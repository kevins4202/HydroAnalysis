17100,anaerobic digestion ad is an essential process in wastewater treatment plants as it can reduce the amount of waste activated sludge was for disposal and also enables the recovery of bioenergy i e methane here a new pretreatment method to enhance anaerobic digestion was achieved by treating thickened was twas with ferric as fecl3 and nitrite simultaneously for 24 hour at room temperature biochemical methane potential tests showed markedly improved degradability in the pretreated twas with a relative increase in hydrolysis rate by 30 a comparative experiment with the operation of two continuous flow anaerobic digesters further demonstrated the improvement in biogas quantity and quality digestate disposal and phosphorus recovery in the experimental digester the dosed fecl3 i e 6 mm decreased the ph of twas to 5 which led to the formation of free nitrous acid fna hno2 at parts per million levels i e 6 mg n l after dosing nitrite at 250 mg no2 n l this fna treatment caused a 26 increase in methane yield and volatile solids destruction 55 reduction in the viscosity of sludge in digester and 24 less polymer required in further digestate dewatering in addition the dosed fe iii was reduced to fe ii which precipitated sulfide and phosphorus leading to decreased hydrogen sulfide concentration in biogas and increased percentage of vivianite in the total crystalline iron species in digested sludge our study experimentally demonstrated that combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite is a useful pretreatment strategy for improving anaerobic digestion of was graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge pretreatment enhanced anaerobic digestion iron dosing low ph free nitrous acid 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a by product generated during secondary biological treatment of municipal wastewater anaerobic digestion is widely used in large scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps to reduce the amount of was for disposal the process converts organic matter to bioenergy i e methane ch4 which is a critical element for the next generation energy neutral wastewater treatment however the anaerobic digestion technology has limitations including i the rate of hydrolyzing organic matter is relatively low batstone et al 2009 and a long hydraulic retention time hrt e g 15 20 days is required carrère et al 2010 ge et al 2011 ii the biogas produced needs to be purified before use as a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide h2s impacts power generators or boilers appels et al 2008 and iii poor sludge dewaterability necessitates increased consumption of polyelectrolyte or ferric iron up to three times more than that required for was bruus et al 1993 hence there is an urgent need to improve anaerobic digester performance many strategies using mechanical chemical and heat based sludge pretreatment have been proposed over the past decade carrère et al 2010 with enhanced solubilization of organically bound solids these approaches generally increase volatile solids vs destruction and biogas production however most of them are costly due to high energy and or chemical requirements foladori et al 2010 and few have been successfully applied at full scale to date ariunbaatar et al 2014 recently free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 at parts per million ppm mg n l levels was found to be strongly biocidal to anaerobes and aerobes jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2014 laloo et al 2018 duan et al 2019 zuo et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 and when used as a pretreatment fna improved sludge biodegradability pijuan et al 2012 wang et al 2013 carried out biochemical methane potential bmp tests and demonstrated a relative increase of 17 35 in methane yield with continuous operation of anaerobic digesters fna pretreatment achieved additional benefits including improved dewaterability wei et al 2018 and increased digestion capacity i e shorter hrt zhang et al 2019 and improved rheological properties of digested sludge at pilot scale meng et al 2020 to generate fna two chemicals i e nitrite and acid are needed according to the chemical equilibrium equation hno2 no2 h pka 3 15 nitrite can be easily produced on site via biological nitritation of ammonium rich streams e g anaerobic digester centrate or source separated urine wastewater law et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 however in order to acidify the sludge to ph 5 a concentration of hydrochloric acid hcl as high as 1 2 mol per kg vs is needed based on our pilot scale evaluation ferric chloride fecl3 is a commonly used chemical in urban water management fecl3 dosing into a sewer pipeline can control h2s formation ge et al 2013 and its dosing into primary settlers of wwtps can enhance the removal of particulate organic matter and phosphorus known as chemically enhanced primary treatment cept chagnon and harleman 2002 wang et al 2009 the fe dosed upstream in sewers has positive effects on the downstream anaerobic digestion such as decreased h2s content in biogas and enhanced dewaterability of digestate kooijman et al 2017 rebosura jr et al 2018 in anaerobic digesters dosed fe iii can be reduced to fe ii which then precipitates phosphate to form vivianite i e fe3 po4 2 8h2o wilfert et al 2018 prot et al 2020 a valuable product recently considered for phosphorus recovery wu et al 2019 salehin et al 2020 in fact fecl3 solution is a strong lewis acid e g ph 1 5 at 38 wt due to fe iii hydrolysis reactions stefánsson 2007 the acidity has been often ignored in wastewater treatment systems because sewage and sludge have strong buffering capacity in this study we hypothesized that fecl3 dosing into sludge can establish the acidic environment required for implementation of fna based pretreatment thereby achieving increased methane production and vs destruction and improved sludge properties i e viscosity and dewaterability in comparison with hcl fecl3 dosing offers increased benefits to anaerobic digestion such as h2s control and vivianite formation therefore this study aimed to demonstrate that sludge pretreatment with combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite enhances anaerobic digestion an optimal fecl3 dosage for thickened sludge acidification was determined then bmp tests were conducted to evaluate change in sludge degradability after pretreatment using solely fecl3 solely nitrite or a combination bmp tests were also carried out to examine the effect of various fecl3 dosages on increasing sludge degradability finally a comprehensive assessment was performed during continuous operation of a control and an experimental anaerobic digester these results support the development of a useful pretreatment strategy for improving anaerobic digestion yielding multiple benefits 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge source thickened was twas and digested sludge were collected from the luggage point wwtp located in brisbane australia the wwtp has capacity to treat 120 000 m3 municipal wastewater per day and a dissolved air flotation daf process to concentrate the secondary biological sludge to a total solids ts concentration of about 40 g l kulandaivelu et al 2020 the twas was held at 4 c in the laboratory and used the same week as it was collected the digested sludge was collected from a full scale digester in the same wwtp and served as inoculum for all bmp tests and laboratory scale anaerobic digesters table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of twas and digested sludge used in this work 2 2 twas acidification using fecl3 titration tests were conducted in 250 ml glass beakers containing 200 ml twas the twas was mixed using magnetic stirrers at 500 rpm a nitrite stock solution as nano2 of 50 g n l was added into the beakers resulting in a nitrite level of 250 mg n l a fecl3 stock solution 10 g fe l was used to titrate the sludge to ph 4 the ph was recorded by using a portable ph meter ph 5 oakton 2 3 twas pretreatment bmp tests and data analyses batch tests were conducted for pretreating twas which consisted of a control c i e pretreatment without the addition of nitrite and fecl3 and three experimental groups with pretreatment using nitrite n fecl3 f and fecl3 plus nitrite f n initially 0 8 l of twas was evenly distributed into the four batch reactors with magnetic stirring at 500 rpm 1 ml nitrite stock solution was added into batch reactors of n and f n to attain 250 mg no2 n l in 24 h the ph of batch reactors in f and f n was controlled at 5 0 0 1 using 0 18 m fecl3 solution via a programmable logic controller plc c served as the control and the ph was not adjusted measuring around 6 2 within 24 h mixing in the presence of nitrite at ph 5 f n achieved an fna concentration of 5 94 mg n l 22 c according to the equation fna as mg n l no2 n e 2300 temperature c 273 10ph anthonisen et al 1976 the pretreatment conditions for f n i e 250 mg no2 n l ph 5 and 24 h were established in previous studies zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 in addition to the above another four groups of batch tests were performed at the same time these tests had various fecl3 dosages at 3 5 6 and 9 mm while the dosed nitrite stock solution was 250 mg no2 n l the initial ph in the four tests was 5 6 5 1 4 9 and 4 2 respectively giving fna levels of 1 52 4 74 7 43 and 33 26 mg n l 22 c it is to be noted that ph was not controlled and found to increase by 0 5 0 7 within 24 h after pretreatment of twas samples bmp tests were carried out according to the standard procedure angelidaki et al 2007 holliger et al 2016 in brief the bmp tests were executed in 160 ml serum bottles the ph of the pretreated twas was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 using 1 m naoh to avoid acid inhibition of methanogens the ratio of vs in inoculated digested sludge to that in pretreated twas was controlled over the range of 2 0 2 6 tests were carried out in triplicate and the bottles were flushed with nitrogen gas and sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum crimp cap a control test n 3 was also carried out using the solely digested sludge serving as a baseline of bmp tests after that all serum bottles n 27 in total were transferred to a temperature controlled incubator at 37 1 c bmp tests lasted for 20 days until almost no further increase of biogas was detected biogas production was monitored every 1 4 days the biogas pressure was measured using a manometer prior to each sampling event cumulative volumetric gas production was determined from the pressure increase in the headspace volume expressed under standard conditions 25 c 1 atm net biogas production from pretreated twas was determined by subtracting the average level obtained in the triplicate control tests specific methane production l ch4 kg vs added was calculated as the volume l of methane produced per kilogram of added vs of the pretreated twas data was analyzed by calculating two key kinetic parameters associated with methane production i e hydrolysis rate k 1 d and biochemical methane potential b 0 l ch4 kg vs added the parameter values were estimated using a substrate model b t b 0 1 e kt where b t is the cumulative methane production at time t l ch4 kg vs added and t is the digestion time d the model fitting was performed using the aquasim software reichert 1998 the 95 confidence regions between k and b 0 were calculated using a gradient search technique described by batstone et al 2009 2 4 operation and monitoring of continuous flow anaerobic digesters two identical anaerobic digesters 0 5 l liquid volume and 0 8 l headspace were manufactured as detailed previously zhang et al 2019 one served as a control digester r1 with the other as an experimental digester r2 temperature of the two digesters was maintained constant at 37 2 c using a water jacket and continuous mixing by magnetic stirrers at 350 rpm daily feeding of 42 ml original twas or pretreated twas as well as wasting of the same amount of digested sludge occurred with the assistance of peristaltic pumps this gave an operating hrt of 11 9 days and organic loading rate of 2 7 kg vs m3 d in the gas line a water trap was connected prior to the gas meter in order to prevent negative pressure during the feeding and wasting processes biogas was collected in a gas bag and biogas production rate was recorded using a tipping bucket gas meter installed at end of the gas line of each digester the gas counters were recalibrated every two months and performance continuously checked to verify reliability the two laboratory anaerobic digesters were continuously operated for 200 days divided into two periods the first period 0 105 days acted as a baseline phase during which both digesters were fed with the collected twas and operated at the same conditions till reaching identical performance including methane production rate vs destruction ratio and ammonium and phosphorus concentrations in supernatant in the second period 106 200 days the feed of the experimental digester was changed to pretreated twas which was produced in an additional unit 0 3 l with combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite into the collected twas every day the 24 h pretreatment was performed using the same approach as that for f n of the bmp tests a protocol to regularly evaluate digestion performance included the measurement of biogas composition ch4 co2 and n2 biogas production rate influent and

measurement of fe ii and fe iii in solids sludge samples were pretreated in 0 5 m hcl overnight and then chemical analyses were performed according to the ferrozine assay viollier et al 2000 h2s

vsconc in 100 where vsconc in and vsconc out are the vs concentrations in the influent and effluent of digester respectively switzenbaum et al 2003 2 5 2 viscosity and dewaterability tests viscosity of a 50 ml sludge sample was tested using a rheometer anton paar physica mcr101 modular compact rheometer australia equipped with a cup and a four blade vane temperature was maintained at 25 c and a constant shear rate of 250 l s was used sludge dewaterability was evaluated using the method previously described wei et al 2018 rebosura jr et al 2018 meng et al 2020 in short 25 ml of sludge sample was centrifuged at 3750 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was removed then 5 mg l polymeric aluminium chloride pac was added to the thickened sludge to enhance coagulation followed by the above centrifugation for 10 min the ts content in the dewatered sludge cake was then measured 2 5 3 x ray diffraction xrd analysis the digested sludge was immediately stored at 18 c followed by freeze drying under vacuum conditions 50 c 0 1 mbar the freeze dried samples were then ground under anaerobic conditions x ray diffractograms were generated using bruker d8 advance mkii with a cu anode as the primary x ray beam source at 40 kv and 40 ma with a step width of 0 02 and 1 2 s step of collecting time and 5 80 as the scanning range the composition identifications were carried out using diffrac eva v 4 software and matched with the icdd pdf 4 2019 database semi quantitative xrd analyses were conducted to quantify the amount of vivianite in the samples using topas v 4 2 software corundum a al2o3 was used as an internal standard for all semi quantitative measurements salehin et al 2020 2 6 statistical analysis in the experimental period data for the experimental digester was subtracted from the data for the control digester to yield a residual time series consisting of differences at all the sampling times if the mean difference of the residual time series was significantly different from zero through hypothesis testing t test the time series data of the two digesters was regarded to be significantly different asterisks and represent significant differences

sequence identity using the markov cluster algorithm 3 results 3 1 sludge acidification by dosing fecl3 the ph of twas decreased almost linearly with increased fecl3 dosage fig 1 in the absence of nitrite the ph decreased to 5 at a dosage of 5 mm fecl3 and further to 4 at 10 mm fecl3 indicating the effectiveness of fe iii hydrolysis for acidifying twas with the initial addition of nitrite at 250 mg no2 n l a similar trend in decreasing ph was achieved the ph drop was slightly slower than that without nitrite dosing particularly when ph was below 5 5 this is likely due to in situ formation of ppm level fna i e 1 91 mg n l at ph 5 5 in the presence of 250 mg no2 n l as fna above one ppm can rapidly destroy sludge floc structure and release ph resistance substances to liquor duan et al 2020 these results showed that about 6 7 mm fecl3 equal to 0 15 0 18 mol kg dry ts was required to acidify twas for fna based pretreatment 3 2 sludge degradability enhanced by combined dosing of fecl3and nitrite bmp tests were carried out to examine the change in sludge degradability with pretreatment in the first set four types of sludge samples were prepared i e 1 twas sample without treatment c and twas samples pretreated with 2 nitrite n 3 fecl3 f and 4 fecl3 plus nitrite f n over the whole bmp test period cumulative methane production increased with the increase in digestion time and reached relatively stable levels after 15 days fig 2 a initially the pretreated twas in f n had the lowest methane production probably due to the direct inhibition of amorphous fe oh 3 on methanogenesis van bodegom et al 2004 after 3 days of digestion faster methane production was observed suggesting fe iii had been reduced to fe ii which is no longer inhibitory to methanogenesis in comparison with c f and n the group f n produced more methane indicating enhanced sludge degradability the methane production curves were fitted using the one substrate model and the kinetic parameters k and b 0 were determined narrow confidence regions between k and b 0 indicated that the model outputs well agreed with the data measured in the bmp tests fig 2b the k and b 0 values for the original twas were estimated to be 0 27 0 02 d 1 and 209 4 l ch4 g vs added respectively both of which are close to the values in group f this result is also consistent to a low increase in scod i e 0 03 mg cod mg vs in the treated twas suggesting the sole fecl3 pretreatment was ineffective in improving sludge degradability in group n b 0 decreased to 192 3 l ch4 g vs added yet k increased to 0 32 0 02 d 1 the increase in scod was 0 1 mg cod mg vs that is higher than that in group c this indicates that the pretreatment using sole nitrite can promote sludge solubilization consistent to the increased k value the reason can be due to that the fna concentration of 0 38 mg n l 250 mg no2 n l ph 6 2 and 22 c was achieved in group n as similar sludge solubilization was reported in wang et al 2013 s experiment at an fna level of 0 36 mg n l 50 mg no2 n l ph 5 5 and 25 c yet the decreased b 0 value is different from that i e b 0 increase from 201 5 to 218 6 l ch4 g vs added in the previous study wang et al 2013 despite the similar fna level a much higher nitrite level was used in this study as a result more solubilized organic matters can be consumed by denitrification on nitrite leading to the decreased b 0 value in group f n the k and b 0 increased to 0 35 0 01 d 1 and 220 2 l ch4 g vs added respectively with the released scod of 0 22 mg cod mg vs fig 2b this indicates pretreatment with fecl3 plus nitrite improved both k and b 0 3 3 effect of fecl3 dosage on sludge degradability fecl3 dosages ranging from 3 to 9 mm were also tested for twas pretreatment leading to ph ranging from 5 6 to 4 2 with the nitrite spiked to 250 mg n l as previously fna levels from 1 52 to 33 26 mg n l were achieved results from bmp tests showed that dosages of 3 9 mm fecl3 were effective in increasing the methane yield fig 3 a through kinetic model estimations the b 0 increased with the fecl3 dosage increase whereas k had a maximum level of 0 44 0 03 d 1 at 3 mm fecl3 fna 1 52 mg n l fig 3b these results are similar to previously reported where b 0 continued to increase with the fna increase wang et al 2013 the previous estimation showed that the maximum level of k was obtained when fna was 1 78 mg n l which is also consistent to this work these results demonstrate that fecl3 can play a critical role in acidifying sludge to enhance the effect of fna however sludge pretreatment achieving the highest k value may not be optimal in application recent studies have shown that an fna at 6 7 mg n l is more effective in increasing digestion capacity and sludge rheological properties of an anaerobic digester zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 therefore an fecl3 dosage 6 mm to obtain fna at 6 mg n l was selected for the continuous anaerobic digestion experiment 3 4 performance of continuous anaerobic digestors in the baseline period i e day 0 105 the two laboratory anaerobic digesters demonstrated similar methane production vs destruction and ammonium and phosphate release fig 4 following the pretreated twas dosed with fecl3 and nitrite was fed to the experimental digester r2 it was observed that methane production vs destruction ratio ammonium and phosphate concentrations in supernatant changed immediately figs 4a d during continuous operation we compared and statistically analyzed the differences between performance of r1 control and r2 including methane production and vs destruction vfa ammonium phosphate dissolved sulfide and sulfate in supernatant h2s content in biogas dewaterability and viscosity properties of digested sludge figs 5 and 6 in the control digester r1 the average methane yield and vs destruction ratio were 127 11 ml ch4 g vs added and 31 6 respectively those values are comparable with the results obtained from the control digesters i e 110 150 ml ch4 g vs added and 24 29 in our previous studies using twas collected from the same wwtp wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 the average methane yield in r2 was 160 14 ml ch4 per g vs added in the experimental period which is 26 5 higher than that in r1 fig 5a consistently the average vs destruction ratio of 39 4 in r2 is 26 2 higher than that in r1 fig 5b the ammonium in the supernatant increased from 1131 36 mg n l in r1 to 1346 54 mg n l in r2 fig 5c overall these results align with the enhanced sludge degradability demonstrated by bmp tests in contrast the phosphate in the supernatant decreased from 352 38 mg p l in r1 to 220 58 mg p l in r2 37 5 reduction fig 5d and the h2s in the biogas also decreased from 225 106 ppmv to 137 85 ppmv 39 1 reduction fig 5e the decrease in the h2s was due to the decreased sulfide in the supernatant from 3 0 1 0 mg s l in r1 to 1 5 0 5 mg s l in r2 fig 5f additionally there was no significant difference in ph and vfa in the r1 and r2 supernatants p 0 05 fig 5g and h differences in the apparent viscosity of twas pretreated twas and r1 and r2 digestate are depicted in fig 6a the viscosity in the raw twas was as high as 629 86 m pa s it decreased to 260 3 m pa s in the pretreated twas and 373 3 m pa s in the r1 digestate and further decreased to 166 2 m pa s in the r2 digestate the results show significant improvement in sludge rheological properties in the experimental digester with fna pretreatment meng et al 2020 the dewaterability was assessed using centrifugation the solid contents of dewatered r1 and r2 digestate cakes were 17 3 1 0 and 16 5 0 8 respectively the difference was found to be insignificant p 0 05 though both were significantly lower than that 20 4 1 5 of the dewatered twas cake fig 6b consistent with the observation that anaerobic digestion negatively impacts sludge dewaterability bruus et al 1993 notwithstanding the experimental digestate consumed 23 6 less pac as polymer than control digestate with similar solid content in the dewatered cakes fig 6c 3 5 fate of the dosed fecl3 the twas used in this study contained a total fe concentration of 620 156 mg fe l because 10 mg fe l was dosed in the upstream sewer pipeline of the local wwtp kulandaivelu et al 2020 the r1 digestate had a similar level of fe with an average of 633 144 mg fe l the total fe concentrations in the pretreated twas and r2 digestate were 974 148 and 996 203 mg fe l respectively fig 7 a the total fe in the feed and effluent of r1 and r2 were similar indicating a closed mass balance in the operation of the two laboratory digesters the difference in the measured total fe between the pretreated twas and r2 digestate showed that the dosed fecl3 was 6 4 mm on average which is similar to the previous assessment using titration tests fig 1 furthermore fe ii was the main species in the twas accounting for 74 of the total fe fig 7b after 24 h pretreatment almost all of the fe ii was converted to fe iii fig 7c which was likely due to oxygen contamination from the mixing nevertheless fe iii was reduced to fe ii again in the experimental digester for example fe ii accounted for 91 of the total fe in the r2 digestate fig 7b dissolved fe concentrations were generally low i e 40 mg fe l in the sludge samples fig 7d the xrd analysis identified four crystalline iron species in the digested sludge including a phosphate mineral vivianite and two sulfur minerals szomolnokite and troilite fig 8 a interestingly the percentage of vivianite in the total crystalline iron species increased to 25 37 in the r2 digestate from 16 21 in the r1 digestate fig 8b this suggests the dosed fecl3 promoted the formation of vivianite 3 6 impact of sludge pretreatment on microbial communities the microbial communities in the digested sludges were analyzed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the sequencing tests captured 99 of the species indicated by the good s coverage estimator fig 9 shows the relative abundances of top 20 genera in the r1 and r2 digestate the sequencing results revealed that various microbes associated with hydrolytic acidification and methanogenesis were detected in the two digesters during stable operation of the experimental phase lentimicrobium anaerolineaceae cloacimonadaceae methanoculleus and methanosaeta accounted for more than 30 of the total microbes lentimicrobium which is able to use complex organic materials and produce acetate hydrogen and butyrate jin et al 2020 was abundant in r2 with the proportion of 8 5 0 7 anaerolineaceae also plays an important role in hydrocarbon degradation and provided organic acid such as acetate to methanogens liang et al 2015 which had a high relative abundance of 10 6 0 7 in r2 compared to 9 9 0 8 in r1 the enhanced sludge degradability from pretreatment with fecl3 plus nitrite enriched the genera of lentimicrobium and anaerolineaceae consequently the total proportion of methanogens slightly increased to 17 5 0 8 in r2 from 16 3 0 4 in r1 among the methanogens hydrogenotrophic methanoculleus and acetoclastic methanosaeta sundberg et al 2013 were dominant in the biomass with the proportion of 6 9 0 3 and 4 8 0 3 in r1 and 7 1 1 1 and 5 5 0 5 in r2 respectively methylotrophic methanomethylophilaceae and candidatus methanofastidiosum nobu et al 2016 were also detected methanomethylophilaceae was only enriched in r2 with an abundance of 2 1 0 1 in contrast the abundance of ca methanofastidiosum decreased in r2 2 0 0 3 versus 3 5 0 4 in r1 the increase in proportion of hydrolytic acidification bacteria and shift in methanogenic microbial communities with sludge pretreatment should be closely related to the improved methane production in r2 4 discussion 4 1 acidity of fecl3 facilitates fna based applications historically fna has been an unwanted substance in wastewater systems due to its inhibitory effect on a wide range of microorganisms however an advanced understanding of the biocidal effects of fna on microorganisms has recently enabled the development of a series of fna based applications that improve wastewater management practices see a recent review duan et al 2020 for biosolids management the pretreatment of twas with fna can markedly improve sludge degradability pijuan et al 2012 zahedi et al 2016 thereby increasing methane production and vs reduction wei et al 2018 as well as the capacity of continuous flow digesters zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 fna is the protonated form of nitrite and a low ph environment is needed to form hno2 at ppm levels this leads to a relatively high acid requirement in fna based applications hcl was used in all previous studies however it does not provide any other benefits apart from lowering ph the current study showed that dosing with 6 7 mm fecl3 strongly acidified the twas decreasing ph to 4 fig 1 following 24 hour mixing with combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite the hydrolysis rate increased by 30 in the pretreated twas fig 2b this result is consistent with previous reports on fna base pretreatment using hcl as an acid source wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 further the improved sludge degradability led to the enhancement of continuous anaerobic digestion performance including 26 increase in the methane yield and vs destruction ratio figs 5a and 5b 55 decrease in the viscosity of the digested sludge fig 6b and 23 6 reduction in polymer consumption in further dewatering the digestate fig 6c these results are also generally comparable to those achieved by fna pretreatment using hcl wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 therefore it can be concluded that fecl3 can be used as an alternative acid to hcl for fna based applications conventionally fecl3 dosing is often applied to promote coagulation flocculation in urban water management this study demonstrates that acidification of sludge is another benefit of fecl3 dosing use of fecl3 based acidification deserves further investigation for fna based applications such as enhanced mainstream nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway as a cleaning reagent in recovering membrane filtration performance and harvesting wastewater grown algae duan et al 2020 4 2 combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite as a pretreatment strategy for improved anaerobic digestion although installed in many wwtps across the world the anaerobic digester has limitations such as a slow rate of hydrolyzing organic matter poor biogas quality and costly digestate disposal batstone et al 2009 carrère et al 2010 foladori et al 2010 ariunbaatar et al 2014 here this study demonstrated that dosing with fecl3 and nitrite into feed sludge simultaneously addressed these issues in the long term assessment with two laboratory continuous flow anaerobic digesters the average chemical consumption was estimated to be 0 16 mol or 26 g fecl3 per kg dry ts the dosed fecl3 decreased h2s content in the biogas fig 5e and stimulated the formation of vivianite in the digested sludge in the experimental digester fig 8 in addition to the aforementioned benefits achieved by addition of fna alone these results suggest that combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite can be a useful pretreatment strategy to improve the performance of anaerobic digesters according to multiple criteria recently several studies have reported that fecl3 dosed upstream is beneficial to downstream anaerobic digestion in a laboratory assessment in sewer fecl3 dosing at 10 mg fe l wastewater caused an increase in total fe concentration from 78 5 to 777 69 mg fe l in the subsequent digester rebosura jr et al 2018 the fe sink in the digestate decreased h2s from 912 190 to 130 6 ppmv in biogas with decreased dissolved sulfide from 23 7 0 5 to 2 7 0 2 mg s l in supernatant in sewer iron dosing was applied in the wwtp kulandaivelu et al 2020 and raised the total fe in the collected twas to 620 mg fe l similar to the control digester in the current study see fig 7a as a result the r1 had a relatively low liquid sulfide 3 0 1 0 mg s l and gas h2s 225 106 ppmv nevertheless the additional fecl3 dosing i e 354 363 mg fe l for the twas pretreatment was beneficial to the anaerobic digestion the experimental reactor r2 demonstrated a significantly lower gas h2s content fig 5e with higher quality biogas in comparison with r1 similarly the added fecl3 further increased the ratio of vivianite in the total crystalline fe species fig 8b the ratio of dosed fe and decreased phosphate was calculated to be 1 64 mol fe per mol po4 3 which is close to the theoretical ratio of 1 5 in the chemical form of vivianite i e fe3 po4 2 8h2o a recent investigation at full scale nieuwveer wwtp also showed that fe dosed into the wastewater biological treatment tank was nearly entirely transformed into vivianite in the digester prot et al 2020 these results indicate upstream fecl3 dosing can boost vivianite recovery from anaerobic digesters the anaerobic digestion process significantly decreased the dewaterability of twas with and without pretreatment fig 6b in previous studies fna pretreatment using hcl was shown favorable to dewatering of digested sludge with dewatered solids content increasing from 12 4 0 4 to 14 1 0 4 wei et al 2018 rebosura jr et al 2018 also reported that in sewer fecl3 dosing caused an increase in dewatered solids content from 15 9 0 1 to 19 4 0 2 possibly due to the crystallization of phosphorus and iron in the digested sludge bergmans et al 2014 however the current study observed no significant difference in the dewatered solids content between the control and experimental digesters i e 17 3 1 0 versus 16 5 0 8 respectively in two very recent reports where hcl plus nitrite pretreatment was used at pilot scale meng et al 2020 and fe was dosed in an upstream wastewater treatment tank at full scale prot et al 2020 no improvement in the dewaterability of digested sludge was found thus further studies are needed to assess whether up stream iron dosing or sludge pretreatment can improve the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge in the present study only one fna concentration i e 250 mg no2 n l and one treatment time i e 1 day were tested thus the technology optimization still requires a further investigation fna can undergo a variety of chemical degradation processes and potentially form volatilized nitrogen oxides such as no and no2 udert et al 2005 the fna degradation rate is strongly related to ph and can become high at ph 4 udert et al 2005 as such the emission of nox should be further evaluated in the pretreatment additionally this study is only a laboratory work demonstrating the technical feasibility of the proposed sludge pretreatment strategy in future studies pilot or full scale demonstrations are still needed to validify the technology under industrially relevant conditions 5 conclusions in this study it was shown that combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite to twas greatly enhanced the subsequent anaerobic digestion process with respect to biogas production and quality sludge reduction sludge viscosity polymer consumption and vivianite recovery specifically it was identified that fna formed from combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite substantially improved twas degradability with increased hydrolysis rate and biochemical methane potential which led to 26 higher methane production and volatile solids destruction during anaerobic digestion 55 lower viscosity in digested sludge and 24 lower polymer demand in final digestate dewatering in addition to providing protons for fna fecl3 decreased h2s content in the biogas by 39 and increased production of vivianite in the digestate from 16 21 to 25 37 in the total crystalline iron species the economic analysis performed indicated that combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite is economically viable overall the results experimentally demonstrate that combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite can be applied as a pre treatment strategy to improve anaerobic digestion yielding multiple benefits declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17100,anaerobic digestion ad is an essential process in wastewater treatment plants as it can reduce the amount of waste activated sludge was for disposal and also enables the recovery of bioenergy i e methane here a new pretreatment method to enhance anaerobic digestion was achieved by treating thickened was twas with ferric as fecl3 and nitrite simultaneously for 24 hour at room temperature biochemical methane potential tests showed markedly improved degradability in the pretreated twas with a relative increase in hydrolysis rate by 30 a comparative experiment with the operation of two continuous flow anaerobic digesters further demonstrated the improvement in biogas quantity and quality digestate disposal and phosphorus recovery in the experimental digester the dosed fecl3 i e 6 mm decreased the ph of twas to 5 which led to the formation of free nitrous acid fna hno2 at parts per million levels i e 6 mg n l after dosing nitrite at 250 mg no2 n l this fna treatment caused a 26 increase in methane yield and volatile solids destruction 55 reduction in the viscosity of sludge in digester and 24 less polymer required in further digestate dewatering in addition the dosed fe iii was reduced to fe ii which precipitated sulfide and phosphorus leading to decreased hydrogen sulfide concentration in biogas and increased percentage of vivianite in the total crystalline iron species

graphical abstract keywords sludge pretreatment enhanced anaerobic digestion iron dosing low ph free nitrous acid 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a by product generated during secondary biological treatment of municipal wastewater anaerobic digestion is widely used in large scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps to reduce the amount of was for disposal the process converts organic matter to bioenergy i e methane ch4 which is a critical element for the next generation energy neutral wastewater treatment however the anaerobic digestion technology has limitations including i the rate of hydrolyzing organic matter is relatively low batstone et al 2009 and a long hydraulic retention time hrt e g 15 20 days is required carrère et al 2010 ge et al 2011 ii the biogas produced needs to be purified before use as a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide h2s impacts power generators or boilers appels et al 2008 and iii poor sludge dewaterability necessitates increased consumption of polyelectrolyte or ferric iron up to three times more than that required for was bruus et al 1993 hence there is an urgent need to improve anaerobic digester performance many strategies using mechanical chemical and heat based sludge pretreatment have been proposed over the past decade carrère et al 2010 with enhanced solubilization of organically bound solids these approaches generally increase volatile solids vs destruction and biogas production however most of them are costly due to high energy and or chemical requirements foladori et al 2010 and few have been successfully applied at full scale to date ariunbaatar et al 2014 recently free nitrous acid fna i e hno2 at parts per million ppm mg n l levels was found to be strongly biocidal to anaerobes and

form vivianite i e fe3 po4 2 8h2o wilfert et al 2018 prot et al 2020 a valuable product recently considered for phosphorus recovery wu et al 2019 salehin et al 2020 in fact fecl3 solution is a strong lewis acid e g ph 1 5 at 38 wt due to fe iii hydrolysis reactions stefánsson 2007 the acidity has been often ignored in wastewater treatment systems because sewage and sludge have strong buffering capacity in this study we hypothesized that fecl3 dosing into sludge can establish the acidic environment required for implementation of fna based pretreatment thereby achieving increased methane production and vs destruction and improved sludge properties i e viscosity and dewaterability in comparison with hcl fecl3 dosing offers increased benefits to anaerobic digestion such as h2s control and vivianite formation therefore this study aimed to demonstrate that sludge pretreatment with combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite enhances anaerobic digestion an optimal fecl3 dosage for thickened sludge acidification was determined then bmp tests were conducted to evaluate change in sludge degradability after pretreatment using solely fecl3 solely nitrite or a combination bmp tests were also carried out to examine the effect of various fecl3 dosages on increasing sludge degradability finally a comprehensive assessment was performed during continuous operation of a control and an experimental anaerobic digester these results support the development of a useful pretreatment strategy for improving anaerobic digestion yielding multiple benefits 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge source thickened was twas and digested sludge were collected from the luggage point wwtp located in brisbane australia the wwtp has capacity to treat 120 000 m3 municipal wastewater per day and a dissolved air flotation daf process to concentrate the secondary biological sludge to a total solids ts concentration of about 40 g l kulandaivelu et al 2020 the twas was held at 4 c in the laboratory and used the same week as it was collected the digested sludge was collected from a full scale digester in the same wwtp and served as inoculum for all bmp tests and laboratory scale anaerobic digesters table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of twas and digested sludge used in this work 2 2 twas acidification using fecl3 titration tests were conducted in 250 ml glass beakers containing 200 ml twas the twas was mixed using magnetic stirrers at 500 rpm a nitrite stock solution as nano2 of 50 g n l was added into the beakers resulting in a nitrite level of 250 mg n l a fecl3 stock solution 10 g fe l was used to titrate the sludge to ph 4 the ph was recorded by using a portable ph meter ph 5 oakton 2 3 twas pretreatment bmp tests and data analyses batch tests were conducted for pretreating twas which consisted of a control c i e pretreatment without the addition of nitrite and fecl3 and three experimental groups with pretreatment using nitrite n fecl3 f and fecl3 plus nitrite f n initially 0 8 l of twas was evenly distributed into the four batch reactors with magnetic stirring at 500 rpm 1 ml nitrite stock solution was added into batch reactors of n and f n to attain 250 mg no2 n l in 24 h the ph of batch reactors in f and f n was controlled at 5 0 0 1 using 0 18 m fecl3 solution via a programmable logic controller plc c served as the control and the ph was not adjusted measuring around 6 2 within 24 h mixing in the presence of nitrite at ph 5 f n achieved an fna concentration of 5 94 mg n l 22 c according to the equation fna as mg n l no2 n e 2300 temperature c 273 10ph anthonisen et al 1976 the pretreatment conditions for f n i e 250 mg no2 n l ph 5 and 24 h were established in previous studies zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 in addition to the above another four groups of batch tests were performed at the same time these tests had various fecl3 dosages at 3 5 6 and 9 mm while the dosed nitrite stock solution was 250 mg no2 n l the initial ph in the four tests was 5 6 5 1 4 9 and 4 2 respectively giving fna levels of 1 52 4 74 7 43 and 33 26 mg n l 22 c it is to be noted that ph was not controlled and found to increase by 0 5 0 7 within 24 h after pretreatment of twas samples bmp tests were carried out according to the standard procedure angelidaki et al 2007 holliger et al 2016 in brief the bmp tests were executed in 160 ml serum bottles the ph of the pretreated twas was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 using 1 m naoh to avoid acid inhibition of methanogens the ratio of vs in inoculated digested sludge to that in pretreated twas was controlled over the range of 2 0 2 6 tests were carried out in triplicate and the bottles were flushed with nitrogen gas and sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum crimp cap a control test n 3 was also carried out using the solely digested sludge serving as a baseline of bmp tests after that all serum bottles n 27 in total were transferred to a temperature controlled incubator at 37 1 c bmp tests lasted for 20 days until almost no further increase of biogas was detected biogas production was monitored every 1 4 days the biogas pressure was measured using a manometer prior to each sampling event cumulative volumetric gas production was determined from the pressure increase in the headspace volume expressed under standard conditions 25 c 1 atm net biogas production from pretreated twas was determined by subtracting the average level obtained in the triplicate control tests specific methane production l ch4 kg vs added was calculated as the volume l of methane produced per kilogram of added vs of the pretreated twas data was analyzed by calculating two key kinetic parameters associated with methane production i e hydrolysis rate k 1 d and biochemical methane potential b 0 l ch4 kg vs added the parameter values were estimated using a substrate model b t b 0 1 e kt where b t is the cumulative methane production at time t l ch4 kg vs added and t is the digestion time d the model fitting was performed using the aquasim software reichert 1998 the 95 confidence regions between k and b 0 were calculated using a gradient search technique described by batstone et al 2009 2 4 operation and monitoring of continuous flow anaerobic digesters two identical anaerobic digesters 0 5 l liquid volume and 0 8 l headspace were manufactured as detailed previously zhang et al 2019 one served as a control digester r1 with the other as an experimental digester r2 temperature of the two digesters was maintained constant at 37 2 c using a water jacket and continuous mixing by magnetic stirrers at 350 rpm daily feeding of 42 ml original twas or pretreated twas as well as wasting of the same amount of digested sludge occurred with the assistance of peristaltic pumps this gave an operating hrt of 11 9 days and organic loading rate of 2 7 kg vs m3 d in the gas line a water trap was connected prior to the gas meter in order to prevent negative pressure during the feeding and wasting processes biogas was collected in a gas bag and biogas production rate was recorded using a tipping bucket gas meter installed at end of the gas line of each digester the gas counters were recalibrated every two months and performance continuously checked to verify reliability the two laboratory anaerobic digesters were continuously operated for 200 days divided into two periods the first period 0 105 days acted as a baseline phase during which both digesters were fed with the collected twas and operated at the same conditions till reaching identical performance including methane production rate vs destruction ratio and ammonium and phosphorus concentrations in supernatant in the second period 106 200 days the feed of the experimental digester was changed to pretreated twas which was produced in an additional unit 0 3 l with combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite into the collected twas every day the 24 h pretreatment was performed using the same approach as that for f n of the bmp tests a protocol to regularly evaluate digestion performance included the measurement of biogas composition ch4 co2 and n2 biogas production rate influent and

of a 50 ml sludge sample was tested using a rheometer anton paar physica mcr101 modular compact rheometer australia equipped with a cup and a four blade vane temperature was maintained at 25 c and a constant shear rate of 250 l s was used sludge dewaterability was evaluated using the method previously described wei et al 2018 rebosura jr et al 2018 meng et al 2020 in short 25 ml of sludge sample was centrifuged at 3750 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was removed then 5 mg l polymeric aluminium chloride pac was added to the thickened sludge to enhance coagulation followed by the above centrifugation for 10 min the ts content in the dewatered sludge cake was then measured 2 5 3 x ray diffraction xrd analysis the digested sludge was immediately stored at 18 c followed by freeze

corundum a al2o3 was used as an internal standard for all semi quantitative measurements salehin et al 2020 2 6 statistical analysis in the experimental period data for the experimental digester was subtracted from the data for the control digester to yield a residual time series consisting of differences at all the sampling times if the mean difference of the residual time series was

sequence identity using the markov cluster algorithm 3 results 3 1 sludge acidification by dosing fecl3 the ph of twas decreased almost linearly with increased fecl3 dosage fig 1 in the absence of nitrite the ph decreased to 5 at a dosage of 5 mm fecl3 and further to 4 at 10 mm fecl3 indicating the effectiveness of fe iii hydrolysis for acidifying twas with the initial addition of nitrite at 250 mg no2 n l a similar trend in decreasing ph was achieved the ph drop was slightly slower than that without nitrite dosing particularly when ph was below 5 5 this is likely due to in situ formation of ppm level fna i e 1 91 mg n l at ph 5 5 in the presence of 250 mg no2 n l as fna above one ppm can rapidly destroy sludge floc structure and release ph resistance substances to liquor duan et al 2020 these results showed that about 6 7 mm fecl3 equal to 0 15 0 18 mol kg dry ts was required to acidify twas for fna based pretreatment 3 2 sludge degradability enhanced by combined dosing of fecl3and nitrite bmp tests were carried out to examine the change in sludge degradability with pretreatment in the first set four types of sludge samples were prepared i e 1 twas sample without treatment c and twas samples pretreated with 2 nitrite n 3 fecl3 f and 4 fecl3 plus nitrite f n over the whole bmp test period cumulative methane production increased with the increase in digestion time and reached relatively stable levels after 15 days fig 2 a initially the pretreated twas in f n had the lowest methane production probably due to the direct inhibition of amorphous fe oh 3 on methanogenesis van bodegom et al 2004 after 3 days of digestion faster methane production was observed suggesting fe iii had been reduced to fe ii which is no longer inhibitory to methanogenesis in comparison with c f and n the group f n produced more methane indicating enhanced sludge degradability the methane production curves were fitted using the one substrate model and the kinetic parameters k and b 0 were determined narrow confidence regions between k and b 0 indicated that the model outputs well agreed with the data measured in the bmp tests fig 2b the k and b 0 values for the original twas were estimated to be 0 27 0 02 d 1 and 209 4 l ch4 g vs added respectively both of which are close to the values in group f this result is also consistent to a low increase in scod i e 0 03 mg cod mg vs in the treated twas suggesting the sole fecl3 pretreatment was ineffective in improving sludge degradability in group n b 0 decreased to 192 3 l ch4 g vs added yet k increased to 0 32 0 02 d 1 the increase in scod was 0 1 mg cod mg vs that is higher than that in group c this indicates that the pretreatment using sole nitrite can promote sludge solubilization consistent to the increased k value the reason can be due to that the fna concentration of 0 38 mg n l 250 mg no2 n l ph 6 2 and 22 c was achieved in group n as similar sludge solubilization was reported in wang et al 2013 s experiment at an fna level of 0 36 mg n l 50 mg no2 n l ph 5 5 and 25 c yet the decreased b 0 value is different from that i e b 0 increase from 201 5 to 218 6 l ch4 g vs added in the previous study wang et al 2013 despite the similar fna level a much higher nitrite level was used in this study as a result more solubilized organic matters can be consumed by denitrification on nitrite leading to the decreased b 0 value in group f n the k and b 0 increased to 0 35 0 01 d 1 and 220 2 l ch4 g vs added respectively with the released scod of 0 22 mg cod mg vs fig 2b this indicates pretreatment with fecl3 plus nitrite improved both k and b 0 3 3 effect of fecl3 dosage on sludge degradability fecl3 dosages ranging from 3 to 9 mm were also tested for twas pretreatment leading to ph ranging from 5 6 to 4 2 with the nitrite spiked to 250 mg n l as previously fna levels from 1 52 to 33 26 mg n l were achieved results from bmp tests showed that dosages of 3 9 mm fecl3 were effective in increasing the methane yield fig 3 a through kinetic model estimations the b 0 increased with the fecl3 dosage increase whereas k had a maximum level of 0 44 0 03 d 1 at 3 mm fecl3 fna 1 52 mg n l fig 3b these results are similar to previously reported where b 0 continued to increase with the fna increase wang et al 2013 the previous estimation showed that the maximum level of k was obtained when fna was 1 78 mg n l which is also consistent to this work these results demonstrate that fecl3 can play a critical role in acidifying sludge to enhance the effect of fna however sludge pretreatment achieving the highest k value may not be optimal in application recent studies have shown that an fna at 6 7 mg n l is more effective in increasing digestion capacity and sludge rheological properties of an anaerobic digester zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 therefore an fecl3 dosage 6 mm to obtain fna at 6 mg n l was selected for the continuous anaerobic digestion experiment 3 4 performance of continuous anaerobic digestors in the baseline period i e day 0 105 the two laboratory anaerobic digesters demonstrated similar methane production vs destruction and ammonium and phosphate release fig 4 following the pretreated twas dosed with fecl3 and nitrite was fed to the experimental digester r2 it was observed that methane production vs destruction ratio ammonium and phosphate concentrations in supernatant changed immediately figs 4a d during continuous operation we compared and statistically analyzed the differences between performance of r1 control and r2 including methane production and vs destruction vfa ammonium phosphate dissolved sulfide and sulfate in supernatant h2s content in biogas dewaterability and viscosity properties of digested sludge figs 5 and 6 in the control digester r1 the average methane yield and vs destruction ratio were 127 11 ml ch4 g vs added and 31 6 respectively those values are comparable with the results obtained from the control digesters i e 110 150 ml ch4 g vs added and 24 29 in our previous studies using twas collected from the same wwtp wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 the average methane yield in r2 was 160 14 ml ch4 per g vs added in the experimental period which is 26 5 higher than that in r1 fig 5a consistently the average vs destruction ratio of 39 4 in r2 is 26 2 higher than that in r1 fig 5b the ammonium in the supernatant increased from 1131 36 mg n l in r1 to 1346 54 mg n l in r2 fig 5c overall these results align with the enhanced sludge degradability demonstrated by bmp tests in contrast the phosphate in the supernatant decreased from 352 38 mg p l in r1 to 220 58 mg p l in r2 37 5 reduction fig 5d and the h2s in the biogas also decreased from 225 106 ppmv to 137 85 ppmv 39 1 reduction fig 5e the decrease in the h2s was due to the decreased sulfide in the supernatant from 3 0 1 0 mg s l in r1 to 1 5 0 5 mg s l in r2 fig 5f additionally there was no significant difference in ph and vfa in the r1 and r2 supernatants p 0 05 fig 5g and h differences in the apparent viscosity of twas pretreated twas and r1 and r2 digestate are depicted in fig 6a the viscosity in the raw twas was as high as 629 86 m pa s it decreased to 260 3 m pa s in the pretreated twas and 373 3 m pa s in the r1 digestate and further decreased to 166 2 m pa s in the r2 digestate the results show significant improvement in sludge rheological properties in the experimental digester with fna pretreatment meng et al 2020 the dewaterability was assessed using centrifugation the solid contents of dewatered r1 and r2 digestate cakes were 17 3 1 0 and 16 5 0 8 respectively the difference was found to be insignificant p 0 05 though both were significantly lower than that 20 4 1 5 of the dewatered twas cake fig 6b consistent with the observation that anaerobic digestion negatively impacts sludge dewaterability bruus et al 1993 notwithstanding the experimental digestate consumed 23 6 less pac as polymer than control digestate with similar solid content in the dewatered cakes fig 6c 3 5 fate of the dosed fecl3 the twas used in this study contained a total fe concentration of 620 156 mg fe l because 10 mg fe l was dosed in the upstream sewer pipeline of the local wwtp kulandaivelu et al 2020 the r1 digestate had a similar level of fe with an average of 633 144 mg fe l the total fe concentrations in the pretreated twas and r2 digestate were 974 148 and 996 203 mg fe l respectively fig 7 a the total fe in the feed and effluent of r1 and r2 were similar indicating a closed mass balance in the operation of the two laboratory digesters the difference in the measured total fe between the pretreated twas and r2 digestate showed that the dosed fecl3 was 6 4 mm on average which is similar to the previous assessment using titration tests fig 1 furthermore fe ii was the main species in the twas accounting for 74 of the total fe fig 7b after 24 h pretreatment almost all of the fe ii was converted to fe iii fig 7c which was likely due to oxygen contamination from the mixing nevertheless fe iii was reduced to fe ii again in the experimental digester for example fe ii accounted for 91 of the total fe in the r2 digestate fig 7b dissolved fe concentrations were generally low i e 40 mg fe l in the sludge samples fig 7d the xrd analysis identified four crystalline iron species in the digested sludge including a phosphate mineral vivianite and two sulfur minerals szomolnokite and troilite fig 8 a interestingly the percentage of vivianite in the total crystalline iron species increased to 25 37 in the r2 digestate from 16 21 in the r1 digestate fig 8b this suggests the dosed fecl3 promoted the formation of vivianite 3 6 impact of sludge pretreatment on microbial communities the microbial communities in the digested sludges were analyzed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the sequencing tests captured 99 of the species indicated by the good s coverage estimator fig 9 shows the relative abundances of top 20 genera in the r1 and r2 digestate the sequencing results revealed that various microbes associated with hydrolytic acidification and methanogenesis were detected in the two digesters during stable operation of the experimental phase lentimicrobium anaerolineaceae cloacimonadaceae methanoculleus and methanosaeta accounted for more than 30 of the total microbes lentimicrobium which is able to use complex organic materials and produce acetate hydrogen and butyrate jin et al 2020 was abundant in r2 with the proportion of 8 5 0 7 anaerolineaceae also plays an important role in hydrocarbon degradation and provided organic acid such as acetate to methanogens liang et al 2015 which had a high relative abundance of 10 6 0 7 in r2 compared to 9 9 0 8 in r1 the enhanced sludge degradability from pretreatment with fecl3 plus nitrite enriched the genera of lentimicrobium and anaerolineaceae consequently the total proportion of methanogens slightly increased to 17 5 0 8 in r2 from 16 3 0 4 in r1 among the methanogens hydrogenotrophic methanoculleus and acetoclastic methanosaeta sundberg et al 2013 were dominant in the biomass with the proportion of 6 9 0 3 and 4 8 0 3 in r1 and 7 1 1 1 and 5 5 0 5 in r2 respectively methylotrophic methanomethylophilaceae and candidatus methanofastidiosum nobu et al 2016 were also detected methanomethylophilaceae was only enriched in r2 with an abundance of 2 1 0 1 in contrast the abundance of ca methanofastidiosum decreased in r2 2 0 0 3 versus 3 5 0 4 in r1 the increase in proportion of hydrolytic acidification bacteria and shift in methanogenic microbial communities with sludge pretreatment should be closely related to the improved methane production in r2 4 discussion 4 1 acidity of fecl3 facilitates fna based applications historically fna has been an unwanted substance in wastewater systems due to its inhibitory effect on a wide range of microorganisms however an advanced understanding of the biocidal effects of fna on microorganisms has recently enabled the development of a series of fna based applications that improve wastewater management practices see a recent review duan et al 2020 for biosolids management the pretreatment of twas with fna can markedly improve sludge degradability pijuan et al 2012 zahedi et al 2016 thereby increasing methane production and vs reduction wei et al 2018 as well as the capacity of continuous flow digesters zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 fna is the protonated form of nitrite and a low ph environment is needed to form hno2 at ppm levels this leads to a relatively high acid requirement in fna based applications hcl was used in all previous studies however it does not provide any other benefits apart from lowering ph the current study showed that dosing with 6 7 mm fecl3 strongly acidified the twas decreasing ph to 4 fig 1 following 24 hour mixing with combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite the hydrolysis rate increased by 30 in the pretreated twas fig 2b this result is consistent with previous reports on fna base pretreatment using hcl as an acid source wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 further the improved sludge degradability led to the enhancement of continuous anaerobic digestion performance including 26 increase in the methane yield and vs destruction ratio figs 5a and 5b 55 decrease in the viscosity of the digested sludge fig 6b and 23 6 reduction in polymer consumption in further dewatering the digestate fig 6c these results are also generally comparable to those achieved by fna pretreatment using hcl wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 meng et al 2020 therefore it can be concluded that fecl3 can be used as an alternative acid to hcl for fna based applications conventionally fecl3 dosing is often applied to promote coagulation flocculation in urban water management this study demonstrates that acidification of sludge is another benefit of fecl3 dosing use of fecl3 based acidification deserves further investigation for fna based applications such as enhanced mainstream nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway as a cleaning reagent in recovering membrane filtration performance and harvesting wastewater grown algae duan et al 2020 4 2 combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite as a pretreatment strategy for improved anaerobic digestion although installed in many wwtps across the world the anaerobic digester has limitations such as a slow rate of hydrolyzing organic matter poor biogas quality and costly digestate disposal batstone et al 2009 carrère et al 2010 foladori et al 2010 ariunbaatar et al 2014 here this study demonstrated that dosing with fecl3 and nitrite into feed sludge simultaneously addressed these issues in the long term assessment with two laboratory continuous flow anaerobic digesters the average chemical consumption was estimated to be 0 16 mol or 26 g fecl3 per kg dry ts the dosed fecl3 decreased h2s content in the biogas fig 5e and stimulated the formation of vivianite in the digested sludge in the experimental digester fig 8 in addition to the aforementioned benefits achieved by addition of fna alone these results suggest that combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite can be a useful pretreatment strategy to improve the performance of anaerobic digesters according to multiple criteria recently several studies have reported that fecl3 dosed upstream is beneficial to downstream anaerobic digestion in a laboratory assessment in sewer fecl3 dosing at 10 mg fe l wastewater caused an increase in total fe concentration from 78 5 to 777 69 mg fe l in the subsequent digester rebosura jr et al 2018 the fe sink in the digestate decreased h2s from 912 190 to 130 6 ppmv in biogas with decreased dissolved sulfide from 23 7 0 5 to 2 7 0 2 mg s l in supernatant in sewer iron dosing was applied in the wwtp kulandaivelu et al 2020 and raised the total fe in the collected twas to 620 mg fe l similar to the control digester in the current study see fig 7a as a result the r1 had a relatively low liquid sulfide 3 0 1 0 mg s l and gas h2s 225 106 ppmv nevertheless the additional fecl3 dosing i e 354 363 mg fe l for the twas pretreatment was beneficial to the anaerobic digestion the experimental reactor r2 demonstrated a significantly lower gas h2s content fig 5e with higher quality biogas in comparison with r1 similarly the added fecl3 further increased the ratio of vivianite in the total crystalline fe species fig 8b the ratio of dosed fe and decreased phosphate was calculated to be 1 64 mol fe per mol po4 3 which is close to the theoretical ratio of 1 5 in the chemical form of vivianite i e fe3 po4 2 8h2o a recent investigation at full scale nieuwveer wwtp also showed that fe dosed into the wastewater biological treatment tank was nearly entirely transformed into vivianite in the digester prot et al 2020 these results indicate upstream fecl3 dosing can boost vivianite recovery from anaerobic digesters the anaerobic digestion process significantly decreased the dewaterability of twas with and without pretreatment fig 6b in previous studies fna pretreatment using hcl was shown favorable to dewatering of digested sludge with dewatered solids content increasing from 12 4 0 4 to 14 1 0 4 wei et al 2018 rebosura jr et al 2018 also reported that in sewer fecl3 dosing caused an increase in dewatered solids content from 15 9 0 1 to 19 4 0 2 possibly due to the crystallization of phosphorus and iron in the digested sludge bergmans et al 2014 however the current study observed no significant difference in the dewatered solids content between the control and experimental digesters i e 17 3 1 0 versus 16 5 0 8 respectively in two very recent reports where hcl plus nitrite pretreatment was used at pilot scale meng et al 2020 and fe was dosed in an upstream wastewater treatment tank at full scale prot et al 2020 no improvement in the dewaterability of digested sludge was found thus further studies are needed to assess whether up stream iron dosing or sludge pretreatment can improve the dewaterability of anaerobically digested sludge in the present study only one fna concentration i e 250 mg no2 n l and one treatment time i e 1 day were tested thus the technology optimization still requires a further investigation fna can undergo a variety of chemical degradation processes and potentially form volatilized nitrogen oxides such as no and no2 udert et al 2005 the fna degradation rate is strongly related to ph and can become high at ph 4 udert et al 2005 as such the emission of nox should be further evaluated in the pretreatment additionally this study is only a laboratory work demonstrating the technical feasibility of the proposed sludge pretreatment strategy in future studies pilot or full scale demonstrations are still needed to validify the technology under industrially relevant conditions 5 conclusions in this study it was shown that combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite to twas greatly enhanced the subsequent anaerobic digestion process with respect to biogas production and quality sludge reduction sludge viscosity polymer consumption and vivianite recovery specifically it was identified that fna formed from combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite substantially improved twas degradability with increased hydrolysis rate and biochemical methane potential which led to 26 higher methane production and volatile solids destruction during anaerobic digestion 55 lower viscosity in digested sludge and 24 lower polymer demand in final digestate dewatering in addition to providing protons for fna fecl3 decreased h2s content in the biogas by 39 and increased production of vivianite in the digestate from 16 21 to 25 37 in the total crystalline iron species the economic analysis performed indicated that combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite is economically viable overall the results experimentally demonstrate that combined dosing of fecl3 and nitrite can be applied as a pre treatment strategy to improve anaerobic digestion yielding multiple benefits declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17101,zero valent iron zvi has been previously documented to attenuate the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes args in microbes while how zvi affects the evolution of args remains unclear herein we investigated the influences of zvi on args dissemination in anaerobic bioreactor treating oxytetracycline tet containing wastewater by deciphering the roles of iron homeostasis and regulatory effects a net reduction of tet gene targets ranging from 0 75 to 1 88 and 0 67 to 2 08 log unit in intracellular and extracellular dna was achieved at the optimal dosage of 5 g l zvi whereas 20 g l zvi made no effects on args reduction the reduced args abundance by zvi was directly related to the inhibited horizontal transfer of args and decreased proliferation of resistant strains mainly paludibacter and wchb1 32 the potential mechanisms included the increased antioxidant capacity the depressed efflux pump system and the weakened energy driving force by fur regulon in microbes especially for cloacibacterium and dechloromonas the negligible influence of 20 g l zvi on args reduction was ascribed to the iron catalyzed oxidative damage and reduced physiological activity this study firstly illustrated the potential relationships among activation of iron uptake regulator leading to protection against oxidative stress alternation of physiological metabolisms and reduction of args dissemination this work extents our understanding about the priority of zvi in mitigating args proliferation and sheds light on its potential application in wastewater treatment plants graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes zero valent iron iron homeostasis ferric uptake regulator antioxidant capacity 1 introduction despite the already various natural background of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args the intensive use and misuse of antibiotics are inextricably linked to the proliferation and propagation of arb and args in environmental compartments berendonk et al 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are regarded as one of the predominant sources of arb and args dissemination into the environment rizzo et al 2013 since the extremely high bacterial loads and subtherapeutic concentrations of antibiotics and other diverse pollutants in wwtps may lead to further args proliferation berendonk et al 2015 lapara et al 2011 therefore great efforts are required to comprehensively reveal args occurrence and efficiently reduce args abundance in biological wastewater treatment systems recently zero valent iron zvi has been extensively introduced to couple with microorganisms to dramatically reduce various antibiotics and metals in wastewater ayala parra et al 2016 huang et al 2017 which were reported to impose selective effects on args zhu et al 2013 specially remarkably higher removals of args have been observed in iron amended anaerobic bioreactor when compared with the conventional treatments gao et al 2017 reported that the addition of 5 g l zvi could decline the representative tetracycline resistance genes during anaerobic digestion of activated sludge huang et al 2019 suggested that the increased intracellular iron contributed to the inhibited proliferation of args these were partly attributed to the altered phylogenetic distribution of domain bacteria adsorption effects of iron hydro oxides and reduced selective pressure of antibiotics which have been substantiated in studies performed both at pilot scale and within full scale wttps li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a however the potential mechanisms were not clearly stated in relation to the changed physiological behaviors of microbes by zvi addition and their roles in args reduction iron is essential for many fundamental cellular processes such as the adaptation stress tolerance and dna biosynthesis and its function relies on the incorporation into iron sulfur fe s clusters rocha and dancis 2016 however excess fe2 catalyses fenton reaction producing highly reactive and damaging hydroxyl radical oh andrews et al 2003 thus the iron dependent homeostasis is tightly regulated by the transcription factor of ferric uptake regulator fur which controls genes coding iron transportation and utilization systems andrew et al 2003 interestingly iron transporter is associated with the outer membrane protein and cell membrane permeability zhang et al 2020 which has a wide range of physiological functions including the antibiotics resistance gil et al 2009 in addition fe s clusters are versatile sensors and scavengers to reactive oxygen species ros beinert et al 1997 kiley and beinert 2003 which have been extensively proved to result in args propagation gutierrez et al 2013 however detailed information about process of intracellular iron homeostasis in zvi amended bioreactor and its role in args dissemination remains unclear although fur was originally considered to play a leading part in maintaining iron homeostasis it is becoming more apparent that it functions as a global regulator involved in a variety of processes such as energy metabolism seo et al 2014 efflux pump embree et al 2014 antioxidant system and sos response lavrrar and mclntosh 2003 interestingly adenosine triphosphate atp is necessary to energize the transfer of substrate dna and replication of template dna which induce the propagation and structural transition of args feeney et al 2016 additionally efflux pump is reported to be one of the resistance mechanisms and account for approximately half of the args bernier et al 2013 chen et al 2018 the activation of sos response caused by oxidative stress promoted the activities of dna repairation system which would stimulate the conjugative transfer of args beaber et al 2004 lv et al 2014 however how fur works as direct or indirect transcriptional regulator in mediating args proliferation remains unknown and this will shed light on how zvi influences args abundance in anaerobic bioreactor in this study the fates of args in anaerobic bioreactor in response to zvi addition were firstly illustrated then the effects of zvi on the abundance of args were determined by examining the levels of horizontal genes transfer hgt and vertical genes transfer vgt the possible mechanisms for zvi influencing args proliferation were explored by identifying the iron dependent form of metabolism and roles as regulators to the best of our knowledge this is the first study revealing the effects of intracellular iron homeostasis and the related transcriptional network regulatory system on args proliferation 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr set up and operation the laboratory scale anaerobic sbr made of plexiglass was established with the inner diameter of 11 cm and height of 40 cm as shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information reaction zone was surrounded by circulating water zone and the stirrer was fixed at the top of the reactor activated sludge with mixed liquor suspended solids of 16 2 g l was collected freshly from an anaerobic digester of a wwtp nanjing china the accumulation and cultivation process were begun with the injection of synthetic wastewater and 5 g l initial suspended solid into the anaerobic reactor the specific compositions of synthetic wastewater were provided in table s1 oxytetracycline hydrochloride otc purity 98 purchased from aladdin shanghai which is one of the most commonly used antibiotics globally li et al 2017 was injected into the influent of sbrs the concentration of otc was designed at 1 mg l in line with those presented in antibiotic production wastewater ranging from 0 1 to 1 mg l larsson et al 2007 before pumping into the reactor the influent was deoxygenated by flushing n2 for 20 min the reactor was operated regularly twice per day including 20 min influent supply 10 h stirring period 70 rpm 1 5 h settling and 10 min effluent withdrawal the effects of zvi powder less than 50 μm in diameter purity 99 tengchun biotech co china on args abundance in anaerobic bioreactor were explored by testing the concentration of 1 5 10 and 20 g l aiming at simultaneously explore the optimal dosage and the potential mechanisms involved in args attenuation according to previous publications gao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a the respective bioreactor was denoted as sbr 1 sbr 2 sbr 3 and sbr 4 the reactor with no zvi addition was marked as control the detailed characteristics of zvi powder were given in our previous publication hou et al 2018 and test s1 to reveal the effects of zvi on the gene targets expression the experiments were operated for 20 days when the sbr systems held steady performance in terms of cod and otc removal efficiency 2 2 sample collection and dna extraction mixture samples for dna extraction were collected at the end of the experiment to obtain well distributed sludge samples three subsamples per replicate segment were collected from each bioreactor the extractions of extracellular dna and intracellular dna edna and idna in anaerobic sludge were conducted according to mao et al 2014 with some modifications briefly 50 ml anaerobic sludge was firstly centrifugated at 5000 rpm for 10 min to obtain cell pellets afterwards 4 ml of nah2po4 buffer 0 12 m ph 8 0 and 0 2 g of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone pvpp were added to cell pellets to separate and release the edna after shaking 250 rpm for 10 min at 25 c and centrifuging 10 000 g for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was collected and stored on ice the cell pellets were extracted thrice again under the same conditions as the first time the combined supernatant of four times extraction was filtered through a sterile membrane 0 22 μm pore size pvdf osmonics u s and a precipitation method was introduced to collect the edna existing in filtrate zhang et al 2018b the further freeze dried precipitates were used for edna extraction the residual cell pellets after extraction with nah2po4 buffer and pvpp were collected for idna extraction then a powersoil dna isolation kit was employed to extract the idna from cell pellets and the edna from freeze dried precipitates the dna content and purity were determined on 1 agarose gel with a nanodrop nd 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific wilmington ma 2 3 quantification of args and mges abundance by qpcr in the present study six frequently detected genes encoding tetracycline tet resistance including three efflux pump genes teta tetc tetg two ribosomal protection proteins genes teto tetm and one inactivating enzyme gene tetx were measured the changes in the abundance of four genes linked with mobile genetic elements mges were also determined

procedures are given in test s2 2 4 detection of bacterial antioxidant system and sos response the levels of cellular oxidative stress were characterized by the total anti oxidative capacity t aoc and lipid peroxidation level tbars according to our previous study xu et al 2018 and listed in test s3 the bacterial antioxidant systems including superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and glutathione reductase gr were assessed based on the illustrations in hou et al 2016 and provided in test s4 the induction of sos response was monitored by β galactosidase assay bernier et al 2013 using onpg sigma as the substrate and displayed as units per milligram ochsner et al 2000 the activities of key enzymes involved in sos response were assessed including endonuclease dna e dna ligase dna l dna polymerase i dnapo i and dna polymerase ii dnapo ii janion 2008 koskiniemi et al 2010 briefly anaerobic sludge was firstly washed with pbs for three times and sonicated in ice bath for 10 min to extract crude enzymes cell lysate of each sample was then added to the corresponding reaction mixtures the spectrophotometrical changes were measured at 450 nm immediately the activities of enzymes were normalized on the basis of protein concentration and displayed as u mg protein detailed in test s5 2 5 evaluation of the energy generation process details of the analysis concerning atp

well as glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pdh 6 phosphogluconic dehydrogenase 6pgdh and 6 phosphate gluconolactone 6pgl which are involved in the pentose phosphate pathway ppp pathway were examined in vivo using the appropriate double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kits you et al 2020 2 6 other analytical methods to reveal the varied iron metabolism caused by zvi addition the abundance of fur ferd and pvds gene that functioning in iron regulation storage and acquisition was detected by qpcr sanjivni et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 primers used in qpcr analysis were given in table s2 the copies of the outer membrane pore protein encoding genes ompa ompf and ompc were determined by qpcr following the protocols described by zhang et al 2017 the hereditary stability of the antibiotic resistance was tested under anaerobic conditions using the modified protocol of kirby bauer disc diffusion method as illustrated in test s7 the concentration of intracellular otc and fe2 was respectively detected according to zhang et al 2014 with some modifications and by sigma aldrich iron assay kit mak 025 details are correspondingly provided in test s8 and test s9 the illumine high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were conducted according to our previous study hou et al 2018 concentrations of ferritins fn and transferrin tfn respectively related to iron storage and transport were examined using commercially available elisa kits 2 7 statistical analysis partial least squares path modeling pls pm was introduced to examine the direct indirect and interactive effects between variables and args abundances with the smart pls 3 0 network analysis based on the pearman correlation p 0 05 was established through the gephi platform 0 9 2 all tests in the present study were performed in triplicate and the statistical analysis were performed using spss 19 0 spss inc chicago illinois statistical analysis was tested by performing a paired t student s test with the significance of 5 level or more significance of 1 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 fates of args in response to zvi addition in anaerobic bioreactor args may be located on chromosomes of arb and exist as free living fragments after released by arb presenting as idna and edna in natural or engineered environment mao et al 2014 to estimate the propagation of bacteria resistance in anaerobic bioreactor the evolution and partition of args in both idna and edna were comprehensively detected thus the occurrences of 6 common tet args in both idna and edna were monitored and displayed in fig 1 and fig s2 respectively in general significantly higher abundance of detected args was found in idna than in edna suggesting that cell associated idna was the important reservoir for tet args specially the detection frequency of tetc teta and tetg in both idna and edna was relatively higher than teto tetm and tetx suggesting that efflux pumps were the predominant resistance mechanism in anaerobes selvam et al 2012 found similar results that efflux pump genes are prevailing during the composting of swine manure in control the absolute quantities of tet genes in idna and edna ranged from 2 46 to 11 32 and 1 17 to 8 97 log unit after treated with otc for 20 days in comparison all tet genes were significantly reduced p 0 05 in idna and in edna with the exception of tetx p 0 45 at the optimal dosage of 5 g l zvi a net reduction of tet gene targets ranging from 0 75 to 1 88 and 0 67 to 2 08 log unit in idna and edna were achieved the evolution performance of tet genes exhibited the highly similar trend in idna and edna treated by 1 and 10 g l zvi with the notable attenuation of tetc tetg teto and tetm especially tetx was not influenced by any zvi treatment in idna while the removal of 0 68 log 0 67 log and 0 34 log at 1 5 and 10 g l zvi addition was obtained in edna this phenomenon might be caused by the close relationships of tetx with mges roberts 2005 and its distribution in comparatively confined genera ghosh et al 2009 notably in sbr 4 only teto in idna and edna was respectively effectively removed p 0 05 by 1 92 log and 1 88 log unit probably due to the close relationship between teto and intracellular iron homeostasis dong et al 2017 this observation corroborated that high zvi application unnecessarily meant the great inhibition of args proliferation consistent with previous study gao et al 2017 the 16s rrna gene copies for each reactor were quantified and followed the order of sbr 3 sbr 2 sbr 4 sbr 1 control in idna and sbr 4 control sbr 1 sbr 3 sbr 2 in edna obviously the introduction of zvi could relieve the antimicrobial effects of otc and maintain biomass at higher level however 20 g l zvi resulted in the improved leakage of dna which might be attributed to the oxidative damage induced by excess iron andrews et al 2003 dong et al 2017 in control tet gene targets in idna and edna normalized to 16s rrna were quite comparable whereas the ratios of tet a g o m 16s rrna in zvi amended bioreactor were significantly p 0 05 higher for edna than those for idna it could be deduced that tet genes evolved distinctly due to the greater effects of zvi on bacteria andrews et al 2003 gao et al 2017 the detailed procedures and potential mechanisms are explored in the following test 3 2 effects of zvi on vertical and horizontal transfer activity of args the development of antibiotic resistance traits is driven by hgt including conjugation transduction of idna and natural transformation of edna among bacteria and vgt transfer of idna from parent cell to offspring mediated process additionally many args are inserted in mges that able to express gene cassettes and transfer genes between dna molecules and cells dodd 2012 partridge 2011 thus mges playing important roles in args dissemination through hgt were detected as shown in fig 2 a and fig s3a the total mges were approximately 8 23 and 7 12 log unit for the control sample in idna and edna with inti1 and iscr being the most dominant considering the total concentrations of mges in idna fig 2a there is no much significance with or without zvi importantly the relative abundance of 4 target mges in edna fig s3b was much higher than the idna fig 2b with the higher residual amounts of mges in control and 20 g l zvi treatment the application of 5 g l zvi was more efficient at reducing mges 89 71 in edna fig s3a than 1 and 10 g l 66 70 and 55 53 respectively nevertheless treated by 20 g l zvi the total mges in edna increased by 96 56 consistent with the increased extracellular 16s rrna genes these results implied zvi could dose dependently mitigate the args propagation through efficiently reducing the mges in edna the effects of zvi on the vgt activity of tet args were determined using the modified disk diffusion method a test duration of 10 days was conducted and the average inhibitory zone diameters fig 3 a were measurably increased p 0 05 in sbr 1 3 compared to the control indicating the reduced arb by zvi previous publication also reported that zvi is a key issue influencing the microbial community structure and arg host bacteria ou et al 2016 notably the residual arb in control sbr 1 and sbr 2 could sustain their vgt activity well since the inhibitory zone diameters were nearly unchanged with prolonged time fig 3b nevertheless 20 g l led to the decreased resistance transfer of microbes to their offspring stably fig 3b thus 1 5 and 10 g l zvi reduced tet args abundance through inhibiting hgt occurrence and reducing arb abundance during operation while 20 g l showed no much effects due to disturbed bacterial activity next the iron dosage dependent homeostasis was further studied to illustrate the distinct effects of zvi on tet args attenuation and potential mechanisms 3 3 roles of altered iron dependent homeostasis in args reduction in bacteria 3 3 1 increased iron utilization and decreased iron transportation the abundance of fur in anaerobic sludge with only zvi addition was examined in another five reactors to illustrate the effects of zvi on iron uptake regulator fig s4 compared with raw sludge the effects of zvi on fur showed a two phase dose response relationship characterized by low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition in the presence of otc the gene abundance of fur and intracellular fe2 was highly promoted by 1 5 and 10 g l zvi fig 4 a obviously the roles of 10 g l zvi on fur were quite different in the presence and absence of otc this result might be caused by the interactions between otc with zvi or anaerobes and the involved mechanisms need to be explored in further studies consistently the transcription of bacterioferritin associated gene and quantity of fn were facilitated by 1 5 and 10 g l zvi fig 4b these findings clearly illustrated that the regulatory effects of fur were stimulated to maintain the iron homeostasis choi and ryu 2019 in the present study the improved activities of nadh dehydratase complex i and cytochrome c reductase complex iii further typically proved increased utilization of iron through formation of fe s clusters under fur activation fig 4c it has been reported that the arrangements of 4fe 4s clusters in dehydratase are crucially involved in oxidative prevention and thus attenuating args in idna propagation lu and imlay 2019 in contrast gene transcription of pvds and the regulated synthesis of tfn were significantly p 0 05 lowered by 1 5 and 10 g l zvi to prevent excessive iron uptake fig 4d earlier studies have reported that down regulation of tfn decreases the generation of porins in cell membranes which allows for args in idna and edna transportation to indigenous bacteria mohanty et al 2015 sanjivni et al 2018 specially for the bacteria receiving 20 g l zvi fe2 concentration was increased as well whereas the iron metabolism regulator of fur the iron reservation and acquisition system were notably inhibited these results implied the deterioration of microbial activity since the aberrant accumulation of iron is linked to a staggering cell death through ros production and physiological damage dixon and stockwell 2014 which was studied in section 3 4 1 3 3 2 shifts in intracellular free mg2 and oxytetracycline the level of mg2 and otc were further assayed since their intracellular availabilities are necessary to evoke tet args zhang et al 2014 and are confirmed to be relied on the iron transport system huang et al 2019 savigni and morgan 2003 as shown in fig s5 the average concentration of mg2 declined by 11 90 61 41 59 51 and 4 96 after treatment with 1 5 10 and 20 g l zvi respectively these results would mitigate arg conjugation in idna because of the crucial roles of mg2 in relaxation of supercoild plasmid dna pansegrau et al 1990 similar trend was observed for intracellular otc content with the greatest and least reduction of 75 94 and 14 54 for 5 and 20 g l zvi treatment the declined uptake of otc would mitigate the selective pressure and relieve the eliciting of tet arg in idna compared to 5 and 10 g l zvi the less impacts of 20 g l zvi on intracellular mg2 and otc might be due to the membranolysis caused by oxidative stress dixon and stockwell 2014 3 3 3 altered args and mges bacterial taxa distribution and association the response of microbial community composition to iron homeostasis was further characterized and shown in fig 5 the introduction of 5 10 and 20 g l zvi led to the dramatical p 0 05 decrease in bacterial species richness otu number and community diversity shannon index fig 5a in control proteobacteria bacteroidetes and patescibacteria were the three most dominant phylum with the corresponding relative abundance of 50 55 19 67 and 23 35 fig 5b with 1 5 and 10 g l zvi treatment abundances of proteobacteria and patescibacteria were significantly declined whereas bacteroidetes was prominently promoted by 34 13 94 84 and 95 86 in bioreactor amended by 20 g l zvi both proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were increased the similarity of bacterial community structure was determined by hierarchically clustered heat map analysis of the top 30 genera fig 5c the microbial compositions in control and sbr 1 displayed similarity which were much different from those in sbr 2 and sbr 3 notably the microbial community structure shaped by 20 g l zvi was separated from other zvi dosages the co occurrence of members of the bacterial community all of the examined args mges in idna and also fur was visualized by network analysis fig 5d established according to wei et al 2020 obviously 13 genera were identified as the potential hosts for args and mges in idna with cloacibacterium dechloromonas paludibacter and wchb1 32 being the most abundant fig s6 specifically cloacibacterium and dechloromonas that affiliated to bacteroidetes and showed less connection with args were significantly enriched by 1 5 and 10 g l zvi it is important to recognize that cloacibacterium and dechloromonas are greatly associated with denitrification and organic degradation carney et al 2019 che et al 2020 their increased abundance suggests the positive roles of zvi on wastewater purification xu et al 2017 you et al 2017 contrarily the relative abundances of paludibacter and wchb1 32 that significantly related with multiple resistance were measurably decreased it could be deduced that the declined abundance of paludibacter and wchb1 32 contributed to the alleviated vgt of args in fig 3 furthermore the correlations between fur with nine resistant genera especially for cloacibacterium and dechloromonas were obtained in fig 5d suggesting the potential roles of iron uptake system in mediating the microbial performances and thus reducing tet args proliferation in idna the effects of fur serving as regulators were further studied to reveal the mechanisms underlying the effects of intracellular iron homeostasis on args reduction 3 4 regulatory roles of fur in args attenuation 3 4 1 regulating effects of fur on antioxidant and sos system evidences indicated that the horizontal transfer of args in idna and edna among bacteria can be induced by triggered oxidative stress and protective sos response beaber et al 2004 lv et al 2014 at the end of the experiment the levels of oxidative stress were quite different among bioreactors in sbr 1 2 and 3 the level of tbars maintained at 98 65 106 91 and 113 43 of the control fig 6 a correspondingly taoc increased to 110 65 153 55 and 139 63 of the control the antioxidative activities of sod cat and gr shown in fig 6a were all higher than the control confirming the functions of fur like proteins in regulating iron assimilation with oxidative defense in evolutionarily unrelated bacteria lavrrar and mclntosh 2003 zheng et al 1999 considering the 20 g l zvi treatment tbars was significantly increased to 161 39 and taoc decreased to 76 15 of the control p 0 05 in line with the destroyed antioxidant enzymes system it has been demonstrated that although iron is essential for most of the bacteria liberated iron would in turn catalyze the generation of radicals dixon and stockwell 2014 seo et al 2014 as the inhibited bacteria proliferation in fig 3 and reduced physiological activity in fig 4 a certain level of dna damage caused by ros could induce the error prone sos response which catalyzes the synthesis of dna in vacant sites and stimulates the integration of args related elements by series of dna repairation enzymes beaber et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 thus the expression of sos regulated gene sula indicated by β galactosidase bernier et al 2013 was determined fig 6b to characterize the sos response the transcription of sula in zvi treatment groups was decreased negatively related to the changes of antioxidant capacity in fig 6a as such zvi introduction led to the down regulation of dna e and dna l which are involved in dna mismatch and re combinational repair mechanisms laloo et al 2018 the dna polymerase including dnapo i and dnapo ii decreased only with 5 and 20 g l zvi addition therefore the activation of fur by 1 5 and 10 g l zvi inhibited the integration of tet args in idna and edna to microbial genome via participating in oxidative defense and repressing sos response in contrast 20 g l zvi strengthened the oxidative stress damaged the physiological activity and posed less effects on tet args reduction 3 4 2 regulating effects of fur on efflux pump system given that efflux pumps dominated the resistance mechanisms fig 1 the regulating effects of fur on efflux pump system were further determined by examining the content of atp binding cassette transporter atp bc and abundance of outer membrane protein ompa ompc and ompf genes involved in resistance nodulation cell division rnd family saba et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 as fig s7 revealed in bioreactor with 5 and 10 g l zvi amendment the atp bc respectively decreased by 15 38 and 5 98 while ompa ompc ompf significantly decreased by 74 21 82 0 and 80 83 90 61 it could be deduced that the lacking of membrane porin channels played vital roles in mitigating the risk for tet args dissemination via hgt in comparison 20 g l zvi imposed more significant negative effects on atp bc and rnd family this result was contrary to the conclusion derived from 5 10 g l zvi treatment and the positive relationships between the expression levels of atp bc and rnd family with the abundance of args zhang et al 2017 3 4 3 regulating effects of fur on energy generation process the energy metabolism that provides driving force for dna uptake and synthesis was further explored under stimulated fur conditions cooper et al 2018 huang et al 2019 as fig s8 illustrates 5 10 and 20 g l zvi induced a notable dose dependent decline in atp by 35 41 57 95 and 67 86 in microbes which would hinder args transfer feeney et al 2016 a particular level of atp has been demonstrated to represent the switch between cell apoptosis and necrosis under oxidant stress lelli et al 1998 therefore it is possible that the reduced atp following treatment with 5 and 10 g l zvi was below and upon the threshold for apoptosis while 20 g l resulted in the necrosis the variations of cell viabilities in fig 3b and physiological activities in figs 4 and 6 caused by individual zvi dosage can thus be well accepted interestingly the intracellular content of cyt c and its cofactor heme c that cycles between the reduced fe2 and oxidized fe3 state to perform electron carrier was measurably increased by 5 and 10 g l zvi addition fig s9 indicating the promoted anaerobic metabolism ma et al 2019 next the degradation of glucose was further studied to expound this contradictory phenomenon in relation to decreased atp generation and enhanced anaerobic metabolism the emp and ppp are fundamental pathways of carbohydrate metabolism fig 7 a for emp yields nadh atp in the respiratory chain reactions shimizua and matsuoka 2019a and ppp generates the only nadph to provide reducing power for cell growth shimizua and matsuoka 2019b in the current study the key enzymes responsible for atp nadh and nadph generation were detected as revealed in fig 7b the activities of glgp gapdh and pk were measurably declined by 5 and 10 g l zvi which would decrease the production of nadh and atp in emp according to fig 7a with respect to ppp pathway the activities of g6pdh and 6pgdh that catalyzing nadph production were dramatically increased the ratio of nadh nadph fig s10 ranging from 2 51 in control to 1 18 and 1 03 in sbr 2 and sbr 3 also confirmed the inhibited emp and facilitated ppp pathway which together resulted in a decrease in cellular atp besides nadph is reported to be a reducing agent kirkman et al 1999 shimizua and matsuoka 2019a and ppp partially serves as a first line defense against oxidative damage lu 2013 as a consequence the activated fur system could comprehensively mitigate oxidative stress and args transfer in idna and edna via the metabolic flux toward ppp with the oversupply of nadph and shortage of driving force under 20 g l zvi treatment condition the five enzymes functioning in emp and two enzymes involved in ppp were significantly inhibited p 0 05 confirming the decreased performance of energy supply and oxidative defense 3 5 underlying mechanisms by which zvi reduce args abundance in bioreactor to reveal the regulatory effects of zvi on restraining args dissemination and minimize the confounding interactions among various causal factors pls pm analysis was conducted as shown in fig 8 zvi and antioxidant system can both directly and indirectly make negative influence on args dissemination while efflux pump mges atp content and sos response were positively linked with args in order of mges sos response efflux pump atp content crucially zvi had significantly negative effects on efflux pump mges and atp content additionally zvi could negatively influence sos response through inducing the antioxidant system due to the negative feedback beaber et al 2004 lv et al 2014 in this study the regulatory effects of fur contributed to tet args loss in anaerobes through activating antioxidant system and depressing sos response energy generation and efflux pump system fig 9 a briefly replete iron supply stimulated the intracellular iron homeostasis regulon of fur for maintaining protein functionality without inducing oxidative stress andrew et al 2003 thereafter the upregulated fe s assembly storage cofactors for iron utilization and downregulated genes encoding transporters for iron uptake fig 9b 1 respectively improved antioxidant capacity of bacteria and suppressed efflux pump system fig 9b 2 fig 9b 4 the increased antioxidant system further implied the suppressed sos response andersson and hughes 2014 lv et al 2014 which mediated horizontal transfer of args additionally the regulatory effects of fur transited the central metabolism from emp to ppp fig 9b 3 leading to the weakened energy driving force for hgt and promoted oxidative stress defense for reducing args propagation 4 conclusion the emergency and removal of tet args in anaerobic bioreactor were systemically detected with an emphasize on exploring the mechanisms of zvi powder on args attenuation the following conclusions can be delivered greater idna associated tet args were enriched in anaerobes with otc exposure and zvi with no more than 10 g l displayed favorable advantages for attenuating args in both idna and edna the reduced tet args dissemination was ascribed to the suppressed processes of plasmid mediated hgt and paludibacter wchb1 32 dominated vgt the aroused fur regulon regulated the physiology of microbes especially for cloacibacterium dechloromonas which led to the antioxidant system activation the efflux pump repression and the energy metabolism transition relieving the hgt and vgt of tet arg 20 g l zvi could not efficiently enhance the reduction of tet args targets due to failure of defensing against oxidative stress caused by excess of free iron to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the deregulation of iron homeostasis leading to protection against oxidative damage and regulation of args dissemination in anaerobic bioreactor was evaluated this study would shed light on the mechanisms of how zvi influence args propagation and the application of zvi in engineering practice declaration of competing interest the authors

17101,zero valent iron zvi has been previously documented to attenuate the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes args in microbes while how zvi affects the evolution of args remains unclear herein we investigated the influences of zvi on args dissemination in anaerobic bioreactor treating oxytetracycline tet containing wastewater by deciphering the roles of iron homeostasis and regulatory effects a net reduction of tet gene targets ranging from 0 75 to 1 88 and 0 67 to 2 08 log unit in intracellular and extracellular dna was achieved at the optimal dosage of 5 g l zvi whereas 20 g l zvi made no effects on args reduction the reduced args abundance by zvi was directly related to the inhibited horizontal transfer of args and decreased proliferation of resistant strains mainly paludibacter and wchb1 32 the potential mechanisms included the increased antioxidant capacity the depressed efflux pump system and the weakened energy driving force by fur regulon in microbes especially for cloacibacterium and dechloromonas the negligible influence of 20 g l zvi on args reduction was ascribed to the iron catalyzed oxidative damage and reduced physiological activity this study firstly illustrated the potential relationships among activation of iron uptake regulator leading to protection against oxidative stress alternation of physiological metabolisms and reduction of args dissemination this work extents our understanding about the priority of zvi in mitigating args proliferation and sheds light on its potential application in wastewater treatment plants graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes zero valent iron iron homeostasis ferric uptake regulator antioxidant capacity 1 introduction despite the already various natural background of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args the intensive use and misuse of antibiotics are inextricably linked to the proliferation and propagation of arb and args in environmental compartments berendonk et al 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are regarded as one of the predominant sources of arb and args dissemination into the environment rizzo et al 2013 since the extremely high bacterial loads and subtherapeutic concentrations of antibiotics and other diverse pollutants in wwtps may lead to further args proliferation berendonk et al 2015 lapara et al 2011 therefore great efforts are required to comprehensively reveal args occurrence and efficiently reduce args abundance in biological wastewater treatment systems recently zero valent iron zvi has been extensively introduced to couple with microorganisms to dramatically reduce various antibiotics and metals in wastewater ayala parra et al 2016 huang et al 2017 which were reported to impose selective effects on args zhu et al 2013 specially remarkably higher removals of args have been observed in iron amended anaerobic bioreactor when compared with the conventional treatments gao et al 2017 reported that the addition of 5 g l zvi could decline the representative tetracycline resistance genes during anaerobic digestion of activated sludge huang et al 2019 suggested that the increased intracellular iron contributed to the inhibited proliferation of args these were partly attributed to the altered phylogenetic distribution of domain bacteria adsorption effects of iron hydro oxides and reduced selective pressure of antibiotics which have been substantiated in studies performed both at pilot scale and within full scale wttps li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a however the potential mechanisms were not clearly stated in relation to the changed physiological behaviors of microbes by zvi addition and their roles in args reduction iron is essential for many fundamental cellular processes such as the adaptation stress tolerance and dna biosynthesis and its function relies on the incorporation into iron sulfur fe s clusters rocha and dancis 2016 however excess fe2 catalyses fenton reaction producing highly reactive and damaging hydroxyl radical oh andrews et al 2003 thus the iron dependent homeostasis is tightly regulated by the transcription factor of ferric uptake regulator fur which controls genes coding iron transportation and utilization systems andrew et al 2003 interestingly iron transporter is associated with the outer membrane protein and cell membrane permeability zhang et al 2020 which has a wide range of physiological functions including the antibiotics resistance gil et al 2009 in addition fe s clusters are versatile sensors and scavengers to reactive oxygen species ros beinert et al 1997 kiley and beinert 2003 which have been extensively proved to result in args propagation gutierrez et al 2013 however detailed information about process of intracellular iron homeostasis in zvi amended bioreactor and its role in args dissemination remains unclear although fur was originally considered to play a leading part in maintaining iron homeostasis it is becoming more apparent that it functions as a global regulator involved in a variety of processes such as energy metabolism seo et al 2014 efflux pump embree et al 2014 antioxidant system and sos response lavrrar and mclntosh 2003 interestingly adenosine triphosphate atp is necessary to energize the transfer of substrate dna and replication of template dna which induce the propagation and structural transition of args feeney et al 2016 additionally efflux pump is reported to be one of the resistance mechanisms and account for approximately half of the args bernier et al 2013 chen et al 2018 the activation of sos response caused by oxidative stress promoted the activities of dna repairation system which would stimulate the conjugative transfer of args beaber et al 2004 lv et al 2014 however how fur works as direct or indirect transcriptional regulator in mediating args proliferation remains unknown and this will shed light on how zvi influences args abundance in anaerobic bioreactor in this study the fates of args in anaerobic bioreactor in response to zvi addition were firstly illustrated then the effects of zvi on the abundance of args were determined by examining the levels of horizontal genes transfer hgt and vertical genes transfer vgt the possible mechanisms for zvi influencing args proliferation were explored by identifying the iron dependent form of metabolism and roles as regulators to the best of our knowledge this is the first study revealing the effects of intracellular iron homeostasis and the related transcriptional network regulatory system on args proliferation 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr set up and operation the laboratory scale anaerobic sbr made of plexiglass was established with the inner diameter of 11 cm and height of 40 cm as shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information reaction zone was surrounded by circulating water zone and the stirrer was fixed at the top of the reactor activated sludge with mixed liquor suspended solids of 16 2 g l was collected freshly from an anaerobic digester of a wwtp nanjing china the accumulation and cultivation process were begun with the injection of synthetic wastewater and 5 g l initial suspended solid into the anaerobic reactor the specific compositions of synthetic wastewater were provided in table s1 oxytetracycline hydrochloride otc purity 98 purchased from aladdin shanghai which is one of the most commonly used antibiotics globally li et al 2017 was injected into the influent of sbrs the concentration of otc was designed at 1 mg l in line with those presented in antibiotic production wastewater ranging from 0 1 to 1 mg l larsson et al 2007 before pumping into the reactor the influent was deoxygenated by flushing n2 for 20 min the reactor was operated regularly twice per day including 20 min influent supply 10 h stirring period 70 rpm 1 5 h settling and 10 min effluent withdrawal the effects of zvi powder less than 50 μm in diameter purity 99 tengchun biotech co china on args abundance in anaerobic bioreactor were explored by testing the concentration of 1 5 10 and 20 g l aiming at simultaneously explore the optimal dosage and the potential mechanisms involved in args attenuation according to previous publications gao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a the respective bioreactor was denoted as sbr 1 sbr 2 sbr 3 and sbr 4 the reactor with no zvi addition was marked as control the detailed characteristics of zvi powder were given in our previous publication hou et al 2018 and test s1 to reveal the effects of zvi on the gene targets expression the experiments were operated for 20 days when the sbr systems held steady performance in terms of cod and otc removal efficiency 2 2 sample collection and dna extraction mixture samples for dna extraction were collected at the end of the experiment to obtain well distributed sludge samples three subsamples per replicate segment were collected from each bioreactor the extractions of extracellular dna and intracellular dna edna and idna in anaerobic sludge were conducted according to mao et al 2014 with some modifications briefly 50 ml anaerobic sludge was firstly centrifugated at 5000 rpm for 10 min to obtain cell pellets afterwards 4 ml of nah2po4 buffer 0 12 m ph 8 0 and 0 2 g of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone pvpp were added to cell pellets to separate and release the edna after shaking 250 rpm for 10 min at 25 c and centrifuging 10 000 g for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was collected and stored on ice the cell pellets were extracted thrice again under the same conditions as the first time the combined supernatant of four times extraction was filtered through a sterile membrane 0 22 μm pore size pvdf osmonics u s and a precipitation method was introduced to collect the edna existing in filtrate zhang et al 2018b the further freeze dried precipitates were used for edna extraction the residual cell pellets after extraction with nah2po4 buffer and pvpp were collected for idna extraction then a powersoil dna isolation kit was employed to extract the idna from cell pellets and the edna from freeze dried precipitates the dna content and purity were determined on 1 agarose gel with a nanodrop nd 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific wilmington ma 2 3 quantification of args and mges abundance by qpcr in the present study six frequently detected genes encoding tetracycline tet resistance including three efflux pump genes teta tetc tetg two ribosomal protection proteins genes teto tetm and one inactivating enzyme gene tetx were measured the changes in the abundance of four genes linked with mobile genetic elements mges were also determined including integrases inti1 inti2 transposon tn916 1545 short for tn916 and insert sequence iscr1 the changes in bacterial cell densities were examined by amplifying 16s rrna gene copies by sybr green real time qpcr primers for all the target genes were selected from previous publication liao et al 2017 with their annealing temperatures and amplification protocols listed in table s2 detailed procedures are given in test s2 2 4 detection of bacterial antioxidant system and sos response the levels of cellular oxidative stress were characterized by the total anti oxidative capacity t aoc and lipid peroxidation level tbars according to our previous study xu et al 2018 and listed in test s3 the bacterial antioxidant systems including superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and glutathione reductase gr were assessed based on the illustrations in hou et al 2016 and provided in test s4 the induction of sos response was monitored by β galactosidase assay bernier et al 2013 using onpg sigma as the substrate and displayed as units per milligram ochsner et al 2000 the activities of key enzymes involved in sos response were assessed including endonuclease dna e dna ligase dna l dna polymerase i dnapo i and dna polymerase ii dnapo ii janion 2008 koskiniemi et al 2010 briefly anaerobic sludge was firstly washed with pbs for three times and sonicated in ice bath for 10 min to extract crude enzymes cell lysate of each sample was then added to the corresponding reaction mixtures the spectrophotometrical changes were measured at 450 nm immediately the activities of enzymes were normalized on the basis of protein concentration and displayed as u mg protein detailed in test s5 2 5 evaluation of the energy generation process details of the analysis concerning atp concentration cytochrome c cyt c heme c content and nadh nadph were all provided in test s6 the activities of key enzymes responsible for the energy metabolic from glycogen including glycogen phosphorylase glgp phosphohexose isomerase gpi phosphofructokinase pfk glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh pyruvate kinase pk which participate in the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway as well as glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pdh 6 phosphogluconic dehydrogenase 6pgdh and 6 phosphate gluconolactone 6pgl which are involved in the pentose phosphate pathway ppp pathway were examined in vivo using the appropriate double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kits you et al 2020 2 6 other analytical methods to reveal the varied iron metabolism caused by zvi addition the abundance of fur ferd and pvds gene that functioning in iron regulation storage and acquisition was detected by qpcr sanjivni et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 primers used in qpcr analysis were given in table s2 the copies of the outer membrane pore protein encoding genes ompa ompf and ompc were determined by qpcr following the protocols described by zhang et al 2017 the hereditary stability of the antibiotic resistance was tested under anaerobic conditions using the modified protocol of kirby bauer disc diffusion method as illustrated in test s7 the concentration of intracellular otc and fe2 was respectively detected according to zhang et al 2014 with some modifications and by sigma aldrich iron assay kit mak 025 details are correspondingly provided in test s8 and test s9 the illumine high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were conducted according to our previous study hou et al 2018 concentrations of ferritins fn and transferrin tfn respectively related to iron storage and transport were examined using commercially available elisa kits 2 7 statistical analysis partial least squares path modeling pls pm was introduced to examine the direct indirect and interactive effects between variables and args abundances with the smart pls 3 0 network analysis based on the pearman correlation p 0 05 was established through the gephi platform 0 9 2 all tests in the present study were performed in triplicate and the statistical analysis were performed using spss 19 0 spss inc chicago illinois statistical analysis was tested by performing a paired t student s test with the significance of 5 level or more significance of 1 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 fates of args in response to zvi addition in anaerobic bioreactor args may be located on chromosomes of arb and exist as free living fragments after released by arb presenting as idna and edna in natural or engineered environment mao et al 2014 to estimate the propagation of bacteria resistance in anaerobic bioreactor the evolution and partition of args in both idna and edna were comprehensively detected thus the occurrences of 6 common tet args in both idna and edna were monitored and displayed in fig 1 and fig s2 respectively in general significantly higher abundance of detected args was found in idna than in edna suggesting that cell associated idna was the important reservoir for tet args specially the detection frequency of tetc teta and tetg in both idna and edna was relatively higher than teto tetm and tetx suggesting that efflux pumps were the predominant resistance mechanism in anaerobes selvam et al 2012 found similar results that efflux pump genes are prevailing during the composting of swine manure in control the absolute quantities of tet genes in idna and edna ranged from 2 46 to 11 32 and 1 17 to 8 97 log unit after treated with otc for 20 days in comparison all tet genes were significantly reduced p 0 05 in idna and in edna with the exception of tetx p 0 45 at the optimal dosage of 5 g l zvi a net reduction of tet gene targets ranging from 0 75 to 1 88 and 0 67 to 2 08 log unit in idna and edna were achieved the evolution performance of tet genes exhibited the highly similar trend in idna and edna treated by 1 and 10 g l zvi with the notable attenuation of tetc tetg teto and tetm especially tetx was not influenced by any zvi treatment in idna while the removal of 0 68 log 0 67 log and 0 34 log at 1 5 and 10 g l zvi addition was obtained in edna this phenomenon might be caused by the close relationships of tetx with mges roberts 2005 and its distribution in comparatively confined genera ghosh et al 2009 notably in sbr 4 only teto in idna and edna was respectively effectively removed p 0 05 by 1 92 log and 1 88 log unit probably due to the close relationship between teto and intracellular iron homeostasis dong et al 2017 this observation corroborated that high zvi application unnecessarily meant the great inhibition of args proliferation consistent with previous study gao et al 2017 the 16s rrna gene copies for each reactor were quantified and followed the order of sbr 3 sbr 2 sbr 4 sbr 1 control in idna and sbr 4 control sbr 1 sbr 3 sbr 2 in edna obviously the introduction of zvi could relieve the antimicrobial effects of otc and maintain biomass at higher level however 20 g l zvi resulted in the improved leakage of dna which might be attributed to the oxidative damage induced by excess iron andrews et al 2003 dong et al 2017 in control tet gene targets in idna and edna normalized to 16s rrna were quite comparable whereas the ratios of tet a g o m 16s rrna in zvi amended bioreactor were significantly p 0 05 higher for edna than those for idna it could be deduced that tet genes evolved distinctly due to the greater effects of zvi on bacteria andrews et al 2003 gao et al 2017 the detailed procedures and potential mechanisms are explored in the following test 3 2 effects of zvi on vertical and horizontal transfer activity of args the development of antibiotic resistance traits is driven by hgt including conjugation transduction of idna and natural transformation of edna among bacteria and vgt transfer of idna from parent cell to offspring mediated process additionally many args are inserted in mges that able to express gene cassettes and transfer genes between dna molecules and cells dodd 2012 partridge 2011 thus mges playing important roles in args dissemination through hgt were detected as shown in fig 2 a and fig s3a the total mges were approximately 8 23 and 7 12 log unit for the control sample in idna and edna with inti1 and iscr being the most dominant considering the total concentrations of mges in idna fig 2a there is no much significance with or without zvi importantly the relative abundance of 4 target mges in edna fig s3b was much higher than the idna fig 2b with the higher residual amounts of mges in control and 20 g l zvi treatment the application of 5 g l zvi was more efficient at reducing mges 89 71 in edna fig s3a than 1 and 10 g l 66 70 and 55 53 respectively nevertheless treated by 20 g l zvi the total mges in edna increased by 96 56 consistent with the increased extracellular 16s rrna genes these results implied zvi could dose dependently mitigate the args propagation through efficiently reducing the mges in edna the effects of zvi on the vgt activity of tet args were determined using the modified disk diffusion method a test duration of 10 days was conducted and the average inhibitory zone diameters fig 3 a were measurably increased p 0 05 in sbr 1 3 compared to the control indicating the reduced arb by zvi previous publication also reported that zvi is a key issue influencing the microbial community structure and arg host bacteria ou et al 2016 notably the residual arb in control sbr 1 and sbr 2 could sustain their vgt activity well since the inhibitory zone diameters were nearly unchanged with prolonged time fig 3b nevertheless 20 g l led to the decreased resistance transfer of microbes to their offspring stably fig 3b thus 1 5 and 10 g l zvi reduced tet args abundance through inhibiting hgt occurrence and reducing arb abundance during operation while 20 g l showed no much effects due to disturbed bacterial activity next the iron dosage dependent homeostasis was further studied to illustrate the distinct effects of zvi on tet args attenuation and potential mechanisms 3 3 roles of altered iron dependent homeostasis in args reduction in bacteria 3 3 1 increased iron utilization and decreased iron transportation the abundance of fur in anaerobic sludge with only zvi addition was examined in another five reactors to illustrate the effects of zvi on iron uptake regulator fig s4 compared with raw sludge the effects of zvi on fur showed a two phase dose response relationship characterized by low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition in the presence of otc the gene abundance of fur and intracellular fe2 was highly promoted by 1 5 and 10 g l zvi fig 4 a obviously the roles of 10 g l zvi on fur were quite different in the presence and absence of otc this result might be caused by the interactions between otc with zvi or anaerobes and the involved mechanisms need to be explored in further studies consistently the transcription of bacterioferritin associated gene and quantity of fn were facilitated by 1 5 and 10 g l zvi fig 4b these findings clearly illustrated that the regulatory effects of fur were stimulated to maintain the iron homeostasis choi and ryu 2019 in the present study the improved activities of nadh dehydratase complex i and cytochrome c reductase complex iii further typically proved increased utilization of iron through formation of fe s clusters under fur activation fig 4c it has been reported that the arrangements of 4fe 4s clusters in dehydratase are crucially involved in oxidative prevention and thus attenuating args in idna propagation lu and imlay 2019 in contrast gene transcription of pvds and the regulated synthesis of tfn were significantly p 0 05 lowered by 1 5 and 10 g l zvi to prevent excessive iron uptake fig 4d earlier studies have reported that down regulation of tfn decreases the generation of porins in cell membranes which allows for args in idna and edna transportation to indigenous bacteria mohanty et al 2015 sanjivni et al 2018 specially for the bacteria receiving 20 g l zvi fe2 concentration was increased as well whereas the iron metabolism regulator of fur the iron reservation and acquisition system were notably inhibited these results implied the deterioration of microbial activity since the aberrant accumulation of iron is linked to a staggering cell death through ros production and physiological damage dixon and stockwell 2014 which was studied in section 3 4 1 3 3 2 shifts in intracellular free mg2 and oxytetracycline the level of mg2 and otc were further assayed since their intracellular availabilities are necessary to evoke tet args zhang et al 2014 and are confirmed to be relied on the iron transport system huang et al 2019 savigni and morgan 2003 as shown in fig s5 the average concentration of mg2 declined by 11 90 61 41 59 51 and 4 96 after treatment with 1 5 10 and 20 g l zvi respectively these results would mitigate arg conjugation in idna because of the crucial roles of mg2 in relaxation of supercoild plasmid dna pansegrau et al 1990 similar trend was observed for intracellular otc content with the greatest and least reduction of 75 94 and 14 54 for 5 and 20 g l zvi treatment the declined uptake of otc would mitigate the selective pressure and relieve the eliciting of tet arg in idna compared to 5 and 10 g l zvi the less impacts of 20 g l zvi on intracellular mg2 and otc might be due to the membranolysis caused by oxidative stress dixon and stockwell 2014 3 3 3 altered args and mges bacterial taxa distribution and association the response of microbial community composition to iron homeostasis was further characterized and shown in fig 5 the introduction of 5 10 and 20 g l zvi led to the dramatical p 0 05 decrease in bacterial species richness otu number and community diversity shannon index fig 5a in control proteobacteria bacteroidetes and patescibacteria were the three most dominant phylum with the corresponding relative abundance of 50 55 19 67 and 23 35 fig 5b with 1 5 and 10 g l zvi treatment abundances of proteobacteria and patescibacteria were significantly declined whereas bacteroidetes was prominently promoted by 34 13 94 84 and 95 86 in bioreactor amended by 20 g l zvi both proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were increased the similarity of bacterial community structure was determined by hierarchically clustered heat map analysis of the top 30 genera fig 5c the microbial compositions in control and sbr 1 displayed similarity which were much different from those in sbr 2 and sbr 3 notably the microbial community structure shaped by 20 g l zvi was separated from other zvi dosages the co occurrence of members of the bacterial community all of the examined args mges in idna and also fur was visualized by network analysis fig 5d established according to wei et al 2020 obviously 13 genera were identified as the potential hosts for args and mges in idna with cloacibacterium dechloromonas paludibacter and wchb1 32 being the most abundant fig s6 specifically cloacibacterium and dechloromonas that affiliated to bacteroidetes and showed less connection with args were significantly enriched by 1 5 and 10 g l zvi it is important to recognize that cloacibacterium and dechloromonas are greatly associated with denitrification and organic degradation carney et al 2019 che et al 2020 their increased abundance suggests the positive roles of zvi on wastewater purification xu et al 2017 you et al 2017 contrarily the relative abundances of paludibacter and wchb1 32 that significantly related with multiple resistance were measurably decreased it could be deduced that the declined abundance of paludibacter and wchb1 32 contributed to the alleviated vgt of args in fig 3 furthermore the correlations between fur with nine resistant genera especially for cloacibacterium and dechloromonas were obtained in fig 5d suggesting the potential roles of iron uptake system in mediating the microbial performances and thus reducing tet args proliferation in idna the effects of fur serving as regulators were further studied to reveal the mechanisms underlying the effects of intracellular iron homeostasis on args reduction 3 4 regulatory roles of fur in args attenuation 3 4 1 regulating effects of fur on antioxidant and sos system evidences indicated that the horizontal transfer of args in idna and edna among bacteria can be induced by triggered oxidative stress and protective sos response beaber et al 2004 lv et al 2014 at the end of the experiment the levels of oxidative stress were quite different among bioreactors in sbr 1 2 and 3 the level of tbars maintained at 98 65 106 91 and 113 43 of the control fig 6 a correspondingly taoc increased to 110 65 153 55 and 139 63 of the control the antioxidative activities of sod cat and gr shown in fig 6a were all higher than the control confirming the functions of fur like proteins in regulating iron assimilation with oxidative defense in evolutionarily unrelated bacteria lavrrar and mclntosh 2003 zheng et al 1999 considering the 20 g l zvi treatment tbars was significantly increased to 161 39 and taoc decreased to 76 15 of the control p 0 05 in line with the destroyed antioxidant enzymes system it has been demonstrated that although iron is essential for most of the bacteria liberated iron would in turn catalyze the generation of radicals dixon and stockwell 2014 seo et al 2014 as the inhibited bacteria proliferation in fig 3 and reduced physiological activity in fig 4 a certain level of dna damage caused by ros could induce the error prone sos response which catalyzes the synthesis of dna in vacant sites and stimulates the integration of args related elements by series of dna repairation enzymes beaber et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 thus the expression of sos regulated gene sula indicated by β galactosidase bernier et al 2013 was determined fig 6b to characterize the sos response the transcription of sula in zvi treatment groups was decreased negatively related to the changes of antioxidant capacity in fig 6a as such zvi introduction led to the down regulation of dna e and dna l which are involved in dna mismatch and re combinational repair mechanisms laloo et al 2018 the dna polymerase including dnapo i and dnapo ii decreased only with 5 and 20 g l zvi addition therefore the activation of fur by 1 5 and 10 g l zvi inhibited the integration of tet args in idna and edna to microbial genome via participating in oxidative defense and repressing sos response in contrast 20 g l zvi strengthened the oxidative stress damaged the physiological activity and posed less effects on tet args reduction 3 4 2 regulating effects of fur on efflux pump system given that efflux pumps dominated the resistance mechanisms fig 1 the regulating effects of fur on efflux pump system were further determined by examining the content of atp binding cassette transporter atp bc and abundance of outer membrane protein ompa ompc and ompf genes involved in resistance nodulation cell division rnd family saba et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 as fig s7 revealed in bioreactor with 5 and 10 g l zvi amendment the atp bc respectively decreased by 15 38 and 5 98 while ompa ompc ompf significantly decreased by 74 21 82 0 and 80 83 90 61 it could be deduced that the lacking of membrane porin channels played vital roles in mitigating the risk for tet args dissemination via hgt in comparison 20 g l zvi imposed more significant negative effects on atp bc and rnd family this result was contrary to the conclusion derived from 5 10 g l zvi treatment and the positive relationships between the expression levels of atp bc and rnd family with the abundance of args zhang et al 2017 3 4 3 regulating effects of fur on energy generation process the energy metabolism that provides driving force for dna uptake and synthesis was further explored under stimulated fur conditions cooper et al 2018 huang et al 2019 as fig s8 illustrates 5 10 and 20 g l zvi induced a notable dose dependent decline in atp by 35 41 57 95 and 67 86 in microbes which would hinder args transfer feeney et al 2016 a particular level of atp has been demonstrated to represent the switch between cell apoptosis and necrosis under oxidant stress lelli et al 1998 therefore it is possible that the reduced atp following treatment with 5 and 10 g l zvi was below and upon the threshold for apoptosis while 20 g l resulted in the necrosis the variations of cell viabilities in fig 3b and physiological activities in figs 4 and 6 caused by individual zvi dosage can thus be well accepted interestingly the intracellular content of cyt c and its cofactor heme c that cycles between the reduced fe2 and oxidized fe3 state to perform electron carrier was measurably increased by 5 and 10 g l zvi addition fig s9 indicating the promoted anaerobic metabolism ma et al 2019 next the degradation of glucose was further studied to expound this contradictory phenomenon in relation to decreased atp generation and enhanced anaerobic metabolism the emp and ppp are fundamental pathways of carbohydrate metabolism fig 7 a for emp yields nadh atp in the respiratory chain reactions shimizua and matsuoka 2019a and ppp generates the only nadph to provide reducing power for cell growth shimizua and matsuoka 2019b in the current study the key enzymes responsible for atp nadh and nadph generation were detected as revealed in fig 7b the activities of glgp gapdh and pk were measurably declined by 5 and 10 g l zvi which would decrease the production of nadh and atp in emp according to fig 7a with respect to ppp pathway the activities of g6pdh and 6pgdh that catalyzing nadph production were dramatically increased the ratio of nadh nadph fig s10 ranging from 2 51 in control to 1 18 and 1 03 in sbr 2 and sbr 3 also confirmed the inhibited emp and facilitated ppp pathway which together resulted in a decrease in cellular atp besides nadph is reported to be a reducing agent kirkman et al 1999 shimizua and matsuoka 2019a and ppp partially serves as a first line defense against oxidative damage lu 2013 as a consequence the activated fur system could comprehensively mitigate oxidative stress and args transfer in idna and edna via the metabolic flux toward ppp with the oversupply of nadph and shortage of driving force under 20 g l zvi treatment condition the five enzymes functioning in emp and two enzymes involved in ppp were significantly inhibited p 0 05 confirming the decreased performance of energy supply and oxidative defense 3 5 underlying mechanisms by which zvi reduce args abundance in bioreactor to reveal the regulatory effects of zvi on restraining args dissemination and minimize the confounding interactions among various causal factors pls pm analysis was conducted as shown in fig 8 zvi and antioxidant system can both directly and indirectly make negative influence on args dissemination while efflux pump mges atp content and sos response were positively linked with args in order of mges sos response efflux pump atp content crucially zvi had significantly negative effects on efflux pump mges and atp content additionally zvi could negatively influence sos response through inducing the antioxidant system due to the negative feedback beaber et al 2004 lv et al 2014 in this study the regulatory effects of fur contributed to tet args loss in anaerobes through activating antioxidant system and depressing sos response energy generation and efflux pump system fig 9 a briefly replete iron supply stimulated the intracellular iron homeostasis regulon of fur for maintaining protein functionality without inducing oxidative stress andrew et al 2003 thereafter the upregulated fe s assembly storage cofactors for iron utilization and downregulated genes encoding transporters for iron uptake fig 9b 1 respectively improved antioxidant capacity of bacteria and suppressed efflux pump system fig 9b 2 fig 9b 4 the increased antioxidant system further implied the suppressed sos response andersson and hughes 2014 lv et al 2014 which mediated horizontal transfer of args additionally the regulatory effects of fur transited the central metabolism from emp to ppp fig 9b 3 leading to the weakened energy driving force for hgt and promoted oxidative stress defense for reducing args propagation 4 conclusion the emergency and removal of tet args in anaerobic bioreactor were systemically detected with an emphasize on exploring the mechanisms of zvi powder on args attenuation the following conclusions can be delivered greater idna associated tet args were enriched in anaerobes with otc exposure and zvi with no more than 10 g l displayed favorable advantages for attenuating args in both idna and edna the reduced tet args dissemination was ascribed to the suppressed processes of plasmid mediated hgt and paludibacter wchb1 32 dominated vgt the aroused fur regulon regulated the physiology of microbes especially for cloacibacterium dechloromonas which led to the antioxidant system activation the efflux pump repression and the energy metabolism transition relieving the hgt and vgt of tet arg 20 g l zvi could not efficiently enhance the reduction of tet args targets due to failure of defensing against oxidative stress caused by excess of free iron to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the deregulation of iron homeostasis leading to protection against oxidative damage and regulation of args dissemination in anaerobic bioreactor was evaluated this study would shed light on the mechanisms of how zvi influence args propagation and the application of zvi in engineering practice declaration of competing interest the authors

17102,sodium silicate is thought to mitigate lead release via two mechanisms by increasing ph and by forming a protective silica film a pilot scale study using an excavated lead service line lsl fed with water from a great lakes source was undertaken to 1 clearly distinguish the ph effect and the silica effect 2 compare sodium silicate to orthophosphate and ph adjustment 3 determine the nature of silica accumulation in the pipe scale the lsl was cut into segments and acclimated with water at ph 7 1 median dissolved lead was 197 µg l in the last 8 weeks of acclimation and dropped to 16 µg l 54 µg l and 85 µg l following treatment with orthophosphate dose 2 6 mg po4 l ph 7 9 ph adjustment ph 7 9 and sodium silicate dose 20 mg sio2 l ph 7 9 respectively when silica dose was increased from 20

detected by field flow fractionation used with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry si was present in the scale at a maximum of 2 2 atomic after 17 weeks of silica dosing at 20 mg sio2 l under the conditions tested sodium silicate did not offer any benefits for reducing lead release from this lsl other than increasing ph however sodium silicate resulted in lower levels of biofilm

kim et al 2011 and addition of phosphate based corrosion inhibitors edwards and mcneill 2002 are the most commonly used corrosion control treatments for lead sodium silicates hereafter referred to as silicates are less commonly used usepa 2016 they increase the ph and are thought to form passivating films in the interior of the pipes that act as diffusion barriers schock 1989 stericker 1945 although silicate application for preventing corrosion in water systems was first proposed in the 1920s stericker 1938 published information to support the formation of silica film and its effectiveness in reducing lead release is scarce lehrman and shuldner 1952 investigated the silica film formation mechanisms via experiments on iron and brass pipes they showed that silica can form adsorption compounds with metal hydroxides and concluded that the silica film formation depends on the presence of corrosion products on the pipe however their experiments did not include lead pipes lintereur et al 2010 investigated whether formation of a pb ii silicate solid is thermodynamically favorable and reported that based on the available equilibrium constants there is no thermodynamic evidence of formation of pbsio3 s or pb2sio4 s over a wide range of ph and alkalinities to the author s knowledge there has been only one published study on silicate corrosion control in a real system schock et al 2005 reported successful replacement of polyphosphates with silicate for simultaneous corrosion control and iron and manganese sequestration in a small water system several pilot studies on silicate application have been conducted by macquarrie et al 1997 pinto et al 1997 lintereur et al 2010 and woszczynski et al 2015 however the only sources of lead in their studies were lead tin solder or lead tin coupons and they did not conduct any surface analysis to investigate whether a silica film had formed parallel to the current study two other pilot studies with lead pipes were conducted by mishrra et al 2021 and li et al 2021 mishrra et al 2021 tested harvested lsls with synthetic water simulating a great lakes water source whereas li et al 2021 tested new lead pipes fed with water from a treatment plant in halifax ns canada mishrra et al 2021 reported silica uptake by the scale of harvested lsls with aluminum rich corrosion scales however no crystalline lead silicate solids had formed in the lsls they conceptualized that the dissolved silica has either formed lead aluminum amorphous compounds or precipitated as amorphous silica li et al 2021 detected a few nanometer thick silicon rich layer on the surface of new lead pipes that were conditioned for 10 months and received silicate treatment for nearly 20 months understanding the two fold mechanism of silicate treatment has been attempted in previous studies macquarrie et al 1997 compared lead release at a fixed ph in the presence and absence of silicate and reported potential adverse effects by silica mishrra et al 2021 studied the silica effect in isolation from the ph effect by bringing down the water ph to its original value after sodium silicate addition under these conditions they observed a reduction in lead release and silica uptake by the scale in another experiment they allowed sodium silicate to increase the water ph and compared the lead release to that of pipe segments that experienced the same ph increase by sodium hydroxide addition they reported that the reduction in lead release by sodium silicate was not significantly different from that achieved by sodium hydroxide the role of silica dose on treatment effectiveness is another area that both previous and recent research has tackled pinto et al 1997 and schock et al 2005 reported lower lead release with an increase in silica dose however in their experiments the silica effect and the ph effect were confounded li et al 2021 increased the silica dose from 24 mg l to 48 mg l while maintaining a fixed ph and in contrast to the observations of previous studies reported significant increase in lead release following the increase in silica dose and attributed it to increased formation of colloidal iron and lead comparison of silicate to orthophosphate treatment is of special interest as silicate unlike orthophosphate is not known to cause challenges for the receiving wastewater treatment plants churchill et al 2000 additionally the increased phosphorus content due to application of orthophosphate inhibitors might impact bacterial regrowth and biofilm formation in the distribution systems cantor 2017 fang et al 2009 several studies have compared silicate performance to that of orthophosphate and were unanimous in the conclusion that orthophosphate is the more effective treatment kogo et al 2017 li et al 2021 macquarrie et al 1997 woszczynski et al 2015 herein a 68 week pilot scale study was undertaken with three main objectives 1 clearly distinguish the ph effect of silicate treatment from its silica effect 2 compare sodium silicates orthophosphate and ph adjustment effectiveness in reducing lead release from lsls 3 determine the nature of silica accumulation in the pipe scale an excavated lsl was used in the study as source of lead and the system was fed with treated water from a great lakes source this water source was intentionally selected as it makes the results applicable to great lakes drinking water utilities which serve millions of customers this study is complementary to the studies by mishrra et al 2021 and li et al 2021 in that mishrra et al 2021 compared sodium silicate to ph adjustment treatment using synthetic water and harvested lsls from a different location than this study whereas li et al 2021 compared sodium silicate to orthophosphate treatment using new lead pipes fed by real water of a different water quality than the one reported here all 3 studies were conducted concurrently to achieve the study objectives total and dissolved 0 45 µm lead were monitored to understand the impact of sodium silicate addition on colloidal lead formation in the dissolved fraction field flow fractionation fff coupled with inductively plasma mass spectrometry icp ms was used the effects of the different treatments on scale composition structure and biofilm accumulation were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale setup a 22 ft 6 7 m lsl 0 5 inch 1 3 cm internal diameter installed in 1903 was cautiously excavated section s1 1 by the city of london ontario canada the pilot study was conducted at the lake huron water treatment plant in grand bend on canada and was fed with finished water from this plant the lsl was cut at the excavation site into seven 3 ft 91 cm and three 4 in 10 cm segments the latter were used for scale characterization to include a galvanic connection with the objective of simulating real distribution system conditions each pipe was connected to a new no lead i e maximum lead content of 0 09 wt brass ball valve hays plumbing products via a new no lead brass compression fitting hays plumbing products all other connections used in the set up were made of plastic 2 2 study phases and design four different treatments were investigated 1 ph adjustment 2 orthophosphate 3 silicate a sio2 na2o wt ratio 3 2 1 and 4 silicate b sio2 na2o wt ratio 4 3 1 all treatments were studied using duplicate pipe segments hereafter referred to as pipe 1 and 2 except for silicate b which had only a single pipe due to the limited number of pipe segments available the experiment was 68 weeks long with a 42 week acclimation phase and two treatment phases i e phase 1 17 weeks i e operational weeks 43 59 phase 2 9 weeks i e operational weeks 60 68 this study was designed such that all the pipes experienced the same increase in ph upon start of treatment and experienced the same average ph throughout the treatment phase this enabled a comparison of the three treatments and also made it possible to distinguish the ph effects of sodium silicate from its silica effects to achieve this goal two feedwater sources from the full scale treatment plant with different ph levels were used the final treatment step at the full scale treatment plant was ph adjustment with sodium hydroxide the high ph feedwater source was the full scale plant finished water after sodium hydroxide addition which had an average ph of 7 95 0 31 this is the same water that fed the lsl when it was in service however the water that the lsl experienced when it was in service was fluoridated hydrofluorosilicic acid downstream of the treatment plant the low ph feedwater source was finished water from the full scale plant before sodium hydroxide addition this water had an average ph of 7 1 0 1 and was used in the acclimation phase of the study when starting treatment for the pipes dedicated to ph adjustment and orthophosphate addition feedwater was switched from the ph 7 1 water to the finished plant water after the full scale ph adjustment for the silicate treatment the ph 7 1 water was used and silicate was dosed such that the silicate treated water ph would match the ph of the full scale plant finished water after ph adjustment fig 1 a in treatment phase 2 there was an increase in the average ph level of the plant s finished water after ph adjustment compared to phase 1 i e average ph in phase 2 8 08 0 44 to maintain the same ph range for all the treatment conditions the silica dose was increased in phase 2 as discussed in section 2 4 1 approximate agreement between the ph of all pipes was achieved throughout the study figures s 4 a and b key water quality parameters for both full scale feedwaters are summarized in table 1 2 3 flow conditions the flow control chemical injection and mixing system information is provided in section s1 2 flow schedules and sampling flow rates up to week 28 of the acclimation phase are summarized in table s 1 starting from acclimation week 29 and for the remainder of the study the following flow conditions were implemented each pipe received 50 minutes of flow at a 2 5 l min flow rate flow velocity 0 33 m s followed by 310 minutes of stagnation four times a day such that the total volume of water that flowed through each pipe was 500 l day a flow schedule with four separate flow periods was selected to simulate water use in real households which consists of several flow periods for the weekly sampling 80 minutes of flow was followed by 15 hours of stagnation after which a first draw sample was collected at a 2 5 l min flow rate the 15 hour stagnation period was selected for the sampling days to ensure lead release had reached steady state before sampling the sample volume i e 110 ml was approximately equal to the pipe volume 2 4 chemical dosing 2 4 1 sodium silicate two different sodium silicate products national silicates etobicoke on canada were tested and are referred to in this study as silicate a sio2 na2o wt ratio 3 2 1 and silicate b sio2 na2o wt ratio 4 3 1 feed solution preparation details are provided in section s1 3 1 the target silica dose above background silica of on average 2 4 mg sio2 l was 20 mg sio2 l and 28 mg sio2 l in phase 1 corresponding to an average ph of 7 9 and 25 mg sio2 l and 38 mg sio2 l in phase 2 corresponding to an average ph of 8 1 for silicates a and b respectively 2 4 2 orthophosphate orthophosphate was dosed as a solution of trisodium orthophosphate sigma aldrich the average measured orthophosphate dose was 2 6 mg po4 l in treatment phases 1 and 2 as trisodium orthophosphate is a weak base the orthophosphate pipes received a slightly higher ph i e approximately 0 1 unit than the ph adjustment pipes fig s 4a feed solution preparation details are provided in

used for scale analysis at the mid stages of the study the first short segment hereafter referred to as the acclimation pipe was removed for scale analysis at the end of the acclimation phase the other two segments hereafter referred to as the phase 1 pipes were placed in line with the silicate a 1 and b pipes respectively and were removed for scale analysis at the end of phase 1 i e before the increase in silica dose at the end of the study scale analysis was conducted on all seven long pipes hereafter referred to as the phase 2 pipes the scale analysis was conducted at washington university st louis mo usa and involved the examination of cross sections and transverse sections of the pipe the cross section of the acclimation and phase 1 pipes were imaged using thermofisher quattro s e scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds with the sem was used to semi quantitatively determine the elemental composition of the pipe scales for all the pipes ground up scale from the transverse sections of the pipes were analyzed by x ray powder diffraction xrd on a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu ka radiation and by icp ms perkinelmer elan drcii for elemental composition analysis more details are provided in section s1 5 2 8 field flow fractionation analysis the fff method coupled with icp ms is described in trueman et al 2019 and was conducted at dalhousie university for one sampling event during treatment phase 2 i e treatment week 25 samples from both silicate a pipes were analyzed however for the ph adjustment and orthophosphate treatments only samples from their pipe 1 were analyzed silicate b was not included in this analysis samples were collected after 15 hours of stagnation and were filtered as described

acclimation the pipes were acclimated to reach lead release stability which was assessed based on the slope of total pbtotal and dissolved pbdiss lead data fig s 2 detailed discussion of the acclimation phase data is provided in section s2 1 for six out of the seven pipe segments the median pbdiss over the last 8 acclimation weeks ranged from 181 to 248 µg l which is in good agreement with solubility modeling predictions i e dominant phase cerussite pbco3 with an equilibrium solubility of 254 µg l and 102 µg l based on the thermodynamic datasets available in schock et al 1996 and giammar et al 2010 respectively lead data comparability was assessed by conducting a paired t test between all pair configurations of the pipes pipe allocation for the treatment phase was done such that comparisons between silicate a and ph adjustment and also between silicate a and orthophosphate could be achieved by pairwise comparisons of pipes that had no statistically significant difference i e p 0 05 in their acclimation phase baselines table s 7 and s 8 for comparison between the remaining treatment conditions reduction in the median of the acclimation and treatment phases was used as a comparison tool that takes into account the effect of the differences in the pipe baselines there was one pipe with a baseline approximately 50 less than the average of the other pipes the treatment allocated to this pipe was silicate b 3 2 ph adjustment treatment after the switch to the ph adjusted water pbdiss dropped sharply from its acclimation phase baseline i e median pbdiss of 229 µg l and 248 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively and exhibited an overall gradually decreasing trend for 10 weeks with median pbdiss of 48 µg l and 56 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively fig 2 c this was expected based on solubility modeling which predicted a change in the dominant phase from cerussite to hydrocerussite pb3 oh 2 co3 2 which has an equilibrium solubility of 41 µg l at the average ph i e 7 96 and dic i e 20 7 mg l the pipes experienced in phase 1 based on the thermodynamic dataset in giammar et al 2010 after week 10 and for the remainder of the study pbdiss had an overall increasing trend the pbdiss upward trend coincided with the period in which water temperature gradually decreased from 23 c to 9 c during the last 4 treatment weeks when the average temperature was 9 4 c average pbdiss was 87 µg l and 75 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively a strong negative correlation was observed between pbdiss and water temperature fig s 5 this is in contrast to the findings of previous studies which reported that higher temperatures promote higher lead release kim et al 2011 masters et al 2016 additionally temperature and residual aluminum had a positive correlation fig s 3 and hence their effect on lead release was confounded overall the negative correlation observed between lead release and temperature cannot be explained conclusively since it would be difficult here to distinguish between random auto correlated noise the influence of other uncontrolled factors and a true temperature effect in treatment phase 2 i e treatment week 17 there was a slight shift in average ph i e 0 13 units compared to phase 1 due to changes in plant operations solubility predictions indicated a 4 µg l decrease in the equilibrium solubility of hydrocerussite due to this ph change however the measured values had an increasing trend as discussed above particulate lead pbpart also dropped sharply after the switch to the ph adjusted water however despite some fluctuations it did not follow an overall decreasing or increasing trend median treatment phase pbpart was 7 µg l and 6 µg l for the pipes 1 and 2 respectively except for a few scale dislodging events when the peaks in pbtotal were attributed to pbpart similar to the acclimation phase pbpart only accounted for a small percentage of pbtotal i e median pbpart fraction was 12 and 9 for pipes 1 and 2 respectively table s 9 3 3 sodium silicate treatment after one week of dosing silicate a at 20 mg sio2 l which coincided with a change in average ph from 7 1 to 7 9 a considerable reduction in pbdiss was observed compared to its acclimation phase baseline i e median pbdiss of 229 µg l and 184 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively during treatment at ph 7 9 pbdiss remained relatively stable for seven weeks in both pipes at median concentrations of 84 µg l and 86 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively fig 2c from treatment week 8 onwards pbdiss started to diverge for the two pipes however in the last three weeks of phase 1 both pipes had similar pbdiss values average was 82 µg l and 79 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively upon the increase of silica by approximately 5 mg sio2 l in treatment phase 2 i e treatment week 18 onwards which corresponded to a change in average ph from 7 9 to 8 1 pbdiss increased and fluctuated considerably in both pipes in phase 2 median pbdiss was 121 µg l and 146 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively the increase in pbdiss was an unexpected outcome and is further discussed in section 3 3 1 both silicate a pipes experienced a severe scale dislodging event at the early treatment stages pipe 1 week 2 pipe 2 week 3 excluding those events and several spikes throughout the study pbpart was relatively stable at median concentrations of 8 µg l and 9 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively pbpart was overall lower than in the acclimation phase but did not show any trends and was not affected by the increase in silica dose in phase 2 table s 9 silicate b lead results are shown in fig s 6 and table 2 for this product the silica dose was 28 mg sio2 l in phase 1 and 38 mg sio2 l in phase 2 as previously discussed the pipe allocated to this treatment had a lower lead release baseline compared to the other pipes during acclimation however its phase 1 median pbdiss i e 176 µg l was the highest of all treatment conditions since upon starting treatment its lead release increased and fluctuated considerably this is in line with the observations for silicate a at a silica dose of 25 mg sio2 l increasing the silica dose for silicate b did not change this trend considerably 3 3 1 ph effect vs the silica effect to distinguish between the ph effect and the silica effect of sodium silicate treatment lead release of the silicate a pipes was compared to that of the ph adjustment pipes that were operating at the same ph as the silicate a pipes statistically significant differences p 0 05 were observed between the pbdiss data of silicate a and ph adjustment pipes in both treatment phases when comparing the pipes with no statistically significant difference in their acclimation phase pbdiss baselines i e silicate a 1 and ph adjustment 2 the silicate a 1 pipe had a 20 µg l and 66 µg l higher median pbdiss compared to the ph adjustment 2 pipe in phase 1 and 2 respectively for the other pipe pairs the reduction in pbdiss median in the treatment phases compared to the acclimation phase was used as a comparison tool the silicate a treatment resulted on average in 57 and 32 reduction in pbdiss while the ph adjustment treatment resulted on average in 77 and 64 reduction in phase 1 and 2 respectively table 2 similar to the ph adjustment pipes a negative correlation between pbdiss and temperature was observed for the silicate pipes since phase 2 coincided with the colder months the effect of the increase in silica dose is confounded with the potential effect of the lower temperatures on lead release however by comparing the phase 2 results of silicate a to that of ph adjustment fig 2 it is evident that the destabilization only occurred in the silicate a pipes additionally the increase of pbdiss in treatment phase 2 was much more considerable in the silicate a pipes table 2 this highlights the fact that the higher silicate dose exacerbated dissolved lead release this is in line with observations of li et al 2021 the potential mechanism responsible at least in part for the elevated pbdiss is discussed in section 3 5 3 4 orthophosphate in combination with ph adjustment pbdiss for both pipes that received the orthophosphate treatment in combination with ph adjustment decreased significantly and stabilized after two weeks of treatment to a median concentration of 16 µg l and 17 µg l in phases 1 and 2 respectively solubility modeling predicted formation of hydroxylpyromorphite pb5 po4 3oh with an equilibrium solubility of 13 5 µg l at the average ph i e 7 95 experienced in phase 1 and 14 µg l at the average ph i e 8 08 experienced in phase 2 based on the thermodynamic dataset in giammar et al 2010 which have a remarkably good agreement with the actual measured values compared to pbdiss the drop in pbpart was delayed by one week and was followed by a severe scale dislodging event and major spikes in pbpart i e 290 µg l and 450 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively several other less major pbpart spikes i e in the range of 30 50 µg l were also recorded in the following weeks the last pbpart spikes were recorded on treatment weeks 8 and 19 for pipes 1 and 2 respectively the persistence of occasional high pbpart several months after start of the orthophosphate treatment is consistent with the observations of previous studies welter et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 excluding the spikes pbpart was stable at a median concentration of 2 µg l and 5 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively table s 9 the orthophosphate treated pipes were not affected by seasonal temperature changes which is consistent with findings of masters et al 2016 3 5 formation of colloidal dispersions fff coupled with icp ms was conducted on a select number of phase 2 samples from treatment week 25 a high molecular weight 1000 kda peak representing colloids was observed in the fractograms fig 3 of stagnated water samples collected from both silicate a pipes the colloids contained lead and aluminum rich phases with trace amounts of iron copper zinc and manganese the source of these metals is further discussed in section 3 7 this is consistent with the known dispersive properties of silicate in other applications such as dispersion and flotation of carbonate bearing iron ore hao et al 2018 a uv254 signal also accompanied the colloidal peak it may be attributed to light scattering absorbance by aromatic organic matter in this size fraction or both based on the fff data the observed increase in pbdiss following the increase in the silicate a dose was potentially at least in part due to the formation of colloids containing lead this is in line with observations of li et al 2021 who reported formation of colloidal iron and lead at a silica dose of 48 mg sio2 l in a system containing unlined cast iron pipes followed by new lead pipes colloids containing lead likely formed in the silicate b treated water as well this could be a potential explanation for the observed increase in pbdiss during silicate b treatment at the dose of 28 mg sio2 l however fff analysis results are not available for silicate b to support this hypothesis 3 6 scale characterization the acclimation phase pipe scale had a thickness of about 30 to 50 µm with only one visible layer in the sem image fig s 7b and its surface coverage with particular corrosion products was not uniform section s2 2 overall the acclimation pipe scale did not accurately represent the pre treatment scale condition of the other pipes since scale analysis on the two phase 1 pipes that received silicate a and b respectively identified a thicker i e 80 150 µm two layer scale which did not form during the treatment phase further discussed in section 3 6 1 scale analysis on the phase 2 pipes at the end of the study confirmed the presence of a two layer scale in all seven pipes a dark brown layer on top and a thin white layer at the bottom fig s 9 at this stage the top layer easily flaked off however its degree of adherence to the bottom layer seemed to be affected by the treatment it had received which is further discussed in the following sections xrd analysis was conducted on both layers table s 12 which showed similar patterns for all pipes the upper scale layer xrd peaks listed in the order of highest to lowest peak intensity were plattnerite cerussite and hydrocerussite plattnerite has been reported to be present in other service lines that were excavated from the city of london kim and herrera 2010 the lower layer was composed mainly of hydrocerussite and elemental lead in addition to other minor phases differences in elemental composition as measured by icp ms were observed between the pipes and at the different study phases which are discussed in section 3 7 3 6 1 silica accumulation in the pipe scale the phase 1 pipes that received silicate a and b respectively were taken out to assess whether a silica film had started forming after 17 weeks of treatment based on the semi quantitative eds analysis si was detectable in both pipes at a maximum of 2 2 atomic percentage as shown in the sem images silicate a fig 4 b silicate b fig s 8b the scales had two distinct layers as indicated by eds si was equally abundant in the upper and lower scale layers of silicate a pipe but was more abundant in the upper scale layer than the lower layer of silicate b pipe additionally both pipes had scales that included al and mn sources of which are discussed in section 3 7 as indicated by elemental mapping silicate a fig 4a and silicate b fig s 8a si and al accumulated in the same scale regions for phase 2 pipes only xrd and icp ms analysis was conducted and no sem and eds results are available the top dark brown scale layer was mainly composed of plattnerite this easily flaked off and a thin white layer was discovered underneath fig 4d and fig s8d which was mainly composed of hydrocerussite a crystalline phase containing si was not detected by xrd in either phase 1 or phase 2 pipes fig s 10 3 6 2 effect of orthophosphate treatment on scale compared to the scale of the other treatment conditions the lower scale layer of the pipes that received the orthophosphate treatment was not as even in appearance the upper layer had a stronger adherence to the lower level and remained adhered to it even after being cut into transverse sections fig s 9 the xrd patterns do not provide definitive evidence that the orthophosphate inhibitory effect on lead release was due to formation of low solubility lead phosphate solids such as hydroxylpyromorphite pb5 po4 3oh only a very low intensity peak at 22 4 degrees in the xrd patterns of the lower layer scale fig s 10 could potentially correspond to hydroxylpyromorphite however due to its low intensity it cannot be identified with certainty it may be that 26 weeks of treatment with orthophosphate was not sufficient to develop enough hydroxylpyromorphite to be detectable by xrd but there are also other cases in which pipe scales receiving orthophosphate treated water have not had the expected lead phosphate solids tully et al 2019 even for systems for which lead phosphates solids are not clearly observed to have formed orthophosphate addition has been hypothesized to still have a benefit in lowering lead release by accumulating in the pipe scales as amorphous solids that act as barriers to diffusion of lead from lead rich lower scale layers to the water tully et al 2019 wasserstrom et al 2017 3 7 accumulation and mobilization of trace metals the effect of the different treatments on the accumulation of trace metals in the scale and or their mobilization from the scale were assessed by combining the results of the scale elemental analysis and the one time fff analysis the fff results suggest that aluminum affected lead release in the silicate a treated pipes considerable amounts of aluminum were only present in the high molecular weight 1000 kda colloidal dispersions of the silicate a treated samples fig 3 since fff results are semi quantitative samples from week 25 were also analyzed by icp ms to determine their total aluminum concentration and overall the results of the two analyses were in agreement table s 10 icp ms indicated that the aluminum concentration in samples collected from the silicate a pipes were almost double that of the other pipes although the residual aluminum concentration before stagnation was not known for these samples a comparison of aluminum concentrations in the stagnated samples i e 0 1 mg l to the plant s average data indicates that the source of aluminum in the silicate treated samples was not just the residual from the coagulation treatment but that aluminum was also mobilized from the scale this phenomenon is consistent with the scale analysis results the phase 2 segments had a low aluminum weight percentage i e 1 wt in their scale table s 11 which is lower than what was reported by a previous study conducted on 11 lsls excavated in the city of london the aluminum content was reported to be 1 4 wt and was attributed to the presence of an amorphous aluminosilicate phase formed by the combination of the naturally occurring background silica in the source water and the residual dissolved al from the coagulation process kim and herrera 2010 the low percentage of aluminum in the phase 2 pipes compared to that in the previous study on city of london lsls could be an indication of aluminum dissolution from the scale over the last decade this is consistent with kim et al 2011 who reported a positive correlation between ph and aluminum dissolution from scale when the water ph at the city of london was gradually increased from 7 1 to 8 3 in 2008 unlike the phase 2 pipes the aluminum weight percentages detected in the silicate a and b phase 1 pipes were substantial i e 5 12 this was a surprising outcome since in the scale of the silicate a and b phase 2 pipes aluminum was below 0 2 wt one explanation could be that the lower silicate dose that the phase 1 pipes received promoted aluminum accumulation in the scale potentially by forming aluminosilicate this hypothesis is supported by the elemental mappings shown in fig 4a and fig s 8a which shows that aluminum and silicon are present in the same scale regions of the phase 1 pipes increasing the silicate dose in phase 2 potentially reversed that process by promoting formation of colloids containing si and al as detected by fff accumulation and mobilization of manganese copper and zinc that were detected in trace amounts by fff in the colloidal dispersions are discussed in section s 2 3 future research should focus on determining the threshold silica dose that results in formation of colloidal dispersions and the effect of water quality on this threshold silica interactions with residual alum and trace metals especially those that have accumulated in corrosion scales in distribution systems and premise plumbing should be studied 3 8 biofilm accumulation impact of the corrosion treatments on biofilm accumulation was assessed via hpc measurement fig 5 at the end of phase 2 during set up breakdown both silicate a and b pipes had lower amounts of biofilm accumulation silicate a 2 88 and 2 62 log cfu cm2 silicate b 3 55 log cfu cm2 when compared to those found in the pipes dosed with orthophosphate log cfu cm2 values 4 13 and 4 25 which had the highest viable biomass overall biofilm accumulation for the ph adjustment pipes 1 and 2 3 12 and 3 99 log cfu cm2 fell in between the silicate a and orthophosphate results albeit showing higher variability between the 2 pipe segments than the other treatments in drinking water distribution systems phosphorus has been shown to impact microbial growth as it is often found limiting sathasivan ohgaki 1999 however there are a number of other aspects to be considered in biofilm formation including those which affect initial adherence to wall material lehtola et al 2002 to gain further insight into biofilm community response community profiling was also examined for biofilm collected for each treatment which is discussed in section s2 4 understanding more detailed dynamics of biofilm formation from study onset would require more extensive sampling 4 conclusions in this study sodium silicates orthophosphate and ph adjustment effects on lead release were compared under the same ph conditions for the conditions tested the following conclusions can be drawn 1 at the same ph silicate a treatment at 20 mg sio2 l was less effective in reducing lead release compared to ph adjustment 2 increasing the silica dose to 25 mg sio2 l caused lead release to increase and destabilize potentially due at least in part to formation of colloidal dispersions composed of lead and aluminum rich phases with trace amounts of other metals 3 although scale analysis showed signs of incorporation of si in the pipe scale comparison of lead results of the silicate pipes to the ph adjustment pipes indicated that under the conditions tested silicate treatment did not offer any benefits other than increasing ph in our experiments the beneficial ph effects of silicate treatment were counteracted when the silica dose was increased and it seemed that instead of formation of a passivating film silica promoted mobilization of lead aluminum and manganese from the pipe scale 4 orthophosphate in combination with ph adjustment was the most effective treatment resulting in a low and stable lead release after only two weeks of treatment however the orthophosphate treatment resulted in higher levels of viable biofilm accumulation on the pipe walls compared to the silicate treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17102,sodium silicate is thought to mitigate lead release via two mechanisms by increasing ph and by forming a protective silica film a pilot scale study using an excavated lead service line lsl fed with water from a great lakes source was undertaken to 1 clearly distinguish the ph effect and the silica effect 2 compare sodium silicate to orthophosphate and ph adjustment 3 determine the nature of silica accumulation in the pipe scale the lsl was cut into segments and acclimated with water at ph 7 1 median dissolved lead was 197 µg l in the last 8 weeks of acclimation and dropped to 16 µg l 54 µg l and 85 µg l following treatment with orthophosphate dose 2 6 mg po4 l ph 7 9 ph adjustment ph 7 9 and sodium silicate dose 20 mg sio2 l ph 7 9 respectively when silica dose was increased from 20

detected by field flow fractionation used with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry si was present in the scale at a maximum of 2 2 atomic after 17 weeks of silica dosing at 20 mg sio2 l under

kim et al 2011 and addition of phosphate based corrosion inhibitors edwards and mcneill 2002 are the most commonly used corrosion control treatments for lead sodium silicates hereafter referred to as silicates are less commonly used usepa 2016 they increase the ph and are thought to form passivating films in the interior of the pipes that act as diffusion barriers schock 1989 stericker 1945 although silicate application for preventing corrosion in water systems was first proposed in the 1920s stericker 1938 published information to support the formation of silica film and its effectiveness in reducing lead release is scarce lehrman and shuldner 1952 investigated the silica film formation mechanisms via experiments on iron and brass pipes they showed that silica can form adsorption compounds with metal hydroxides and concluded that the silica film formation depends on the presence of corrosion products on the pipe however their experiments did not include lead pipes lintereur et al 2010 investigated whether formation of a pb ii silicate solid is thermodynamically favorable and reported that based on the available equilibrium constants there is no thermodynamic evidence of formation of pbsio3 s or pb2sio4 s over a wide range of ph and alkalinities to the author s knowledge there has been only one published study on silicate corrosion control in a real system schock et al 2005 reported successful replacement of polyphosphates with silicate for simultaneous corrosion control and iron and manganese sequestration in a small water system several pilot studies on silicate application have been conducted by macquarrie et al 1997 pinto et al 1997 lintereur et al 2010 and woszczynski et al 2015 however the only sources of lead in their studies were lead tin solder or lead tin coupons and they did not conduct any surface analysis to investigate whether a silica film had formed parallel to the current study two other pilot studies with lead pipes were conducted by mishrra et al 2021 and li et al 2021 mishrra et al 2021 tested harvested lsls with synthetic water simulating a great lakes water source whereas li et al 2021 tested new lead pipes fed with water from a treatment plant in halifax ns canada mishrra et al 2021 reported silica uptake by the scale of harvested lsls with aluminum rich corrosion scales however no crystalline lead silicate solids had formed in the lsls they conceptualized that the dissolved silica has either formed lead aluminum amorphous compounds or precipitated as amorphous silica li et al 2021 detected a few nanometer thick silicon rich layer on the surface of new lead pipes that were conditioned for 10 months and received silicate treatment for nearly 20 months understanding the two fold mechanism of silicate treatment has been attempted in previous studies macquarrie et al 1997 compared lead release at a fixed ph in the presence and absence of silicate and reported potential adverse effects by silica mishrra et al 2021 studied the silica effect in isolation from the ph effect by bringing down the water ph to its original value after sodium silicate addition under these conditions they observed a reduction in lead release and silica uptake by the scale in another experiment they allowed sodium silicate to increase the water ph and compared the lead release to that of pipe segments that experienced the same ph increase by sodium hydroxide addition they reported that the reduction in lead release by sodium silicate was not significantly different from that achieved by sodium hydroxide the role of silica dose on treatment effectiveness is another area that both previous and recent research has tackled pinto et al 1997 and schock et al 2005 reported lower lead release with an increase in silica dose however in their experiments the silica effect and the ph effect were confounded li et al 2021 increased the silica dose from 24 mg l to 48 mg l while maintaining a fixed ph and in contrast to the observations of previous studies reported significant increase in lead release following the increase in silica dose and attributed it to increased formation of colloidal iron and lead comparison of silicate to orthophosphate treatment is of special interest as silicate unlike orthophosphate is not known to cause challenges for the receiving wastewater treatment plants churchill et al 2000 additionally the increased phosphorus content due to application of orthophosphate inhibitors might impact bacterial regrowth and biofilm formation in the distribution systems cantor 2017 fang et al 2009 several studies have compared silicate performance to that of orthophosphate and were unanimous in the conclusion that orthophosphate is the more effective treatment kogo et al 2017 li et al 2021 macquarrie et al 1997 woszczynski et al 2015 herein a 68 week pilot scale study was undertaken with three main objectives 1 clearly distinguish the ph effect of silicate treatment from its silica effect 2 compare sodium silicates orthophosphate and ph adjustment effectiveness in reducing lead release from lsls 3 determine the nature of silica accumulation in the pipe scale an excavated lsl was used in the study as source of lead and the system was fed with treated water from a great lakes source this water source was intentionally selected as it makes the results applicable to great lakes drinking water utilities which serve millions of customers this study is complementary to the studies by mishrra et al 2021 and li et al 2021 in that mishrra et al 2021 compared sodium silicate to ph adjustment treatment using synthetic water and harvested lsls from a different location than this study whereas li et al 2021 compared sodium silicate to orthophosphate treatment using new lead pipes fed by real water of a different water quality than the one reported here all 3 studies were conducted concurrently to achieve the study objectives total and dissolved 0 45 µm lead were monitored to understand the impact of sodium silicate addition on colloidal lead formation in the dissolved fraction field flow fractionation fff coupled with inductively plasma mass spectrometry icp ms was used the effects of the different treatments on scale composition structure and biofilm accumulation were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale setup a 22 ft 6 7 m lsl 0 5 inch 1 3 cm internal diameter installed in 1903 was cautiously excavated section s1 1 by the city of london ontario canada the pilot study was conducted at the lake huron water treatment plant in grand bend on canada and was fed with finished water from this plant the lsl was cut at the excavation site into seven 3 ft 91 cm and three 4 in 10 cm segments the latter were used for scale characterization to include a galvanic connection with the objective of simulating real distribution system conditions each pipe was connected to a new no lead i e maximum lead content of 0 09 wt brass ball valve hays plumbing products via a new no lead brass compression fitting hays plumbing products all other connections used in the set up were made of plastic 2 2 study phases and design four different treatments were investigated 1 ph adjustment 2 orthophosphate 3 silicate a sio2 na2o wt ratio 3 2 1 and 4 silicate b sio2 na2o wt ratio 4 3 1 all treatments were studied using duplicate pipe segments hereafter referred to as pipe 1 and 2 except for silicate b which had only a single pipe due to the limited number of pipe segments available the experiment was 68 weeks long with a 42 week acclimation phase and two treatment phases i e phase 1 17 weeks i e operational weeks 43 59 phase 2 9 weeks i e operational weeks 60 68 this study was designed such that all the pipes experienced the same increase in ph upon start of treatment and experienced the same average ph throughout the treatment phase this enabled a comparison of the three treatments and also made it possible to distinguish the ph effects of sodium silicate from its silica effects to achieve this goal two feedwater sources from the full scale treatment plant with different ph levels were used the final treatment step at the full scale treatment plant was ph adjustment with sodium hydroxide the high ph feedwater source was the full scale plant finished water after sodium hydroxide addition which had an average ph of 7 95 0 31 this is the same water that fed the lsl when it was in service however the water that the lsl experienced when it was in service was fluoridated hydrofluorosilicic acid downstream of the treatment plant the low ph feedwater source was finished water from the full scale plant before sodium hydroxide addition this water had an average ph of 7 1 0 1 and was used in the acclimation phase of the study when starting treatment for the pipes dedicated to ph adjustment and orthophosphate addition feedwater was switched from the ph 7 1 water to the finished plant water after the full scale ph adjustment for the silicate treatment the ph 7 1 water was used and silicate was dosed such that the silicate treated water ph would match the ph of the full scale plant finished water after ph adjustment fig 1 a in treatment phase 2 there was an increase in the average ph level of the plant s finished water after ph adjustment compared to phase 1 i e average ph in phase 2 8 08 0 44 to maintain the same ph range for all the treatment conditions the silica dose was increased in phase 2 as discussed in section 2 4 1 approximate agreement between the ph of all pipes was achieved throughout the study figures s 4 a and b key water quality parameters for both full scale feedwaters are summarized in table 1 2 3 flow conditions the flow control chemical injection and mixing system information is provided in section s1 2 flow schedules and sampling flow rates up to week 28 of the acclimation phase are summarized in table s 1 starting from acclimation week 29 and for the remainder of the study the following flow conditions were implemented each pipe received 50 minutes of flow at a 2 5 l min flow rate flow velocity 0 33 m s followed by 310 minutes of stagnation four times a day such that the total volume of water that flowed through each pipe was 500 l day a flow schedule with four separate flow periods was selected to simulate water use in real households which consists of several flow periods for the weekly sampling 80 minutes of flow was followed by 15 hours of stagnation after which a first draw sample was collected at a 2 5 l min flow rate the 15 hour stagnation period was selected for the sampling days to ensure lead release had reached steady state before sampling the sample volume i e 110 ml was approximately equal to the pipe volume 2 4 chemical dosing 2 4 1 sodium silicate two different sodium silicate products national silicates etobicoke on canada were tested and are referred to in this study as silicate a sio2 na2o wt ratio 3 2 1 and silicate b sio2 na2o wt ratio 4 3 1 feed solution preparation details are provided in section s1 3 1 the target silica dose above background silica of on average 2 4 mg sio2 l was 20 mg sio2 l and 28 mg sio2 l in phase 1 corresponding to an average ph of 7 9 and 25 mg sio2 l and 38 mg sio2 l in phase 2 corresponding to an average ph of 8 1 for silicates a and b respectively 2 4 2 orthophosphate orthophosphate was dosed as a solution of trisodium orthophosphate sigma aldrich the average measured orthophosphate dose was 2 6 mg po4 l in treatment phases 1 and 2 as trisodium orthophosphate is a weak base the orthophosphate pipes received a slightly higher ph i e approximately 0 1 unit than the ph adjustment pipes fig s 4a feed solution preparation details are provided in

of the solubility predictions based on the three thermodynamic datasets under the experimental conditions is provided in table s 3 2 7 scale analysis three removable short i e 10 cm pipe segments were used for scale analysis at the mid stages of the study the first short segment hereafter referred to as the acclimation pipe was removed for scale analysis at the end of the acclimation phase the other two segments hereafter referred to as the phase 1 pipes were placed in line with the silicate a 1 and b pipes respectively and were removed for scale analysis at the end of phase 1 i e before the increase in silica dose at the end of the study scale analysis was conducted on all seven long pipes hereafter referred to as the phase 2 pipes the scale analysis was conducted at washington university st louis mo usa and involved the examination of cross sections and transverse sections of the pipe the cross section of the acclimation and phase 1 pipes were imaged using thermofisher quattro s e scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds with the sem was used to semi quantitatively determine the elemental composition of the pipe scales for all the pipes ground up scale from the transverse sections of the pipes were analyzed by x ray powder diffraction xrd on a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu ka radiation and by icp ms perkinelmer elan drcii for elemental composition analysis more details are provided in section s1 5 2 8 field flow fractionation analysis the fff method coupled with icp ms is described in trueman et al 2019 and was conducted at dalhousie university for one sampling event during treatment phase 2 i e treatment week 25 samples from both silicate a pipes were analyzed however for the ph adjustment and orthophosphate treatments only samples from their pipe 1 were analyzed silicate b was not included in this analysis samples were collected after 15 hours of stagnation and were filtered as described in section 2 5 and were kept cold until analyzed information about the fff system calibration and the peak integration method used to estimate the semi quantitative concentrations for each fraction is provided in section s1 6 2 9 biofilm analysis at the end of the study swab samples of biofilm material were taken from the final three inches of each pipe to conduct microbial analysis cotton swabs pre moistened in sterile saline solution 0 9 were used and stored in 250 ml glass bottles containing sterile saline solution for transport back to the laboratory to resuspend cells from the swabs the glass bottles were sonicated bransonic ultrasonic cleaner model 5210 for 2 minutes at 47 khz at 20 c gagnon and slawson 1999 serial dilutions were prepared and plated onto reasoner s 2a r2a agar and heterotrophic plate counts hpcs were enumerated following standard method 9215 rice et al 2012 to generate a functional community profile biolog ecoplates biolog ecoplate model 1506 biolog were inoculated following procedures outlined by clairmont slawson 2020 metabolic potential index mpi and metabolic diversity and richness indices were generated section s1 7 3 results and discussion 3 1 acclimation the pipes were acclimated to reach lead release stability which was assessed based on the slope of total pbtotal and dissolved pbdiss lead data fig s 2 detailed discussion of the acclimation phase data is provided in section s2 1 for six out of the seven pipe segments the median pbdiss over the last 8 acclimation weeks ranged from 181 to 248 µg l which is in good agreement with solubility modeling predictions i e dominant phase cerussite pbco3 with an equilibrium solubility of 254 µg l and 102 µg l based on the thermodynamic datasets available in schock et al 1996 and giammar et al 2010 respectively lead data comparability was assessed by conducting a paired t test between all pair configurations of the pipes pipe allocation for the treatment phase was done such that comparisons between silicate a and ph adjustment and also between silicate a and orthophosphate could be achieved by pairwise comparisons of pipes that had no statistically significant difference i e p 0 05 in their acclimation phase baselines table s 7 and s 8 for comparison between the remaining treatment conditions reduction in the median of the acclimation and treatment phases was used as a comparison tool that takes into account the effect of the differences in the pipe baselines there was one pipe with a baseline approximately 50 less than the average of the other pipes the treatment allocated to this pipe was silicate b 3 2 ph adjustment treatment after the switch to the ph adjusted water pbdiss dropped sharply from its acclimation phase baseline i e median pbdiss of 229 µg l and 248 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively and exhibited an overall gradually decreasing trend for 10 weeks with median pbdiss of 48 µg l and 56 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively fig 2 c this was expected based on solubility modeling which predicted a change in the dominant phase from cerussite to hydrocerussite pb3 oh 2 co3 2 which has an equilibrium solubility of 41 µg l at the average ph i e 7 96 and dic i e 20 7 mg l the pipes experienced in phase 1 based on the thermodynamic dataset in giammar et al 2010 after week 10 and for the remainder of the study pbdiss had an overall increasing trend the pbdiss upward trend coincided with the period in which water temperature gradually decreased from 23 c to 9 c during the last 4 treatment weeks when the average temperature was 9 4 c average pbdiss was 87 µg l and 75 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively a strong negative correlation was observed between pbdiss and water temperature fig s 5 this is in contrast to the findings of previous studies which reported that higher temperatures promote higher lead release kim et al 2011 masters et al 2016 additionally temperature and residual aluminum had a positive correlation fig s 3 and hence their effect on lead release was confounded overall the negative correlation observed between lead release and temperature cannot be explained conclusively since it would be difficult here to distinguish between random auto correlated noise the influence of other uncontrolled factors and a true temperature effect in treatment phase 2 i e treatment week 17 there was a slight shift in average ph i e 0 13 units compared to phase 1 due to changes in plant operations solubility predictions indicated a 4 µg l decrease in the equilibrium solubility of hydrocerussite due to this ph change however the measured values had an increasing trend as discussed above particulate lead pbpart also dropped sharply after the switch to the ph adjusted water however despite some fluctuations it did not follow an overall decreasing or increasing trend median treatment phase pbpart was 7 µg l and 6 µg l for the pipes 1 and 2 respectively except for a few scale dislodging events when the peaks in pbtotal were attributed to pbpart similar to the acclimation phase pbpart only accounted for a small percentage of pbtotal i e median pbpart fraction was 12 and 9 for pipes 1 and 2 respectively table s 9 3 3 sodium silicate treatment after one week of dosing silicate a at 20 mg sio2 l which coincided with a change in average ph from 7 1 to 7 9 a considerable reduction in pbdiss was observed compared to its acclimation phase baseline i e median pbdiss of 229 µg l and 184 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively during treatment at ph 7 9 pbdiss remained relatively stable for seven weeks in both pipes at median concentrations of 84 µg l and 86 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively fig 2c from treatment week 8 onwards pbdiss started to diverge for the two pipes however in the last three weeks of phase 1 both pipes had similar pbdiss values average was 82 µg l and 79 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively upon the increase of silica by approximately 5 mg sio2 l in treatment phase 2 i e treatment week 18 onwards which corresponded to a change in average ph from 7 9 to 8 1 pbdiss increased and fluctuated considerably in both pipes in phase 2 median pbdiss was 121 µg l and 146 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively the increase in pbdiss was an unexpected outcome and is further discussed in section 3 3 1 both silicate a pipes experienced a severe scale dislodging event at the early treatment stages pipe 1 week 2 pipe 2 week 3 excluding those events and several spikes throughout the study pbpart was relatively stable at median concentrations of 8 µg l and 9 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively pbpart was overall lower than in the acclimation phase but did not show any trends and was not affected by the increase in silica dose in phase 2 table s 9 silicate b lead results are shown in fig s 6 and table 2 for this product the silica dose was 28 mg sio2 l in phase 1 and 38 mg sio2 l in phase 2 as previously discussed the pipe allocated to this treatment had a lower lead release baseline compared to the other pipes during acclimation however its phase 1 median pbdiss i e 176 µg l was the highest of all treatment conditions since upon starting treatment its lead release increased and fluctuated considerably this is in line with the observations for silicate a at a silica dose of 25 mg sio2 l increasing the silica dose for silicate b did not change this trend considerably 3 3 1 ph effect vs the silica effect to distinguish between the ph effect and the silica effect of sodium silicate treatment lead release of the silicate a pipes was compared to that of the ph adjustment pipes that were operating at the same ph as the silicate a pipes statistically significant differences p 0 05 were observed between the pbdiss data of silicate a and ph adjustment pipes in both treatment phases when comparing the pipes with no statistically significant difference in their acclimation phase pbdiss baselines i e silicate a 1 and ph adjustment 2 the silicate a 1 pipe had a 20 µg l and 66 µg l higher median pbdiss compared to the ph adjustment 2 pipe in phase 1 and 2 respectively for the other pipe pairs the reduction in pbdiss median in the treatment phases compared to the acclimation phase was used as a comparison tool the silicate a treatment resulted on average in 57 and 32 reduction in pbdiss while the ph adjustment treatment resulted on average in 77 and 64 reduction in phase 1 and 2 respectively table 2 similar to the ph adjustment pipes a negative correlation between pbdiss and temperature was observed for the silicate pipes since phase 2 coincided with the colder months the effect of the increase in silica dose is confounded with the potential effect of the lower temperatures on lead release however by comparing the phase 2 results of silicate a to that of ph adjustment fig 2 it is evident that the destabilization only occurred in the silicate a pipes additionally the increase of pbdiss in treatment phase 2 was much more considerable in the silicate a pipes table 2 this highlights the fact that the higher silicate dose exacerbated dissolved lead release this is in line with observations of li et al 2021 the potential mechanism responsible at least in part for the elevated pbdiss is discussed in section 3 5 3 4 orthophosphate in combination with ph adjustment pbdiss for both pipes that received the orthophosphate treatment in combination with ph adjustment decreased significantly and stabilized after two weeks of treatment to a median concentration of 16 µg l and 17 µg l in phases 1 and 2 respectively solubility modeling predicted formation of hydroxylpyromorphite pb5 po4 3oh with an equilibrium solubility of 13 5 µg l at the average ph i e 7 95 experienced in phase 1 and 14 µg l at the average ph i e 8 08 experienced in phase 2 based on the thermodynamic dataset in giammar et al 2010 which have a remarkably good agreement with the actual measured values compared to pbdiss the drop in pbpart was delayed by one week and was followed by a severe scale dislodging event and major spikes in pbpart i e 290 µg l and 450 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively several other less major pbpart spikes i e in the range of 30 50 µg l were also recorded in the following weeks the last pbpart spikes were recorded on treatment weeks 8 and 19 for pipes 1 and 2 respectively the persistence of occasional high pbpart several months after start of the orthophosphate treatment is consistent with the observations of previous studies welter et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 excluding the spikes pbpart was stable at a median concentration of 2 µg l and 5 µg l for pipes 1 and 2 respectively table s 9 the orthophosphate treated pipes were not affected by seasonal temperature changes which is consistent with findings of masters et al 2016 3 5 formation of colloidal dispersions fff coupled with icp ms was conducted on a select number of phase 2 samples from treatment week 25 a high molecular weight 1000 kda peak representing colloids was observed in the fractograms fig 3 of stagnated water samples collected from both silicate a pipes the colloids contained lead and aluminum rich phases with trace amounts of iron copper zinc and manganese the source of these metals is further discussed in section 3 7 this is consistent with the known dispersive properties of silicate in other applications such as dispersion and flotation of carbonate bearing iron ore hao et al 2018 a uv254 signal also accompanied the colloidal peak it may be attributed to light scattering absorbance by aromatic organic matter in this size fraction or both based on the fff data the observed increase in pbdiss following the increase in the silicate a dose was potentially at least in part due to the formation of colloids containing lead this is in line with observations of li et al 2021 who reported formation of colloidal iron and lead at a silica dose of 48 mg sio2 l in a system containing unlined cast iron pipes followed by new lead pipes colloids containing lead likely formed in the silicate b treated water as well this could be a potential explanation for the observed increase in pbdiss during silicate b treatment at the dose of 28 mg sio2 l however fff analysis results are not available for silicate b to support this hypothesis 3 6 scale characterization the acclimation phase pipe scale had a thickness of about 30 to 50 µm with only one visible layer in the sem image fig s 7b and its surface coverage with particular corrosion products was not uniform section s2 2 overall the acclimation pipe scale did not accurately represent the pre treatment scale condition of the other pipes since scale analysis on the two phase 1 pipes that received silicate a and b respectively identified a thicker i e 80 150 µm two layer scale which did not form during the treatment phase further discussed in section 3 6 1 scale analysis on the phase 2 pipes at the end of the study confirmed the presence of a two layer scale in all seven pipes a dark brown layer on top and a thin white layer at the bottom fig s 9 at this stage the top layer easily flaked off however its degree of adherence to the bottom layer seemed to be affected by the treatment it had received which is further discussed in the following sections xrd analysis was conducted on both layers table s 12 which showed similar patterns for all pipes the upper scale layer xrd peaks listed in the order of highest to lowest peak intensity were plattnerite cerussite and hydrocerussite plattnerite has been reported to be present in other service lines that were excavated from the city of london kim and herrera 2010 the lower layer was composed mainly of hydrocerussite and elemental lead in addition to other minor phases differences in elemental composition as measured by icp ms were observed between the pipes and at the different study phases which are discussed in section 3 7 3 6 1 silica accumulation in the pipe scale the phase 1 pipes that received silicate a and b respectively were taken out to assess whether a silica film had started forming after 17 weeks of treatment based on the semi quantitative eds analysis si was detectable in both pipes at a maximum of 2 2 atomic percentage as shown in the sem images silicate a fig 4 b silicate b fig s 8b the scales had two distinct layers as indicated by eds si was equally abundant in the upper and lower scale layers of silicate a pipe but was more abundant in the upper scale layer than the lower layer of silicate b pipe additionally both pipes had scales that included al and mn sources of which are discussed in section 3 7 as indicated by elemental mapping silicate a fig 4a and silicate b fig s 8a si and al accumulated in the same scale regions for phase 2 pipes only xrd and icp ms analysis was conducted and no sem and eds results are available the top dark brown scale layer was mainly composed of plattnerite this easily flaked off and a thin white layer was discovered underneath fig 4d and fig s8d which was mainly composed of hydrocerussite a crystalline phase containing si was not detected by xrd in either phase 1 or phase 2 pipes fig s 10 3 6 2 effect of orthophosphate treatment on scale compared to the scale of the other treatment conditions the lower scale layer of the pipes that received the orthophosphate treatment was not as even in appearance the upper layer had a stronger adherence to the lower level and remained adhered to it even after being cut into transverse sections fig s 9 the xrd patterns do not provide definitive evidence that the orthophosphate inhibitory effect on lead release was due to formation of low solubility lead phosphate solids such as hydroxylpyromorphite pb5 po4 3oh only a very low intensity peak at 22 4 degrees in the xrd patterns of the lower layer scale fig s 10 could potentially correspond to hydroxylpyromorphite however due to its low intensity it cannot be identified with certainty it may be that 26 weeks of treatment with orthophosphate was not sufficient to develop enough hydroxylpyromorphite to be detectable by xrd but there are also other cases in which pipe scales receiving orthophosphate treated water have not had the expected lead phosphate solids tully et al 2019 even for systems for which lead phosphates solids are not clearly observed to have formed orthophosphate addition has been hypothesized to still have a benefit in lowering lead release by accumulating in the pipe scales as amorphous solids that act as barriers to diffusion of lead from lead rich lower scale layers to the water tully et al 2019 wasserstrom et al 2017 3 7 accumulation and mobilization of trace metals the effect of the different treatments on the accumulation of trace metals in the scale and or their mobilization from the scale were assessed by combining the results of the scale elemental analysis and the one time fff analysis the fff results suggest that aluminum affected lead release in the silicate a treated pipes considerable amounts of aluminum were only present in the high molecular weight 1000 kda colloidal dispersions of the silicate a treated samples fig 3 since fff results are semi quantitative samples from week 25 were also analyzed by icp ms to determine their total aluminum concentration and overall the results of the two analyses were in agreement table s 10 icp ms indicated that the aluminum concentration in samples collected from the silicate a pipes were almost double that of the other pipes although the residual aluminum concentration before stagnation was not known for these samples a comparison of aluminum concentrations in the stagnated samples i e 0 1 mg l to the plant s average data indicates that the source of aluminum in the silicate treated samples was not just the residual from the coagulation treatment but that aluminum was also mobilized from the scale this phenomenon is consistent with the scale analysis results the phase 2 segments had a low aluminum weight percentage i e 1 wt in their scale table s 11 which is lower than what was reported by a previous study conducted on 11 lsls excavated in the city of london the aluminum content was reported to be 1 4 wt and was attributed to the presence of an amorphous aluminosilicate phase formed by the combination of the naturally occurring background silica in the source water and the residual dissolved al from the coagulation process kim and herrera 2010 the low percentage of aluminum in the phase 2 pipes compared to that in the previous study on city of london lsls could be an indication of aluminum dissolution from the scale over the last decade this is consistent with kim et al 2011 who reported a positive correlation between ph and aluminum dissolution from scale when the water ph at the city of london was gradually increased from 7 1 to 8 3 in 2008 unlike the phase 2 pipes the aluminum weight percentages detected in the silicate a and b phase 1 pipes were substantial i e 5 12 this was a surprising outcome since in the scale of the silicate a and b phase 2 pipes aluminum was below 0 2 wt one explanation could be that the lower silicate dose that the phase 1 pipes received promoted aluminum accumulation in the scale potentially by forming aluminosilicate this hypothesis is supported by the elemental mappings shown in fig 4a and fig s 8a which shows that aluminum and silicon are present in the same scale regions of the phase 1 pipes increasing the silicate dose in phase 2 potentially reversed that process by promoting formation of colloids containing si and al as detected by fff accumulation and mobilization of manganese copper and zinc that were detected in trace amounts by fff in the colloidal dispersions are discussed in section s 2 3 future research should focus on determining the threshold silica dose that results in formation of colloidal dispersions and the effect of water quality on this threshold silica interactions with residual alum and trace metals especially those that have accumulated in corrosion scales in distribution systems and premise plumbing should be studied 3 8 biofilm accumulation impact of the corrosion treatments on biofilm accumulation was assessed via hpc measurement fig 5 at the end of phase 2 during set up breakdown both silicate a and b pipes had lower amounts of biofilm accumulation silicate a 2 88 and 2 62 log cfu cm2 silicate b 3 55 log cfu cm2 when compared to those found in the pipes dosed with orthophosphate log cfu cm2 values 4 13 and 4 25 which had the highest viable biomass overall biofilm accumulation for the ph adjustment pipes 1 and 2 3 12 and 3 99 log cfu cm2 fell in between the silicate a and orthophosphate results albeit showing higher variability between the 2 pipe segments than the other treatments in drinking water distribution systems phosphorus has been shown to impact microbial growth as it is often found limiting sathasivan ohgaki 1999 however there are a number of other aspects to be considered in biofilm formation including those which affect initial adherence to wall material lehtola et al 2002 to gain further insight into biofilm community response community profiling was also examined for biofilm collected for each treatment which is discussed in section s2 4 understanding more detailed dynamics of biofilm formation from study onset would require more extensive sampling 4 conclusions in this study sodium silicates orthophosphate and ph adjustment effects on lead release were compared under the same ph conditions for the conditions tested the following conclusions can be drawn 1 at the same ph silicate a treatment at 20 mg sio2 l was less effective in reducing lead release compared to ph adjustment 2 increasing the silica dose to 25 mg sio2 l caused lead release to increase and destabilize potentially due at least in part to formation of colloidal dispersions composed of lead and aluminum rich phases with trace amounts of other metals 3 although scale analysis showed signs of incorporation of si in the pipe scale comparison of lead results of the silicate pipes to the ph adjustment pipes indicated that under the conditions tested silicate treatment did not offer any benefits other than increasing ph in our experiments the beneficial ph effects of silicate treatment were counteracted when the silica dose was increased and it seemed that instead of formation of a passivating film silica promoted mobilization of lead aluminum and manganese from the pipe scale 4 orthophosphate in combination with ph adjustment was the most effective treatment resulting in a low and stable lead release after only two weeks of treatment however the orthophosphate treatment resulted in higher levels of viable biofilm accumulation on the pipe walls compared to the silicate treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17103,relatively little work has been done on the role of micronutrients in influencing development and progression of harmful algal blooms yet micronutrients are ineluctably required for growth relatively small changes in micronutrient status have wide ranging consequences here we report results from mesocosm experiments with microcystis and desmodesmus spp in mono and mixed cultures to probe questions of how copper iron and copper iron amendments affect growth short term assemblage progression and production of siderophore chalkophore and microcystin in lake water from a large hypereutrophic lake taihu china our approach offers an entirely new perspective to understanding micronutrient dynamics in aqueous environments as this is the first work to systematically screen for chalkophores and siderophores separately as a function of copper iron amendment and using community trajectory analysis singular findings are summarized as follows 1 unlike lab based studies in our work we observe neither dramatic copper modulation of iron demand nor evidence of an iron protective effect from copper toxicity 2 the interplay between chalkophore siderophore production supports a concept model wherein microcystis spp varies behavior to individually and uniquely manage copper iron requirements in a phased manner in being able to specifically screen for chalkophores we observe a previously unreported link between chalkophore and microcystin production that may relate to iron limitation 3 regarding harmful algal bloom hab persistance the lake water itself influences mesocosm changes differentiated effects for iron regarding growth indicators and or reduction of fe limitation stress were found at an hab free field station xukou bay likely a consequence of low

in influencing hab development and progression facey et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 which is therefore an important and largely neglected topic we previously found statistically significant effects of algal growth limitation for b co cu and fe zhang et al 2019 fe is frequently limiting in marine environments boyd et al 2007 tripathy and jena 2019 and there have been some reports for freshwater nagai et al 2007 molot et al 2010 mns have an interesting role in regard to environmental management since relatively minor inputs changes could potentially have pronounced effects for example cu has been suggested at concentrations on the order of 100 ppb as an algal biocide for use in hab management wu et al 2017 at 20 ppb cu however we found a tremendous stimulatory effect zhang et al 2019 suggesting that hab management with cu may not always be advisable the environmental bioavailability of fe is often low yet some phytoplankton have relatively high cellular requirements brand 1991 schoffman et al 2016 some studies report cu fe interactions whereby cu facilitates fe uptake schoffman et al 2016 and in previous work we were unable to discount that cu amendment induced increased fe bioavailability zhang et al 2019 synergistic np mn interactions involving fe e g phototroph n metabolism is sensitive to fe limitation quigg 2008 have contributed to conceptualization of the extended redfield ratio ho et al 2003 in addition to np mn synergies there are well known mn mn interactions for algae as early as 1987 stauber and florence 1987 observed that fe reduced cu toxicity to different algal species which they attributed to cu scavenging by a layer of fe hydroxide on algal cell surfaces thus reducing cellular cu penetration recently kochoni and fortin 2019 also found that fe ameliorates cu toxicity to the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii an effect rationalized via the biotic ligand model blm i e fe blocks cu receptor binding that initiates toxic response fe hydroxide scavenging or blm theories cannot explain the stimulatory effect we observed for cu we hypothesized zhang et al 2019 a cu fe link involving bacterial or algal production of strong fe and cu binding ligands respectively called siderophores saha et al 2016 and chalkophores solioz 2018 which have demonstrated importance in aiding organisms to navigate the divide between mn nutrition and toxicity in 1980 mcknight and morel 1980 found that fe limitation caused anabaena species to secrete strong cu binding ligands they speculated that cu ligand complexes reduced cu2 conveying an advantage to cyanophytes in another example nicolaisen et al 2010 reported that at low fe and cu anabaena spp secrete the siderophore schizokinen to complex with fe and increase its bioavailability to these organisms at high cu low fe concentrations cu schizokinen complexation lowers cu intake toxicity and synthesis of another fe transporter is activated similarly for p aeruginosa toxic cu concentrations caused siderophore production that conveyed a cu protective effect braud et al 2010 the literature we found concerning coupled cu fe effects is from laboratory studies on algal monocultures which is very different from field settings also the environmental half life of some mn binding ligands is relatively low maldonado et al 2005 more so than lab studies ewhat happens in field settings is relevant to mns and environmental management whole lake management has been much discussed carpenter et al 1987 nault et al 2014 paerl et al 2016 hanson et al 2017 including habs and using cu to control microcystis jančula and maršálek 2011 if cu fe links affect chalkophore siderophore production this affects cu fe bioavailability and whole lake management of habs using cu may have unanticipated side effects certainly a better understanding is needed including field settings before implementing whole lake cu application particularly in geographical settings with highly variable ecosystem s dynamics across a regional scale here we examine how cu and fe amendments affect small scale mesocosms initiated with microcystis and desmodesmus spp using lake water from a large hypereutrophic lake that has widely varying algal ecology geographically our field area is taihu lake tai 太湖 in chinese china s third largest freshwater lake 2 338 km2 surface area catchment area 36 900 km2 located in a rapidly developing region yangtze delta qin et al 2007 cyanobacterial habs have impacted taihu every summer since the mid 1980s due to environmental change human impacts qin et al 2007 wang et al 2009 hence taihu has become a locus of field studies to understand hab management we monitored mesocosm changes for 25 standard water quality parameters plus three biomolecules chalkophore siderophore and microcystin chalkophore screening is new zhang et al 2020a and this is the first work to analyze chalkophores and siderophores separately and as a function of cu fe chalkophore siderophore results are not well characterized by standard time series analysis and we use community trajectory analysis cta a powerful new approach in ecological studies we also apply multivariate analysis to the full 28 parameter data set results offer an entirely new perspective to understanding mn dynamics in aqueous environments summarizing we find 1 cu fe impacts on growth and community progression do not agree with lab based findings 2 there is an interplay between chalkophore siderophore production wherein microcystis spp varies behavior to manage cu fe requirements including a link between chalkophore and microcystin and 3 the lake water itself influences mesocosm changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area collection and treatment of lake water taihu is a polymictic lake located 150 km west of shanghai lake center 31 10ʹ0ʺn 120 90ʹ0ʺe water samples were collected during an hab in august 2018 at three stations fig 1 monitored quarterly by niglas nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences meiliang bay station 3 st3 receives large amounts of untreated wastewater via the liang and zhihu rivers paerl et al 2011 accordingly recurring and increasing microcystis dominated habs often originate at st3 qin et al 2007 xukou bay st28 has a high density of macrophytes and is typically unimpacted by habs gonghu bay st13 located in between st3 and st28 is usually less impacted by habs compared to st3 these three stations were selected for sampling based on our previous work zhang et al 2019 wherein we found that water chemistry is different and significant differences were found in mn mesocosm experiments for these stations forty l water samples from 0 2 m below the surface were collected into acid cleaned polyethylene carboys all work was conducted trace metals clean using ultrapure water upw water temperature ph turbidity and dissolved oxygen were measured in the field using a ysi 6600 sonde water samples were filtered immediately after collection using whatman gf f glass fiber filters nominal pore size 0 7 μm to remove in situ phytoplankton due to filter clogging when filtering 40 l many filters must be used and small amounts of in situ algae algis are introduced to the filtrate from transfer during filter changes confirmed to be below the limit of detection lod by microscopic counting and automated cell counts 2 2 algal cultures microcystis was selected as the main hab forming species in taihu qin et al 2007 also reportedly sensitive to cu wu et al 2017 desmodesmus was selected as a contrasting non nuisance green alga with a relative tolerance to cu buayam et al 2019 also having been used as a model microcystis competitor in lab studies chang et al 2012 omidi et al 2019 microcystis 99 microcystis spp from microscopic examination were collected from meiliang bay during an hab desmodesmus was purchased from aquatic biology services wuxi zhongshun biotechnology co ltd 99 desmodesmus from microscopic examination and 18s rrna sequencing algae were passed through a 65 μm zooplankton net then acclimated in modified combo medium kilham et al 1998 with 1 mg l n 0 1 mg l p no cu fe and all other ingredients at 50 of combo mono algal status was verified by microscopic examination periodically and on mesocosm establishment for mesocosm bioassays algae were collected concentrated by coarse filtration 2 3 nutrient limitation bioassays nlbs the nlb used here is a small scale field mesocosm study that possesses an element of control akin to lab experiments improved reproducibility isolation of variables resulting basis for tractable hypotheses while also offering environmental reality e g diel cycles temperature conditions that lab experiments lack spivak et al 2011 meta analysis by elser et al 2007 and spivak et al 2011 on 1060 nlb experiments spanning a wide range of volumetric as little as 0 02 l and temporal 0 7 days scales concluded that the approach is applicable to larger scale processes their findings confirm the suitability of nlbs for our large factorial experiment that screens for potential environmental mn effects we designed nlb amendments as follows table 1 1 no added cu fe control ctl 2 50 µg l cu 3 200 µg l fe and 4 cu and fe cufe at the dose used for each individually all had np to ensure that these are non limiting and to focus on the effects of cu fe and cu fe concentrations of np and fe were the same used previously zhang et al 2019 and references therein wherein significant growth promotion was observed for fe cu concentration was increased 2 5 times over previous work zhang et al 2019 to levels reportedly toxic to microcystis wu et al 2017 to observe how this affects mesocosm progression we also varied the chemical form of fe table 1 for fe only we used fecitrate a solubilized and exchangeable more bioavailable 1 1 here we adhere to the terminology of semple et al 2004 whereby bioavailability references only the amount of a substance available to an organism at a given time which is distinguished from bioaccessibility i e that which could potential become or be rendered bioavailable as an outgrowth of some decades of study bioavailability and bioaccessibility of micronutrients and other species are generally recognized to be a function of chemical speciation i e per campbell 1995 as an example form of fe sutak et al 2012 quigg 2016 mustoe 2018 we used fecl3 6h2o for cufe which as a less bioavailable form due to the formation of insoluble fe oxyhydroxides lis et al 2015 von der heyden and roychoudhury 2015 jiménez et al 2019 was to test whether the response of algae to cu will have an influence on the bioavailability of fe trials were also conducted to see if mn effects differ for mono and mixed cultures we designate these trials as mmeso dosed with microcystis spp dmeso desmodesmus spp and bmeso 1 1 mixture of microcystis and desmodesmus by od or both to perform nlbs filtered lake water was divided into three portions and dosed with algae to a starting optical density at 750 nm od750 hereafter od of 0 05 given the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of algae free water from natural water it was given that algis species might grow in our mesocosms over time our prior work found that mns may mediate changes in algal assemblages zhang et al 2019 which is a possible outcome of interest our primary criterion of importance for nlb experimental design is that the initial conditions for all mesocosms are controlled for each nlb permutation station water used algae dosed amendment type triplicate subsamples were placed into 1 l transparent chemically inert cubitainers which were then spiked to achieve the final concentrations of np and mn table 1 the cubitainers were then incubated in situ in taihu near the surface at tller samples for analysis were collected from initial water initial algal suspensions t0 and then each cubitainer was sampled

parameters table 2 shows t0 water quality results which agree with prior research on taihu zhang et al 2019 the secchi disk transparency followed st3 st13 st28 as expected reflecting the pattern of hab formation and the predominant drainage from northwest to southeast and consistent with higher particulates in st3 st13 tdfe is higher in st3 st13 perhaps because some colloidal fe passes the 0 45 μm filter that is operationally used for td measurement tdcu for all stations was 6 7 µg l well below levels causing toxic effects in algae wu et al 2017 the sm contains further discussion on table 2 and t2 t6 water quality results 3 2 correlation matrix plot fig 2 is a bivariate correlation matrix plot that gives an overview of inter parameter associations parameters associated with algal growth include od ph cts ef cts m esv and d avg plotted at the top the counts for different algal species groups determined from cts m are next followed by biomolecules chalkophore siderophore and microcystin np species and normalized concentration to maxima for tdcun tdfen tcun and tfen are shown at the bottom the growth indicators od ph cts ef and cts m all have strong correlations with each other chl a is not as strongly correlated with cts ef cts m and esv as od a consequence of chl a s not being solely related to cell number or volume ignatiades et al 1985 and that different algae have different rates of chl a synthesis according to growth state and conditions chl a correlates most with algis ug dia rest i e those absent at t0 since temporal algis increases contribute to chl a chalkophore and siderophore correlate positively with od ph and cts ef and chalkophore specifically correlate with bg as expected tdn no3 correlate negatively with growth indicators and the strong positive no2 ug correlation suggests more nitrification in samples with ug tcu and tdcu negatively correlate with bg accompanied by reduction in growth indicators and concomitant increases in esv d avg bg cells being small reflecting differential bg sensitivity to the level of cu amended interestingly microcystin correlates negatively with tfen discussed in more detail in section 3 6 see sm for further discussion regarding np macronutrients and cu fe correlations for individual station data correlations are comparatively stronger for st13 than for st3 st28 however st3 st13 patterns in pair wise correlation are more similar compared to st28 such differences are discussed where relevant in subsequent sections 3 3 temporal changes of algal growth indicators fig 3 shows od and ph versus time for all stations and amendments there is a strong od ph correlation ρ 0 78 p 0 001 fig 2 as od and ph are both primary consequences of growth ph increases due to inorganic carbon scavenging wang et al 2017 for mmeso ctl fe both parameters increase then decrease indicating onset of stationary phase by t2 where differences exist mmeso od and ph are higher for fe than ctl p 0 05 during growth t2 for st3 whereas post stationary fe ctl differences are for st13 and st28 much more so for st28 by t6 indicating that st28 ctl growth has started to taper with an ameliorating affect for fe considering that st28 t0 tdfe is half of the other stations and that fe can limit microcystis growth fujii et al 2016 the st28 difference between ctl and fe may be caused by fe limitation cu for mmeso caused inhibition with or without fe od for mmeso cu showed a decrease t0 t2 while ph showed no increase from microscopic examination we know that this is from a cu induced diminution in bg microcystis for mmeso cu od slowly recovered with simultaneous ph increases t2 t6 per results in section 3 4 this results from algis increases also with cu there are indications that fe exerts a positive effect notably ph has risen for cufe much more than for cu by t4 for dmeso od drops t0 t2 likely a result of incomplete acclimatization after a longer induction than mmeso dmeso od for all amendments entered logarithmic growth phase with substantive increase of od ph by t6 there were no differences by amendment except that st3 fe had higher ph compared to cu cufe p 0 01 at t4 by t6 the benefit of fe disappeared comparing od ph results for mmeso and dmeso dmeso had a greater ability to cope with the amended level of 50 µg l cu consistent with other research on green algae buayam et al 2019 wu et al 2017 other metrics used as growth indicators include counts and chl a per fig 2 od strongly correlates with cts ef and cts m see sm for further discussion the od chl a correlation is not as strong ρ 0 64 p 0 001 as we detail herein fig 4 shows chl a versus time normalized to t0 by mesocosm to show relative changes t0 chl a are given in the figure caption fe increases chl a production in mmeso with or without cu and shows higher chl a compared to ctl by t2 st3 and st28 p 0 05 chl a in st28 mmeso ctl is less than half of mmeso fe by t6 p 0 05 which agrees with od results that cu at 50 µg l severely impairs mmeso chl a fully agrees with od and ph results however the mmeso od results for cu cufe are still lower than for ctl and fe by t6 and the reverse is true for chl a p 0 05 this corresponds to algal assemblage changes for cu cufe after t2 the od versus chl a plot in fig 5 illustrates how different algal assemblages details in section 3 4 contribute to chl a the slopes for dmeso and samples becoming green algae dominated mmeso and bmeso cu cufe are less than corresponding slopes for microcystis dominated samples mmeso and bmeso ctl fe such that for any given increase in od the corresponding increase in chl a is less for the latter in our work on taihu we have found that microcystis consistently have relatively lower chl a than green algae which has also been observed by others ghadouani and ralph 2005 for microcystis dominated samples chl a is consistent with od and ph increasing to t2 then diminishing on entering stationary phase with fe ctl for chl a st3 st28 p 0 05 during the period of growth up to t2 similar to od fe increases chl a in mmeso with or without cu chl a in st28 mmesoctl is less than half of mmeso fe by t6 p 0 05 which also agrees with od results though mmeso cu cufe od are still lower than for ctl fe by t6 the reverse is true for chl a p 0 05 this reflects algal assemblage changes for cu cufe after t2 like od dmeso chl a dropped substantively by t2 fig 4 compared to ctl fe cu cufe negatively impacted chl a production in dmeso at t4 cu fe st3 st28 cufe fe st3 st28 p 0 05 consistent with küpper et al s 2003 results showing a cu induced temporary drop in chl a for the desmid scenedesmus quadricauda this might be explained by the negative effect that mg2 substitution by cu2 in the chl a complex has been documented to have on chl a synthesis at first küpper et al 2003 until cu detoxification mechanisms in the green algae overcome this sub lethal cu toxicity and chl a synthesis is restored to control levels as observed at t6 fig 4 as with od and ph chl a of green algae dominated samples fig 4 and 5 increased with time though mmeso cu cufe contain predominantly green algae from t2 grouping with dmeso in fig 5 unlike dmeso there are some differences between cu and cufe noted above for mmeso chl a levels show cufe cu during t2 t6 though this is not observed by t6 for st28 the difference in chl a results for st28 may reflect fe limitation fujii et al 2016 per od ph results and for st28 relating to other observations below differentiating st28 chl a correlation with totg is comparatively stronger in st3 and st13 3 4 how amendments affect algal assemblages cts m remain unsurpassed for simple determination of species density assemblage changes and cell condition butterwick et al 1982 transition from blue green to green algae from varying np carbon sources has been long known shapiro 1973 and we previously found that mn also mediate algal assemblage changes zhang et al 2019 because of our experimental design we anticipated that algis might cause algal assemblage changes over the course of our field experiments and that changes might reflect initial conditions or cu fe amendment fig 6 shows time dependent changes in cts m of algae groups by amendment at t0 algal species and cts m are as expected since the mixture in bmeso was effected according to od des in dmeso constitute larger but fewer individuals and thus t0 bg microcystis cts m is greater than des in bmeso for t2 t6 the compositions of the five algal groups were as follows bg were 97 microcystis with smaller amounts of chroococcus and pseudoanabaena des were primarily desmodesmus with occasional occurrences of scenedesmus ug included mixtures ofcarteria and chlorella 81 not always easily differentiable with lesser amounts ofchalmydamonas dia were mixtures of navicula and nitzschia with minor amounts of asterionella cyclotella andfragilaria each never exceeding 12 and rest constituted low highly variable counts of chlosteriopsis coelastrum dichtyospaerium eudorina haematococcus kirchneriella micractinium monoraphidium oocystis pediastrum planktosphaeria radiococcus schrodeiria tetraedron mallomonas chroomonas chryptomonas and trachelomonas a striking feature in fig 6 is by t2 mmeso cu cufe amendment resulted in replacement of microcystis by other groups through to t6 i e microcystis is more sensitive to the cu concentrations that we use compared to other freshwater algae consistent with zeng et al s 2010 report of an ic50 of 25 5 µg l for microcystis whereas buayam et al 2019 and wan et al 2018 reported that desmodesmus and chlorella can tolerate higher cu concentrations fig 6 suggests that excretion of cu protective compounds e g nicolaisen et al 2010 is non operative or non effective for mmeso cu cufe also apparent in fig 6 is that when microcystis is not impacted it retains its place mmeso or gains ground bmeso over other species which may partially result from more efficient bg co2 uptake at high ph king 1970 shapiro 1973 the proportionate increase of des in dmeso was slower than ug growth and ug consistently dominated dmeso by t6 des may have been less competitive due to incomplete acclimatization changes in bmeso ctl fe assemblages followed those for mmeso albeit not as dramatically microcystis was the major species t0 t6 average 77 minimum 61 while des averaged 34 at t0 decreasing 17 on average maximum 37 in bmeso by t6 since different algae grow at different rates results may be considered in terms of auc see sm to obtain comparative information on integrated growth growth inhibition documented for microcystis dong et al 2019 omidi et al 2019 or stimulation i e mono versus mixed cultures stockenreiter et al 2012 smith and crews 2014 fig 7 shows auc for the four main algal groups bg des ug dia in panels a d respectively auc is normalized to the station maximum to show relative scale cts m for bg of mmeso and des of dmeso are divided by two for comparison with bmeso proportionate t0 conditions since cts m for bg des in bmeso were half those of bg in mmeso and des in dmeso respectively p 0 05 results in fig 7a and b imply that bg and des grow better in mixed culture on average auc for bg in bmeso ctl fig 7a is higher by 35 than bg in mmeso ctl p 0 05 for fe auc for bg in bmeso is 27 higher than for mmeso though p 0 15 the difference being least for st13 not significant and most for st28 p 0 007 looking at des fig 7b for ctl auc for bmeso is 30 greater than dmeso however this is not statistically significant on average or station to station for fe des counts in bmeso average 25 greater than for dmeso significantly for st3 and st13 p 0 05 for des cu cufe there is no apparent difference in in dmeso versus bmeso ug and dia are algis with comparable t0 amounts by station hence are plotted differently than bg des no consistent station to station differences were observed thus plots show station averages ug auc fig 7c is consistently most variable and highest in dmeso on average by more than a factor of two compared to mmeso bmeso cu cufe for mmeso and bmeso auc for cu cufe ctl fe p 0 05 except for mmeso cu ctl and cufe ctl p 0 07 and 0 08 respectively our data show as others find chen et al 2016 wan et al 2018 that ug copes with cu comparing dmeso ctl fe to cu cufe however the presence of microcystis is inhibiting dong et al 2019 omidi et al 2019 which effect persists even when the original microcystis population is diminished logically lysis and release of microcystin is expected with bg microcystis diminution in cu cufe shen et al 2019 that microcystin is labile in field surface water welker and steinberg 2000 chen et al 2008 possibly accounts for higher ug auc with cu cufe in mmeso and bmeso while lysing cells may transiently increase solution microcystin live cells are able to provide continuous flux of microcystin and toxic secondary metabolites flux being in some ways more relevant than load tecon et al 2006 omidi et al 2019 for dia cts m are low and variability high averaging stations does not increase this the dia auc is higher for cu cufe versus ctl fe in mmeso and bmeso p 0 05 in contrast dmeso dia is higher in ctl compared to cu cufe p 0 05 on an average and station to station basis uncertainty is higher for fe dmeso dia fe cu cufe though not significantly p 0 21 unlike fig 7a c which respectively show growth that is favored or inhibited in mixed culture mmeso and bmeso are not different dia for mmesocu cufe suggest growth despite this cu level perhaps dia grow better in these mesocosms because of increased don bronk et al 2007 see np discussion in the sm or because the additional don dop in these mesocosms complex cu in a protective manner zeng et al 2010 however we are cautious about such inferences due to low cts m 3 5 temporal changes in amended nutrients here we summarize np and cu fe results for full discussion see sm three np changes are most interesting relevant to other results first don dop is higher in cu cufe bg containing mesocosms consistent with cu induced algal death and subsequent cycling into dissolved organic matter second no2 increases in mesocosms having active in growth of ug we postulate that this likely results from different bacterial assemblages in these third all mmeso irrespective of amendment are steady state for p i e the rate of p production from organic matter cycling is equal to the rate of p uptake by algae and or bacteria we posit see sm that this is also an effect of bacterial assemblages however as the effect is not a function of amendment it is less relevant to our focus regarding cu fe tcu tfe were conserved for t0 t6 and tdcu tdfe arrived at or near steady state by t2 for tdcu dmeso uptake for cu cufe amendments was 50 greater than that of mmeso on average for tdfe results were unexpected having used different forms of fe by design section 2 3 we anticipated that fecitrate in fe would exhibit a greater longer term dissolved phase availability than the fecl3 6h2o used for cufe instead by t2 fe in both fe cufe had become tfe of some form differences in tdfe as a function of amendment are generally not large though for st3 and st13 by t4 the tdfe averages 30 less for ctl fe than for cu cufe 3 6 relationships between cu fe amendment and biomolecule production this field based work is the first to study chalkophore and siderophore production using assays differentiating the two chalkophores are defined as being ligands that have very strong and as compared to other metals very high association complexation constants for cu saha et al 2016 and analogously siderophores are ligands that have differentially stronger fe binding behavior until recently studies have relied on techniques that do not differentiate the two according to the operational classes of chalkophores being ligands that bind to cu more strongly than fe and siderophores being ligands that bind to fe more strongly than cu prior work that is not able to separate chalkophores from siderophores as operational classes includes for instance studies that characterize strong cu binding ligands when it is increasingly recognized that many siderophores are strong cu binding ligands and the so called strong cu binding ligands in question might be siderophores jones and hart 1989 baptista et al 2014 solioz 2018 i e many methods in use do not explicitly separate chalkophore from siderophore the method we use here zhang et al 2020a specifically distinguishes chalkophore from siderophore and the present work is the first to use this approach that specifically differentiates chalkophores from siderophores we analyzed results using cta recently adduced as a fresh perspective on dynamic aspects of population community changes de cáceres et al 2019 please see section s2 5 in the sm for more commentary and results fig 8 a f illustrates the cta concept a b and summarizes selected chalkophore siderophore results c g fig 8a shows time sequence data for model variables x and y similar to results we report e g od in fig 3 chl a in fig 4 fig 8b shows what model x y pairs look like as trajectories in community space prominently without an x y phase difference a trajectory becomes a line hence subject to correlation analysis or for instance pca calculated from a correlation matrix phase differences however are commonly present between variables in community ecological data bischof and zedrosser 2009 and may efface correlation cta is multivariate however we use two dimensions of community space to simplify understanding of results and eliminate noise from potentially unrelated parameters fig 8c shows representative chalkophore siderophore trajectories those trajectories with substantial shape angularity are counter clockwise angularity results from increase in siderophore relative to chalkophore initially followed by increasing chalkophore and in some cases by subsequent decreasing chalkophore siderophore the diagonal line shows a chalkophore siderophore ratio that dmeso trajectories never exceed whereas mmeso commonly do by more than threefold chalkophore siderophore ratios for bmeso vary being a first study of chalkophore siderophore individually we do not know if this ratio represents a stoichiometric cellular process the t0 t2 increase in mmeso and bmeso siderophore for ctl fe is higher than for other mesocosms by an average factor of 3 e g fig 8c mmeso ctl versus fe though less pronounced for st28 mmeso for which by t2 fe siderophore is higher than ctl by 50 on average chalkophore increases following siderophore are more variable in magnitude for some trajectories chalkophore siderophore changes are sequential and for some simultaneous possibly relating to sampling period see sm in part these changes relate to growth however not fully see the sm for discussion the trajectories in fig 8c have three segments s1 s3 the simplest trajectory measurements include total segment length fig 8d and angles between segments two angles s1 s2 and s2 s3 fig 8e the former represents the cumulative chalkophore siderophore bivariate change a type of velocity time sequence data see sm while the latter indicates proportionate change between variables i e angularity is absent when variables change at the same rate the mmeso and bmeso ctl trajectories average more than a factor of two longer than the longest trajectories in green algae dominated dmeso or mmeso cu cufe groups after ctl longest trajectories are for mmeso fe followed by bmeso fe for two of three stations mmeso and bmeso ctl fe also differ from other groups in angularity for which s2 s3 averages 360 more than s1 s2 i e palpable disproportionate change in the latter growth stages cta trajectory length is plotted versus angularity to better understand simultaneous trends in both fig 8f angularity plotted as total sum of all angles except for the microcystis dominated mmeso and bmeso ctl fe trajectory lengths are similar in contrast to angularity there is no obvious pattern in angularity other than cufe is high while t0 t2 siderophore fe ctl for mmeso and bmeso overall ctl trajectories are greater since this work is the first to screen for chalkophore and siderophore there is no comparable literature context for results that t0 t2 siderophore production is higher for fe versus ctl may appear counterintuitive however fujii et al 2016 found that microcystis aeruginosa fe uptake rates decreased with increasing fe limitation due to lower fe requirements resulting from adaption to low fe this would explain why microcystis in our mesocosms produce more siderophore for fe there is another interesting implication despite conversion of amended tdfe to tfe by t2 fe bioaccessibility may yet be sensed with aging von der heyden and roychoudhury 2015 jiménez et al 2019 amorphous oxyhydroxides crystallize becoming less labile organisms sensing this i e via reduced flux could adjust siderophore production accordingly concerning chalkophores baptista et al 2014 found that strong cu binding ligand field concentrations were higher during microcystis dominated habs however for their analytical method cu binding siderophore are not differentiable from chalkophore much as t0 t2 siderophore is higher in microcystis dominated fe mesocosms chalkophore production in these may be differentially increased in ctl causing longer trajectories due to fe limitation it is well known that with fe limitation cu based plastocyanin becomes important in photosynthetic electron transfer quigg 2008 causing cu requirements to increase up to ten fold schoffman et al 2016 unlike mcknight and morel 1980 and nicolaisen et al s 2010 results for anabaena discussed in the introduction we find no evidence of chalkophore siderophore mechanisms to protect from cu toxicity in microcystis dominated mesocosms comparing results from mmeso to dmeso perhaps even microcystis susceptibility to cu results from enhanced siderophore and particularly chalkophore production increasing acquisition uptake of cu hadjoudja et al 2010 the meaning of chalkophore and siderophore is explicit molecules that have respectively high association constants for cu and fe zhang et al 2020a the causative basis for microcystis to produce microcystin is as yet unclear omidi et al 2018 ceballos laita et al 2017 reported microcystin fe binding speculating on microcystin s being a siderophore that conveys competitive advantage to microcystis we monitored terminal microcystin concentrations to explore this we find that microcystin produced is higher for ctl versus fe for st3 and st13 fig 9 a consistent with lukač and aegerter 1993 and alexova et al 2011 who found stress triggered microcystin production induced by fe limitation as with other results here st28 which is not subject to habs is different since other factors in experiments are matched equal differences in st28 may be summarized as its something in the water or not as the case may be one apparent difference for st28 that relates to cu or fe binding ligands is tdfe st28 t0 tdfe is half that of st3 st13 for t2 t6 st28 tdfe averages 42 that of st3 and st13 if microcystin production is suppressed when bioaccessible fe is sensed and such is lacking in st28 microcystin for st28 ctl and fe should be similar consistent with our observations we find no relationship between microcystin and siderophore production we do see a possible relationship with chalkophore fig 9b plots chalkophore versus microcystin at t0 dashed ellipse chalkophore is effectively constant rsd 18 and microcystin varies specifically mmeso values are all similar and highest whereas for bmeso in which microcystis cts m are approximately half values are lower and more variable which is expected as for instance one value is below the limit of quantitation to within statistical uncertainty t0 bmeso microcystin is half that of mmeso by t6 for the linear chalkophore microcystin relationship in fig 9b pearson s r 0 78 p 0 005 with spearman s ρ being 0 77 p 0 005 in close agreement our working hypothesis to explain biomolecule results involves microcystis production of siderophores first to capture fe then shifting to production of chalkophore as available accessible fe depletes simultaneously in ctl microcystin increases possibly as a stress reaction or to inhibit other algae microorganisms that might compete for np mn inhibition is consistent with what we observe for ug and dia in fig 7c d this hypothesis explains why ctl fe trajectories lead with siderophore followed by chalkophore and are longest overall for ctl which lacks both cu and fe the greater initial siderophore production for fe bioaccessible less so for st28 fe why microcystin is less for fe and why chalkophore microcystin correlate by t6 st28 values in fig 9b are lowest in part because by t6 population crash has begun our hypothesis concerning fe bioavailability in taihu is consistent with fan et al 2018 and our prior finding that organic matter metal binding affinity hence retention of metal solubility is lowest of 32 monitoring stations across taihu at st28 zhang et al 2020b an objective in biomolecule analysis was to see if high cu causes production of cu bioavailability reducing ligands or a fe linked effect we do not see that instead the cu concentration was toxic to microcystis and we are thus not able to say if cu causes different chalkophore siderophore microcystin production than fe for microcystis we do see interesting effects for fe with the interplay between chalkophore siderophore production and amendment and the potential link between microcystin chalkophore production is very interesting emerging literature concerning the importance of fe and cu as limiting mns and the interplay between cu fe literature cited references therein underscores the importance of this topic the additional potential interrelationships with microcystin production will be interesting to pursue in future work because these classes of molecule are documented to have short half lives in environmental conditions the advent of cta provides a timely and useful new tool for study of both the interplay between time varying production of these molecules and the ability to treat this interplay in terms of multivariate velocities 3 7 pca analysis of full data set we chose pca for multivariate analysis as an approach free from investigator bias and well known for allowing discrimination of data patterns and indications of which individual parameters most influence same e g see zhang et al 2020b pca was performed on temporally complete data t0 t6 results are shown in fig 10 and include a a three dimensional plot of pc1 pc3 b parameters with highest contributions to each pc and c e two dimensional plots of pc1 versus pc2 for st3 st28 pc1 pc3 represent 68 of data set variance pc1 33 3 pc2 21 3 and pc3 13 1 other pcs each account for 6 of total variance see sm for additional pca data and discussion thereof fig 10a shows data separation into three clusters cluster 1 dmeso cluster 2 mmeso and bmeso ctl fe and cluster 3 mmeso and bmeso cu cufe the parameters primarily contributing to pc1 pc3 in fig 10b are characterized as follows pc1 how cu affects indicators of growth particularly for bg pc2 algis increases over time and pc3 positive tfe green algae association accompanied by negative chalkophore loading fig 10a shows clear separation of cluster 2 pc1 and cluster 3 pc1 cluster 2 pc1 values correspond to mmeso and bmeso without cu whereas cluster 3 corresponds to mmeso and bmeso with cu as pc1 describes how cu affects growth particularly for bg cluster 3 has low pc1 values while cluster 2 no cu signifies no cu toxicity or positive pc1 also in fig 10a pc3 0 demarcates dmeso and mmeso with bmeso in between which is sensible since des totg and tfen are the biggest contributors to pc3 dmeso contains more des compared to bmeso des was not added to mmeso and t0 des contained higher tfe see sm though des has the highest tfe in pc3 ug and tfe load together i e t0 des tfe is not the only aspect of fe concentration providing discrimination chalkophore variation by amendment suggests that pc3 chalkophore loads negatively to tfe in consequence of higher chalkophore in bg dominated mesocosms and as a result of fe status in mediating chalkophore production in ctl section 3 6 separation between cu and non cu amendments in pc2 versus pc1 plots is more complex per the solid black diagonal line in fig 10c e temporal shifts parallel to this line relate to growth since pc1 and pc2 are loaded by growth indicators pc1 and pc2 are loaded by bg and algis respectively which explains the variable rate of change in pc1 versus pc2 in fig 10c e t0 is centered at pc1 0 and pc2 3 solid grey ellipses wherein mmeso have greater pc1 more bg than dmeso dmeso has greater pc2 more green algae chl a and bmeso is in the middle by t2 pc2 for all mesocosms increases or remains approximately the same for pc1 in contrast all cu decrease substantively dashed grey ellipses while mmeso and bmeso ctl fe increase similarly in pc1 thus pc1 separates cu and non cu mesocosms across the black line for the remainder of the experiments dmeso follows the diagonal black line red solid and dashed arrows over t2 t6 per comments above regarding pc1 pc2 and growth for mmeso and bmeso cu cufe after the t0 t2 decrease in pc1 subsequent changes are in pc2 only vertical dashed green line after the cu toxic effect to bg as the transition to different algal assemblage progresses growth resumes along pc1 pc2 diagonal dashed green line mmeso and bmeso ctl fe change in pc1 and pc2 growth over t0 t2 diagonal solid green line after which there is no further change these mesocosms remain dominated by bg till t6 thus t2 t6 these mesocosms are dominated by bg loaded pc1 changes horizontal solid green line the graphical change of those mesocosms t2 t6 agrees with od cts m cts ef and ph results as bg growth progressed into stationary phase pc1 first shifted to higher values and then later back to lower values by t6 with pca we wanted to know whether variations across the whole data set would discriminate according to initial water used in the otherwise t0 matched mesocosms in fig 10c e notable differences thick black arrows involve growth in st28 versus st3 st13 mmeso and bmeso changes in st28 for mmeso and bmeso t2 t6 are all diminished in comparison to st3 and st13 this finding is most interesting because it applies to ctl fe and cu cufe mesocosms which have very different algal assemblages it is as if to say growth will be diminished for any st28 mesocosm touched by microcystis per fig 3 wherein the maximum od and final od compared to t0 for st28 mesocosms averages 55 that of st3 st13 this echos again the concept of something in the water or not so what could something be the high equalizing t0 np amended effectively rules out macronutrient based causation other water quality indicators see sm discussion are not likely our discussion herein suggests that microcystin is not the direct cause however chalkophore siderophore trajectories are very different for st28 and t0 tdfe is half that of st3 st13 remaining lower t2 t6 relative to amendment sm why would the tdfe differ by a factor of two in this polymictic ergo relatively short water retention time relatively well mixed lake the most likely explanation that we have seen relates to fan et al s work 2018 demonstrating how different bacterial consortia affect fe biogeochemistry prior work shows mn fe limitation in eastern taihu including st28 fan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and references therein chalkophore siderophore trajectories clearly concern the reaction of algae associated bacteria to the mesocosm environments particularly to the status of cu fe mns the evidence that we present here clearly shows 1 the difficulty of keeping fe bioavailable in more realistic experiments compared to lab studies more detail in sm 2 the lower tdfe in st28 water as collected and as amended over time more detail in sm 3 the increased production of siderophore chalkophore in microcystis dominated mesocosms i e strong cu fe chelating ligands that microorganisms may produce to modulate the bioavailability of cu fe while the work herein cannot be considered as fully conclusive it strongly supports a model wherein fe cu fe mns biogeochemistry is a fundamental control on the absence of hab formation in eastern taihu 4 conclusions the results presented herein show the following with respect to cu fe effects on bloom forming algae in a highly impacted environment the 50 µg l level of amended cu with or without fe favors changes to green algae as dominant species over microcystis spp this starkly contrasts our previous work wherein 20 µg l cu strongly stimulated growth and effected assemblage changes that sometimes favored microcystis spp given this narrow concentration difference with two very different outcomes responsible whole lake management of algae using cu is untenable we observe neither dramatic cu modulation of fe demand for algae that can switch from fe based cyt c6 to cu based plastocyanin in electron transfer nor evidence of an fe protective effect from cu toxicity as observed in multiple lab studies underscoring the desirability of relatively more complex field experimentation we report a first example of coupled chalkophore siderophore production and use of cta using cta represents an important innovation since chalkophore and siderophore production is not cotemporaneous our results support a concept model wherein for microcystis dominated mesocosms siderophore production is differentially increased in the presence of bioaccessible fe and subsequent chalkophore production is fe modulated lower fe increases cu demand chalkophore production though reports show that microcystin can function as a siderophore we find no microcystin siderophore correlation however we find that microcystin production is lower with fe and a hitherto unreported discovery of a microcystin chalkophore link microcystin and chalkophore production both accompany fe shortage indicating response to fe limitation despite rapid diminution of amended bioavailable tdfe there are multiple significant differences in individual parameters for fe that are more pronounced for st28 pca also shows that st28 behavior is differentiable from st3 and st13 across all mesocosms that are microcystis dominated by t6 the explanation that is consistent with other literature reports involves the different bacterial communities known to be in this part of the lake and how these affect 1 fe status t0 tdfe in st28 is half that of the other stations and amended tdfe declines more rapidly for st28 than for st3 st13 and 2 more intense chalkophore siderophore cta trajectories are associated with st28 fe status the evidence presented here implicating variable mn bioavailability and demonstrating coupled chalkophore siderophore and microcystin production in response to varying mn is a first step and warrants further research including expression profiles of genes involved in synthesis of chalkophore siderophore and microcystin and how these are activated

17103,relatively little work has been done on the role of micronutrients in influencing development and progression of harmful algal blooms yet micronutrients are ineluctably required for growth relatively small changes in micronutrient status have wide ranging consequences here we report results from mesocosm experiments with microcystis and desmodesmus spp in mono and mixed cultures to probe questions of how copper iron and copper iron amendments affect growth short term assemblage progression and production of siderophore chalkophore and microcystin in lake water from a large hypereutrophic lake taihu china our approach offers an entirely new perspective to understanding micronutrient dynamics in aqueous environments as this is the first work to systematically screen for chalkophores and siderophores separately as a function of copper iron amendment and using community trajectory analysis singular findings are summarized as follows 1 unlike lab based studies in our work we observe neither dramatic copper modulation of iron demand nor evidence of an iron protective effect from copper toxicity 2 the interplay between chalkophore siderophore production supports a concept model wherein microcystis spp varies behavior to individually and uniquely manage copper iron requirements in a phased manner in being able to specifically screen for chalkophores we observe a previously unreported link between chalkophore and microcystin production that may relate to iron limitation 3 regarding harmful algal bloom hab persistance the lake water itself influences mesocosm changes differentiated effects for iron regarding growth indicators and or reduction of fe limitation stress were found at an hab free field station xukou bay likely a consequence of low bioavailability of iron in this station as compared to hab impacted stations half the initial dissolved iron concentration persisting throughout experiments the low dissolved iron accompanies more

in influencing hab development and progression facey et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 which is therefore an important and largely neglected topic we previously found statistically significant effects of algal growth limitation for b co cu and fe zhang et al 2019 fe is frequently limiting in marine environments boyd et al 2007 tripathy and jena 2019 and there have been some reports for freshwater nagai et al 2007 molot et al 2010 mns have an interesting role in regard to environmental management since relatively minor inputs changes could potentially have pronounced effects for example cu has been suggested at concentrations on the order of 100 ppb as an algal biocide for use in hab management wu et al 2017 at 20 ppb cu however we found a tremendous stimulatory effect zhang et al 2019 suggesting that hab management with cu may not always be advisable the environmental bioavailability of fe is often low yet some phytoplankton have relatively high cellular requirements brand 1991 schoffman et al 2016 some studies report cu fe interactions whereby cu facilitates fe uptake schoffman et al 2016 and in previous work we were unable to discount that cu amendment induced increased fe bioavailability zhang et al 2019 synergistic np mn interactions involving fe e g phototroph n metabolism is sensitive to fe limitation quigg 2008 have contributed to conceptualization of the extended redfield ratio ho et al 2003 in addition to np mn synergies there are well known mn mn interactions for algae as early as 1987 stauber and florence 1987 observed that fe reduced cu toxicity to different algal species which they attributed to cu scavenging by a layer of fe hydroxide on algal cell surfaces thus reducing cellular cu penetration recently kochoni and fortin 2019 also found that fe ameliorates cu toxicity to the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii an effect rationalized via the biotic ligand model blm i e fe blocks cu receptor binding that initiates toxic response fe hydroxide scavenging or blm theories cannot explain the stimulatory effect we observed for cu we hypothesized zhang et al 2019 a cu fe link involving bacterial or algal production of strong fe and cu binding ligands respectively called siderophores saha et al 2016 and chalkophores solioz 2018 which have demonstrated importance in aiding organisms to navigate the divide between mn nutrition and toxicity in 1980 mcknight and morel 1980 found that fe limitation caused anabaena species to secrete strong cu binding ligands they speculated that cu ligand complexes reduced cu2 conveying an advantage to cyanophytes in another example nicolaisen et al 2010 reported that at low fe and cu anabaena spp secrete the siderophore schizokinen to complex with fe and increase its bioavailability to these organisms at high cu low fe concentrations cu schizokinen complexation lowers cu intake toxicity and synthesis of another fe transporter is activated similarly for p aeruginosa toxic cu concentrations caused siderophore production that conveyed a cu protective effect braud et al 2010 the literature we found concerning coupled cu fe effects is from laboratory studies on algal monocultures which is very different from field settings also the environmental half life of some mn binding ligands is relatively low maldonado et al 2005 more so than lab studies ewhat happens in field settings is relevant to mns and environmental management whole lake management has been much discussed carpenter et al 1987 nault et al 2014 paerl et al 2016 hanson et al 2017 including habs and using cu to control microcystis jančula and maršálek 2011 if cu fe links affect chalkophore siderophore production this affects cu fe bioavailability and whole lake management of habs using cu may have unanticipated side effects certainly a better understanding is needed including field settings before implementing whole lake cu application particularly in geographical settings with highly variable ecosystem s dynamics across a regional scale here we examine how cu and fe amendments affect small scale mesocosms initiated with microcystis and desmodesmus spp using lake water from a large hypereutrophic lake that has widely varying algal ecology geographically our field area is taihu lake tai 太湖 in chinese china s third largest freshwater lake 2 338 km2 surface area catchment area 36 900 km2 located in a rapidly developing region yangtze delta qin et al 2007 cyanobacterial habs have impacted taihu every summer since the mid 1980s due to environmental change human impacts qin et al 2007 wang et al 2009 hence taihu has become a locus of field studies to understand hab management we monitored mesocosm changes for 25 standard water quality parameters plus three biomolecules chalkophore siderophore and microcystin chalkophore screening is new zhang et al 2020a and this is the first work to analyze chalkophores and siderophores separately and as a function of cu fe chalkophore siderophore results are not well characterized by standard time series analysis and we use community trajectory analysis cta a powerful new approach in ecological studies we also apply multivariate analysis to the full 28 parameter data set results offer an entirely new perspective to understanding mn dynamics in aqueous environments summarizing we find 1 cu fe impacts on growth and community progression do not agree with lab based findings 2 there is an interplay between chalkophore siderophore production wherein microcystis spp varies behavior to manage cu fe requirements including a link between chalkophore and microcystin and 3 the lake water itself influences mesocosm changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area collection and treatment of lake water taihu is a polymictic lake located 150 km west of shanghai lake center 31 10ʹ0ʺn 120 90ʹ0ʺe water samples were collected during an hab in august 2018 at three stations fig 1 monitored quarterly by niglas nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences meiliang bay station 3 st3 receives large amounts of untreated wastewater via the liang and zhihu rivers paerl et al 2011 accordingly recurring and increasing microcystis dominated habs often originate at st3 qin et al 2007 xukou bay st28 has a high density of macrophytes and is typically unimpacted by habs gonghu bay st13 located in between st3 and st28 is usually less impacted by habs compared to st3 these three stations were selected for sampling based on our previous work zhang et al 2019 wherein we found that water chemistry is different and significant differences were found in mn mesocosm experiments for these stations forty l water samples from 0 2 m below the surface were collected into acid cleaned polyethylene carboys all work was conducted trace metals clean using ultrapure water upw water temperature ph turbidity and dissolved oxygen were measured in the field using a ysi 6600 sonde water samples were filtered immediately after collection using whatman gf f glass fiber filters nominal pore size 0 7 μm to remove in situ phytoplankton due to filter clogging when filtering 40 l many filters must be used and small amounts of in situ algae algis are introduced to the filtrate from transfer during filter changes confirmed to be below the limit of detection lod by microscopic counting and automated cell counts 2 2 algal cultures microcystis was selected as the main hab forming species in taihu qin et al 2007 also reportedly sensitive to cu wu et al 2017 desmodesmus was selected as a contrasting non nuisance green alga with a relative tolerance to cu buayam et al 2019 also having been used as a model microcystis competitor in lab studies chang et al 2012 omidi et al 2019 microcystis 99 microcystis spp from microscopic examination were collected from meiliang bay during an hab desmodesmus was purchased from aquatic biology services wuxi zhongshun biotechnology co

collected concentrated by coarse filtration 2 3 nutrient limitation bioassays nlbs the nlb used here is a small scale field mesocosm study that possesses an element of control akin to lab experiments improved reproducibility isolation of variables resulting basis for tractable hypotheses while also offering environmental reality e g diel cycles temperature conditions that lab experiments lack spivak et al 2011 meta analysis by elser et al 2007 and spivak et al 2011 on 1060 nlb experiments spanning a wide range of volumetric as little as 0 02 l and temporal 0 7 days scales concluded that the approach is applicable to larger scale processes their findings confirm the suitability of nlbs for our large factorial experiment that screens for potential environmental mn effects we designed nlb amendments as follows table 1 1 no added cu fe control ctl 2 50 µg l cu 3 200 µg l fe and 4 cu and fe cufe at the dose used for each individually all had np to ensure that these are non limiting and to focus on the effects of cu fe and cu fe concentrations of np and fe were the same used previously zhang et al 2019 and references therein wherein significant growth promotion was observed for fe cu concentration was increased 2 5 times over previous work zhang et al 2019 to levels reportedly toxic to microcystis wu et al 2017 to observe how this affects mesocosm progression we also varied the chemical form of fe table 1 for fe only we used fecitrate a solubilized and exchangeable more bioavailable 1 1 here we adhere to the terminology of semple et al 2004 whereby bioavailability references only the amount of a substance available to an organism at a given time which is distinguished from bioaccessibility i e that which could potential become or be rendered bioavailable as an outgrowth of some decades of study bioavailability and bioaccessibility of micronutrients and other species are generally recognized to be a function of chemical speciation i e per campbell 1995 as an example form of fe sutak et al 2012 quigg 2016 mustoe 2018 we used fecl3 6h2o for cufe which as a less bioavailable form due to the formation of insoluble fe oxyhydroxides lis et al 2015 von der heyden and roychoudhury 2015 jiménez et al 2019 was to test whether the response of algae to cu will have an influence on the bioavailability of fe trials were also conducted to see if mn effects differ for mono and mixed cultures we designate these trials as mmeso dosed with microcystis spp dmeso desmodesmus spp and bmeso 1 1 mixture of microcystis and desmodesmus by od or both to perform nlbs filtered lake water was divided into three portions and dosed with algae to a starting optical density at 750 nm od750 hereafter od of 0 05 given the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of algae free water from natural water it was given that algis species might grow in our mesocosms over time our prior work found that mns may mediate changes in algal assemblages zhang et al 2019 which is a possible outcome of interest our primary criterion of importance for nlb experimental design is that the initial conditions for all mesocosms are controlled for each nlb permutation station water used algae dosed amendment type triplicate subsamples were placed into 1 l transparent chemically inert cubitainers which were then spiked to achieve the final concentrations of np and mn table 1 the cubitainers were then incubated in situ in taihu near the surface at tller samples for analysis were collected from initial water initial algal suspensions t0 and then each cubitainer was sampled

other chl a is not as strongly correlated with cts ef cts m and esv as od a consequence of chl a s not being solely related to cell number or volume ignatiades et al 1985 and that different algae have

chalkophore and siderophore correlate positively with od ph and cts ef and chalkophore specifically correlate with bg as expected tdn no3 correlate negatively with growth indicators and the strong

further discussion regarding np macronutrients and cu fe correlations for individual station data correlations are comparatively stronger for st13 than for st3 st28 however st3 st13 patterns in pair wise correlation are more similar compared to st28 such differences are discussed where relevant in subsequent sections 3 3 temporal changes of algal growth indicators fig 3 shows od and ph versus time for all stations and amendments there is a strong od ph correlation ρ 0 78 p 0 001 fig 2 as od and ph are both primary consequences of growth ph increases due to inorganic carbon scavenging wang et al 2017 for mmeso ctl fe both parameters increase then decrease indicating onset of stationary phase by t2 where differences exist mmeso od and ph are higher for fe than ctl p 0 05 during growth t2 for st3 whereas post stationary fe ctl differences are for st13 and st28 much more so for st28 by t6 indicating that st28 ctl growth has started to taper with an ameliorating affect for fe considering that st28 t0 tdfe is half of the other stations and that fe can limit microcystis growth fujii et al 2016 the st28 difference between ctl and fe may be caused by fe limitation cu for mmeso caused inhibition with or without fe od for mmeso cu showed a decrease t0 t2 while ph showed no increase from microscopic examination we know that this is from a cu induced diminution in bg microcystis for mmeso cu od slowly recovered with simultaneous ph increases t2 t6 per results in section 3 4 this results from algis increases also with cu there are indications that fe exerts a positive effect notably ph has risen for cufe much more than for cu by t4 for dmeso od drops t0 t2 likely a result of incomplete acclimatization after a longer induction than mmeso dmeso od for all amendments entered logarithmic growth phase with substantive increase of od ph by t6 there were no differences by amendment except that st3 fe had higher ph compared to cu cufe p 0 01 at t4 by t6 the benefit of fe disappeared comparing od ph results for mmeso and dmeso dmeso had a greater ability to cope with the amended level of 50 µg l cu consistent with other research on green algae buayam et al 2019 wu et al 2017 other metrics used as growth indicators include counts and chl a per fig 2 od strongly correlates with cts ef and cts m see sm for further discussion the od chl a correlation is not as strong ρ 0 64 p 0 001 as we detail herein fig 4 shows chl a versus time normalized to t0 by mesocosm to show relative changes t0 chl a are given in the figure caption fe increases chl a production in mmeso with or without cu and shows higher chl a compared to ctl by t2 st3 and st28 p 0 05 chl a in st28 mmeso ctl is less than half of mmeso fe by t6 p 0 05 which agrees with od results that cu at 50 µg l severely impairs mmeso chl a fully agrees with od and ph results however the mmeso od results for cu cufe are still lower than for ctl and fe by t6 and the reverse is true for chl a p 0 05 this corresponds to algal assemblage changes for cu cufe after t2 the od versus chl a plot in fig 5 illustrates how different algal assemblages details in section 3 4 contribute to chl a the slopes for dmeso and samples becoming green algae dominated mmeso and bmeso cu cufe are less than corresponding slopes for microcystis dominated samples mmeso and bmeso ctl fe such that for any given increase in od the corresponding increase in chl a is less for the latter in our work on taihu we have found that microcystis consistently have relatively lower chl a than green algae which has also been observed by others ghadouani and ralph 2005 for microcystis dominated samples chl a is consistent with od and ph increasing to t2 then diminishing on entering stationary phase with fe ctl for chl a st3 st28 p 0 05 during the period of growth up to t2 similar to od fe increases chl a in mmeso with or without cu chl a in st28 mmesoctl is less than half of mmeso fe by t6 p 0 05 which also agrees with od results though mmeso cu cufe od are still lower than for ctl fe by t6 the reverse is true for chl a p 0 05 this reflects algal assemblage changes for cu cufe after t2 like od dmeso chl a dropped substantively by t2 fig 4 compared to ctl fe cu cufe negatively impacted chl a production in dmeso at t4 cu fe st3 st28 cufe fe st3 st28 p 0 05 consistent with küpper et al s 2003 results showing a cu induced temporary drop in chl a for the desmid scenedesmus quadricauda this might be explained by the negative effect that mg2 substitution by cu2 in the chl a complex has been documented to have on chl a synthesis at first küpper et al 2003 until cu detoxification mechanisms in the green algae overcome this sub lethal cu toxicity and chl a synthesis is restored to control levels as observed at t6 fig 4 as with od and ph chl a of green algae dominated samples fig 4 and 5 increased with time though mmeso cu cufe contain predominantly green algae from t2 grouping with dmeso in fig 5 unlike dmeso there are some differences between cu and cufe noted above for mmeso chl a levels show cufe cu during t2 t6 though this is not observed by t6 for st28 the difference in chl a results for st28 may reflect fe limitation fujii et al 2016 per od ph results and for st28 relating to other observations below differentiating st28 chl a correlation with totg is comparatively stronger in st3 and st13 3 4 how amendments affect algal assemblages cts m remain unsurpassed for simple determination of species density assemblage changes and cell condition butterwick et al 1982 transition from blue green to green algae from varying np carbon sources has been long known shapiro 1973 and we previously found that mn also mediate algal assemblage changes zhang et al 2019 because of our experimental design we anticipated that algis might cause algal assemblage changes over the course of our field experiments and that changes might reflect initial conditions or cu fe amendment fig 6 shows time dependent changes in cts m of algae groups by amendment at t0 algal species and cts m are as expected since the mixture in bmeso was effected according to od des in dmeso constitute larger but fewer individuals and thus t0 bg microcystis cts m is greater than des in bmeso for t2 t6 the compositions of the five algal groups were as follows bg were 97 microcystis with smaller amounts of chroococcus and pseudoanabaena des were primarily desmodesmus with occasional occurrences of scenedesmus ug included mixtures ofcarteria and chlorella 81 not always easily differentiable with lesser amounts ofchalmydamonas dia were mixtures of navicula and nitzschia with minor amounts of asterionella cyclotella andfragilaria each never exceeding 12 and rest constituted low highly variable counts of chlosteriopsis coelastrum dichtyospaerium eudorina haematococcus kirchneriella micractinium monoraphidium oocystis pediastrum planktosphaeria radiococcus schrodeiria tetraedron mallomonas chroomonas chryptomonas and trachelomonas a striking feature in fig 6 is by t2 mmeso cu cufe amendment resulted in replacement of microcystis by other groups through to t6 i e microcystis is more sensitive to the cu concentrations that we use compared to other freshwater algae consistent with zeng et al s 2010 report of an ic50 of 25 5 µg l for microcystis whereas buayam et al 2019 and wan et al 2018 reported that desmodesmus and chlorella can tolerate higher cu concentrations fig 6 suggests that excretion of cu protective compounds e g nicolaisen et al 2010 is non operative or non effective for mmeso cu cufe also apparent in fig 6 is that when microcystis is not impacted it retains its place mmeso or gains ground bmeso over other species which may partially result from more efficient bg co2 uptake at high ph king 1970 shapiro 1973 the proportionate increase of des in dmeso was slower than ug growth and ug consistently dominated dmeso by t6 des may have been less competitive due to incomplete acclimatization changes in bmeso ctl fe assemblages followed those for mmeso albeit not as dramatically microcystis was the major species t0 t6 average 77 minimum 61 while des averaged 34 at t0 decreasing 17 on average maximum 37 in bmeso by t6 since different algae grow at different rates results may be considered in terms of auc see sm to obtain comparative information on integrated growth growth inhibition documented for microcystis dong et al 2019 omidi et al 2019 or stimulation i e mono versus mixed cultures stockenreiter et al 2012 smith and crews 2014 fig 7 shows auc for the four main algal groups bg des ug dia in panels a d respectively auc is normalized to the station maximum to show relative scale cts m for bg of mmeso and des of dmeso are divided by two for comparison with bmeso proportionate t0 conditions since cts m for bg des in bmeso were half those of bg in mmeso and des in dmeso respectively p 0 05 results in fig 7a and b imply that bg and des grow better in mixed culture on average auc for bg in bmeso ctl fig 7a is higher by 35 than bg in mmeso ctl p 0 05 for fe auc for bg in bmeso is 27 higher than for mmeso though p 0 15 the difference being least for st13 not significant and most for st28 p 0 007 looking at des fig 7b for ctl auc for bmeso is 30 greater than dmeso however this is not statistically significant on average or station to station for fe des counts in bmeso average 25 greater than for dmeso significantly for st3 and st13 p 0 05 for des cu cufe there is no apparent difference in in dmeso versus bmeso ug and dia are algis with comparable t0 amounts by station hence are plotted differently than bg des no consistent station to station differences were observed thus plots show station averages ug auc fig 7c is consistently most variable and highest in dmeso on average by more than a factor of two compared to mmeso bmeso cu cufe for mmeso and bmeso auc for cu cufe ctl fe p 0 05 except for mmeso cu ctl and cufe ctl p 0 07 and 0 08 respectively our data show as others find chen et al 2016 wan et al 2018 that ug copes with cu comparing dmeso ctl fe to cu cufe however the presence of microcystis is inhibiting dong et al 2019 omidi et al 2019 which effect persists even when the original microcystis population is diminished logically lysis and release of microcystin is expected with bg microcystis diminution in cu cufe shen et al 2019 that microcystin is labile in field surface water welker and steinberg 2000 chen et al 2008 possibly accounts for higher ug auc with cu cufe in mmeso and bmeso while lysing cells may transiently increase solution microcystin live cells are able to provide continuous flux of microcystin and toxic secondary metabolites flux being in some ways more relevant than load tecon et al 2006 omidi et al 2019 for dia cts m are low and variability high averaging stations does not increase this the dia auc is higher for cu cufe versus ctl fe in mmeso and bmeso p 0 05 in contrast dmeso dia is higher in ctl compared to cu cufe p 0 05 on an average and station to station basis uncertainty is higher for fe dmeso dia fe cu cufe though not significantly p 0 21 unlike fig 7a c which respectively show growth that is favored or inhibited in mixed culture mmeso and bmeso are not different dia for mmesocu cufe suggest growth despite this cu level perhaps dia grow better in these mesocosms because of increased don bronk et al 2007 see np discussion in the sm or because the additional don dop in these mesocosms complex cu in a protective manner zeng et al 2010 however we are cautious about such inferences due to low cts m 3 5 temporal changes in amended nutrients here we summarize np and cu fe results for full discussion see sm three np changes are most interesting relevant to other results first don dop is higher in cu cufe bg containing mesocosms consistent with cu induced algal death and subsequent cycling into dissolved organic matter second no2 increases in mesocosms having active in growth of ug we postulate that this likely results from different bacterial assemblages in these third all mmeso irrespective of amendment are steady state for p i e the rate of p production from organic matter cycling is equal to the rate of p uptake by algae and or bacteria we posit see sm that this is also an effect of bacterial assemblages however as the effect is not a function of amendment it is less relevant to our focus regarding cu fe tcu tfe were conserved for t0 t6 and tdcu tdfe arrived at or near steady state by t2 for tdcu dmeso uptake for cu cufe amendments was 50 greater than that of mmeso on average for tdfe results were unexpected having used different forms of fe by design section 2 3 we anticipated that fecitrate in fe would exhibit a greater longer term dissolved phase availability than the fecl3 6h2o used for cufe instead by t2 fe in both fe cufe had become tfe of some form differences in tdfe as a function of amendment are generally not large though for st3 and st13 by t4 the tdfe averages 30 less for ctl fe than for cu cufe 3 6 relationships between cu fe amendment and biomolecule production this field based work is the first to study chalkophore and siderophore production using assays differentiating the two chalkophores are defined as being ligands that have very strong and as compared to other metals very high association complexation constants for cu saha et al 2016 and analogously siderophores are ligands that have differentially stronger fe binding behavior until recently studies have relied on techniques that do not differentiate the two according to the operational classes of chalkophores being ligands that bind to cu more strongly than fe and siderophores being ligands that bind to fe more strongly than cu prior work that is not able to separate chalkophores from siderophores as operational classes includes for instance studies that characterize strong cu binding ligands when it is increasingly recognized that many siderophores are strong cu binding ligands and the so called strong cu binding ligands in question might be siderophores jones and hart 1989 baptista et al 2014 solioz 2018 i e many methods in use do not explicitly separate chalkophore from siderophore the method we use here zhang et al 2020a specifically distinguishes chalkophore from siderophore and the present work is the first to use this approach that specifically differentiates chalkophores from siderophores we analyzed results using cta recently adduced as a fresh perspective on dynamic aspects of population community changes de cáceres et al 2019 please see section s2 5 in the sm for more commentary and results fig 8 a f illustrates the cta concept a b and summarizes selected chalkophore siderophore results c g fig 8a shows time sequence data for model variables x and y similar to results we report e g od in fig 3 chl a in fig 4 fig 8b shows what model x y pairs look like as trajectories in community space prominently without an x y phase difference a trajectory becomes a line hence subject to correlation analysis or for instance pca calculated from a correlation matrix phase differences however are commonly present between variables in community ecological data bischof and zedrosser 2009 and may efface correlation cta is multivariate however we use two dimensions of community space to simplify understanding of results and eliminate noise from potentially unrelated parameters fig 8c shows representative chalkophore siderophore trajectories those trajectories with substantial shape angularity are counter clockwise angularity results from increase in siderophore relative to chalkophore initially followed by increasing chalkophore and in some cases by subsequent decreasing chalkophore siderophore the diagonal line shows a chalkophore siderophore ratio that dmeso trajectories never exceed whereas mmeso commonly do by more than threefold chalkophore siderophore ratios for bmeso vary being a first study of chalkophore siderophore individually we do not know if this ratio represents a stoichiometric cellular process the t0 t2 increase in mmeso and bmeso siderophore for ctl fe is higher than for other mesocosms by an average factor of 3 e g fig 8c mmeso ctl versus fe though less pronounced for st28 mmeso for which by t2 fe siderophore is higher than ctl by 50 on average chalkophore increases following siderophore are more variable in magnitude for some trajectories chalkophore siderophore changes are sequential and for some simultaneous possibly relating to sampling period see sm in part these changes relate to growth however not fully see the sm for discussion the trajectories in fig 8c have three segments s1 s3 the simplest trajectory measurements include total segment length fig 8d and angles between segments two angles s1 s2 and s2 s3 fig 8e the former represents the cumulative chalkophore siderophore bivariate change a type of velocity time sequence data see sm while the latter indicates proportionate change between variables i e angularity is absent when variables change at the same rate the mmeso and bmeso ctl trajectories average more than a factor of two longer than the longest trajectories in green algae dominated dmeso or mmeso cu cufe groups after ctl longest trajectories are for mmeso fe followed by bmeso fe for two of three stations mmeso and bmeso ctl fe also differ from other groups in angularity for which s2 s3 averages 360 more than s1 s2 i e palpable disproportionate change in the latter growth stages cta trajectory length is plotted versus angularity to better understand simultaneous trends in both fig 8f angularity plotted as total sum of all angles except for the microcystis dominated mmeso and bmeso ctl fe trajectory lengths are similar in contrast to angularity there is no obvious pattern in angularity other than cufe is high while t0 t2 siderophore fe ctl for mmeso and bmeso overall ctl trajectories are greater since this work is the first to screen for chalkophore and siderophore there is no comparable literature context for results that t0 t2 siderophore production is higher for fe versus ctl may appear counterintuitive however fujii et al 2016 found that microcystis aeruginosa fe uptake rates decreased with increasing fe limitation due to lower fe requirements resulting from adaption to low fe this would explain why microcystis in our mesocosms produce more siderophore for fe there is another interesting implication despite conversion of amended tdfe to tfe by t2 fe bioaccessibility may yet be sensed with aging von der heyden and roychoudhury 2015 jiménez et al 2019 amorphous oxyhydroxides crystallize becoming less labile organisms sensing this i e via reduced flux could adjust siderophore production accordingly concerning chalkophores baptista et al 2014 found that strong cu binding ligand field concentrations were higher during microcystis dominated habs however for their analytical method cu binding siderophore are not differentiable from chalkophore much as t0 t2 siderophore is higher in microcystis dominated fe mesocosms chalkophore production in these may be differentially increased in ctl causing longer trajectories due to fe limitation it is well known that with fe limitation cu based plastocyanin becomes important in photosynthetic electron transfer quigg 2008 causing cu requirements to increase up to ten fold schoffman et al 2016 unlike mcknight and morel 1980 and nicolaisen et al s 2010 results for anabaena discussed in the introduction we find no evidence of chalkophore siderophore mechanisms to protect from cu toxicity in microcystis dominated mesocosms comparing results from mmeso to dmeso perhaps even microcystis susceptibility to cu results from enhanced siderophore and particularly chalkophore production increasing acquisition uptake of cu hadjoudja et al 2010 the meaning of chalkophore and siderophore is explicit molecules that have respectively high association constants for cu and fe zhang et al 2020a the causative basis for microcystis to produce microcystin is as yet unclear omidi et al 2018 ceballos laita et al 2017 reported microcystin fe binding speculating on microcystin s being a siderophore that conveys competitive advantage to microcystis we monitored terminal microcystin concentrations to explore this we find that microcystin produced is higher for ctl versus fe for st3 and st13 fig 9 a consistent with lukač and aegerter 1993 and alexova et al 2011 who found stress triggered microcystin production induced by fe limitation as with other results here st28 which is not subject to habs is different since other factors in experiments are matched equal differences in st28 may be summarized as its something in the water or not as the case may be one apparent difference for st28 that relates to cu or fe binding ligands is tdfe st28 t0 tdfe is half that of st3 st13 for t2 t6 st28 tdfe averages 42 that of st3 and st13 if microcystin production is suppressed when bioaccessible fe is sensed and such is lacking in st28 microcystin for st28 ctl and fe should be similar consistent with our observations we find no relationship between microcystin and siderophore production we do see a possible relationship with chalkophore fig 9b plots chalkophore versus microcystin at t0 dashed ellipse chalkophore is effectively constant rsd 18 and microcystin varies specifically mmeso values are all similar and highest whereas for bmeso in which microcystis cts m are approximately half values are lower and more variable which is expected as for instance one value is below the limit of quantitation to within statistical uncertainty t0 bmeso microcystin is half that of mmeso by t6 for the linear chalkophore microcystin relationship in fig 9b pearson s r 0 78 p 0 005 with spearman s ρ being 0 77 p 0 005 in close agreement our working hypothesis to explain biomolecule results involves microcystis production of siderophores first to capture fe then shifting to production of chalkophore as available accessible fe depletes simultaneously in ctl microcystin increases possibly as a stress reaction or to inhibit other algae microorganisms that might compete for np mn inhibition is consistent with what we observe for ug and dia in fig 7c d this hypothesis explains why ctl fe trajectories lead with siderophore followed by chalkophore and are longest overall for ctl which lacks both cu and fe the greater initial siderophore production for fe bioaccessible less so for st28 fe why microcystin is less for fe and why chalkophore microcystin correlate by t6 st28 values in fig 9b are lowest in part because by t6 population crash has begun our hypothesis concerning fe bioavailability in taihu is consistent with fan et al 2018 and our prior finding that organic matter metal binding affinity hence retention of metal solubility is lowest of 32 monitoring stations across taihu at st28 zhang et al 2020b an objective in biomolecule analysis was to see if high cu causes production of cu bioavailability reducing ligands or a fe linked effect we do not see that instead the cu concentration was toxic to microcystis and we are thus not able to say if cu causes different chalkophore siderophore microcystin production than fe for microcystis we do see interesting effects for fe with the interplay between chalkophore siderophore production and amendment and the potential link between microcystin chalkophore production is very interesting emerging literature concerning the importance of fe and cu as limiting mns and the interplay between cu fe literature cited references therein underscores the importance of this topic the additional potential interrelationships with microcystin production will be interesting to pursue in future work because these classes of molecule are documented to have short half lives in environmental conditions the advent of cta provides a timely and useful new tool for study of both the interplay between time varying production of these molecules and the ability to treat this interplay in terms of multivariate velocities 3 7 pca analysis of full data set we chose pca for multivariate analysis as an approach free from investigator bias and well known for allowing discrimination of data patterns and indications of which individual parameters most influence same e g see zhang et al 2020b pca was performed on temporally complete data t0 t6 results are shown in fig 10 and include a a three dimensional plot of pc1 pc3 b parameters with highest contributions to each pc and c e two dimensional plots of pc1 versus pc2 for st3 st28 pc1 pc3 represent 68 of data set variance pc1 33 3 pc2 21 3 and pc3 13 1 other pcs each account for 6 of total variance see sm for additional pca data and discussion thereof fig 10a shows data separation into three clusters cluster 1 dmeso cluster 2 mmeso and bmeso ctl fe and cluster 3 mmeso and bmeso cu cufe the parameters primarily contributing to pc1 pc3 in fig 10b are characterized as follows pc1 how cu affects indicators of growth particularly for bg pc2 algis increases over time and pc3 positive tfe green algae association accompanied by negative chalkophore loading fig 10a shows clear separation of cluster 2 pc1 and cluster 3 pc1 cluster 2 pc1 values correspond to mmeso and bmeso without cu whereas cluster 3 corresponds to mmeso and bmeso with cu as pc1 describes how cu affects growth particularly for bg cluster 3 has low pc1 values while cluster 2 no cu signifies no cu toxicity or positive pc1 also in fig 10a pc3 0 demarcates dmeso and mmeso with bmeso in between which is sensible since des totg and tfen are the biggest contributors to pc3 dmeso contains more des compared to bmeso des was not added to mmeso and t0 des contained higher tfe see sm though des has the highest tfe in pc3 ug and tfe load together i e t0 des tfe is not the only aspect of fe concentration providing discrimination chalkophore variation by amendment suggests that pc3 chalkophore loads negatively to tfe in consequence of higher chalkophore in bg dominated mesocosms and as a result of fe status in mediating chalkophore production in ctl section 3 6 separation between cu and non cu amendments in pc2 versus pc1 plots is more complex per the solid black diagonal line in fig 10c e temporal shifts parallel to this line relate to growth since pc1 and pc2 are loaded by growth indicators pc1 and pc2 are loaded by bg and algis respectively which explains the variable rate of change in pc1 versus pc2 in fig 10c e t0 is centered at pc1 0 and pc2 3 solid grey ellipses wherein mmeso have greater pc1 more bg than dmeso dmeso has greater pc2 more green algae chl a and bmeso is in the middle by t2 pc2 for all mesocosms increases or remains approximately the same for pc1 in contrast all cu decrease substantively dashed grey ellipses while mmeso and bmeso ctl fe increase similarly in pc1 thus pc1 separates cu and non cu mesocosms across the black line for the remainder of the experiments dmeso follows the diagonal black line red solid and dashed arrows over t2 t6 per comments above regarding pc1 pc2 and growth for mmeso and bmeso cu cufe after the t0 t2 decrease in pc1 subsequent changes are in pc2 only vertical dashed green line after the cu toxic effect to bg as the transition to different algal assemblage progresses growth resumes along pc1 pc2 diagonal dashed green line mmeso and bmeso ctl fe change in pc1 and pc2 growth over t0 t2 diagonal solid green line after which there is no further change these mesocosms remain dominated by bg till t6 thus t2 t6 these mesocosms are dominated by bg loaded pc1 changes horizontal solid green line the graphical change of those mesocosms t2 t6 agrees with od cts m cts ef and ph results as bg growth progressed into stationary phase pc1 first shifted to higher values and then later back to lower values by t6 with pca we wanted to know whether variations across the whole data set would discriminate according to initial water used in the otherwise t0 matched mesocosms in fig 10c e notable differences thick black arrows involve growth in st28 versus st3 st13 mmeso and bmeso changes in st28 for mmeso and bmeso t2 t6 are all diminished in comparison to st3 and st13 this finding is most interesting because it applies to ctl fe and cu cufe mesocosms which have very different algal assemblages it is as if to say growth will be diminished for any st28 mesocosm touched by microcystis per fig 3 wherein the maximum od and final od compared to t0 for st28 mesocosms averages 55 that of st3 st13 this echos again the concept of something in the water or not so what could something be the high equalizing t0 np amended effectively rules out macronutrient based causation other water quality indicators see sm discussion are not likely our discussion herein suggests that microcystin is not the direct cause however chalkophore siderophore trajectories are very different for st28 and t0 tdfe is half that of st3 st13 remaining lower t2 t6 relative to amendment sm why would the tdfe differ by a factor of two in this polymictic ergo relatively short water retention time relatively well mixed lake the most likely explanation that we have seen relates to fan et al s work 2018 demonstrating how different bacterial consortia affect fe biogeochemistry prior work shows mn fe limitation in eastern taihu including st28 fan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and references therein chalkophore siderophore trajectories clearly concern the reaction of algae associated bacteria to the mesocosm environments particularly to the status of cu fe mns the evidence that we present here clearly shows 1 the difficulty of keeping fe bioavailable in more realistic experiments compared to lab studies more detail in sm 2 the lower tdfe in st28 water as collected and as amended over time more detail in sm 3 the increased production of siderophore chalkophore in microcystis dominated mesocosms i e strong cu fe chelating ligands that microorganisms may produce to modulate the bioavailability of cu fe while the work herein cannot be considered as fully conclusive it strongly supports a model wherein fe cu fe mns biogeochemistry is a fundamental control on the absence of hab formation in eastern taihu 4 conclusions the results presented herein show the following with respect to cu fe effects on bloom forming algae in a highly impacted environment the 50 µg l level of amended cu with or without fe favors changes to green algae as dominant species over microcystis spp this starkly contrasts our previous work wherein 20 µg l cu strongly stimulated growth and effected assemblage changes that sometimes favored microcystis spp given this narrow concentration difference with two very different outcomes responsible whole lake management of algae using cu is untenable we observe neither dramatic cu modulation of fe demand for algae that can switch from fe based cyt c6 to cu based plastocyanin in electron transfer nor evidence of an fe protective effect from cu toxicity as observed in multiple lab studies underscoring the desirability of relatively more complex field experimentation we report a first example of coupled chalkophore siderophore production and use of cta using cta represents an important innovation since chalkophore and siderophore production is not cotemporaneous our results support a concept model wherein for microcystis dominated mesocosms siderophore production is differentially increased in the presence of bioaccessible fe and subsequent chalkophore production is fe modulated lower fe increases cu demand chalkophore production though reports show that microcystin can function as a siderophore we find no microcystin siderophore correlation however we find that microcystin production is lower with fe and a hitherto unreported discovery of a microcystin chalkophore link microcystin and chalkophore production both accompany fe shortage indicating response to fe limitation despite rapid diminution of amended bioavailable tdfe there are multiple significant differences in individual parameters for fe that are more pronounced for st28 pca also shows that st28 behavior is differentiable from st3 and st13 across all mesocosms that are microcystis dominated by t6 the explanation that is consistent with other literature reports involves the different bacterial communities known to be in this part of the lake and how these affect 1 fe status t0 tdfe in st28 is half that of the other stations and amended tdfe declines more rapidly for st28 than for st3 st13 and 2 more intense chalkophore siderophore cta trajectories are associated with st28 fe status the evidence presented here implicating variable mn bioavailability and demonstrating coupled chalkophore siderophore and microcystin production in response to varying mn is a first step and warrants further research including expression profiles of genes involved in synthesis of chalkophore siderophore and microcystin and how these are activated

17104,adhesion is one of the main features of sewage sludge this paper aims at reducing sludge to wall adhesion through formation of a water layer induced by boundary electro osmotic pulse beop which is characterized by distributing anodes and cathodes on one surface and exerting a pulsating current the effects of the related parameters including current intensity exerting time frequency duty cycle dtc and the ratio of cathodic surface area to anodic surface area c a on the adhesive stress of sewage sludge with different moisture content were thoroughly studied the results indicated that under the optimal conditions of beop the adhesive stress of sludge with moisture content of 35 45 60 and 70 was reduced by 40 4 54 5 31 and 24 4 respectively the migrations of water ions and organic matters were also investigated to explore the functional mechanism of beop the results showed that the water migrated from the anode side to the cathode side whereas the organic matters migrated in the opposite direction the increment of the sludge moisture content on the cathode surface was reduced with the increase of distance away from the anode based on theoretical modeling the distributions of current density and temperature in sludge cake were obtained the current flowed from anode to cathode and decayed quickly with the increase of the flowing distance which well explained the moisture content distribution in sludge cake graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge electro osmotic pulse adhesion stickiness drying 1 introduction as a type of solid waste from wastewater treatment plant sludge treatment and disposal has become an increasingly important task for environmental protection high moisture content is one of the main characteristics of sewage sludge thus dewatering and drying are important steps for volume reduction and further utilization of sludge like incineration pyrolysis agricultural utilization landscaping etc tunçal and uslu 2014 dassanayake et al 2015 wu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 stickiness is also a main feature of wet sludge reflecting the tendency of materials adhering to contact surfaces or to agglomerates li et al 2014 it will exert a negative effect on sludge dewatering drying pipe transportation etc peeters et al 2013 deng et al 2017 baudez et al 2016 for example sticky sludge will greatly increase the flow resistance and consume more energy during pipe transportation slatter 2008 it is well known that sludge will pass through a sticky region during thermal drying which greatly lowers the drying efficiency of sludge dryers deng et al 2009 ferrase et al 2002 it was reported that the sticky feature of drying sludge represents 95 of problems in sludge dewatering and drying installations peeters et al 2013 in view of the adverse impact of stickiness much attention has been paid to lowering the stickiness of sewage sludge as a relatively mature solution to sludge stickiness back mixing is a method of lowering the moisture content mc calculated by eq 1 of sewage sludge by mixing dried sludge with wet sludge to go over the sticky region during sludge treatment léonard et al 2008 similar to the back mixing of dried sludge there are also reports about the mixing of wet sludge with dry solids like lignite and saw dust to reduce sludge adhesion deng et a 2017 hamawand et al 2015 however many drawbacks still exist in this method 1 the high mass ratio of dried sludge is required for back mixing e g 1 kg of the totally dried sludge is demanded for lowering 1 kg of wet sludge from the mc of 80 to 40 2 much energy will be dissipated in heating up the back mixed dried sludge during thermal drying 3 the abrasion of installations will become severer due to the high percentage of dried sludge 4 the handling capacity of installations will be decreased 5 back mixing will also complicate the sludge treatment system peeters et al 2013 investigated the application of polyaluminiumchloride pacl as a conditioner for activated sludge prior its dewatering and drying it was found that the shear stress of sludge with mc of 54 over a steel surface was reduced by 35 attributed to the lubrication effect of bound hydration water and that the maximal torque of a screw conveyor for conveying sludge was reduced by 20 chen et al 2016 studied the effects of ferric chloride fecl3 and polyacrylamide pam on the stickiness of activated sludge and found that by introducing 4 wt of fecl3 or 0 6 wt of pam into the sludge the adhesive stress was decreased by 25 and 17 4 respectively jing et al 1999 also investigated the effect of fecl3 on sludge dewatering and subsequent detachment from filter cloth and found that sludge mass of residue on the filter cloth was decreased by more than 90 at a fecl3 dose of 52 li et al 2012 found that the sludge build up on a metal surface was markedly reduced by introducing 1 5 ds dry solids of calcium oxide cao or calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 deng et al 2017 2020b also studied the effect of cao 5 8 wet sludge basis on sludge stickiness and obtained the contrary results which showed that the adhesive and cohesive stress of sewage sludge and the sludge build up on a hot metal surface 140 200 c were markedly increased by cao addition yang 2019 found that the sludge adhesion on a metal surface can be inhibited when the surface was covered by a teflon layer but this method will be difficult to apply in practice due to the low wear resistance of the teflon materials ma et al 2016 found that the adhesion of sludge pretreated by electro osmosis was decreased by about 23 and the possible explanation is the changes in water distribution and the quantity of extracellular polymeric substances eps ma et al 2007 also conducted an application of a polarized electric field to reduce the adhesion of wet sludge to dryer wall and found that a water layer was formed on the cathode by electro osmosis leading to a great reduction of the adhesion intensity in fact there are many reports about the application of the electro osmosis based adhesion reduction in mechanical tunnel driving and shale drilling roy and cooper 1991 cooper and roy 1994 hariharan et al 1998 spagnoli et al 2011 in these reports the anode and cathode plates were arranged in parallel similar to the arrangement of electrodes in the traditional electro osmotic dewatering mahmoud et al 2010 this study tried to explore a new method of sludge adhesion reduction based on a boundary electro osmotic pulse beop there are some reports about a solution to soil adhesion through a surface electro osmosis applied in terrain machines ren et al 2001 ren 2009 muhammad et al 2010 however to the best of our knowledge there is no published research about the application of beop on sludge adhesion reduction the main differences of beop with the traditional electro osmosis method are that 1 anodes and cathodes are distributed on a surface to constitute an electrode plate in other words the electrode plate is made of many anodes and cathodes thus the metal surface of sludge treatment installations in contact with sludge can be replaced by the electrode plate to lower the sludge adhesion which makes it possible for wide application in sludge treatment installations like pipeline transportation mechanical dewatering and thermal drying 2 our previous research shows that electro osmotic pulse eop showed marked advantages in promoting water migration and lowering energy consumption deng et al 2020a therefore eop was exerted on the electrodes for realizing electro osmotic flow in this study the effects of current intensity exerting time frequency duty cycle dtc the ratio of the cathode surface area to the anode surface area c a on the adhesive stress of sewage sludge were systematically studied to further explore the functional mechanisms of beop the migrations of moisture ions and organic matters oms were experimentally studied coupled with the theoretical modeling of the distributions of current density and temperature in sludge cake 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the sludge used in this study was a type of mechanically dewatered sewage sludge which was sampled from an anaerobic oxic municipal wastewater treatment plant located in shanghai the moisture content mc of sludge sample was determined by air drying under 105 c for 24 h and was calculated according to eq 1 1 mc mass of water in wet sludge mass of wet sludge 100 other important properties of the sludge sample including ph oms zeta potential and electric conductivity were determined according to the methods introduced in our previous report deng et al 2020a the ash and fixed carbon content of the sludge sample were determined according to the method gb t 30732 2014 each parameter was tested in triplicate and the results with the 95 confidence interval are shown in table 1 in order to examine the adhesive stress of sludge with the different mc sludge samples with the mc of 70 60 45 and 35 were prepared for experimental tests 2 2 experimental set up and design 2 2 1 experimental set up fig 1 shows the experimental set up which includes a beop unit and an adhesive stress testing unit the beop unit was composed of a direct current dc power supply mp 5020d china a frequency generator a solid state relay and an electrode plate 20 cm width 27 cm length 1 cm thickness which was composed of anode bars and cathode bars the bars were made of 316 l stainless steel separated by teflon slices with thickness of 0 5 mm the adhesive stress testing unit was composed of a teflon cylinder inner diameter of 6 cm a massive cylinder 1200 g a pulley wheel steel balls a container and the electrode plate 2 2 2 operational principle of beop the voltage of the dc power supply can be regulated between 0 50 v fig 2 shows the wave form of pulsating current which pulsated between 0 a power off and a specific value power on located between 0 1 0 6 a at a frequency of 0 10 20 30 or 40 hz the power on and off was controlled by the solid state relay through the signals released from the frequency generator duty cycle dtc denotes the percentage of the power on time in one pulsating period and was set at 0 25 50 75 and 100 in this study as shown in fig 1 sludge cake was placed on the electrode plate surface the cathode and anode surfaces covered by the sludge cake were symmetrically distributed the number and width of the cathode and anode bars can be adjusted to obtain a certain c a value in the range of 2 14 2 2 3 adhesive stress tests the testing principle of adhesive stress was based on the method introduced in the previous reports peeters et al 2011 deng et al 2017 in brief 25 gram of sludge sample with a certain mc was introduced into the teflon cylinder and compressed by the massive cylinder on the electrode plate to form a sludge cake with a thickness of approximately 4 mm the container was connected with the teflon cylinder through a soft thread and braced by the pulley wheel then the sludge cake was processed by beop at a specific current 0 0 6 a exerting time 0 60 s c a 2 14 frequency 0 40 hz and dtc 0 100 then the application of beop on the sludge cake was stopped and the adhesive tests began steel balls of 2 2 g each were introduced every 5 s into the container until the teflon cylinder began to slide on the electrode plate the total weight of the steel balls in the container was recorded and the adhesive force was calculated by eq 2 the tests were conducted in threefold for each experimental condition the results with the 95 confidence interval are shown in fig 3 7 2 τ w 1 w 0 g s where τ is the adhesive stress pa w 1 and w 0 are respectively the weight required for sliding of the teflon cylinder with and without sludge sample kg g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 s is the surface area of sludge sample in contact with the electrode surface m2 2 2 4 migrations of water ions and oms under the effect of beop the sludge sample with mc of 60 was used to investigate the effect of beop on the migrations of water ions and oms firstly 12 gram of sludge sample was introduced into the teflon cylinder and compressed to form a sludge cake of about 2 mm thickness then the sludge cake was processed by beop with current of 0 4 a frequency of 20 hz dtc of 50 and c a of 7 for 5 s 10 s 20 s 40 s or 60 s respectively as shown in fig 1 the processed sludge cake was cut into 7 pieces two pieces were from the anodes san and the other 5 pieces were from the cathodes sca1 sca2 and sca3 the two anodic pieces of san were symmetric as well as that of sca1 and sca2 the mc ph conductivity oms on dry basis and zeta potential of the sludge pieces were also tested in triplicate by the methods introduced in the previous report deng et al 2020a 2 2 5 numerical modelling the electric current distribution in sludge cake was modelled by the following eqs 3 5 3 j q j v 4 j σ e j e 5 e v where j is current density a m2 q j v is the volumetric source of current a m3 e is electric intensity v m σ is electric conductivity s m j e is externally generated current density a m2 v is potential v the temperature distribution in sludge cake was modelled by the following eqs 6 8 6 ρ c p t t ρ c p t q q j 7 q k t 8 q j j v where c p is the heat capacity at constant pressure j kg k ρ is density kg m3 t is temperature k k is heat transfer coefficient j m2 k the initial sludge temperature and the ambient temperature were set to be 293 2 k the calculation of the above eqs 3 8 was conducted by the commercial software package comsol multiphysics 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of beop parameters on the adhesive stress of sewage sludge 3 1 1 effect of current intensity the pulsating current increased from 0 0 6 a with an interval of 0 1 a to investigate the effect of current on the adhesive stress of sludge with the mc of 45 60 and 70 the mc of 35 was not investigated because the maximum current was only 0 15 a at the maximum output of the dc power supply due to the low mc the other parameters were set at the exerting time of 10 s frequency of 20 hz dtc of 50 and c a of 7 as shown in fig 3 the original adhesive stresses were 4614 pa 5826 pa and 5937 pa for the mc of 70 60 and 45 respectively close to the values in the previous report deng et al 2017 the original adhesive stresses τ 0 see table 2 at the mc of 60 and 45 were markedly higher than that at the mc of 70 and 35 indicating that the sludge samples with mc of 60 and 45 were possibly in the range of sticky region which is a widely observed phenomenon in sludge dewatering and drying peeters et al 2013 deng et al 2009 2020b with the increase of current from 0 to 0 3 a 0 4 a for mc of 60 a gradual decrease of the adhesive stress can be observed as shown in table 1 the zeta potential of the original sludge sample was 17 3 0 4 mv suggesting that sludge particles were negatively charged usually owing to the surficial functional groups like carboxyl hydroxyl etc sheng et al 2010 more et al 2012 cations in liquid phase usually combine with water forming hydrated cations close to a solid liquid interface under the effect of eop water displacement was ensured by propagation of the hydrated cations from anode to cathode which drove the neutral liquid in the central channel through viscous momentum transfer yang et al 2009 citeau et al 2012 therefore there should be an increase of mc on the cathode side and a water layer against the cathode surface was very likely to be formed ma et al 2007 the water layer can lubricate the cathode surface and lower the adhesive stress of sludge according to eq 9 and 10 water electrolysis induced by beop could result in o2 emission on the anode and h2 emission on the cathode citeau et al 2012 cao et al 2018 similar to the effect of gas injection in lowering the frictional pressure loss of slurry pipeflow heywood 2003 orell 2007 the gas emission on the electrode surface may also contribute to the reduction of adhesive stress 9 anode 2 h 2 o l 4 h o 2 g 4 e 10 cathode 2 h 2 o l 2 e 2 o h a q h 2 g however as shown in fig 3 with the increase of current from 0 3 a 0 4 a for the mc of 60 to 0 6 a 0 5 a for the mc of 45 and 60 due to the limit of dc power supply the adhesive stress gradually increased from the minimum values of 3488 pa mc of 70 4515 pa mc of 60 and 3847 pa mc of 45 to 4267 pa 4750 pa and 5047 pa respectively there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon firstly despite the lubrication of the cathode surface by water layer the anode surface became dryer and a sludge crust was formed on the anode surface under the higher current both the faster water migration from anode to cathode and the stronger joule heating on the anode surface can lead to the formation of sludge crust under the higher current the sludge crust may act like solid bridge which could greatly raise the adhesive stress on the anode surface adhikari et la 2001 the overall adhesive stress of sludge on the electrode plate was a combination of adhesive stress on the cathodes and anodes when the increase of adhesive stress on the anodes overwhelmed the decrease on the cathodes the overall adhesive stress may increase secondly under the higher current more water was driven to the cathode surface and some water even spilled out from the bottom of sludge cake on the cathode side the loss of water could also result in the increase of adhesive stress 3 1 2 effect of exerting time before the tests of adhesive stress sludge samples were processed by beop and the effect of exerting time was investigated according to the results in section 3 1 1 the optimal current was set to be 0 3 a mc of 70 0 4 a mc of 60 0 3 a mc of 45 and 0 15a mc of 35 the other parameters were set at the frequency of 20 hz dtc of 50 and c a of 7 as shown in fig 4 a marked decrease of adhesive stress can be found with the increase of exerting time from 0 to 10 s for sludge samples with the mc of 45 60 and 70 further increasing the exerting time led to the increase of adhesive stress from the minimum values of 3488 pa mc of 70 4020 pa mc of 60 and 3847 pa mc of 45 to 4515 pa 4836 pa and 4416 pa respectively the effect of exerting time may be similar to that of current i e with the increase of time both the sludge crust formation on the anode surface and the spilling out of water from the cathode surface became severer which could result in the increase of adhesive stress differently the adhesive stress of sludge sample with the mc of 35 gradually decreased from 4527 pa at the exerting time of 0 s to 3278 pa at 60 s the adhesive stress decreased more obviously in the former 30 s and was almost stable between 30 to 60 s due to the low mc the electric resistance should be higher that s why only the maximum current of 0 15 a can be obtained as mentioned above both the lower current and the lower mc will result in the slower water migration inside the sludge cake thus more exerting time was required for decreasing the adhesive stress of sludge with the mc of 35 3 1 3 effect of frequency frequency is an important parameter for beop based on the results in figs 3 and 4 the optimal parameters of current and exerting time were selected to investigate the effect of frequency on the adhesive stress the other parameters were set at the dtc of 50 and c a of 7 fig 5 shows the adhesive stresses at the frequency of 0 power off 10 20 30 and 40 hz it is obvious that for the sludge samples with the mc of 45 60 and 70 the adhesive stress showed the minimum values at the frequency of 20 hz differently sludge sample with the mc of 35 showed a continuous decreasing tendency with the increase of frequency indicating that the increase of frequency from 10 to 40 hz promoted the water migration from anodes to cathodes similar results can also be found in previous reports through electro dewatering of sewage sludge under the effect of eop deng et al 2020a found that the water migration was promoted by increasing frequency from 0 01 to 30 hz and almost remained stable with further increasing frequency spagnoli et al 2011 found that the contact resistance between sample and electrode was decreased when the frequency of eop increased from 10 to 40 hz and remained stable with further increasing frequency liu 2012 found that the migration of ions in concrete was promoted by eop and speculated that the vibration of ions under eop may be the reason for the promotion effect however due to the particularity and complexity of sewage sludge further revelation of the functional mechanism of the pulsating current on water migration is still necessary in future work 3 1 4 effect of dtc based on the results from fig 3 to 5 the optimal current exerting time and frequency were selected to investigate the effect of dtc with c a of 7 as shown in fig 6 with the increase of dtc from 0 to 100 the adhesive stress first decreased and then increased with dtc except for the sludge sample with 45 mc the sludge samples with the mc of 35 60 and 70 showed the minimum adhesive stress at the dtc of 50 which was meaningful from the economic point of view it can be seen from fig 2 that the lower dtc means the longer power off time and the lower energy consumption the results in fig 6 indicated that beop at the dtc of 50 or 75 depending on the mc of sludge was able to realize the lower energy consumption and the better adhesion reduction compared to the electro osmosis with the constant dc dtc of 100 the change of adhesive stress with dtc may be correlated with the change of water migration our previous study on the electro dewatering of sewage sludge showed that the water migration from anode to cathode was promoted by increasing dtc from 20 to 40 60 and the further increase of dtc to 100 led to the slowing down of water migration deng et al 2020a in fact the higher dtc represents the higher average current intensity the previous study also showed that the anode temperature at the dtc of 100 was about 40 c higher than that at the dtc of 60 due to the more intensive joule heating which could result in the sludge crust formation and the increased electric resistance on the anode side therefore it is possible that the decrease of adhesive stress with the increase of dtc from 0 to 50 or 75 for the mc of 35 could be attributed to the promotion of water migration and a better subsequent water layer formation on the cathode surface the moderate increase of the adhesive stress with the further increase of dtc should be due to the formation of sludge crust under the higher average current intensity 3 1 5 effect of c a to investigate the effect of c a the optimal parameters of current exerting time frequency and dtc were chosen according to the results from fig 3 to 6 fig 7 shows that the variation tendency of sludge samples with the different mc was similar i e the adhesive stress first decreased and then increased with the increase of c a all of sludge samples showed the minimum adhesive stress at the c a of 7 as discussed above under the effect of electric field the propagation of the hydrated cations ensured the movement of neutral liquid in the central channel through viscous momentum transfer water layer acting as a lubricant could be formed on the cathode surface and promoted the decrease of adhesive stress conversely water was displaced from the anodes thus the change of the adhesive stress on the anode surface should be different with that on the cathode surface with the decrease of mc from 60 to 45 the original adhesive stress was still at high level from 5826 pa to 5929 pa as shown in table 1 but a further decrease of mc to 35 led to a marked decrease of adhesive stress to 4527 pa to strengthen the positive effect of cathodes the area percentage of the cathode surface should be increased to an extent thus the decrease of adhesive stress with the increase of c a from 2 to 7 was expected however there was a marked increase in adhesive stress when c a increased from 7 to 14 the possible reason is that the sludge in contact with anodes became dryer under the higher c a because the current density on the anode surface will increase with the decrease of the anode surface area given that the overall current being the same under the different c a which could result in the faster water displacement and the stronger joule heating on the anode surface under the c a of 14 sludge crust was formed on the anode surface due to the greater loss of water which could markedly increase the adhesive stress by acting like solid bridge as mentioned above based on the results above the adhesion reduction percentage arp through beop under the optimal conditions can be calculated according to eq 11 11 arp τ 0 τ min τ 0 100 where τ 0 is the original adhesive stress of sludge sample without the effect of beop pa τ min is the minimum adhesive stress under the effect of beop in the examined range pa as shown in table 2 the arp of different sludge samples are in the range of 24 4 54 5 compared with the sludge samples at the higher mc 60 and 70 the sludge samples at the lower mc 35 and 45 showed the higher arp which is reasonable according to the functional principle of beop for wet sludge like the mc of 70 or even higher water layer between sludge and metal surface can be easily formed by mechanical compression shi et al 1997 thus the impact level of beop could be lowered 3 2 components migration under beop as discussed above the sludge sample used in this study was in the range of sticky region at the mc of 60 which is also a typical mc within the scope of sticky region peeters et al 2011 deng et al 2017 thus the sludge sample with the mc of 60 was chosen to investigate the migrations of water ions and oms under the effect of beop the results were shown in fig 8 with the 95 confidence interval fig 8a shows the water migration with the increase of processing time it is obvious that the mc of anodic sludge san decreased with time whereas the mc of cathodic sludge sca1 sca2 and sca3 increased with time indicating that water migrated from anode side to cathode side as shown in fig 1 the water migration distance between san sca1 and the distance between san sca2 were close which may be the reason for the close mc of sca1 and sca2 in fig 8a the distance between san sca3 was larger than that between san sca1 or san sca2 thus the mc of sca3 was lower than that of sca1 and sca2 fig 8a shows that there was a sharper increase or decrease of mc on the anodes or cathodes between 0 10 s after 10 s the change of mc became smoother due to the loss of water on the anodes this should be correlated with the minimum adhesive stress at the exerting time of 10 s see fig 4 however the increments of mc at 10 s for sca1 sca2 and sca3 are only 2 3 2 and 0 9 respectively which seems hard to explain the sharp decrease of adhesive stress from 5826 pa to 4020 pa between 0 10 s for the sample with 60 mc because the original adhesive stress of sample with 70 mc is still as high as 4614 pa the reason is that the mc of each piece sca1 sca2 sca3 or san in fig 8a represents the average mc of the whole 2 mm thick piece attributed to the formation of water layer on the cathode surface as discussed above the mc of the boundary sludge layer in contact with the cathode surface could be much higher than the average mc which makes it possible for the sharp decrease of the adhesive stress as mentioned above o2 and h2 emission on the anode and cathode surface could also contribute to the sharp decrease of the adhesive stress fig 8b shows the change of oms under the different exerting time of beop the oms of san increased with time whereas the oms of sca1 sca2 and sca3 decreased with time it has been reported that the oms in sludge are mainly composed of bacterial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps which are usually negatively charged more et al 2012 sheng et al 2010 therefore the negatively charged oms in sludge would migrate gradually from cathodes to anodes under the effect of beop xiao et al 2017 tuan and sillanpӓӓ 2010 in addition the migration of positively charged inorganic metal ions from anode to cathode could also result in the increase of the oms concentration on the anode precipitation co precipitation or complexation of the metal ions could take place on the cathodes with basic environment see fig 8d which could also lead to the decrease of the oms concentration on the cathodes wang et al 2005 as a reflection of ion concentration in solution the electric conductivity is an important parameter for the electro osmotic process tafti et al 2015 fig 8c shows that the conductivity of both the anodic sample san and cathodic samples sca1 sca2 and sca3 increased with the exerting time the reason is that the water electrolysis induced by beop could result in the production of protons h and hydroxide ions oh on the anode eq 9 and cathode eq 10 respectively fig 8c also shows that the conductivity of san was higher than that of sca1 sca2 and sca3 due to the formation of oh on the cathodes ion concentration may be decreased owing to the precipitation of some metal components in basic environment which may be the reason for the lower conductivity of sca1 and sca2 than that of san deng et al 2020a fig 8d shows the ph variation of san sca1 sca2 and sca3 with the exerting time the ph of san decreased with time due to the release of h through eq 9 conversely the ph of sca1 sca2 and sca3 increased with time due to the release of oh through eq 10 fig 8e shows the change of zeta potential with the exerting time the zeta potential on the anode san increased with time whereas the zeta potential on the cathodes sca1 sca2 and sca3 decreased with time it was reported that the change of zeta potential was correlated with the change of ph weng et al 2013 citeau et al 2011 the release of h on the anode area could result in the increase of zeta potential whereas the release of oh aq on the cathode area could lead to the decrease of zeta potential the electro osmotic velocity of liquid flow u is given by eq 12 mahmoud et al 2010 the slowing down of the water migration with time in fig 8a could also be attributed to the decrease of the electro osmotic velocity caused by the decrease of the absolute zeta potential on the anode area 12 u ζ d 4 π μ e where ζ is the zeta potential of sludge particles d is the dielectric constant of liquid e is the electric field μ is the dynamic viscosity of liquid 3 3 distributions of current density and temperature inside sludge cake since current is the driving force of the water flow in sludge cake it is important to figure out the distribution of current density in sludge for deeply understanding the effect of beop according to the structure and size of the electrode plate and sludge cake in fig 1 and the sludge properties in table 1 the current density distribution was modelled by the commercial software package comsol multiphysics fig 9 a and b are the 3d and 2d results of the theoretical modeling respectively since the sludge cake is symmetric in structure as well as that of the electrodes see fig 1 fig 9b only shows half of the modeling results firstly it can be seen that the current density close to the dividing line between cathode and anode is much higher than other distant locations because the current flow distance is quite short at the dividing line secondly the current flows out from the anode and into the cathodes on the right and left side of the anode simultaneously in fig 9b a2 a4 and a5 are the interfaces of sca3 sca1 san and sca2 a1 and a3 are the cross sections at the centerline of sca3 and sca1 respectively all of the current flow passes through a4 and a5 it was calculated that 49 7 of the current flow passes through a4 and another 50 3 passes through a5 the current flow passing through a3 a2 and a1 is respectively 13 8 2 8 and 0 6 of the current flow passing through a4 indicating that the current density on the cathode surface decayed along the distance away from the anode the higher current density indicates more intensive water migration thus the water layer with the higher current density was supposed to be thicker than that with the lower current density as shown in fig 9b the current density in sca1 was higher than that in sca3 thus it can be inferred that more water could be driven into sca1 fig 8a shows that the mc of sca1 was higher than that of sca3 which agrees with the theoretical inference fig 9c shows the temperature distribution inside the sludge cake at 10 s it is obvious that the temperature distribution was strongly correlated with the current density distribution because the heat for the temperature rise of the sludge cake was originated from joule heating at 10 s the temperature around the dividing line between cathode and anode is about 40 k higher than the average temperature of the whole cake 294 k fig 9d shows the change of the average temperature in the exerting time of 0 60 s the average temperature almost linearly increased with time from 293 2 k at 0 s to 297 6 k at 60 s the sludge temperature usually has a marked influence on its adhesive property the increase of sludge temperature could lead to the decrease of sludge adhesion deng et al 2017 deng et al 2020b in this study most of the tests were conducted under the exerting time of 10 s the average temperature increased by 0 8 k thus the effect of temperature was negligible however due to the much higher temperature rise around the dividing line water displacement on the anode surface may be promoted by evaporation which could accelerate the formation of the sludge crust on the anode surface as mentioned above 3 4 possible practical applications the good performance of beop in adhesion reduction provides the possibility of the wide application of this technology in sludge treatment installations such as transportation like wet sludge pumping and scraper conveyer of half dried sludge mechanical dewatering like screw press and spiral dewatering and thermal drying like paddle dryer and rotary pan dryer taking the wet sludge pumping as an example beop can be applied to reduce sludge pipeflow resistance and save sludge pumping energy for scraper conveyer beop can be applied on scrapers and reduce sludge build up on the scrapers for the installations of sludge mechanical dewatering like screw press and spiral dewatering machine the application of beop on shaft or inner shell of these dewatering machines may be beneficial for reducing the torque of shaft for sludge thermal drying it is well known that sludge will go through sticky region with the decrease of mc which can greatly increase the torque of dryer shaft especially for indirect sludge dryers like paddle dryer and rotary pan dryer and deteriorate the sludge drying efficiency deng et al 2009 ferrase et al 2002 the application of beop inside the indirect sludge dryers may help to alleviate these problems 4 conclusion beop induced reduction of sludge to wall adhesion was experimentally studied in this work special attentions were paid to the effects of current intensity exerting time frequency dtc and c a on the adhesive stress of sewage sludge with the mc of 35 45 60 and 70 the results indicated that the adhesive stress of sludge samples with the different mc firstly decreased and then increased with the increase of the all examined parameters under the optimal conditions of beop the adhesive stress was decreased by 40 4 54 4 31 0 and 24 4 respectively for the mc of 35 45 60 and 70 suggesting a good performance of beop on adhesion reduction under the effect of beop water migrated from anodes to cathodes but the increment of the mc on the cathode with longer distance from anode was lower than that with smaller distance conversely the oms of sludge migrated from cathodes to anodes the conductivity of both cathodic and anodic sludge increased with the exerting time of beop due to the formation of h on the anodes and oh on the cathodes which also lead to increase of ph on the cathodes and decrease of ph on the anodes the results of the theoretical modelling of the distributions of current density and temperature in sludge indicated that the current intensity on the cathode surface decayed quickly with the increase of flowing distance away from anode which well explained the moisture distribution on the cathode surface the temperature distribution was similar to the current density distribution and the sludge temperature around the dividing line of cathodes and anodes was about 40 k higher than the average sludge temperature declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17104,adhesion is one of the main features of sewage sludge this paper aims at reducing sludge to wall adhesion through formation of a water layer induced by boundary electro osmotic pulse beop which is characterized by distributing anodes and cathodes on one surface and exerting a pulsating current the effects of the related parameters including current intensity exerting time frequency duty cycle dtc and the ratio of cathodic surface area to anodic surface area c a on the adhesive stress of sewage sludge with different moisture content were thoroughly studied the results indicated that under the optimal conditions of beop the adhesive stress of sludge with moisture content of 35 45 60 and 70 was reduced by 40 4 54 5 31 and 24 4 respectively the migrations of water ions and organic matters were also investigated to explore the functional mechanism of beop the results showed that the water migrated from the anode side to the cathode side whereas the organic matters migrated in the opposite direction the increment of the sludge moisture content on the cathode surface was reduced with the increase of distance away from the anode based on theoretical modeling the distributions of current density and temperature in sludge cake were obtained the current flowed from anode to cathode and decayed quickly with the increase of the flowing distance which well explained the moisture content distribution in sludge cake graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge electro osmotic pulse adhesion stickiness drying 1 introduction as a type of solid waste from wastewater treatment plant sludge treatment and disposal has become an increasingly important task for environmental protection high moisture content is one of the main characteristics of sewage sludge thus dewatering and drying are important steps for volume reduction and further utilization of sludge like incineration pyrolysis agricultural utilization landscaping etc tunçal and uslu 2014 dassanayake et al 2015 wu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 stickiness is also a main feature of wet sludge reflecting the tendency of materials adhering to contact surfaces or to agglomerates li et al 2014 it will exert a negative effect on sludge dewatering drying pipe transportation etc peeters et al 2013 deng et al 2017 baudez et al 2016 for example sticky sludge will greatly increase the flow resistance and consume more energy during pipe transportation slatter 2008 it is well known that sludge will pass through a sticky region during thermal drying which greatly lowers the drying efficiency of sludge dryers deng et al 2009 ferrase et al 2002 it was reported that the sticky feature of drying sludge represents 95 of problems in sludge dewatering and drying installations peeters et al 2013 in view of the adverse impact of stickiness much attention has been paid to lowering the stickiness of sewage sludge as a relatively mature solution to sludge stickiness back mixing is a method of lowering the moisture content mc calculated by eq 1 of sewage sludge by mixing dried sludge with wet sludge to go over the sticky region during sludge treatment léonard et al 2008 similar to the back mixing of dried sludge there are also reports about the mixing of wet sludge with dry solids like lignite and saw dust to reduce sludge adhesion deng et a 2017 hamawand et al 2015 however many drawbacks still exist in this method 1 the high mass ratio of dried sludge is required for back mixing e g 1 kg of the totally dried sludge is demanded for lowering 1 kg of wet sludge from the mc of 80 to 40 2 much energy will be dissipated in heating up the back mixed dried sludge during thermal drying 3 the abrasion of installations will become severer due to the high percentage of dried sludge 4 the handling capacity of installations will be decreased 5 back mixing will also complicate the sludge treatment system peeters et al 2013 investigated the application of polyaluminiumchloride pacl as a conditioner for activated sludge prior its dewatering and drying it was found that the shear stress of sludge with mc of 54 over a steel surface was reduced by 35 attributed to the lubrication effect of bound hydration water and that the maximal torque of a screw conveyor for conveying sludge was reduced by 20 chen et al 2016 studied the effects of ferric chloride fecl3 and polyacrylamide pam on the stickiness of activated sludge and found that by introducing 4 wt of fecl3 or 0 6 wt of pam into the sludge the adhesive stress was decreased by 25 and 17 4 respectively jing et al 1999 also investigated the effect of fecl3 on sludge dewatering and subsequent detachment from filter cloth and found that sludge mass of residue on the filter cloth was decreased by more than 90 at a fecl3 dose of 52 li et al 2012 found that the sludge build up on a metal surface was markedly reduced by introducing 1 5 ds dry solids of calcium oxide cao or calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 deng et al 2017 2020b also studied the effect of cao 5 8 wet sludge basis on sludge stickiness and obtained the contrary results which showed that the adhesive and cohesive stress of sewage sludge and the sludge build up on a hot metal surface 140 200 c were markedly increased by cao addition yang 2019 found that the sludge adhesion on a metal surface can be inhibited when the surface was covered by a teflon layer but this method will be difficult to apply in practice due to the low wear resistance of the teflon materials ma et al 2016 found that the adhesion of sludge pretreated by electro osmosis was decreased by about 23 and the possible explanation is the changes in water distribution and the quantity of extracellular polymeric substances eps ma et al 2007 also conducted an application of a polarized electric field to reduce the adhesion of wet sludge to dryer wall and found that a water layer was formed on the cathode by electro osmosis leading to a great reduction of the adhesion intensity in fact there are many reports about the application of the electro osmosis based adhesion reduction in mechanical tunnel driving and shale drilling roy and cooper 1991 cooper and roy 1994 hariharan et al 1998 spagnoli et al 2011 in these reports the anode and cathode plates were arranged in parallel similar to the arrangement of electrodes in the traditional electro osmotic dewatering mahmoud et al 2010 this study tried to explore a new method of sludge adhesion reduction based on a boundary electro osmotic pulse beop there are some reports about a solution to soil adhesion through a surface electro osmosis applied in terrain machines ren et al 2001 ren 2009 muhammad et al 2010 however to the best of our knowledge there is no published research about the application of beop on sludge adhesion reduction the main differences of beop with the traditional electro osmosis method are that 1 anodes and cathodes are distributed on a surface to constitute an electrode plate in other words the electrode plate is made of many anodes and cathodes thus the metal surface of sludge treatment installations in contact with sludge can be replaced by the electrode plate to lower the sludge adhesion which makes it possible for wide application in sludge treatment installations like pipeline transportation mechanical dewatering and thermal drying 2 our previous research shows that electro osmotic pulse eop showed marked advantages in promoting water migration and lowering energy consumption deng et al 2020a therefore eop was exerted on the electrodes for realizing electro osmotic flow in this study the effects of current intensity exerting time frequency duty cycle dtc the ratio of the cathode surface area to the anode surface area c a on the adhesive stress of sewage sludge were systematically studied to further explore the functional mechanisms of beop the migrations of moisture ions and organic matters oms were experimentally studied coupled with the theoretical modeling of the distributions of current density and temperature in sludge cake 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the sludge used in this study was a type of mechanically dewatered sewage sludge which was sampled from an anaerobic oxic municipal wastewater treatment plant located in shanghai the moisture content mc of sludge sample was determined by air drying under 105 c for 24 h and was calculated according to eq 1 1 mc mass of water in wet sludge mass of wet sludge 100 other important properties of the sludge sample including ph oms zeta potential and electric conductivity were determined according to the methods introduced in our previous report deng et al 2020a the ash and fixed carbon content of the sludge sample were determined according to the method gb t 30732 2014 each parameter was tested in triplicate and the results with the 95 confidence interval are shown in table 1 in order to examine the adhesive stress of sludge with the different mc sludge samples with the mc of 70 60 45 and 35 were prepared for experimental tests 2 2 experimental set up and design 2 2 1 experimental set up fig 1 shows the experimental set up which includes a beop unit and an adhesive stress testing unit the beop unit was composed of a direct current dc power supply mp 5020d china a frequency generator a solid state relay and an electrode plate 20 cm width 27 cm length 1 cm thickness which was composed of anode bars and cathode bars the bars were made of 316 l stainless steel separated by teflon slices with thickness of 0 5 mm the adhesive stress testing unit was composed of a teflon cylinder inner diameter of 6 cm a massive cylinder 1200 g a pulley wheel steel balls a container and the electrode plate 2 2 2 operational principle of beop the voltage of the dc power supply can be regulated between 0 50 v fig 2 shows the wave form of pulsating current which pulsated between 0 a power off and a specific value power on located between 0 1 0 6 a at a frequency of 0 10 20 30 or 40 hz the power on and off was controlled by the solid state relay through the signals released from the frequency generator duty cycle dtc denotes the percentage of the power on time in one pulsating period and was set at 0 25 50 75 and 100 in this study as shown in fig 1 sludge cake was placed on the electrode plate surface the cathode and anode surfaces covered by the sludge cake were symmetrically distributed the number and width of the cathode and anode bars can be adjusted to obtain a certain c a value in the range of 2 14 2 2 3 adhesive stress tests the testing principle of adhesive stress was based on the method introduced in the previous reports peeters et al 2011 deng et al 2017 in brief 25 gram of sludge sample with a certain mc was introduced into the teflon cylinder and compressed by the massive cylinder on the electrode plate to form a sludge cake with a thickness of approximately 4 mm the container was connected with the teflon cylinder through a soft thread and braced by the pulley wheel then the sludge cake was processed by beop at a specific current 0 0 6 a exerting time 0 60 s c a 2 14 frequency 0 40 hz and dtc 0 100 then the application of beop on the sludge cake was stopped and the adhesive tests began steel balls of 2 2 g each were introduced every 5 s into the container until the teflon cylinder began to slide on the electrode plate the total weight of the steel balls in the container was recorded and the adhesive force was calculated by eq 2 the tests were conducted in threefold for each experimental condition the results with the 95 confidence interval are shown in fig 3 7 2 τ w 1 w 0 g s where τ is the adhesive stress pa w 1 and w 0 are respectively the weight required for sliding of the teflon cylinder with and without sludge sample kg g is the acceleration of gravity m s2 s is the surface area of sludge sample in contact with the electrode surface m2 2 2 4 migrations of water ions and oms under the effect of beop the sludge sample with mc of 60 was used to investigate the effect of beop on the migrations of water ions and oms firstly 12 gram of sludge sample was introduced into the teflon cylinder and compressed to form a sludge cake of about 2 mm thickness then the sludge cake was processed by beop with current of 0 4 a frequency of 20 hz dtc of 50 and c a of 7 for 5 s 10 s 20 s 40 s or 60 s respectively as shown in fig 1 the processed sludge cake was cut into 7 pieces two pieces were from the anodes san and the other 5 pieces were from the cathodes sca1 sca2 and sca3 the two anodic pieces of san were symmetric as well as that of sca1 and sca2 the mc ph conductivity oms on dry basis and zeta potential of the sludge pieces were also tested in triplicate by the methods introduced in the previous report deng et al 2020a 2 2 5 numerical modelling the electric current distribution in sludge cake was modelled by the following eqs 3 5 3 j q j v 4 j σ e j e 5 e v where j is current density a m2 q j v is the volumetric source of current a m3 e is electric intensity v m σ is electric conductivity s m j e is externally generated current density a m2 v is potential v the temperature distribution in sludge cake was modelled by the following eqs 6 8 6 ρ c p t t ρ c p t q q j 7 q k t 8 q j j v where c p is the heat capacity at constant pressure j kg k ρ is density kg m3 t is temperature k k is heat transfer coefficient j m2 k the initial sludge temperature and the ambient temperature were set to be 293 2 k the calculation of the above eqs 3 8 was conducted by the commercial software package comsol multiphysics 3 results and discussions 3 1 effects of beop parameters on the adhesive stress of sewage sludge 3 1 1 effect of current intensity the pulsating current increased from 0 0 6 a with an interval of 0 1 a to investigate the effect of current on the adhesive stress of sludge with the mc of 45 60 and 70 the mc of 35 was not investigated because the maximum current was only 0 15 a at the maximum output of the dc power supply due to the low mc the other parameters were set at the exerting time of 10 s frequency of 20 hz dtc of 50 and c a of 7 as shown in fig 3 the original adhesive stresses were 4614 pa 5826 pa and 5937 pa for the mc of 70 60 and 45 respectively close to the values in the previous report deng et al 2017 the original adhesive stresses τ 0 see table 2 at the mc of 60 and 45 were markedly higher than that at the mc of 70 and 35 indicating that the sludge samples with mc of 60 and 45 were possibly in the range of sticky region which is a widely observed phenomenon in sludge dewatering and drying peeters et al 2013 deng et al 2009 2020b with the increase of current from 0 to 0 3 a 0 4 a for mc of 60 a gradual decrease of the adhesive stress can be observed as shown in table 1 the zeta potential of the original sludge sample was 17 3 0 4 mv suggesting that sludge particles were negatively charged usually owing to the surficial functional groups like carboxyl hydroxyl etc sheng et al 2010 more et al 2012 cations in liquid phase usually combine with water forming hydrated cations close to a solid liquid interface under the effect of eop water displacement was ensured by propagation of the hydrated cations from anode to cathode which drove the neutral liquid in the central channel through viscous momentum transfer yang et al 2009 citeau et al 2012 therefore there should be an increase of mc on the cathode side and a water layer against the cathode surface was very likely to be formed ma et al 2007 the water layer can lubricate the cathode surface and lower the adhesive stress of sludge according to eq 9 and 10 water electrolysis induced by beop could result in o2 emission on the anode and h2 emission on the cathode citeau et al 2012 cao et al 2018 similar to the effect of gas injection in lowering the frictional pressure loss of slurry pipeflow heywood 2003 orell 2007 the gas emission on the electrode surface may also contribute to the reduction of adhesive stress 9 anode 2 h 2 o l 4 h o 2 g 4 e 10 cathode 2 h 2 o l 2 e 2 o h a q h 2 g however as shown in fig 3 with the increase of current from 0 3 a 0 4 a for the mc of 60 to 0 6 a 0 5 a for the mc of 45 and 60 due to the limit of dc power supply the adhesive stress gradually increased from the minimum values of 3488 pa mc of 70 4515 pa mc of 60 and 3847 pa mc of 45 to 4267 pa 4750 pa and 5047 pa respectively there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon firstly despite the lubrication of the cathode surface by water layer the anode surface became dryer and a sludge crust was formed on the anode surface under the higher current both the faster water migration from anode to cathode and the stronger joule heating on the anode surface can lead to the formation of sludge crust under the higher current the sludge crust may act like solid bridge which could greatly raise the adhesive stress on the anode surface adhikari et la 2001 the overall adhesive stress of sludge on the electrode plate was a combination of adhesive stress on the cathodes and anodes when the increase of adhesive stress on the anodes overwhelmed the decrease on the cathodes the overall adhesive stress may increase secondly under the higher current more water was driven to the cathode surface and some water even spilled out from the bottom of sludge cake on the cathode side the loss of water could also result in the increase of adhesive stress 3 1 2 effect of exerting time before the tests of adhesive stress sludge samples were processed by beop and the effect of exerting time was investigated according to the results in section 3 1 1 the optimal current was set to be 0 3 a mc of 70 0 4 a mc of 60 0 3 a mc of 45 and 0 15a mc of 35 the other parameters were set at the frequency of 20 hz dtc of 50 and c a of 7 as shown in fig 4 a marked decrease of adhesive stress can be found with the increase of exerting time from 0 to 10 s for sludge samples with the mc of 45 60 and 70 further increasing the exerting time led to the increase of adhesive stress from the minimum values of 3488 pa mc of 70 4020 pa mc of 60 and 3847 pa mc of 45 to 4515 pa 4836 pa and 4416 pa respectively the effect of exerting time may be similar to that of current i e with the increase of time both the sludge crust formation on the anode surface and the spilling out of water from the cathode surface became severer which could result in the increase of adhesive stress differently the adhesive stress of sludge sample with the mc of 35 gradually decreased from 4527 pa at the exerting time of 0 s to 3278 pa at 60 s the adhesive stress decreased more obviously in the former 30 s and was almost stable between 30 to 60 s due to the low mc the electric resistance should be higher that s why only the maximum current of 0 15 a can be obtained as mentioned above both the lower current and the lower mc will result in the slower water migration inside the sludge cake thus more exerting time was required for decreasing the adhesive stress of sludge with the mc of 35 3 1 3 effect of frequency frequency is an important parameter for beop based on the results in figs 3 and 4 the optimal parameters of current and exerting time were selected to investigate the effect of frequency on the adhesive stress the other parameters were set at the dtc of 50 and c a of 7 fig 5 shows the adhesive stresses at the frequency of 0 power off 10 20 30 and 40 hz it is obvious that for the sludge samples with the mc of 45 60 and 70 the adhesive stress showed the minimum values at the frequency of 20 hz differently sludge sample with the mc of 35 showed a continuous decreasing tendency with the increase of frequency indicating that the increase of frequency from 10 to 40 hz promoted the water migration from anodes to cathodes similar results can also be found in previous reports through electro dewatering of sewage sludge under the effect of eop deng et al 2020a found that the water migration was promoted by increasing frequency from 0 01 to 30 hz and almost remained stable with further increasing frequency spagnoli et al 2011 found that the contact resistance between sample and electrode was decreased when the frequency of eop increased from 10 to 40 hz and remained stable with further increasing frequency liu 2012 found that the migration of ions in concrete was promoted by eop and speculated that the vibration of ions under eop may be the reason for the promotion effect however due to the particularity and complexity of sewage sludge further revelation of the functional mechanism of the pulsating current on water migration is still necessary in future work 3 1 4 effect of dtc based on the results from fig 3 to 5 the optimal current exerting time and frequency were selected to investigate the effect of dtc with c a of 7 as shown in fig 6 with the increase of dtc from 0 to 100 the adhesive stress first decreased and then increased with dtc except for the sludge sample with 45 mc the sludge samples with the mc of 35 60 and 70 showed the minimum adhesive stress at the dtc of 50 which was meaningful from the economic point of view it can be seen from fig 2 that the lower dtc means the longer power off time and the lower energy consumption the results in fig 6 indicated that beop at the dtc of 50 or 75 depending on the mc of sludge was able to realize the lower energy consumption and the better adhesion reduction compared to the electro osmosis with the constant dc dtc of 100 the change of adhesive stress with dtc may be correlated with the change of water migration our previous study on the electro dewatering of sewage sludge showed that the water migration from anode to cathode was promoted by increasing dtc from 20 to 40 60 and the further increase of dtc to 100 led to the slowing down of water migration deng et al 2020a in fact the higher dtc represents the higher average current intensity the previous study also showed that the anode temperature at the dtc of 100 was about 40 c higher than that at the dtc of 60 due to the more intensive joule heating which could result in the sludge crust formation and the increased electric resistance on the anode side therefore it is possible that the decrease of adhesive stress with the increase of dtc from 0 to 50 or 75 for the mc of 35 could be attributed to the promotion of water migration and a better subsequent water layer formation on the cathode surface the moderate increase of the adhesive stress with the further increase of dtc should be due to the formation of sludge crust under the higher average current intensity 3 1 5 effect of c a to investigate the effect of c a the optimal parameters of current exerting time frequency and dtc were chosen according to the results from fig 3 to 6 fig 7 shows that the variation tendency of sludge samples with the different mc was similar i e the adhesive stress first decreased and then increased with the increase of c a all of sludge samples showed the minimum adhesive stress at the c a of 7 as discussed above under the effect of electric field the propagation of the hydrated cations ensured the movement of neutral liquid in the central channel through viscous momentum transfer water layer acting as a lubricant could be formed on the cathode surface and promoted the decrease of adhesive stress conversely water was displaced from the anodes thus the change of the adhesive stress on the anode surface should be different with that on the cathode surface with the decrease of mc from 60 to 45 the original adhesive stress was still at high level from 5826 pa to 5929 pa as shown in table 1 but a further decrease of mc to 35 led to a marked decrease of adhesive stress to 4527 pa to strengthen the positive effect of cathodes the area percentage of the cathode surface should be increased to an extent thus the decrease of adhesive stress with the increase of c a from 2 to 7 was expected however there was a marked increase in adhesive stress when c a increased from 7 to 14 the possible reason is that the sludge in contact with anodes became dryer under the higher c a because the current density on the anode surface will increase with the decrease of the anode surface area given that the overall current being the same under the different c a which could result in the faster water displacement and the stronger joule heating on the anode surface under the c a of 14 sludge crust was formed on the anode surface due to the greater loss of water which could markedly increase the adhesive stress by acting like solid bridge as mentioned above based on the results above the adhesion reduction percentage arp through beop under the optimal conditions can be calculated according to eq 11 11 arp τ 0 τ min τ 0 100 where τ 0 is the original adhesive stress of sludge sample without the effect of beop pa τ min is the minimum adhesive stress under the effect of beop in the examined range pa as shown in table 2 the arp of different sludge samples are in the range of 24 4 54 5 compared with the sludge samples at the higher mc 60 and 70 the sludge samples at the lower mc 35 and 45 showed the higher arp which is reasonable according to the functional principle of beop for wet sludge like the mc of 70 or even higher water layer between sludge and metal surface can be easily formed by mechanical compression shi et al 1997 thus the impact level of beop could be lowered 3 2 components migration under beop as discussed above the sludge sample used in this study was in the range of sticky region at the mc of 60 which is also a typical mc within the scope of sticky region peeters et al 2011 deng et al 2017 thus the sludge sample with the mc of 60 was chosen to investigate the migrations of water ions and oms under the effect of beop the results were shown in fig 8 with the 95 confidence interval fig 8a shows the water migration with the increase of processing time it is obvious that the mc of anodic sludge san decreased with time whereas the mc of cathodic sludge sca1 sca2 and sca3 increased with time indicating that water migrated from anode side to cathode side as shown in fig 1 the water migration distance between san sca1 and the distance between san sca2 were close which may be the reason for the close mc of sca1 and sca2 in fig 8a the distance between san sca3 was larger than that between san sca1 or san sca2 thus the mc of sca3 was lower than that of sca1 and sca2 fig 8a shows that there was a sharper increase or decrease of mc on the anodes or cathodes between 0 10 s after 10 s the change of mc became smoother due to the loss of water on the anodes this should be correlated with the minimum adhesive stress at the exerting time of 10 s see fig 4 however the increments of mc at 10 s for sca1 sca2 and sca3 are only 2 3 2 and 0 9 respectively which seems hard to explain the sharp decrease of adhesive stress from 5826 pa to 4020 pa between 0 10 s for the sample with 60 mc because the original adhesive stress of sample with 70 mc is still as high as 4614 pa the reason is that the mc of each piece sca1 sca2 sca3 or san in fig 8a represents the average mc of the whole 2 mm thick piece attributed to the formation of water layer on the cathode surface as discussed above the mc of the boundary sludge layer in contact with the cathode surface could be much higher than the average mc which makes it possible for the sharp decrease of the adhesive stress as mentioned above o2 and h2 emission on the anode and cathode surface could also contribute to the sharp decrease of the adhesive stress fig 8b shows the change of oms under the different exerting time of beop the oms of san increased with time whereas the oms of sca1 sca2 and sca3 decreased with time it has been reported that the oms in sludge are mainly composed of bacterial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps which are usually negatively charged more et al 2012 sheng et al 2010 therefore the negatively charged oms in sludge would migrate gradually from cathodes to anodes under the effect of beop xiao et al 2017 tuan and sillanpӓӓ 2010 in addition the migration of positively charged inorganic metal ions from anode to cathode could also result in the increase of the oms concentration on the anode precipitation co precipitation or complexation of the metal ions could take place on the cathodes with basic environment see fig 8d which could also lead to the decrease of the oms concentration on the cathodes wang et al 2005 as a reflection of ion concentration in solution the electric conductivity is an important parameter for the electro osmotic process tafti et al 2015 fig 8c shows that the conductivity of both the anodic sample san and cathodic samples sca1 sca2 and sca3 increased with the exerting time the reason is that the water electrolysis induced by beop could result in the production of protons h and hydroxide ions oh on the anode eq 9 and cathode eq 10 respectively fig 8c also shows that the conductivity of san was higher than that of sca1 sca2 and sca3 due to the formation of oh on the cathodes ion concentration may be decreased owing to the precipitation of some metal components in basic environment which may be the reason for the lower conductivity of sca1 and sca2 than that of san deng et al 2020a fig 8d shows the ph variation of san sca1 sca2 and sca3 with the exerting time the ph of san decreased with time due to the release of h through eq 9 conversely the ph of sca1 sca2 and sca3 increased with time due to the release of oh through eq 10 fig 8e shows the change of zeta potential with the exerting time the zeta potential on the anode san increased with time whereas the zeta potential on the cathodes sca1 sca2 and sca3 decreased with time it was reported that the change of zeta potential was correlated with the change of ph weng et al 2013 citeau et al 2011 the release of h on the anode area could result in the increase of zeta potential whereas the release of oh aq on the cathode area could lead to the decrease of zeta potential the electro osmotic velocity of liquid flow u is given by eq 12 mahmoud et al 2010 the slowing down of the water migration with time in fig 8a could also be attributed to the decrease of the electro osmotic velocity caused by the decrease of the absolute zeta potential on the anode area 12 u ζ d 4 π μ e where ζ is the zeta potential of sludge particles d is the dielectric constant of liquid e is the electric field μ is the dynamic viscosity of liquid 3 3 distributions of current density and temperature inside sludge cake since current is the driving force of the water flow in sludge cake it is important to figure out the distribution of current density in sludge for deeply understanding the effect of beop according to the structure and size of the electrode plate and sludge cake in fig 1 and the sludge properties in table 1 the current density distribution was modelled by the commercial software package comsol multiphysics fig 9 a and b are the 3d and 2d results of the theoretical modeling respectively since the sludge cake is symmetric in structure as well as that of the electrodes see fig 1 fig 9b only shows half of the modeling results firstly it can be seen that the current density close to the dividing line between cathode and anode is much higher than other distant locations because the current flow distance is quite short at the dividing line secondly the current flows out from the anode and into the cathodes on the right and left side of the anode simultaneously in fig 9b a2 a4 and a5 are the interfaces of sca3 sca1 san and sca2 a1 and a3 are the cross sections at the centerline of sca3 and sca1 respectively all of the current flow passes through a4 and a5 it was calculated that 49 7 of the current flow passes through a4 and another 50 3 passes through a5 the current flow passing through a3 a2 and a1 is respectively 13 8 2 8 and 0 6 of the current flow passing through a4 indicating that the current density on the cathode surface decayed along the distance away from the anode the higher current density indicates more intensive water migration thus the water layer with the higher current density was supposed to be thicker than that with the lower current density as shown in fig 9b the current density in sca1 was higher than that in sca3 thus it can be inferred that more water could be driven into sca1 fig 8a shows that the mc of sca1 was higher than that of sca3 which agrees with the theoretical inference fig 9c shows the temperature distribution inside the sludge cake at 10 s it is obvious that the temperature distribution was strongly correlated with the current density distribution because the heat for the temperature rise of the sludge cake was originated from joule heating at 10 s the temperature around the dividing line between cathode and anode is about 40 k higher than the average temperature of the whole cake 294 k fig 9d shows the change of the average temperature in the exerting time of 0 60 s the average temperature almost linearly increased with time from 293 2 k at 0 s to 297 6 k at 60 s the sludge temperature usually has a marked influence on its adhesive property the increase of sludge temperature could lead to the decrease of sludge adhesion deng et al 2017 deng et al 2020b in this study most of the tests were conducted under the exerting time of 10 s the average temperature increased by 0 8 k thus the effect of temperature was negligible however due to the much higher temperature rise around the dividing line water displacement on the anode surface may be promoted by evaporation which could accelerate the formation of the sludge crust on the anode surface as mentioned above 3 4 possible practical applications the good performance of beop in adhesion reduction provides the possibility of the wide application of this technology in sludge treatment installations such as transportation like wet sludge pumping and scraper conveyer of half dried sludge mechanical dewatering like screw press and spiral dewatering and thermal drying like paddle dryer and rotary pan dryer taking the wet sludge pumping as an example beop can be applied to reduce sludge pipeflow resistance and save sludge pumping energy for scraper conveyer beop can be applied on scrapers and reduce sludge build up on the scrapers for the installations of sludge mechanical dewatering like screw press and spiral dewatering machine the application of beop on shaft or inner shell of these dewatering machines may be beneficial for reducing the torque of shaft for sludge thermal drying it is well known that sludge will go through sticky region with the decrease of mc which can greatly increase the torque of dryer shaft especially for indirect sludge dryers like paddle dryer and rotary pan dryer and deteriorate the sludge drying efficiency deng et al 2009 ferrase et al 2002 the application of beop inside the indirect sludge dryers may help to alleviate these problems 4 conclusion beop induced reduction of sludge to wall adhesion was experimentally studied in this work special attentions were paid to the effects of current intensity exerting time frequency dtc and c a on the adhesive stress of sewage sludge with the mc of 35 45 60 and 70 the results indicated that the adhesive stress of sludge samples with the different mc firstly decreased and then increased with the increase of the all examined parameters under the optimal conditions of beop the adhesive stress was decreased by 40 4 54 4 31 0 and 24 4 respectively for the mc of 35 45 60 and 70 suggesting a good performance of beop on adhesion reduction under the effect of beop water migrated from anodes to cathodes but the increment of the mc on the cathode with longer distance from anode was lower than that with smaller distance conversely the oms of sludge migrated from cathodes to anodes the conductivity of both cathodic and anodic sludge increased with the exerting time of beop due to the formation of h on the anodes and oh on the cathodes which also lead to increase of ph on the cathodes and decrease of ph on the anodes the results of the theoretical modelling of the distributions of current density and temperature in sludge indicated that the current intensity on the cathode surface decayed quickly with the increase of flowing distance away from anode which well explained the moisture distribution on the cathode surface the temperature distribution was similar to the current density distribution and the sludge temperature around the dividing line of cathodes and anodes was about 40 k higher than the average sludge temperature declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
