22625,in this study the liquid sloshing in a closed partially filled t shaped baffled and unbaffled two dimensional rectangular tank was numerically investigated the tank was rotated with two different rotation angles of 4 and 8 and a fixed angular velocity of 3 3 rad s which was determined by taking the natural frequency of the tank into consideration for the filling depths of 50 and 75 the baffle heights as well as the rotation angles and filling depths were systematically varied and the effect of these parameters on the hydrodynamic loads on the tank wall and free surface elevations was examined the calculations were carried out in two different ways by means of laminar and turbulent viscous flow solvers which use the finite differences and finite volume discretization techniques in conjunction with the volume of fluid technique respectively the general flow topology free surface deformations and vorticity distributions are provided and discussed in detail it was found that the baffle was fully effective in pressure and wave damping when its height was greater than 80 of the liquid level keywords sloshing baffle cfd rectangular tank 1 introduction liquid sloshing in partially filled containers under external excitations has been a crucial engineering issue which involves the performance stability and structural integrity problems in many disciplines such as aerospace vehicles road tankers liquefied natural gas carriers elevated water towers and petroleum cylindrical tanks etc hasheminej and mohammadi 2016 ibrahim 2005 hydrodynamic forces acting on tank walls as a result of the liquid sloshing may damage the container thus the sloshing dynamic loads should be restricted in order to avoid structural failure because of undesirable dynamic behaviours the inherent liquid viscosity is not sufficient to reduce the sloshing forces on the dynamic characteristics of liquid storage tanks therefore other methods should be introduced to suppress the sloshing dynamic loads among them in order to maintain safe operations baffles have been devised as effective internal components to increase the hydrodynamic damping ratio and consequently decrease the slosh forces in most of the practical engineering problems many researchers have proposed simulated and tested a wide variety of passive solutions to dissipate slosh energy and or limit the liquid movement by using various physical devices such as partitions mitra et al 2010 baffles wang et al 2016 tuned flexible absorbers gradinscak et al 2011 and floating roofs hasheminej and mohammadi 2016 alternatively it has also been devised proper control methods for effective slosh suppression the flexible floating panel is a particularly viable option that requires no support from the tank side walls and is functional for an arbitrary direction of external excitation application of the active control methods may be an effective solution for addressing this challenging problem zang et al 2015 pridgen et al 2012 fluid motion in partially filled tanks can cause large structural loads and unexpected instability of engineering structural system if the period of tank motion is close to the natural period of fluid inside the tank furthermore the caused failure may be a tremendous loss of human economic and environmental resources the amplitude of the slosh in general depends on the amplitude and frequency of the tank motion liquid fill depth liquid properties and tank geometry these parameters have direct effects on the dynamic stability and performance of moving tanks vertical baffles and perforated plates are useful for suppressing resonant sloshing by changing the lowest resonant frequency to a higher frequency range there has been a considerable amount of work on investigating the effects of baffles on liquid sloshing by using analytical experimental and numerical methods but still further research is of great importance for the understanding of the complex sloshing dynamics and the techniques for sloshing damping using baffles the analytical and semi analytical mathematical models have been used to study the liquid sloshing characteristics in a baffled or unbaffled half full horizontal cylindrical container of elliptical or circular cross section rectangular containers vertical circular cylindrical tanks subjected to arbitrary external forces some of these studies e g gavrilyuk et al 2006 maleki and ziyaeifar 2008 hasheminejad et al 2014 and wang et al 2013 are carried out to approximate the linearized problem on fluid sloshing by using some techniques such as the appropriate eigen function expansions a weakly nonlinear modal theory an asymptotic modal method a powerful conformal mapping technique etc developing an analytical model with acceptable accuracy for the determination of baffle damping could provide useful means for the design of the baffle geometric characteristics and arrangements on the other hand analytical methods have not been useful anymore with the complexity of the tank geometry experimental investigations are necessary for evaluating the actual dynamic characteristics of the liquid sloshing with different baffles on the other hand there are not enough information on the experimental investigation of the suppression of sloshing behaviour using baffles in published literature and some problems in the extension of their results to the full scale real world problems due to scaling effects in recent years goudarzi and sabbagh yazdi 2012 carried out the experimental measurements to evaluate the efficiency of three types of baffles upper and lower mounted vertical baffles as well as horizontal baffles on the hydrodynamic damping of the liquid motion akyıldız et al 2013 conducted severalexperiments to analyse liquid sloshing in a cylindrical tank at a model scale with various fill levels and ring baffles under the excitation of roll motion the experimental results of xue et al 2013 for the liquid sloshing in a rectangular liquid tank with a perforated baffle provide an effective baffle arrangement in tanks on reducing the sloshing amplitude the accuracy of the experimental systems was validated against the numerical results from an in house robust cfd code an experimental rig was developed by zheng et al 2013 to study non linear sloshing in a baffled and unbaffled tank of rectangular dimension nayak and biswal 2015 experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic damping potential of three different configurations of centrally installed internal baffles perpendicular to the direction of lateral excitation in a rectangular tank partially filled with water it was found that the damping coefficient increases with relative baffle height and baffles can be effectively used to damp the liquid sloshing near resonance conditions there are also lots of numerical studies of liquid sloshing with different baffles in the containers with complex geometries such as finite element methods fem finite difference methods fdm boundary element methods bem volume of fluid vof technique virtual boundary force vbf method and meshless method etc akyıldız 2012 and jung et al 2012 numerically examined the effect of the vertical baffle height relative to the initial liquid depth the critical baffle height to reach the roof of the tank have been investigated on the other hand goudarzi et al 2012 indicated that an up mounted vertical baffle is more effective than a low mounted one and horizontal plates have significant damping effects in slender tanks whereas vertical plates are more effective in broader tanks vertical baffles may reduce the sloshing amplitudes and dynamic impact loads as well as the natural frequency of the tank wu et al 2012 xue et al 2012 additionally alternative baffle systems have been analysed in tanks such as annular baffles and flexible baffles in cylindrical tanks biswal et al 2006 horizontal and vertical baffles in rectangular tanks akyıldız and ünal 2005 2006 liu and lin 2009 and annular baffles in rectangular tanks panigrahy et al 2009 they concluded that in an increased fill depth the rolling amplitude and frequency of the tank with or without baffle configurations directly affect the degrees of non linearity of the sloshing phenomena pal and bhattacharyya 2010 carried out the numerical and experimental studies of liquid sloshing for a 2 d problem the resulting slosh heights for various excitation frequencies and amplitudes are compared with the data obtained numerically numerical simulation of liquid sloshing with or without baffles is also examined by eswaran et al 2009 and chen et al 2009 based on fluent software modaressi tehrani et al 2007 built a three dimensional 3d nonlinear model of a partly filled horizontal cylindrical tank with annular curved baffles and investigated the forces and moments caused by the transient fluid slosh and the effects of baffles the results clearly showed that the presence of baffles helps to suppress the peak as well as mean slosh forces and moments significantly the optimisation of baffle installation height and baffle width to reduce the sloshing of a rectangular storage tank under translational motion was conducted by using a newly proposed evolutionary optimisation method kim and lee 2008 based on the numerical technique named virtual boundary force vbf method used to model the internal baffles with complex geometries xue and lin 2011 developed a 3d numerical model newtank to study viscous liquid sloshing in a tank with internal baffles of different shapes and arrangements shao et al 2015 presented a comparative study of different baffles on mitigation effects of liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank due to a horizontal excitation using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method using the improved consistent particle method cpm water sloshing with a constrained floating baffle cfb was successfully simulated the effect of cfb in sloshing mitigation was investigated koh et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 investigated the nonlinear sloshing of liquid in a partially filled rigid cylindrical container with a rigid annular baffle by using the multi modal method of lukovsky miles variational a time independent finite difference scheme with the fictitious cell technique was used to study viscous fluid sloshing in 2d tanks with baffles and an experiment setup was also made to validate the present numerical sloshing results in a tank with baffles wu et al 2012 wu et al 2015 provided a finite difference method fdm with coordinate transformation and fictitious cell approach to analyse the vortex generation and shedding phenomenon for sloshing liquid in 2d tanks with baffles the above review clearly indicates that there exists a relatively large body of literature on liquid sloshing in baffled rectangular circular elliptical and axisymmetric containers with different fill levels meanwhile most studies are of concern on determining the natural frequencies and mode shapes of liquid sloshing for the baffled problems the review also shows that the studies investigating the detailed flow properties around the t shaped baffles in terms of the flow topology and the behaviour of the tip vortices are highly limited accordingly it was decided to focus on the liquid sloshing in a rotating partially filled baffled and unbaffled two dimensional 2d rectangular tank to numerically assess how the height of a fixed width t shaped baffle relative to the initial liquid filling depth affects liquid sloshing and to present detailed flow analysis clearly providing the flow structure in the tank numerical algorithms based on the finite difference and finite volume discretization approaches were used in the study the first numerical method is based on an in house code written in fortran which performs laminar flow calculations on rather coarse grid systems the turbulent flow computations on the other hand were carried out by the software package fluent 19 2 the first approach is a relatively simple method which may be used for the initial design stages to calculate global impact loads due to the liquid sloshing whilst the latter is indispensable to perform detailed analyses and to verify the geometry of the final design a single degree of freedom motion was considered and the tank was rotated with a fixed angular frequency about the axis passing through its bottom wall centre the effects of the t shaped baffle height as well as the filling depth and rotation angle on the liquid sloshing motion were systematically investigated the time variations of the pressure acting on the tank wall computed by the two methods are presented the general flow topology free surface deformations and tip vortices generated by the baffle are also provided and discussed in detail 2 computational study 2 1 computational models the 2d rectangular tank geometry seen in fig 1 was used in the study this geometry was formed from the cross section of the tank with a length of 46 cm that was used in the experimental work of akyıldız and ünal 2005 the rigid t shaped baffles mounted to the bottom of the tank had a thickness of 10 mm the preliminary studies and previous experiences of the authors indicated that a particular width was required to provide effective shallow water and blockage effects which helps to reduce the sloshing motion accordingly a fixed baffle width of 46 cm corresponding to the half breadth of the tank was selected in the study in order to address to the tank conditions with relatively high pressure levels two liquid depths h which corresponded to 50 and 75 of the tank height were considered the ratio of the baffle heights h b to the liquid depth h was chosen as 0 5 0 75 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 respectively the time dependent pressure signals were obtained from a sensor placed on the right wall of the tank for each computational case fig 1 a rotational motion around the axis that is perpendicular to the xy plane and passing through the bottom centre of the geometry was applied to the rectangular tank the fixed angular frequency of 3 3 rad s chosen corresponded to roughly 60 of the natural frequency of the tank liquid system for the liquid depths considered the motion was represented by a sinusoidal function θ θ 0 sin ω t where θ 0 ω and t imply rotation angle amplitude angular velocity and time respectively two different rotation angles of 4 and 8 were used in the study in this way the effect of the baffle heights as well as the rotation angles and the liquid depths on the hydrodynamic loads and the wave heights was investigated by systematically varying these parameters the cases associated with the liquid depths of 50 and 75 were coded as d50 and d75 respectively in the paper the rotation angles mentioned above were shown as a4 and a8 throughout the text on the other hand whilst the unbaffled cases were abbreviated as u the baffled cases were coded as b5 b8 etc according to baffle height ratio h b h for example the case with a liquid depth of 50 a rotation angle of 4 and a baffle height ratio of 0 5 is named as a4 d50 b5 the computational cases investigated in the study can be seen in table 1 2 2 mathematical formulation and numerical approach 2 2 1 laminar flow calculations the fluid is assumed to be homogenous isotropic viscous and newtonian tank and fluid motions are assumed to be two dimensional the domain considered here is a rigid rectangular container partially filled with liquid as shown in fig 1 the governing equations are solved simultaneously with the corresponding boundary conditions and free surface kinematics and dynamic boundary conditions in the fluid domain 1 u u v 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p f ν 2 u where u u v is the velocity vector defined in the tank fixed coordinate and ρ p ν and f are the liquid density pressure kinematic viscosity and external forces per mass respectively in order to include the non linearity and avoid the complex boundary conditions of moving walls the moving coordinate system is used the origin of the coordinate system is at the position of the centre plane of the tank and on the undisturbed free surface the moving coordinate is translating and rotating relative to an inertial system which can be used to represent general roll or pitch of the tank the external force per mass consists of gravitational forces the translational and rotational inertia forces which can be written as 3 f g v t 2 ω v ω t r ω ω r where g v and ω are the gravitational vector the translational velocity and the rotational velocity vector respectively in addition r is the position vector of the considered point relative to o on the free surface both the kinematics and dynamic conditions should be satisfied 4 η t u η y 0 5 p p atm where η and y represent the disturbed and undisturbed free surface levels respectively p atm is the air pressure or ullage pressure inside the tank the surface tension is ignored in this study therefore a no shear is needed on the free surface however proper wall conditions are necessary on the tank walls and the internal members 2 2 1 1 numerical computation for the analysis of the sloshing flow inside a partial filled tank a finite difference method fdm was applied to the governing equations fdm is useful when there are internal structures inside the tank or the fluid contacts the tank ceiling frequently as the internal structures exist the viscous effects may be dominant this method concentrates on the global fluid motion so some local effects such as turbulence and wave breaking have been ignored in some cases these local effects are important but the simulation of global flow plays a more critical role in many sloshing problems due to the slosh induced moment in the ship cargo kim 2001 volume of fluid vof technique was used hirt and nichols 1981 to track the interface between the fluids the scheme adopted in this study is the sola method of hirt and nichols 1981 tank volume was discretised into cartesian staggered grid cells a single layer of fictitious cells or boundary cells surrounded the fluid region the fictitious cells were used to set the boundary conditions so that the same difference equation can be used in the interior of the mesh liu and lin 2009 eswaran et al 2009 fluid velocities were located at the centres of the cell boundaries and pressure p and the volume of fluid function f were computed at the centre of the cell the solution algorithm works as a time cycle or movie frame the results of the time cycle act as initial conditions for the next one at each step suitable boundary conditions must be imposed at all boundaries there are two alternatives for the wall conditions when the viscosity effect on the tank boundary is significant the no slip condition should be imposed however in most sloshing problems the viscous effect is not significant and the boundary layer thickness is much less than the cell size therefore the free slip condition was applied for the tank walls and the baffle in the present study for example if the left boundary of the computing mesh is to be a rigid free slip wall the normal velocity will be zero and the tangential velocity should have no normal gradients i e 6 u 1 j 0 v 1 j v 2 j for all j where j implies the value of the indices in the vertical direction and is related to the grid number numerical calculations can have quantities that develop large high frequency oscillations in space or time or both of them this behaviour is usually referred to as a numerical instability to prevent this type of numerical instability or inaccuracy certain restrictions must be observed in defining the mesh increments δx i and δy j the time increment δt and the upstream differencing parameter α for accuracy the mesh increments must be chosen small enough to resolve the expected spatial variations in all dependent variables generally the choice of δt is of extreme importance in explicit schemes it will govern the stability and accuracy of the computation while in implicit schemes it will affect the accuracy once a mesh has been chosen the choice of the time increment necessary for stability is governed by two restrictions first material cannot move through more than one cell in one time step because the difference equations assume fluxes only between adjacent cells therefore the time increment must satisfy the inequality 7 δ t δ x y δ u i j or 8 δ t m i n δ x i u i j δ y j v i j where the minimum is with respect to every cell in the mesh when a non zero value of kinematic viscosity momentum must not diffuse more than one cell in one time step a linear stability analysis shows that this limitation implies 9 υ δ t 1 2 1 δ x i 2 1 δ y j 2 in this study δt is automatically chosen to satisfy the above inequalities in order to ensure the numerical stability the parameter α is 10 1 α m a x u i j δ t δ x v i j δ t δ y when the period and amplitude of excitation are large the liquid responds violently and causes the numerical solution to become unstable the instability is related to the instability of the fluid motion such as the occurrence of turbulence wave breaking and the transition from homogeneous flow to a two phase flow for these situations the present numerical model is limited to the period prior to the inception of these flow perturbations 2 2 2 turbulent flow calculations the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations wilcox 2006 were used in the simulations in cartesian tensor notation these equations can be expressed as follows 11 u i x i 0 12 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i x j μ s i j ρ u i u j where ρ μ u p and u imply fluid density molecular viscosity averaged velocity averaged static pressure and fluctuating velocity respectively s i j term in equation 12 represents the mean strain rate tensor while the term ρ u i u j expresses the stresses which are produced by turbulent fluctuations namely reynolds stresses where an overbar signifies a shorthand for average the calculation of the reynolds stresses and the turbulence field were realised by means of the sst k ω turbulence model of menter 1994 which is based on the boussinesq hypothesis tennekes and lumley 1972 which for incompressible flow can be represented as follows 13 ρ u i u j 2 μ t s i j 2 3 ρ k δ i j where μ t and k represent turbulent viscosity and turbulent kinetic energy respectively while the symbol δ i j denotes the kronecker delta 2 2 2 1 numerical computation a fine volume discretization based solution algorithm was employed blazek 2001 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 to solve the rans and turbulence transport equations a pressure based segregated algorithm was applied for the solution the velocity pressure coupling was achieved with the piso method issa 1986 which a pressure correction technique providing relatively high convergence speed for time dependent simulations the pressure staggering approach of patankar and spalding 1972 were employed for the calculation of the pressure field where the pressure and velocity values are stored at different grid nodes whilst a second order central differencing scheme was used for the viscous terms the spatial discretization of the convective terms of the rans and turbulent transport equations was achieved with a second order upwind scheme pletcher et al 2013 the three time level implicit time discretization ferziger and peric 2002 was applied for unconditionally stable and accurate solutions the two phase flow problem was solved based on the volume of fluid vof technique of hirt and nichols 1981 the tracking of the free surface was performed with a high accuracy second order scheme in order to increase the accuracy of the simulations a dynamically varying time step was chosen such that the maximum local courant number courant et al 1928 in the flow field was kept around 1 this approach also avoided extremely long solution periods due to the unnecessarily small time step use the convergence of the solution at each time step was checked by the examination of the variation of the primitive variables such as velocity and pressure in addition to the scaled residuals of the equation systems the tank walls and baffle faces were modelled as no slip walls in the turbulent flow calculations 2 3 grid dependency 2 3 1 laminar flow calculations in order to testify and verify the discretization of the numerical model for the laminar flow calculations three different grid systems were chosen 16 31 23 31 and 46 31 for the unbaffled a8 d75 u case in this study the value of δt can be automatically calculated by the program and dynamically modified to ensure the stability and also optimize the pressure solution when the excitation is harmonic rolling it was found that the normalized time step was somewhat independent of the forcing period therefore about 200 time steps were required per forcing period in this program this appeared to hold regardless of discretization reasonable agreement of the time variations of the pressure for different grid systems at t1 for a8 d75 u was obtained for all grid systems while the difference between the results of the medium and fine mesh systems was simply indistinguishable a relatively fine discretization 46 31 with a finer enforcement of the velocity divergence requires 3 s of computer time per time step comparing a coarse discretization 16 31 therefore 23 31 grid system is chosen to obtain results in a reasonable time considering stability and accuracy 2 3 2 turbulent flow calculations a similar analysis with the same computational case was carried out for the rans simulations the pressure signals obtained from the t1 point by using three different mesh resolutions with nominal grid spacing of 1 2 and 4 mm can be comparatively examined for a8 d75 u in fig 2 in order to place a few cells in the boundary layer the grid size in these regions were kept around 1 mm and gradually increased if necessary depending on the nominal grid resolution as seen in the figure the agreement between the three plots is high since the results obtained from the grid spacings of 1 mm and 2 mm were almost identical subsequent simulations were carried out with the former grid resolution a view of the mesh structure used for the rans simulations can also be seen in fig 3 2 4 validation in order to assess the accuracy of the methods used the results of the pressure at t1 obtained from the unbaffled conditions by using the above mentioned two numerical methods were compared with those of the experimental work of akyıldız and ünal 2005 2006 for the two computational cases a8 d75 u and a8 d50 u due to the low frequency data collection the experimental signals have sharp edges it should be noted that due to the uncertainty of the initialisation of the data collection in the tests the computational and experimental signals were time aligned such that the first peaks of the signals overlap as shown in figs 4 and 5 the magnitude of the non dimensionalised pressure signals are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data for both laminar and rans calculations the concordance between the turbulent and laminar calculations applied is also remarkable whilst the periodicity of the sloshing motion is also well captured with the numerical methods used for both cases the first case investigated a8 d75 u produced a slightly lower sloshing frequency compared to the experiments fig 4 the main sloshing motion frequency is calculated as 0 525 hz whilst this value was 0 560 hz in the experiments the frequency obtained from the second computational case a8 d50 u on the other hand is in good agreement with the experimental data fig 5 the computational and experimental values of the main motion frequency was obtained as 0 525 hz and 0 515 hz respectively the validation study showed that the simulations involving t shaped baffles can be confidently performed by using the two numerical methods adopted it should be born in mind that in order to achieve 2d flow conditions the length to breadth ratio of the tank should be as small as possible to avoid any 3d flow such as swirling diagonal waves etc for the rolling excitation of a tank faltinsen and timokha 2009 hence the results of the present 2d simulations should be essentially interpreted with the slender tank assumption however the agreement with the results of the 3d tank experiments with a tank length of 46 cm also implied negligible 3d flow influences for the unbaffled cases nonetheless the application of a baffle may increase these effects if it does not significantly affect the global impact loads and main flow structure 3 results and discussion 3 1 laminar flow calculations fig 6 displays the non dimensional pressure signals obtained from the t1 probe which was placed on the right wall at a height of 6 cm above the bottom for all cases the absolute pressure values which are equal to the sum of the aero hydrostatic and static pressure values were non dimensionalised with respect to the hydrostatic pressure level acting on the bottom surface p ρ g seen in fig 6 imply absolute pressure pa liquid density kg m3 and gravitational acceleration m s2 respectively as is seen some of the signals cannot reach to the targeted time point ω t 14 since the computer code used in the calculation was not designed to model the complex sloshing motions such as liquid spray and wave breaking which occurs after the impact of the liquid on the top surface the pressure oscillations mainly display a sinusoidal structure for the unbaffled cases the amplitude of the oscillations is higher for the d50 u cases with respect to the d75 u cases for both rotational angles adopted the increase of the rotational angle also raised the amplitude of the oscillations as expected as far as the baffled cases are concerned it can be clearly observed that the baffle can effectively dampen the amplitude of the pressure oscillations for d50 b cases when h b h 0 8 for the cases with the same liquid depth and h b h 0 8 the amplitude of the oscillations and or the maximum level of the pressure further increased this is also evidenced by the figures figs 10 13 presented in the following section a similar situation applies to the d75 b cases this time however the results indicate that the baffle was incapable of damping the oscillations when h b h 0 8 for the cases with h b h 0 8 whilst the signal amplitudes significantly diminished 3 2 turbulent flow calculations much more detailed analyses were performed for the turbulent flow calculations shown in fig 7 are the non dimensional pressure signals obtained from the t1 sensor this numerical technique which allowed a higher precision in resolving the complex sloshing motion indicated a non sinusoidal and oscillating curve structure for the unbaffled cases in contrast to the results of the laminar flow calculations the instant rises and drops particularly observed in the baffled cases are due to the liquid sprays and wave breakings occurring during the sloshing motion which could be captured with the very high time resolution of the simulations also see figs 10 13 it can also be seen that some of the unbaffled cases displayed multiple peaks during the second period of the sloshing motion this is due to the interference of the free surface waves and fluid flow heading to the side walls of the tank and reflecting from them within this interval the time resolution of the computations allowed the capture of the phenomenon the maximum and minimum pressure levels along with the differences between the extremes of the pressure signal amplitudes d a obtained from the computations are collected in table 2 fundamentally the results pointed out that the baffles were fully effective with the baffle height ratios of h b h 0 8 for the two liquid depths and rotation angles considered in the study although the general character of the pressure signals is different in terms of determination of the effective height ratios of the baffles the results of the turbulent flow simulations are in close agreement with the observations previously presented for the laminar calculations table 2 demonstrates that the application of baffle with an adequate height can significantly damp the liquid sloshing motion and reduce d a with respect to those of the unbaffled cases considering d50 cases this effect along with the reduction in the maximum pressure level can be observed when h b h 0 8 for instance whilst the non dimensional pressure values were within 0 4 1 2 range for the unbaffled a8 d50 u case the values of the signal varied within a range of 0 7 0 9 with the application of the baffle with a height ratio of h b h 1 0 a8 d50 b1 this indicates a serious decrease of about 72 in d a however for the d50 b8 cases h b h 0 8 during the second period of the sloshing motion the maximum levels of the pressure signals were increased in comparison with those of the unbaffled cases due to the complex flow structure generated by the baffles a similar trend can be observed for d75 only the cases with hb h 0 8 were successful in diminishing both d a and maximum pressure level in a8 d75 the decrease of d a was computed as around 62 within the first two sloshing periods with the application of the largest baffle the table indicates a significant rise in d a for the rest of the computational cases for these cases the application of baffle negatively affected sloshing motion and increased the amplitude of the impact loads on the other hand the motion and impact load damping effect of the baffles appeared to be relatively diminished for the higher filling depth this can be clearly evidenced by the examination of the reduction in d a for the b9 and b1 cases for both rotation angles table 2 for the two liquid depths and rotation angles adopted the period of the pressure signals was also increased with increasing baffle heights for the case of h b h 1 0 however the oscillation period value returned to the value of the unbaffled case s period although this study is focused on the sloshing motion in the tank considering two filling depths of 50 and 75 additional simulations with a filling depth of 25 were also performed to observe the influence of the baffles for relatively lower liquid levels and to make a clearer conclusion about their effectiveness the ratio of the angular frequency of the simulations to the natural frequency of the tank was kept at 0 6 table 2 also covers the results of these simulations it can be observed that the motion damping effect of the baffles was increased for the two rotation angles considered the baffle with a height ratio of h b h 0 75 was sufficient to keep the oscillation amplitudes and maximum pressure levels below those of the unbaffled tank the reason of the rise of the pressure signal amplitudes for the cases of h b h 0 8 in comparison with the unbaffled cases can be perceived by the investigation of the graphs in figs 8 13 the phase numbers seen in fig 8 correspond to the motion times of t t 4 t t 2 t 3t 4 t t t 5t 4 t 3t 2 t 7t 4 t 2t respectively the same phases were used in all subsequent figures the x and y axes in the figures show the distance from the bottom centre of the tank in meters in this section six specific cases were selected for the demonstration of the effect of the baffle on the sloshing motion for a clearer and concise presentation the reason of the selection of the rotation angle of 8 is that this configuration provides a violent free surface motion that can easily reach to the top wall of the tank b5s are clear examples of the strong negative impact of the introduction of the baffle and b9s are the cases where the damping influence of the baffle is explicitly apparent the figures show the structure of the free liquid surface at the different phases within the first two sloshing periods 2t for different cases as seen from figs 8 and 9 the motion has a simple and organised form with a minimal free surface deformation for the unbaffled cases the maximum liquid level which was approximately 0 5 m high for a8 d50 u reached to the ceiling of the tank for a8 d75 u within the first sloshing period in the second period due to the wave reflections created by the wall and mutual cancellation of the waves the free surface levels remained lower than those of the first period on the other hand figs 10 and 11 indicated that the structure of the free surface became highly complex and violent with the application of the t shaped baffle with a ratio of h b h 0 5 which was amongst the cases that made the wall pressures and the amplitudes of the oscillations increase with respect to those of the unbaffled cases see figs 6 and 7 and table 2 even within the first period of the motion the levels of the liquid were higher than those of the unbaffled case and the fluid strongly hit the side and top walls of the tank a large amount of liquid appeared to be clearly free to move with a high momentum intensity for the second period of the motion the free surface became highly disorganised and very rough it was also exposed to a strong liquid spray and wave breaking phenomenon figs 10 and 11 one can deduce that if the height of the baffle is insufficient the sloshing motion and hence the pressure levels acting on the tank walls are notably amplified as far as the cases with h b h 0 9 are concerned see figs 12 and 13 it can be clearly seen that the structure of the free surface is still complex although the liquid level could still reach to the top wall of the tank the major portion of the liquid motion was effectively blocked by the baffle the amount of liquid hitting to the walls was low and the free surface roughly remained horizontal this flow structure clarifies the drops of the pressure signals for the cases h b h 0 8 the flow topology of the sloshing motion can be deeply investigated benefiting from the plots presented in figs 14 19 shown in figs 14 16 and 18 are the streamlines of the flow at different sloshing phases which are coloured according to the velocity magnitudes and were obtained for the aforementioned three cases of d75 the thick solid line represents the free surface the vorticity distributions at different sloshing phases computed for the same cases can also be examined in figs 15 17 and 19 the figures more clearly reveal the structure of the sloshing motion for a8 d75 u the flow primarily included two well defined co rotating structure the odd numbered phases of this unbaffled case retained this organised counterclockwise rotational motion for the first two periods examined two additional clockwise rotating motions were also visible at the bottom corners of the tank for the 7th phase the organised structure of the rotation was somewhat broken down for the even numbered phases in which rightward and leftward motions were dominant the 6th case however included a saddle point around which weak rotations were existent the motion in general was remarkably slow compared to those seen in the baffled cases the area weighted average velocity magnitudes at each sloshing phase for the three cases in question can be examined in table 3 the area weighted average can be represented as follows 14 i 1 n a i i i 1 n a i where implies an arbitrary variable value to be averaged and a i is the area of each computational grid cell table 3 also includes the values obtained from a8 d75 b1 which will be discussed later the values of the odd numbered phases were substantially small compared to those of the even numbered phases probably due to the effect of the mutual cancellation of the free surface waves and momentum the maximum of these values occurred in 4th phase where the maximum velocity magnitude was around 0 95 m s within a highly confined zone appearing at the rightmost free surface boundary for the unbaffled case also it appeared that there existed almost no shear stress for the most part of the flow indicating a similar character to that of a rigid body motion for this reason the associated vorticity distributions shown in fig 15 imply that the vorticity in the liquid flow was simply generated due to the existence of the boundary layer zones the area weighted average vorticity levels at each sloshing motion phase are collected in table 4 the average value of the vorticity magnitude was lower than those computed for the baffled cases and almost 50 lower compared to the average vorticity level of a8 d75 b5 the wall shear effect which generated the vorticity indeed directly contributed to the liquid sloshing as a motion damping factor the liquid motion in the vicinity of the side walls also created well defined small vorticity areas around the intersection of the free surface and side walls see 4th and 5th phases of fig 15 considering the case of a8 d75 b5 h b h 0 5 whilst various centre of rotations can be observed in fig 16 the velocity magnitude was significantly and progressively risen particularly in the zone confined between the free surface and the top surface of the baffle mainly due to the limitation of the flow motion zone by the t shaped baffle the momentum of the flow above the baffle considerably increased and intensified the sloshing motion of the liquid the area weighted average velocity magnitudes calculated are given in table 3 almost at each phase the magnitudes were higher than those observed in the unbaffled case the global average velocity magnitude was around 46 larger for this baffled case it should be noted here that the average includes the contribution of the slower motion zones below the baffle which more clearly reveals the higher momentum levels occurring above the higher values of the velocity magnitudes took place near the tips of the baffle due to the vortices generated and around the free surface as a comparison for the most accelerated sloshing phase 4th phase whilst the maximum velocity around the tip was 1 4 m s the flow velocity due the free surface motion reached to values higher than 1 8 m s this value is almost 90 larger than that calculated for a8 d75 u although the generation of the tip vortices causes a loss in the motion energy it appeared that it augmented the momentum of the liquid above the baffle and caused the free surface motion to grow stronger well defined rotational motions gradually increased in the odd numbered phases the even numbered phases on the other hand contained higher momentum levels however displayed less rotational structures the associated vorticity distribution presented in fig 17 demonstrates the existence of the well organised tip vortices generated by the two free ends of the baffle which were immediately formed with the rotational motion of the tank and subsequently shed into the liquid zone in a regular fashion advancing in the right and left directions depending on the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the tank by the investigation of table 4 one can see that due to this vortex generation the global average vorticity level doubled in respect to that of the unbaffled case the levels were also significantly larger at each sloshing phase the strength of these tip vortices was initially quite high up to 200 1 s in the 2nd phase they also became stronger before the instant they broke up subsequently the vorticity area was grown but its strength gradually diminished for instance the core strength of the clockwise vortex generating from the left tip at the 2nd phase of the motion was about 86 1 s after the shedding phenomenon its core strength dropped by 50 at the 4th phase eventually the vortices mixed with the vorticity in the boundary layer and the other vortices generated due to the boundary layer or free surface motion the interpretation of these results along with the streamlines shown in fig 16 reveals that these systematic vortex structures and the blockage of the baffle increase the momentum of the flow above the t shaped baffle and contribute to the violent motion of the free surface consequently while one could expect a diminishment in the sloshing motion and attenuation in the pressure levels acting on the tank walls due to the motion blockage of the baffle despite the energy loss due to the generation of the vortices blockage and additional wall shear the opposite effect occurred the results associated with the case a8 d75 b9 h b h 0 9 are presented in figs 18 and 19 it can be seen that the flow velocity magnitudes significantly reduced for the most part of the liquid zone table 3 indicates a reduction of 10 with respect to the average velocity levels of a8 d75 b5 however they were still significantly higher 30 in global average than those observed in the unbaffled case relatively high velocities occurred in the confined area between the top of the baffle and the free surface and in the local zones where high vorticity levels existed due to the shallow water effect although a reduction in the global averaged velocity magnitudes was obtained they reached to relatively very high values of up to 1 75 m s in specific regions the odd numbered phases displayed a flow structure basically formed by two large rotational zones at both sides of the baffle which also included several smaller rotational structures the tip vortices were still generated by the ends of the baffle however they were prematurely shed as they rapidly broke down by the free surface flow the vortex shedding frequency was substantially high the first vortex shedding took place before the first sloshing phase according to table 4 a notable reduction of 36 in the global average vorticity magnitudes created due to the absence of the well organised tip vortices was obtained as the free surface motion occurred very close to the top surface of the baffle the vorticity levels within this area was quite strong the organised and diffused vorticity zones apparent after the 5th phase is a result of the blending of the tip vortices with the significant vorticity generated by the boundary layer flow and or free surface motion due to the shallow water effect the contribution of the wall shear was also higher due to the increased baffle surface area and stronger interaction of the boundary layer and free surface flow the latter coupled with a lower velocity weaker momentum fluid flow effectively dampened the free surface levels and the pressures acting on the walls it should be noted here that although the related plots are not given in an effort to provide a concise presentation the motion blockage seen in a8 d75 b1 was significantly high and the velocity levels dropped to the values of the unbaffled cases table 3 the systematic vortex shedding was completely absent in this case due to the dynamic free surface motions contacting the upper wall of the baffle still the vorticity levels were once again amplified since the latter was the dominant factor generating the vorticity table 4 due to the stronger influence of the convective blockage and wall shear effect the pressure levels and free surface deformations were substantially damped 4 conclusion two distinct numerical methods involving laminar and turbulent flow calculations based on the vof technique were applied for simulating the single degree of freedom liquid sloshing in a partially filled rotating 2d rectangular tank with bottom mounted fixed width t shaped baffle a systematic approach was presented to reveal the effect of the vertical baffle height on the sloshing motion for two rotating angles and different filling depths the time history of the pressure signals acting on the side wall as well as the general topological features of the flow free surface deformations and vorticity distributions around the baffle at constant sloshing phases were comparatively presented and discussed in detail the two numerical methods produced well agreed results in terms of the fundamental effect of the t shaped baffle on the pressure signals obtained from the tank surface for all cases investigated as pointed out previously the laminar flow calculations were incapable of simulating the wave breaking and spraying phenomena and this method was not appropriate for the situations when the liquid reached the ceiling of the tank however as presented this did not jeopardise the global impact load predictions of this approach as the turbulent simulations detailedly modelled wave braking and spraying phenomena the pressure signals obtained were rather irregular the results of both simulation techniques were also in agreement with the experimental results found in the open literature for the unbaffled cases the computations indicated that the laminar flow approach with its relatively coarse grid resolution and rapid calculation performance associated with the global sloshing loads is suitable to be used at early design stages of tank geometry and structure enabling the consideration of various design alternatives the turbulent flow approach on the other hand is computationally much more expensive however it may produce highly detailed results in the sense of the turbulent flow features around the baffle which affect the sloshing motion and impact loads it is then suitable for performing extensive liquid sloshing analyses and it may be used at later stages of the design process when the detailed geometrical definitions of the tank and baffle are available the critical findings of the investigation are briefly addressed as follows the amplitudes of the pressure signals decreased with increasing filling depth for both rotation angles considered for the unbaffled cases on the other hand the increase of the rotation angle resulted in the intensification of the sloshing motion along with the pressure oscillation amplitudes as expected the application of the t shaped baffle amplified the complexity of the free surface and caused stronger wave breaking liquid spraying compared to those observed in the unbaffled cases the baffle caused a substantial increment in the area weighted average velocity and vorticity levels in the tank initially for h b h 0 5 the global average velocity raised by 46 and this value gradually decreased as the height of the baffle increased still the velocities in the zone between the top wall of the baffle and free surface remained high the vorticity in the sloshing motion was typically created by the tips of the baffle free surface and tank boundary layers when h b h 0 8 since the free surface weakly affected the flow around the baffle the tip vortices generated were well defined and organised however for h b h 0 8 these vortices were prematurely shed as they rapidly broke down by the free surface flow until the systematic shedding is completely disappeared for h b h 1 0 the vorticity levels were more influenced by the existence of the baffle and its height than the velocity levels for h b h 0 5 the vorticity levels doubled compared to the unbaffled case examined the increase of the height of the baffle significantly dropped the vorticity intensities however due to the dominance of the free surface motion contacting the upper wall of the baffle the vorticity levels were once again significantly augmented for h b h 1 0 according to the pressure signals and free surface deformations obtained from the simulations it was revealed that the t shaped baffle was ineffective in completely damping the sloshing for h b h 0 8 within the first two periods of the motion for the filling depths of 50 and 75 however the effectiveness of the baffles was increased with decreasing filling depths when the liquid depth was further reduced to 25 a height ratio of h b h 0 75 was sufficient to keep the oscillation amplitudes and maximum pressure levels below those of the unbaffled tank the motion damping property of the baffle is connected with the optimal balance between the wall shear and blockage effects along with the energy loss by the generation of the vorticity when the height was not adequate the liquid convection was intensified and the generated vorticity and friction was insufficient to expense enough energy to suppress the free surface motion and pressure levels as the baffle height increased the blockage and wall shear became the dominant effect and a significant reduction in free surface and pressure levels were achieved it is believed that the present study serves as a valuable tool in the estimation of the sloshing characteristics in rectangular tanks and in the design of the t baffles suitable to the user s requirements and also sheds further light to the understanding the complex fluid motion due to the t shaped baffles future works will involve multiple degree of freedom analyses to investigate the impact loads due to the sloshing motion in 3d prismatic tanks 
22625,in this study the liquid sloshing in a closed partially filled t shaped baffled and unbaffled two dimensional rectangular tank was numerically investigated the tank was rotated with two different rotation angles of 4 and 8 and a fixed angular velocity of 3 3 rad s which was determined by taking the natural frequency of the tank into consideration for the filling depths of 50 and 75 the baffle heights as well as the rotation angles and filling depths were systematically varied and the effect of these parameters on the hydrodynamic loads on the tank wall and free surface elevations was examined the calculations were carried out in two different ways by means of laminar and turbulent viscous flow solvers which use the finite differences and finite volume discretization techniques in conjunction with the volume of fluid technique respectively the general flow topology free surface deformations and vorticity distributions are provided and discussed in detail it was found that the baffle was fully effective in pressure and wave damping when its height was greater than 80 of the liquid level keywords sloshing baffle cfd rectangular tank 1 introduction liquid sloshing in partially filled containers under external excitations has been a crucial engineering issue which involves the performance stability and structural integrity problems in many disciplines such as aerospace vehicles road tankers liquefied natural gas carriers elevated water towers and petroleum cylindrical tanks etc hasheminej and mohammadi 2016 ibrahim 2005 hydrodynamic forces acting on tank walls as a result of the liquid sloshing may damage the container thus the sloshing dynamic loads should be restricted in order to avoid structural failure because of undesirable dynamic behaviours the inherent liquid viscosity is not sufficient to reduce the sloshing forces on the dynamic characteristics of liquid storage tanks therefore other methods should be introduced to suppress the sloshing dynamic loads among them in order to maintain safe operations baffles have been devised as effective internal components to increase the hydrodynamic damping ratio and consequently decrease the slosh forces in most of the practical engineering problems many researchers have proposed simulated and tested a wide variety of passive solutions to dissipate slosh energy and or limit the liquid movement by using various physical devices such as partitions mitra et al 2010 baffles wang et al 2016 tuned flexible absorbers gradinscak et al 2011 and floating roofs hasheminej and mohammadi 2016 alternatively it has also been devised proper control methods for effective slosh suppression the flexible floating panel is a particularly viable option that requires no support from the tank side walls and is functional for an arbitrary direction of external excitation application of the active control methods may be an effective solution for addressing this challenging problem zang et al 2015 pridgen et al 2012 fluid motion in partially filled tanks can cause large structural loads and unexpected instability of engineering structural system if the period of tank motion is close to the natural period of fluid inside the tank furthermore the caused failure may be a tremendous loss of human economic and environmental resources the amplitude of the slosh in general depends on the amplitude and frequency of the tank motion liquid fill depth liquid properties and tank geometry these parameters have direct effects on the dynamic stability and performance of moving tanks vertical baffles and perforated plates are useful for suppressing resonant sloshing by changing the lowest resonant frequency to a higher frequency range there has been a considerable amount of work on investigating the effects of baffles on liquid sloshing by using analytical experimental and numerical methods but still further research is of great importance for the understanding of the complex sloshing dynamics and the techniques for sloshing damping using baffles the analytical and semi analytical mathematical models have been used to study the liquid sloshing characteristics in a baffled or unbaffled half full horizontal cylindrical container of elliptical or circular cross section rectangular containers vertical circular cylindrical tanks subjected to arbitrary external forces some of these studies e g gavrilyuk et al 2006 maleki and ziyaeifar 2008 hasheminejad et al 2014 and wang et al 2013 are carried out to approximate the linearized problem on fluid sloshing by using some techniques such as the appropriate eigen function expansions a weakly nonlinear modal theory an asymptotic modal method a powerful conformal mapping technique etc developing an analytical model with acceptable accuracy for the determination of baffle damping could provide useful means for the design of the baffle geometric characteristics and arrangements on the other hand analytical methods have not been useful anymore with the complexity of the tank geometry experimental investigations are necessary for evaluating the actual dynamic characteristics of the liquid sloshing with different baffles on the other hand there are not enough information on the experimental investigation of the suppression of sloshing behaviour using baffles in published literature and some problems in the extension of their results to the full scale real world problems due to scaling effects in recent years goudarzi and sabbagh yazdi 2012 carried out the experimental measurements to evaluate the efficiency of three types of baffles upper and lower mounted vertical baffles as well as horizontal baffles on the hydrodynamic damping of the liquid motion akyıldız et al 2013 conducted severalexperiments to analyse liquid sloshing in a cylindrical tank at a model scale with various fill levels and ring baffles under the excitation of roll motion the experimental results of xue et al 2013 for the liquid sloshing in a rectangular liquid tank with a perforated baffle provide an effective baffle arrangement in tanks on reducing the sloshing amplitude the accuracy of the experimental systems was validated against the numerical results from an in house robust cfd code an experimental rig was developed by zheng et al 2013 to study non linear sloshing in a baffled and unbaffled tank of rectangular dimension nayak and biswal 2015 experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic damping potential of three different configurations of centrally installed internal baffles perpendicular to the direction of lateral excitation in a rectangular tank partially filled with water it was found that the damping coefficient increases with relative baffle height and baffles can be effectively used to damp the liquid sloshing near resonance conditions there are also lots of numerical studies of liquid sloshing with different baffles in the containers with complex geometries such as finite element methods fem finite difference methods fdm boundary element methods bem volume of fluid vof technique virtual boundary force vbf method and meshless method etc akyıldız 2012 and jung et al 2012 numerically examined the effect of the vertical baffle height relative to the initial liquid depth the critical baffle height to reach the roof of the tank have been investigated on the other hand goudarzi et al 2012 indicated that an up mounted vertical baffle is more effective than a low mounted one and horizontal plates have significant damping effects in slender tanks whereas vertical plates are more effective in broader tanks vertical baffles may reduce the sloshing amplitudes and dynamic impact loads as well as the natural frequency of the tank wu et al 2012 xue et al 2012 additionally alternative baffle systems have been analysed in tanks such as annular baffles and flexible baffles in cylindrical tanks biswal et al 2006 horizontal and vertical baffles in rectangular tanks akyıldız and ünal 2005 2006 liu and lin 2009 and annular baffles in rectangular tanks panigrahy et al 2009 they concluded that in an increased fill depth the rolling amplitude and frequency of the tank with or without baffle configurations directly affect the degrees of non linearity of the sloshing phenomena pal and bhattacharyya 2010 carried out the numerical and experimental studies of liquid sloshing for a 2 d problem the resulting slosh heights for various excitation frequencies and amplitudes are compared with the data obtained numerically numerical simulation of liquid sloshing with or without baffles is also examined by eswaran et al 2009 and chen et al 2009 based on fluent software modaressi tehrani et al 2007 built a three dimensional 3d nonlinear model of a partly filled horizontal cylindrical tank with annular curved baffles and investigated the forces and moments caused by the transient fluid slosh and the effects of baffles the results clearly showed that the presence of baffles helps to suppress the peak as well as mean slosh forces and moments significantly the optimisation of baffle installation height and baffle width to reduce the sloshing of a rectangular storage tank under translational motion was conducted by using a newly proposed evolutionary optimisation method kim and lee 2008 based on the numerical technique named virtual boundary force vbf method used to model the internal baffles with complex geometries xue and lin 2011 developed a 3d numerical model newtank to study viscous liquid sloshing in a tank with internal baffles of different shapes and arrangements shao et al 2015 presented a comparative study of different baffles on mitigation effects of liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank due to a horizontal excitation using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method using the improved consistent particle method cpm water sloshing with a constrained floating baffle cfb was successfully simulated the effect of cfb in sloshing mitigation was investigated koh et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 investigated the nonlinear sloshing of liquid in a partially filled rigid cylindrical container with a rigid annular baffle by using the multi modal method of lukovsky miles variational a time independent finite difference scheme with the fictitious cell technique was used to study viscous fluid sloshing in 2d tanks with baffles and an experiment setup was also made to validate the present numerical sloshing results in a tank with baffles wu et al 2012 wu et al 2015 provided a finite difference method fdm with coordinate transformation and fictitious cell approach to analyse the vortex generation and shedding phenomenon for sloshing liquid in 2d tanks with baffles the above review clearly indicates that there exists a relatively large body of literature on liquid sloshing in baffled rectangular circular elliptical and axisymmetric containers with different fill levels meanwhile most studies are of concern on determining the natural frequencies and mode shapes of liquid sloshing for the baffled problems the review also shows that the studies investigating the detailed flow properties around the t shaped baffles in terms of the flow topology and the behaviour of the tip vortices are highly limited accordingly it was decided to focus on the liquid sloshing in a rotating partially filled baffled and unbaffled two dimensional 2d rectangular tank to numerically assess how the height of a fixed width t shaped baffle relative to the initial liquid filling depth affects liquid sloshing and to present detailed flow analysis clearly providing the flow structure in the tank numerical algorithms based on the finite difference and finite volume discretization approaches were used in the study the first numerical method is based on an in house code written in fortran which performs laminar flow calculations on rather coarse grid systems the turbulent flow computations on the other hand were carried out by the software package fluent 19 2 the first approach is a relatively simple method which may be used for the initial design stages to calculate global impact loads due to the liquid sloshing whilst the latter is indispensable to perform detailed analyses and to verify the geometry of the final design a single degree of freedom motion was considered and the tank was rotated with a fixed angular frequency about the axis passing through its bottom wall centre the effects of the t shaped baffle height as well as the filling depth and rotation angle on the liquid sloshing motion were systematically investigated the time variations of the pressure acting on the tank wall computed by the two methods are presented the general flow topology free surface deformations and tip vortices generated by the baffle are also provided and discussed in detail 2 computational study 2 1 computational models the 2d rectangular tank geometry seen in fig 1 was used in the study this geometry was formed from the cross section of the tank with a length of 46 cm that was used in the experimental work of akyıldız and ünal 2005 the rigid t shaped baffles mounted to the bottom of the tank had a thickness of 10 mm the preliminary studies and previous experiences of the authors indicated that a particular width was required to provide effective shallow water and blockage effects which helps to reduce the sloshing motion accordingly a fixed baffle width of 46 cm corresponding to the half breadth of the tank was selected in the study in order to address to the tank conditions with relatively high pressure levels two liquid depths h which corresponded to 50 and 75 of the tank height were considered the ratio of the baffle heights h b to the liquid depth h was chosen as 0 5 0 75 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 respectively the time dependent pressure signals were obtained from a sensor placed on the right wall of the tank for each computational case fig 1 a rotational motion around the axis that is perpendicular to the xy plane and passing through the bottom centre of the geometry was applied to the rectangular tank the fixed angular frequency of 3 3 rad s chosen corresponded to roughly 60 of the natural frequency of the tank liquid system for the liquid depths considered the motion was represented by a sinusoidal function θ θ 0 sin ω t where θ 0 ω and t imply rotation angle amplitude angular velocity and time respectively two different rotation angles of 4 and 8 were used in the study in this way the effect of the baffle heights as well as the rotation angles and the liquid depths on the hydrodynamic loads and the wave heights was investigated by systematically varying these parameters the cases associated with the liquid depths of 50 and 75 were coded as d50 and d75 respectively in the paper the rotation angles mentioned above were shown as a4 and a8 throughout the text on the other hand whilst the unbaffled cases were abbreviated as u the baffled cases were coded as b5 b8 etc according to baffle height ratio h b h for example the case with a liquid depth of 50 a rotation angle of 4 and a baffle height ratio of 0 5 is named as a4 d50 b5 the computational cases investigated in the study can be seen in table 1 2 2 mathematical formulation and numerical approach 2 2 1 laminar flow calculations the fluid is assumed to be homogenous isotropic viscous and newtonian tank and fluid motions are assumed to be two dimensional the domain considered here is a rigid rectangular container partially filled with liquid as shown in fig 1 the governing equations are solved simultaneously with the corresponding boundary conditions and free surface kinematics and dynamic boundary conditions in the fluid domain 1 u u v 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p f ν 2 u where u u v is the velocity vector defined in the tank fixed coordinate and ρ p ν and f are the liquid density pressure kinematic viscosity and external forces per mass respectively in order to include the non linearity and avoid the complex boundary conditions of moving walls the moving coordinate system is used the origin of the coordinate system is at the position of the centre plane of the tank and on the undisturbed free surface the moving coordinate is translating and rotating relative to an inertial system which can be used to represent general roll or pitch of the tank the external force per mass consists of gravitational forces the translational and rotational inertia forces which can be written as 3 f g v t 2 ω v ω t r ω ω r where g v and ω are the gravitational vector the translational velocity and the rotational velocity vector respectively in addition r is the position vector of the considered point relative to o on the free surface both the kinematics and dynamic conditions should be satisfied 4 η t u η y 0 5 p p atm where η and y represent the disturbed and undisturbed free surface levels respectively p atm is the air pressure or ullage pressure inside the tank the surface tension is ignored in this study therefore a no shear is needed on the free surface however proper wall conditions are necessary on the tank walls and the internal members 2 2 1 1 numerical computation for the analysis of the sloshing flow inside a partial filled tank a finite difference method fdm was applied to the governing equations fdm is useful when there are internal structures inside the tank or the fluid contacts the tank ceiling frequently as the internal structures exist the viscous effects may be dominant this method concentrates on the global fluid motion so some local effects such as turbulence and wave breaking have been ignored in some cases these local effects are important but the simulation of global flow plays a more critical role in many sloshing problems due to the slosh induced moment in the ship cargo kim 2001 volume of fluid vof technique was used hirt and nichols 1981 to track the interface between the fluids the scheme adopted in this study is the sola method of hirt and nichols 1981 tank volume was discretised into cartesian staggered grid cells a single layer of fictitious cells or boundary cells surrounded the fluid region the fictitious cells were used to set the boundary conditions so that the same difference equation can be used in the interior of the mesh liu and lin 2009 eswaran et al 2009 fluid velocities were located at the centres of the cell boundaries and pressure p and the volume of fluid function f were computed at the centre of the cell the solution algorithm works as a time cycle or movie frame the results of the time cycle act as initial conditions for the next one at each step suitable boundary conditions must be imposed at all boundaries there are two alternatives for the wall conditions when the viscosity effect on the tank boundary is significant the no slip condition should be imposed however in most sloshing problems the viscous effect is not significant and the boundary layer thickness is much less than the cell size therefore the free slip condition was applied for the tank walls and the baffle in the present study for example if the left boundary of the computing mesh is to be a rigid free slip wall the normal velocity will be zero and the tangential velocity should have no normal gradients i e 6 u 1 j 0 v 1 j v 2 j for all j where j implies the value of the indices in the vertical direction and is related to the grid number numerical calculations can have quantities that develop large high frequency oscillations in space or time or both of them this behaviour is usually referred to as a numerical instability to prevent this type of numerical instability or inaccuracy certain restrictions must be observed in defining the mesh increments δx i and δy j the time increment δt and the upstream differencing parameter α for accuracy the mesh increments must be chosen small enough to resolve the expected spatial variations in all dependent variables generally the choice of δt is of extreme importance in explicit schemes it will govern the stability and accuracy of the computation while in implicit schemes it will affect the accuracy once a mesh has been chosen the choice of the time increment necessary for stability is governed by two restrictions first material cannot move through more than one cell in one time step because the difference equations assume fluxes only between adjacent cells therefore the time increment must satisfy the inequality 7 δ t δ x y δ u i j or 8 δ t m i n δ x i u i j δ y j v i j where the minimum is with respect to every cell in the mesh when a non zero value of kinematic viscosity momentum must not diffuse more than one cell in one time step a linear stability analysis shows that this limitation implies 9 υ δ t 1 2 1 δ x i 2 1 δ y j 2 in this study δt is automatically chosen to satisfy the above inequalities in order to ensure the numerical stability the parameter α is 10 1 α m a x u i j δ t δ x v i j δ t δ y when the period and amplitude of excitation are large the liquid responds violently and causes the numerical solution to become unstable the instability is related to the instability of the fluid motion such as the occurrence of turbulence wave breaking and the transition from homogeneous flow to a two phase flow for these situations the present numerical model is limited to the period prior to the inception of these flow perturbations 2 2 2 turbulent flow calculations the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations wilcox 2006 were used in the simulations in cartesian tensor notation these equations can be expressed as follows 11 u i x i 0 12 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i x j μ s i j ρ u i u j where ρ μ u p and u imply fluid density molecular viscosity averaged velocity averaged static pressure and fluctuating velocity respectively s i j term in equation 12 represents the mean strain rate tensor while the term ρ u i u j expresses the stresses which are produced by turbulent fluctuations namely reynolds stresses where an overbar signifies a shorthand for average the calculation of the reynolds stresses and the turbulence field were realised by means of the sst k ω turbulence model of menter 1994 which is based on the boussinesq hypothesis tennekes and lumley 1972 which for incompressible flow can be represented as follows 13 ρ u i u j 2 μ t s i j 2 3 ρ k δ i j where μ t and k represent turbulent viscosity and turbulent kinetic energy respectively while the symbol δ i j denotes the kronecker delta 2 2 2 1 numerical computation a fine volume discretization based solution algorithm was employed blazek 2001 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 to solve the rans and turbulence transport equations a pressure based segregated algorithm was applied for the solution the velocity pressure coupling was achieved with the piso method issa 1986 which a pressure correction technique providing relatively high convergence speed for time dependent simulations the pressure staggering approach of patankar and spalding 1972 were employed for the calculation of the pressure field where the pressure and velocity values are stored at different grid nodes whilst a second order central differencing scheme was used for the viscous terms the spatial discretization of the convective terms of the rans and turbulent transport equations was achieved with a second order upwind scheme pletcher et al 2013 the three time level implicit time discretization ferziger and peric 2002 was applied for unconditionally stable and accurate solutions the two phase flow problem was solved based on the volume of fluid vof technique of hirt and nichols 1981 the tracking of the free surface was performed with a high accuracy second order scheme in order to increase the accuracy of the simulations a dynamically varying time step was chosen such that the maximum local courant number courant et al 1928 in the flow field was kept around 1 this approach also avoided extremely long solution periods due to the unnecessarily small time step use the convergence of the solution at each time step was checked by the examination of the variation of the primitive variables such as velocity and pressure in addition to the scaled residuals of the equation systems the tank walls and baffle faces were modelled as no slip walls in the turbulent flow calculations 2 3 grid dependency 2 3 1 laminar flow calculations in order to testify and verify the discretization of the numerical model for the laminar flow calculations three different grid systems were chosen 16 31 23 31 and 46 31 for the unbaffled a8 d75 u case in this study the value of δt can be automatically calculated by the program and dynamically modified to ensure the stability and also optimize the pressure solution when the excitation is harmonic rolling it was found that the normalized time step was somewhat independent of the forcing period therefore about 200 time steps were required per forcing period in this program this appeared to hold regardless of discretization reasonable agreement of the time variations of the pressure for different grid systems at t1 for a8 d75 u was obtained for all grid systems while the difference between the results of the medium and fine mesh systems was simply indistinguishable a relatively fine discretization 46 31 with a finer enforcement of the velocity divergence requires 3 s of computer time per time step comparing a coarse discretization 16 31 therefore 23 31 grid system is chosen to obtain results in a reasonable time considering stability and accuracy 2 3 2 turbulent flow calculations a similar analysis with the same computational case was carried out for the rans simulations the pressure signals obtained from the t1 point by using three different mesh resolutions with nominal grid spacing of 1 2 and 4 mm can be comparatively examined for a8 d75 u in fig 2 in order to place a few cells in the boundary layer the grid size in these regions were kept around 1 mm and gradually increased if necessary depending on the nominal grid resolution as seen in the figure the agreement between the three plots is high since the results obtained from the grid spacings of 1 mm and 2 mm were almost identical subsequent simulations were carried out with the former grid resolution a view of the mesh structure used for the rans simulations can also be seen in fig 3 2 4 validation in order to assess the accuracy of the methods used the results of the pressure at t1 obtained from the unbaffled conditions by using the above mentioned two numerical methods were compared with those of the experimental work of akyıldız and ünal 2005 2006 for the two computational cases a8 d75 u and a8 d50 u due to the low frequency data collection the experimental signals have sharp edges it should be noted that due to the uncertainty of the initialisation of the data collection in the tests the computational and experimental signals were time aligned such that the first peaks of the signals overlap as shown in figs 4 and 5 the magnitude of the non dimensionalised pressure signals are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data for both laminar and rans calculations the concordance between the turbulent and laminar calculations applied is also remarkable whilst the periodicity of the sloshing motion is also well captured with the numerical methods used for both cases the first case investigated a8 d75 u produced a slightly lower sloshing frequency compared to the experiments fig 4 the main sloshing motion frequency is calculated as 0 525 hz whilst this value was 0 560 hz in the experiments the frequency obtained from the second computational case a8 d50 u on the other hand is in good agreement with the experimental data fig 5 the computational and experimental values of the main motion frequency was obtained as 0 525 hz and 0 515 hz respectively the validation study showed that the simulations involving t shaped baffles can be confidently performed by using the two numerical methods adopted it should be born in mind that in order to achieve 2d flow conditions the length to breadth ratio of the tank should be as small as possible to avoid any 3d flow such as swirling diagonal waves etc for the rolling excitation of a tank faltinsen and timokha 2009 hence the results of the present 2d simulations should be essentially interpreted with the slender tank assumption however the agreement with the results of the 3d tank experiments with a tank length of 46 cm also implied negligible 3d flow influences for the unbaffled cases nonetheless the application of a baffle may increase these effects if it does not significantly affect the global impact loads and main flow structure 3 results and discussion 3 1 laminar flow calculations fig 6 displays the non dimensional pressure signals obtained from the t1 probe which was placed on the right wall at a height of 6 cm above the bottom for all cases the absolute pressure values which are equal to the sum of the aero hydrostatic and static pressure values were non dimensionalised with respect to the hydrostatic pressure level acting on the bottom surface p ρ g seen in fig 6 imply absolute pressure pa liquid density kg m3 and gravitational acceleration m s2 respectively as is seen some of the signals cannot reach to the targeted time point ω t 14 since the computer code used in the calculation was not designed to model the complex sloshing motions such as liquid spray and wave breaking which occurs after the impact of the liquid on the top surface the pressure oscillations mainly display a sinusoidal structure for the unbaffled cases the amplitude of the oscillations is higher for the d50 u cases with respect to the d75 u cases for both rotational angles adopted the increase of the rotational angle also raised the amplitude of the oscillations as expected as far as the baffled cases are concerned it can be clearly observed that the baffle can effectively dampen the amplitude of the pressure oscillations for d50 b cases when h b h 0 8 for the cases with the same liquid depth and h b h 0 8 the amplitude of the oscillations and or the maximum level of the pressure further increased this is also evidenced by the figures figs 10 13 presented in the following section a similar situation applies to the d75 b cases this time however the results indicate that the baffle was incapable of damping the oscillations when h b h 0 8 for the cases with h b h 0 8 whilst the signal amplitudes significantly diminished 3 2 turbulent flow calculations much more detailed analyses were performed for the turbulent flow calculations shown in fig 7 are the non dimensional pressure signals obtained from the t1 sensor this numerical technique which allowed a higher precision in resolving the complex sloshing motion indicated a non sinusoidal and oscillating curve structure for the unbaffled cases in contrast to the results of the laminar flow calculations the instant rises and drops particularly observed in the baffled cases are due to the liquid sprays and wave breakings occurring during the sloshing motion which could be captured with the very high time resolution of the simulations also see figs 10 13 it can also be seen that some of the unbaffled cases displayed multiple peaks during the second period of the sloshing motion this is due to the interference of the free surface waves and fluid flow heading to the side walls of the tank and reflecting from them within this interval the time resolution of the computations allowed the capture of the phenomenon the maximum and minimum pressure levels along with the differences between the extremes of the pressure signal amplitudes d a obtained from the computations are collected in table 2 fundamentally the results pointed out that the baffles were fully effective with the baffle height ratios of h b h 0 8 for the two liquid depths and rotation angles considered in the study although the general character of the pressure signals is different in terms of determination of the effective height ratios of the baffles the results of the turbulent flow simulations are in close agreement with the observations previously presented for the laminar calculations table 2 demonstrates that the application of baffle with an adequate height can significantly damp the liquid sloshing motion and reduce d a with respect to those of the unbaffled cases considering d50 cases this effect along with the reduction in the maximum pressure level can be observed when h b h 0 8 for instance whilst the non dimensional pressure values were within 0 4 1 2 range for the unbaffled a8 d50 u case the values of the signal varied within a range of 0 7 0 9 with the application of the baffle with a height ratio of h b h 1 0 a8 d50 b1 this indicates a serious decrease of about 72 in d a however for the d50 b8 cases h b h 0 8 during the second period of the sloshing motion the maximum levels of the pressure signals were increased in comparison with those of the unbaffled cases due to the complex flow structure generated by the baffles a similar trend can be observed for d75 only the cases with hb h 0 8 were successful in diminishing both d a and maximum pressure level in a8 d75 the decrease of d a was computed as around 62 within the first two sloshing periods with the application of the largest baffle the table indicates a significant rise in d a for the rest of the computational cases for these cases the application of baffle negatively affected sloshing motion and increased the amplitude of the impact loads on the other hand the motion and impact load damping effect of the baffles appeared to be relatively diminished for the higher filling depth this can be clearly evidenced by the examination of the reduction in d a for the b9 and b1 cases for both rotation angles table 2 for the two liquid depths and rotation angles adopted the period of the pressure signals was also increased with increasing baffle heights for the case of h b h 1 0 however the oscillation period value returned to the value of the unbaffled case s period although this study is focused on the sloshing motion in the tank considering two filling depths of 50 and 75 additional simulations with a filling depth of 25 were also performed to observe the influence of the baffles for relatively lower liquid levels and to make a clearer conclusion about their effectiveness the ratio of the angular frequency of the simulations to the natural frequency of the tank was kept at 0 6 table 2 also covers the results of these simulations it can be observed that the motion damping effect of the baffles was increased for the two rotation angles considered the baffle with a height ratio of h b h 0 75 was sufficient to keep the oscillation amplitudes and maximum pressure levels below those of the unbaffled tank the reason of the rise of the pressure signal amplitudes for the cases of h b h 0 8 in comparison with the unbaffled cases can be perceived by the investigation of the graphs in figs 8 13 the phase numbers seen in fig 8 correspond to the motion times of t t 4 t t 2 t 3t 4 t t t 5t 4 t 3t 2 t 7t 4 t 2t respectively the same phases were used in all subsequent figures the x and y axes in the figures show the distance from the bottom centre of the tank in meters in this section six specific cases were selected for the demonstration of the effect of the baffle on the sloshing motion for a clearer and concise presentation the reason of the selection of the rotation angle of 8 is that this configuration provides a violent free surface motion that can easily reach to the top wall of the tank b5s are clear examples of the strong negative impact of the introduction of the baffle and b9s are the cases where the damping influence of the baffle is explicitly apparent the figures show the structure of the free liquid surface at the different phases within the first two sloshing periods 2t for different cases as seen from figs 8 and 9 the motion has a simple and organised form with a minimal free surface deformation for the unbaffled cases the maximum liquid level which was approximately 0 5 m high for a8 d50 u reached to the ceiling of the tank for a8 d75 u within the first sloshing period in the second period due to the wave reflections created by the wall and mutual cancellation of the waves the free surface levels remained lower than those of the first period on the other hand figs 10 and 11 indicated that the structure of the free surface became highly complex and violent with the application of the t shaped baffle with a ratio of h b h 0 5 which was amongst the cases that made the wall pressures and the amplitudes of the oscillations increase with respect to those of the unbaffled cases see figs 6 and 7 and table 2 even within the first period of the motion the levels of the liquid were higher than those of the unbaffled case and the fluid strongly hit the side and top walls of the tank a large amount of liquid appeared to be clearly free to move with a high momentum intensity for the second period of the motion the free surface became highly disorganised and very rough it was also exposed to a strong liquid spray and wave breaking phenomenon figs 10 and 11 one can deduce that if the height of the baffle is insufficient the sloshing motion and hence the pressure levels acting on the tank walls are notably amplified as far as the cases with h b h 0 9 are concerned see figs 12 and 13 it can be clearly seen that the structure of the free surface is still complex although the liquid level could still reach to the top wall of the tank the major portion of the liquid motion was effectively blocked by the baffle the amount of liquid hitting to the walls was low and the free surface roughly remained horizontal this flow structure clarifies the drops of the pressure signals for the cases h b h 0 8 the flow topology of the sloshing motion can be deeply investigated benefiting from the plots presented in figs 14 19 shown in figs 14 16 and 18 are the streamlines of the flow at different sloshing phases which are coloured according to the velocity magnitudes and were obtained for the aforementioned three cases of d75 the thick solid line represents the free surface the vorticity distributions at different sloshing phases computed for the same cases can also be examined in figs 15 17 and 19 the figures more clearly reveal the structure of the sloshing motion for a8 d75 u the flow primarily included two well defined co rotating structure the odd numbered phases of this unbaffled case retained this organised counterclockwise rotational motion for the first two periods examined two additional clockwise rotating motions were also visible at the bottom corners of the tank for the 7th phase the organised structure of the rotation was somewhat broken down for the even numbered phases in which rightward and leftward motions were dominant the 6th case however included a saddle point around which weak rotations were existent the motion in general was remarkably slow compared to those seen in the baffled cases the area weighted average velocity magnitudes at each sloshing phase for the three cases in question can be examined in table 3 the area weighted average can be represented as follows 14 i 1 n a i i i 1 n a i where implies an arbitrary variable value to be averaged and a i is the area of each computational grid cell table 3 also includes the values obtained from a8 d75 b1 which will be discussed later the values of the odd numbered phases were substantially small compared to those of the even numbered phases probably due to the effect of the mutual cancellation of the free surface waves and momentum the maximum of these values occurred in 4th phase where the maximum velocity magnitude was around 0 95 m s within a highly confined zone appearing at the rightmost free surface boundary for the unbaffled case also it appeared that there existed almost no shear stress for the most part of the flow indicating a similar character to that of a rigid body motion for this reason the associated vorticity distributions shown in fig 15 imply that the vorticity in the liquid flow was simply generated due to the existence of the boundary layer zones the area weighted average vorticity levels at each sloshing motion phase are collected in table 4 the average value of the vorticity magnitude was lower than those computed for the baffled cases and almost 50 lower compared to the average vorticity level of a8 d75 b5 the wall shear effect which generated the vorticity indeed directly contributed to the liquid sloshing as a motion damping factor the liquid motion in the vicinity of the side walls also created well defined small vorticity areas around the intersection of the free surface and side walls see 4th and 5th phases of fig 15 considering the case of a8 d75 b5 h b h 0 5 whilst various centre of rotations can be observed in fig 16 the velocity magnitude was significantly and progressively risen particularly in the zone confined between the free surface and the top surface of the baffle mainly due to the limitation of the flow motion zone by the t shaped baffle the momentum of the flow above the baffle considerably increased and intensified the sloshing motion of the liquid the area weighted average velocity magnitudes calculated are given in table 3 almost at each phase the magnitudes were higher than those observed in the unbaffled case the global average velocity magnitude was around 46 larger for this baffled case it should be noted here that the average includes the contribution of the slower motion zones below the baffle which more clearly reveals the higher momentum levels occurring above the higher values of the velocity magnitudes took place near the tips of the baffle due to the vortices generated and around the free surface as a comparison for the most accelerated sloshing phase 4th phase whilst the maximum velocity around the tip was 1 4 m s the flow velocity due the free surface motion reached to values higher than 1 8 m s this value is almost 90 larger than that calculated for a8 d75 u although the generation of the tip vortices causes a loss in the motion energy it appeared that it augmented the momentum of the liquid above the baffle and caused the free surface motion to grow stronger well defined rotational motions gradually increased in the odd numbered phases the even numbered phases on the other hand contained higher momentum levels however displayed less rotational structures the associated vorticity distribution presented in fig 17 demonstrates the existence of the well organised tip vortices generated by the two free ends of the baffle which were immediately formed with the rotational motion of the tank and subsequently shed into the liquid zone in a regular fashion advancing in the right and left directions depending on the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of the tank by the investigation of table 4 one can see that due to this vortex generation the global average vorticity level doubled in respect to that of the unbaffled case the levels were also significantly larger at each sloshing phase the strength of these tip vortices was initially quite high up to 200 1 s in the 2nd phase they also became stronger before the instant they broke up subsequently the vorticity area was grown but its strength gradually diminished for instance the core strength of the clockwise vortex generating from the left tip at the 2nd phase of the motion was about 86 1 s after the shedding phenomenon its core strength dropped by 50 at the 4th phase eventually the vortices mixed with the vorticity in the boundary layer and the other vortices generated due to the boundary layer or free surface motion the interpretation of these results along with the streamlines shown in fig 16 reveals that these systematic vortex structures and the blockage of the baffle increase the momentum of the flow above the t shaped baffle and contribute to the violent motion of the free surface consequently while one could expect a diminishment in the sloshing motion and attenuation in the pressure levels acting on the tank walls due to the motion blockage of the baffle despite the energy loss due to the generation of the vortices blockage and additional wall shear the opposite effect occurred the results associated with the case a8 d75 b9 h b h 0 9 are presented in figs 18 and 19 it can be seen that the flow velocity magnitudes significantly reduced for the most part of the liquid zone table 3 indicates a reduction of 10 with respect to the average velocity levels of a8 d75 b5 however they were still significantly higher 30 in global average than those observed in the unbaffled case relatively high velocities occurred in the confined area between the top of the baffle and the free surface and in the local zones where high vorticity levels existed due to the shallow water effect although a reduction in the global averaged velocity magnitudes was obtained they reached to relatively very high values of up to 1 75 m s in specific regions the odd numbered phases displayed a flow structure basically formed by two large rotational zones at both sides of the baffle which also included several smaller rotational structures the tip vortices were still generated by the ends of the baffle however they were prematurely shed as they rapidly broke down by the free surface flow the vortex shedding frequency was substantially high the first vortex shedding took place before the first sloshing phase according to table 4 a notable reduction of 36 in the global average vorticity magnitudes created due to the absence of the well organised tip vortices was obtained as the free surface motion occurred very close to the top surface of the baffle the vorticity levels within this area was quite strong the organised and diffused vorticity zones apparent after the 5th phase is a result of the blending of the tip vortices with the significant vorticity generated by the boundary layer flow and or free surface motion due to the shallow water effect the contribution of the wall shear was also higher due to the increased baffle surface area and stronger interaction of the boundary layer and free surface flow the latter coupled with a lower velocity weaker momentum fluid flow effectively dampened the free surface levels and the pressures acting on the walls it should be noted here that although the related plots are not given in an effort to provide a concise presentation the motion blockage seen in a8 d75 b1 was significantly high and the velocity levels dropped to the values of the unbaffled cases table 3 the systematic vortex shedding was completely absent in this case due to the dynamic free surface motions contacting the upper wall of the baffle still the vorticity levels were once again amplified since the latter was the dominant factor generating the vorticity table 4 due to the stronger influence of the convective blockage and wall shear effect the pressure levels and free surface deformations were substantially damped 4 conclusion two distinct numerical methods involving laminar and turbulent flow calculations based on the vof technique were applied for simulating the single degree of freedom liquid sloshing in a partially filled rotating 2d rectangular tank with bottom mounted fixed width t shaped baffle a systematic approach was presented to reveal the effect of the vertical baffle height on the sloshing motion for two rotating angles and different filling depths the time history of the pressure signals acting on the side wall as well as the general topological features of the flow free surface deformations and vorticity distributions around the baffle at constant sloshing phases were comparatively presented and discussed in detail the two numerical methods produced well agreed results in terms of the fundamental effect of the t shaped baffle on the pressure signals obtained from the tank surface for all cases investigated as pointed out previously the laminar flow calculations were incapable of simulating the wave breaking and spraying phenomena and this method was not appropriate for the situations when the liquid reached the ceiling of the tank however as presented this did not jeopardise the global impact load predictions of this approach as the turbulent simulations detailedly modelled wave braking and spraying phenomena the pressure signals obtained were rather irregular the results of both simulation techniques were also in agreement with the experimental results found in the open literature for the unbaffled cases the computations indicated that the laminar flow approach with its relatively coarse grid resolution and rapid calculation performance associated with the global sloshing loads is suitable to be used at early design stages of tank geometry and structure enabling the consideration of various design alternatives the turbulent flow approach on the other hand is computationally much more expensive however it may produce highly detailed results in the sense of the turbulent flow features around the baffle which affect the sloshing motion and impact loads it is then suitable for performing extensive liquid sloshing analyses and it may be used at later stages of the design process when the detailed geometrical definitions of the tank and baffle are available the critical findings of the investigation are briefly addressed as follows the amplitudes of the pressure signals decreased with increasing filling depth for both rotation angles considered for the unbaffled cases on the other hand the increase of the rotation angle resulted in the intensification of the sloshing motion along with the pressure oscillation amplitudes as expected the application of the t shaped baffle amplified the complexity of the free surface and caused stronger wave breaking liquid spraying compared to those observed in the unbaffled cases the baffle caused a substantial increment in the area weighted average velocity and vorticity levels in the tank initially for h b h 0 5 the global average velocity raised by 46 and this value gradually decreased as the height of the baffle increased still the velocities in the zone between the top wall of the baffle and free surface remained high the vorticity in the sloshing motion was typically created by the tips of the baffle free surface and tank boundary layers when h b h 0 8 since the free surface weakly affected the flow around the baffle the tip vortices generated were well defined and organised however for h b h 0 8 these vortices were prematurely shed as they rapidly broke down by the free surface flow until the systematic shedding is completely disappeared for h b h 1 0 the vorticity levels were more influenced by the existence of the baffle and its height than the velocity levels for h b h 0 5 the vorticity levels doubled compared to the unbaffled case examined the increase of the height of the baffle significantly dropped the vorticity intensities however due to the dominance of the free surface motion contacting the upper wall of the baffle the vorticity levels were once again significantly augmented for h b h 1 0 according to the pressure signals and free surface deformations obtained from the simulations it was revealed that the t shaped baffle was ineffective in completely damping the sloshing for h b h 0 8 within the first two periods of the motion for the filling depths of 50 and 75 however the effectiveness of the baffles was increased with decreasing filling depths when the liquid depth was further reduced to 25 a height ratio of h b h 0 75 was sufficient to keep the oscillation amplitudes and maximum pressure levels below those of the unbaffled tank the motion damping property of the baffle is connected with the optimal balance between the wall shear and blockage effects along with the energy loss by the generation of the vorticity when the height was not adequate the liquid convection was intensified and the generated vorticity and friction was insufficient to expense enough energy to suppress the free surface motion and pressure levels as the baffle height increased the blockage and wall shear became the dominant effect and a significant reduction in free surface and pressure levels were achieved it is believed that the present study serves as a valuable tool in the estimation of the sloshing characteristics in rectangular tanks and in the design of the t baffles suitable to the user s requirements and also sheds further light to the understanding the complex fluid motion due to the t shaped baffles future works will involve multiple degree of freedom analyses to investigate the impact loads due to the sloshing motion in 3d prismatic tanks

of a computational method for predicting global hull structure response due to regular head seas waves in the time domain in addition a brief summary of a segmented model test performed at the university of new orleans towing tank is given some of the preliminary results from the computational method are compared to the experimental results these results serve to validate the method as well as to show some of its capabilities this type of analysis is important for large ocean going ships especially those with slender hull forms the recent trend to capitalize on economies of scale by designing and building ever larger ships makes the question of global hull response even more pertinent relatively recent catastrophic accidents such as the mol comfort bring into question the adequacy of existing design methods for evaluating global structural response for these contemporary ship designs investigation report on the structural safety of large container ships 2014 analytical approaches such as frequency domain linear strip theory are widely known these well established linear theories have been shown to provide reasonably good approximations of a ship s motions in heave and pitch and offer a rapid and robust solution method however the linearizing assumptions of these methods do not capture the asymmetry of a hull girder s dynamic response yielding simplified dynamic bending moment predictions linear theories must assume that the hydrodynamic coefficients and the inertial and diffraction forcing amplitudes are constant this means the submerged geometry of the hull is considered invariant with time generally these methods also consider the ship as a rigid body and do not consider the flexibility of the hull structure or the effects of structural damping many examples comparing linear predictions to model scale or full scale data have been published and in some cases especially cases with low speed and small to moderate wave amplitudes reasonable agreement is found while there are many examples of this work some notable studies include those by korvin kroukovsky and jacobs 1957 gerritsma and beukelman 1967 salvesen et al 1970 kaplan and raff 1972 kim et al 1980 bishop and price 1979a 1979b 1977 and 1986 published extensively on ship hydroelasticity both developing an early theoretical formulation for the hydroelasticity of rigid bodies and later flexible bodies and presented multiple numerical and experimental comparisons of linear ship structural response in regular and irregular waves using strip theory explorations into vertical responses were primary but consideration was also given to lateral and torsional modes however early work by jacobs 1958 noted that dynamic bending moment response was predominately a second order effect furthermore the bending moments were found to be sensitive to the hydrodynamic added mass and damping terms his experimental and analytical work concluded that linear predictions were not sufficient in capturing the important small local load variations and the resulting discrepancies were assumed to be attributed partly to the linear coefficients jensen and pedersen 1979 proposed a quadratic strip theory in which the coefficients are a linear function of the local draft which must be solved in the time domain their work also examined full scale short term experimental data and determined that the vertical bending moments predicted by linear theories were unsatisfactory jensen and pedersen 1981 their work was also extended to provide design values based on the results of the nonlinear theory jensen 2001 xia and wang 1997 implemented a time domain slender body theory and compared the numerical results to experimental results of rigid and flexible models their findings reiterated the importance of nonlinear effects on the hydroelastic response of ships and explored the body nonlinear solution of the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces fonseca and soares 2002 2004 presented multiple experimental and numerical investigations on the nonlinearity of vertical responses of a containership and concluded that strong nonlinearity could be observed in the structural responses as well as marked asymmetry in the time domain signals the mathematical model included body nonlinear hydrostatic and inertial forces as well as memory effects mikami and shimada 2006 also implemented a body nonlinear time domain strip method which included memory effects via a convolution function in more recent years many researchers have implemented similar strip theory methods including lee et al 2012 e silva and soares 2013 rajendran and soares 2016 rajendran et al 2016 and others in general it has been found that the nonlinear formulations are more effective in predicting the global loads especially in large waves recent research has also focused on the transfer of nonlinear seakeeping loads to finite element structural models including malencia et al 2006 tuitman et al 2009 ma et al 2012 these methods typically focus on hydrodynamic loads computed using 3d panel methods but some work has also focused on 2d and 2 5d strip theories however these methods typically do not fully couple the hydrodynamic and structural model directly the method presented here is a time domain strip theory coupled to a global finite element model which introduces body nonlinearity using a quadratic perturbation method and a non rigid hull girder for simplicity the ship is assumed to be in head seas μ 180 and moving with zero forward speed u 0 0 ft s time varying hydrostatic and hydrodynamic coefficients are computed from their mean stillwater values via a perturbation term that is a function of the local instantaneous draft along the hull this establishes the theory as a type of approximate body nonlinear theory where the submerged hull variation is approximated locally at each time step much more rapidly as opposed to a more computationally intensive direct solution of the hydrostatic and radiation problems at each time step the local drafts are computed continuously through time with consideration given to the local instantaneous vertical position the local deflection and the incident wave elevation geometric symmetry and the head seas limitation allow the diffraction forcing to be computed from the radiation and incident wave potentials using the haskind relation the inertial froude krylov forces are then computed using the head seas equations given by beck et al 1989 which depends on the hydrostatic stiffness coefficient because these formulations are developed to depend primarily on the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic coefficients both the inertial and diffraction forces are thereby also approximately body nonlinear incident waves are considered regular for simplicity the dynamic hull girder structure is modeled using standard eulerian beam elements which are free in vertical translation and rotation at each node the model is shown by fig 1 hydrostatic stiffness in heave and pitch is modeled using translational and rotational spring elements respectively structural stiffness is imparted by the sectional moment of inertia and modulus of elasticity in the beam element as is typical in finite element methods only vertical hydrodynamic potential damping is considered on the basis that the elements are small with a simplified approach to structural damping included in the formulation physical mass and hydrodynamic added mass are computed at each node by decomposing the longitudinal mass distribution to each node a similar approach is taken with the wave excitation forcing where the forces are computed locally for each node viscous and memory effects have been ignored 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 equation of motion in this section the theory and assumptions behind the method will be discussed as mentioned earlier fig 1 illustrates the theoretical dynamic model underlying the method the foundation of the method then is the assembly and solution of the equation of motion describing this model to apply the theoretical model to a hull geometry as shown by fig 2 the hull is discretized into n s stations or nodes we denote a particular node by n where the forward perpendicular is denoted by n 1 and the after perpendicular is denoted n n s hull elements are denoted by s each hull element is theoretically equivalent to a beam element as in fig 1 due to this discretization we denote the degrees of freedom for a single element as opposed to that for the entire hull as is the case in a typical rigid body motion problem as implied by fig 1 we permit each node on each element to be free in heave and pitch but fixed in all other modes the motions problem for each node is therefore 2 dof but because each element is defined by 2 nodes each element is said to have 4 dof in other words an individual hull element is free in vertical translation heave and rotation about the transverse axis pitch at each node 2 2 following this model the equation of motion is then defined over each element s in fig 2 resulting in 1 where the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the node number on the element note that the element specific 4 dof solution vectors are shown explicitly and that the local coefficient matrices are correspondingly of size 4 4 1 m s a s η 3 1 η 5 1 η 3 2 η 5 2 s b s t r u c t s b s η 3 1 η 5 1 η 3 2 η 5 2 s c s c s t r u c t s η 3 1 η 5 1 η 3 2 η 5 2 s f 3 1 f 5 1 f 3 2 f 5 2 s for s 1 to n s in the equation above m s and a s are the local physical and hydrodynamic added mass matrices respectively b s t r u c t s is the elemental structural damping matrix and b s is the local hydrodynamic damping matrix c s t r u c t s and c s are the elemental structural stiffness and local hydrostatic stiffness matrices the forcing vector shown on the right hand side of 1 represents the forces and moments at each node at the elemental level these are therefore the element wise internal reactions where f 3 n is the vertical reaction force and f 5 n is the reaction moment about the transverse axis at the n th node equilibrium dictates that the internal moments at nodes shared by two elements will sum to zero in practice it was found that the moments are not quite identical due to numerical limitations however a simple average of the absolute value of each moment presents no loss in accuracy since the difference is small compared to the magnitude of the values respecting the connectivity of the local elements in the global structure the global system of equations is represented by the global matrix form of the equation of motion 2 where the coefficient matrices are now of size 2 n s 2 n s and f t is the external forcing vector of length 2 n s one will also observe that the solution and its derivatives must also be vectors of length 2 n s because the elements are connected serially i e end to end the global matrices are easily assembled by superimposing the local matrices for s 1 n s 1 along the diagonal as is typical in finite element formulations 2 m a η t b s t r u c t b η t c s t r u c t c η t f t let us reiterate that 2 denotes the global system which is the result of the superposition of the many local elemental systems 1 according to their connectivity the solution η t is therefore the global displacement vector which includes vertical displacement and rotation at each node along the length of the hull girder similarly f t is the external force vector which includes vertical forces and moments applied to the global system at each node this is quite different from the typical rigid body formulation in which the displacement is given for the entire hull typically about the center of gravity and the heave and pitch excitation are computed over the entire hull surface the distinction between the local systems and the global system is important as the theory is developed predominately at the element level 2 2 hydrodynamic hydrostatic coefficients the two dimensional heave hydrodynamic coefficients a 33 and b 33 are determined at the sections corresponding to each node using the two dimensional rankine patch boundary element method formulated by soding 1993 and described by bertram 2001 invoking the assumptions of potential flow there exists a potential ϕ such that the two dimensional laplace equation may be satisfied in the fluid domain the radiation problem is then formulated by the decay linearized body combined linearized free surface and an appropriate radiation boundary condition contrary to typical panel methods the boundary conditions are enforced over the entire patch not only at a single colocation point by integrating each boundary condition over the patch extents once the radiation potential is known the complex two dimensional radiation coefficient is then computed by integrating the total potential over the section body contour as given by 3 the two dimensional heave coefficients are then found from the real and imaginary parts of the complex coefficient as shown 3 ω e 2 a 33 i ω e b 33 ρ i ω e n 3 ϕ 3 y z x d l the two dimensional heave hydrostatic stiffness coefficient c 33 is computed according to equation 4 where b x is the local waterplane beam at the longitudinal location of a node ρ and g are the density of water and gravitational acceleration respectively 4 c 33 ρ g b x because the dynamic model is composed of finite beam elements as shown by fig 1 the two dimensional coefficients are not integrated over the length of the hull girder as is typical in a rigid body formulation instead the coefficients are determined at each node by integrating over the corresponding element length it can be said that the resulting nodal coefficients are three dimensional however they still represent only the local section associated with the element to this end and for a model with elements of constant length the two dimensional coefficients are simply scaled by the length of the element l s according to equation 5 through 10 to yield the three dimensional coefficients a 33 b 33 and c 33 at each node as shown in fig 1 the rotational coefficients a 55 b 55 and c 55 are computed according to equation 8 through 10 and are derived from the mass moment of inertia for a rod about its end here b 55 is considered zero on the basis that the element length is small general strip theory derivations for a 55 b 55 and c 55 will often include a second forward speed term that depends upon u and ω e recall that the method presented here assumes a vessel with zero forward speed and therefore these additional speed terms vanish 5 a 33 n a 33 n l s 6 b 33 n b 33 n l s 7 c 33 n c 33 n l s 8 a 55 n 1 3 a 33 n l s 2 9 b 55 n 0 10 c 55 n 1 3 c 33 n l s 2 equations 5 10 are computed for n 1 to ns note that the heave pitch coupling coefficients are omitted on the basis of local longitudinal symmetry about a node 2 3 external force vector the complex external heave excitation force per unit length is computed according to equation 11 this equation is derived from the summation of the froude krylov and diffraction exciting forces for a section assumptions include exclusively heave pitch forcing and zero forward speed a more comprehensive discussion of the derivation of this equation may be found in beck et al 1989 11 f 3 x t ζ a e i k w x e k w t x e i ω e t c 33 x ω 0 ω e a 33 x i b 33 x similar to the coefficients the heave excitation force for n th node is then computed by scaling the real part of 11 by the element length according to equation 12 note that this represents the external heave forces in the model shown in fig 1 12 f 3 n t re f 3 x t l s the external force vector is then assembled accordingly 13 f t f 3 1 t 0 f 3 2 t 0 f 3 n s t 0 t because the external forcing is applied at each node and the length of an element is considered small it is reasonable to assume that the external excitation moments about each node are zero as shown by 13 2 4 nonlinear formulation in the linear regime the coefficient matrices in equation 2 are assumed constant with time and independent of the solution η t this is of course true for the physical mass structural stiffness and structural damping matrices as these physical quantities are not affected by the motion or deformation of the vessel the elemental versions of these quantities are given below where again the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the node on the element s note the elemental structural stiffness matrix c s t r u c t s is that of a typical 4 dof beam element and the structural damping b s t r u c t s is taken proportional to the stiffness where tan δ is the visco elastic damping coefficient for steel tan δ is taken as 0 001 to 0 005 14 m s m 1 0 0

r u c t s when considering the hydrodynamic added mass damping and hydrostatic stiffness matrices the linear assumption is considered valid only for small amplitude first order responses given that it is contrary to the real world physics for example as the incident wave passes the hull and as the vessel heaves and pitches in the waves the hull girder will deflect and the submerged hull geometry will vary with time this means the coefficient matrices a b c are time varying quantities nonlinearity in the wave excitation forcing is also introduced as 11 depends on the unscaled coefficients in the present method the coefficients are interpreted as functions of the instantaneous nodal position η t this results in 17 the nonlinear form of equation 2 where the a b and c coefficient terms are no longer constant with time or position and the equation contains products of the solution and its derivatives with functions of the solution 17 m a η η t b s t r u c t b η η t c s t r u c t c η η t f t the nonlinear terms present obvious problems one cannot solve 17 unless the solution is already known to move forward it helps to consider a 33 b 33 and c 33 as functions of local draft t s t where t s t depends partly upon η t this distinction although more of an intermediary than a change of physical dependence allows the separation of a 33 b 33 and c 33 from η in an advantageous manner the coefficients are computed at the most basic level according to underwater geometry and wave characteristics the former of which is directly dependent upon draft making this a reasonable substitution the local draft can be computed according to 18 where t is the stillwater draft the second term represents the incident wave elevation and η 3 t is of course the instantaneous vertical position of the node where the coupling with pitch is already included fig 3 also illustrates this relationship 18 t s t t ζ a cos k w x ω e t η 3 t one will notice that as t s t is still dependent upon η 3 t we have seemingly only complicated the problem however if we invoke a small time step assumption it is possible to approximate t s t by replacing η 3 t with η 3 t δ t if δ t is sufficiently small the difference η 3 t η 3 t δ t will be sufficiently close to zero the coefficients can now be computed without trouble as η 3 t δ t is known for long wave periods it is not difficult to reach a suitable small value for δ t but it is an important consideration when assessing short wave periods and a worthy consideration otherwise computing the coefficients at each discrete time step by interpolating the submerged geometry of the hull using t s is common and this body exact method does have several advantages and is explored by many researchers but it is very computationally intensive especially if the radiation forces are recomputed directly in this method we use a different approach prior to solving equation 17 the coefficients are computed at two different stillwater drafts t t δ t where δ t has shown success when set equal to 0 1 ζ a using these two sets of coefficients it is possible to construct a proportional relationship for each coefficient as a function of draft as shown by equation 19 through 21 where the second term on the right hand side is the perturbation term note that in this formulation the partial derivative is assumed constant if the local draft is equal to the mean draft the second term vanishes and we are left with the coefficient at t note that the difference t s t t will be in some ways limited by the wave amplitude and the vertical position of the node in resonance these terms will be constructive and may lead to large perturbation terms 19 a 33 t s a 33 t a 33 t s t s t t s t t 20 b 33 t s b 33 t b 33 t s t s t t s t t 21 c 33 t s c 33 t c 33 t s t s t t s t t equation 19 through 21 may be visualized as a proportional relationship between the coefficients and sectional draft as shown by fig 4 to make this simplification valid the exact function of the hydrodynamic coefficient indicated arbitrarily by a dashed line must be close to linear within the draft range of interest this draft range is difficult to quantify without first estimating the vessel s motion response due to the wave because the heave response of the vessel may not be symmetric about t the coefficient also may not oscillate between t ζ a changes in hull geometry near the waterline should also be considered as any effects on the coefficients will not be captured unless t δ t includes the desired hull variation abrupt changes in hull geometry near the waterline will not be accurately represented by this approximation and would require a more direct method the proportional assumption mentioned above is an important consideration when selecting a suitable δ t for a particular wave and has a significant influence on the validity at certain wave amplitudes if for example the wave amplitude is very large it may be that the hydrodynamic coefficients are not reasonably proportional in the sectional draft range and therefore this approximation may not be valid one might compute multiple points within the expected draft range to check the validity of the assumption and this method may be extended beyond a simple proportional relationship although this has not been evaluated in the work presented here to complete the nonlinear formulation of the equation of motion 17 the nonlinear elemental hydrodynamic added mass matrix hydrodynamic damping matrix and hydrostatic stiffness matrix are given by equations 22 24

step is to determine the solution the system is solved using the newmark β direct integration scheme newmark 1959 with the careful selection of the coefficients γ 1 2 and β 1 4 the scheme offers unconditional numerical stability second order accuracy and does not introduce numerical damping the general method is given by equation 25 through 28 the constants a 0 through a 7 are also defined

nonlinear formulation and represent the total mass total damping and total stiffness and external excitation forcing 3 results experimental validation recent work by taravella and marlantes 2017 presented the midship heave pitch and bending moment response of a segmented korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso container ship model at the university of new orleans towing tank the experimental work was carried out before the computational work presented in this paper the model was constructed at the uno model shop to a 1 100 scale where the general particulars of the full scale and model scale hull are given by table 1 the segmented hull model was constructed using freeman plastics high density foam 5020 and the hull was divided at three locations along the length the divisions were placed at 1 89 ft aft of the forward perpendicular station 5 3 77 ft aft of the forward perpendicular midships station 10 and 5 66 ft aft of the forward perpendicular station 15 as shown in fig 5 hull girder stiffness was simulated with an aluminum square tube spine with a second moment of area equal to 0 218 in4 this translates to a full scale stiffness of 36 285 ft4 strain gages were installed in pairs on the top and bottom sides of the aluminum spine in the model the strain gage pairs were placed precisely at each of the segment gaps model motions were measured with a crossbow vg 400 inertial measuring unit imu the imu measures all three translational accelerations and angular rates and it also computes and outputs pitch and roll angles the study considered five different wave frequencies at wave amplitudes of 1 in and 1 5 in 8 33 ft and 12 5 ft full scale a body plan of the full scale hull geometry is shown by fig 6 the offsets were used to prepare a computer model for input into the computational method the theoretical weight distribution was also specified in the input file and is given by fig 7 at the design draft of 35 4 ft computational results were generated for ten different wave frequencies at a wave amplitude of 8 33 ft both linear and nonlinear results were generated for comparison in the nonlinear case δ t was taken as 0 1 ζ a or 0 833 ft for the 8 33 ft wave e was taken as 4 176e9 psf all simulations generated 300 s of data at a 0 1 s time step in the rigid body case the sectional moment of inertia i y y s was set to a very large value 10 000 000 000 ft4 to simulate rigid body motion i y y s and avoid effects of hull flexibility in the linear results this translates to a constant sectional inertia distribution along the length of the hull girder structural damping was also ignored in both the linear and nonlinear results tan δ 0 in the nonlinear case studies comparing the results with and without the full scale hull girder stiffness showed little difference in the results at lower wave frequencies therefore the results in this section present nonlinear effects due mainly to the nonlinear coefficients a 33 b 33 and c 33 as discussed in the theoretical formulation the midship heave and pitch raos for the linear and nonlinear maximum and minimum values were then plotted against the scaled model test measurements obtained by taravella and marlantes 2017 the mean values of the experimental data are plotted as points while the error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean for fig 8 through fig 12 although the focus of the computational method is the global structural response the heave and pitch response is the first step in achieving this result a comparison of the computational motion results to the model test data is important to validate the numerical solution before considering the internal reactions directly to this end the heave and pitch results are shown by figs 8 and 9 respectively the relative agreement between the model test data and the results obtained using the computational method is quite good as expected the asymptotic behavior of the heave and pitch response at low and high frequencies is observed the pitch response appears to be excited at ω e near 0 45 rad s 1 in general the nonlinear predicted heave and pitch response do not differ significantly from the linear formulation especially at low frequencies if anything the nonlinear pitch response may be slightly more pronounced near the natural frequency as well as the dip near 0 63 rad s 1 it does not appear that the nonlinear effects yield any appreciable difference at wave frequencies less than about 0 4 rad s 1 this makes physical sense as the lower frequency is paired with a longer wavelength thereby reducing the change in t s as the long wave period appears more or less like a still waterline this convergence is also observed in the heave response at high frequencies although minimal any deviation between linear and nonlinear heave and pitch response appears to be observed at or above 0 4 rad s 1 the nonlinear midship dynamic hogging and sagging bending moment amplitude functions are plotted against the model test data in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively again there appears to be a general agreement in terms of magnitude and shape between the computational and experimental results with both the maximum hogging and sagging bending moments occurring near the 0 55 rad s 1 wave frequency contrary to the heave and pitch response nonlinear coefficients impart significant variation in the predicted bending moment response when compared to the linear formulation it is evident that the sagging moment is markedly larger than the hogging moment at the peak frequency a difference of about 20 although the general agreement appears to be good the computational results do under predict the midship peak hogging moment in the current condition the sagging moment is also under predicted at wave frequencies below about 0 5 rad s 1 because the variation in the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic coefficients is dependent upon the change in local draft at low frequencies the change can be quite small yielding little change in the coefficients and ultimately a weakly nonlinear response it is believed that this behavior is one probable cause of the under prediction of bending moments at low wave frequencies the longitudinal dynamic bending moment distribution for the linear and nonlinear hogging and sagging results at wave frequencies of 0 503 rad s 1 and 0 635 rad s 1 are given by figs 12 and 13 respectively these frequencies correspond to the model test data near the peak bending moment response here it is most evident that the linear method may under predict the peak sagging bending moment for the given hull geometry the difference between the hogging and sagging bending moments is most notable in the after sections of the hull girder near node 16 at this node the difference between the hogging and sagging bending moment prediction is nearly 60 for the peak wave frequency of 0 503 rad s 1 the quadratic approximation of the change in coefficients influences considerable variation in the relatively flat after sections of the hull where the slope of the approximation is quite steep the results indicate a sensitivity to the local geometry as indicated by the distribution at 0 635 rad s 1 the sensitivity may be prone to overprediction it is expected that the variation is primarily influenced by the draft increment therefore determining a suitable draft increment for a particular geometry and or wave is consequently a topic of interest the experimental results show an asymmetry between the hogging and sagging bending moments with the deviation increasing as we move farther aft this behavior is expected and has been shown as typical it is therefore encouraging that the proposed method also exhibits this same behavior with a marked difference between the predicted hogging and sagging bending moments in the after section of the hull however while the method seems to well predict the sagging moments at nodes 6 11 and 16 at 0 503 rad s 1 the method does under predict the hogging moment conversely at 0 635 rad s 1 the hogging moment is better predicted and the sagging moment is overpredicted in the after part of the hull it is expected that these deviations are due to the relatively preliminary nature in which the δ t value was selected it is proposed that the δ t must be tuned to achieve better correlation between the experimental and theoretical results despite this in general terms the results follow the implied trend fig 14 and fig 15 show 50 s of steady state dynamic midship bending moment time series results for nodes 6 11 and 16 at wave frequencies of 0 503 rad s 1 and 0 635 rad s 1 respectively the black line is the rigid body linear case and the red is the nonlinear response matching the distributions in figs 12 and 13 nonlinear effects are small at node 6 where the slope of the approximate change in coefficients is small at node 11 the midship node the nonlinear effects become more apparent here it is observed that the hogging peaks become sharper and the sagging troughs become deeper and slightly more pronounced these general qualitative observations of shape are expected to properly consider the nonlinear variation at node 16 it is important to recall that the instantaneous vertical displacement of the node is included in the calculation of the local draft see eq 28 this means that the variation in coefficients is influenced more by the vertical motion response near peak heave response wave frequencies however near 0 503 rad s 1 and 0 635 rad s 1 the heave response is rather small therefore the primary influence on the variation in local drafts for the time series results shown is the change in wave elevation the reduction in the peak hogging response is expected to be the result of the phase relationship between the added mass damping and total forcing the peak added mass occurs at the same point in time as the step in the hogging moment further investigation of the phase relationships between the various components in equation 1 would be a worthy endeavor 4 conclusion the results of the computational method are validated by the model test data for the kriso containership hull geometry the nonlinear effects do not appear to have significant influence on vessel motions in heave and pitch although some small variations are observed at higher wave frequencies 0 4 rad s 1 and above dynamic midship bending moments were found to be highly sensitive to nonlinear effects yielding notable differences between the hogging and sagging bending moment peaks in the aft third of the vessel this was most apparent yielding a difference of nearly 60 at peak frequencies peak nonlinear sagging moments at midship exceeded linear predictions by about 12 moreover the longitudinal dynamic bending moment distribution near peak response is in fair agreement with the model test data with the nonlinear formulation capturing much of the significant variation in hogging and sagging bending moment response in the aft sections of the hull girder a qualitative assessment of the time series results also indicates expected trends of primary interest is the method s apparent tendency to under predict the hogging bending moments as evidenced in fig 10 and especially in fig 12 and overpredict the sagging moments as shown in fig 13 it is believed that this is due to the relatively simplistic assignment of δ t to 10 of the wave amplitude improved predictions may be had by setting different proportionality relationships for local drafts above vs below the calm waterline there also exists a strong dependence on geometry and sections with large changes in transverse offsets may yield highly sensitive coefficient variations such as in the after part of the kriso hull for this reason predictions may be further improved by varying δ t on a section by section basis perhaps based on sectional properties such as sectional area waterline tangent or sectional coefficients furthermore these variables may also have a significant effect on the stability and accuracy of the numerical solution this is especially true when analyzing a flexible hull or evaluating a wave frequency near resonance quantifying these numerical effects would be beneficial to improving the usability of the method and increasing confidence in the results to conclude the results presented in this paper show that the computational method may offer a viable means of evaluating dynamic global structural response of a ship due to waves with relatively little computational effort however further testing and improvements are required before the computational method might be suitable for use in design analysis a more robust set of model test data would allow a more comprehensive validation of the computational results the capability to specify non zero vessel speed an extension to more degrees of freedom or the ability to analyze responses in irregular waves are possible additions 
22626,this paper outlines the theoretical development and some validation of a quadratic strip theory method coupled to a global finite element model to predict the global structural response of the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso hull geometry due to regular head seas waves in the time domain the method attempts to capture some body nonlinear effects of the dynamic problem due to time varying underwater hull geometry by drawing a relationship between the coefficients a 33 b 33 and c 33 and the local draft t s in addition the hull girder is considered flexible and structural damping may be included a segmented model test in head seas was also performed and the linear and nonlinear numerical results are compared to the experimental data it is found that the

of a computational method for predicting global hull structure response due to regular head seas waves in the time domain in addition a brief summary of a segmented model test performed at the university of new orleans towing tank is given some of the preliminary results from the computational method are compared to the experimental results these results serve to validate the method as well as to show some of its capabilities this type of analysis is important for large ocean going ships especially those with slender hull forms the recent trend to capitalize on economies of scale by designing and building ever larger ships makes the question of global hull response even more pertinent relatively recent catastrophic accidents such as the mol comfort bring into question the adequacy of existing design methods for evaluating global structural response for these contemporary ship designs investigation report on the structural safety of large container ships 2014 analytical approaches such as frequency domain linear strip theory are widely known these well established linear theories have been shown to provide reasonably good approximations of a ship s motions in heave and pitch and offer a rapid and robust solution method however the linearizing assumptions of these methods do not capture the asymmetry of a hull girder s dynamic response yielding simplified dynamic bending moment predictions linear theories must assume that the hydrodynamic coefficients and the inertial and diffraction forcing amplitudes are constant this means the submerged geometry of the hull is considered invariant with time generally these methods also consider the ship as a rigid body and do not consider the flexibility of the hull structure or the effects of structural damping many examples comparing linear predictions to model scale or full scale data have been published and in some cases especially cases with low speed and small to moderate wave amplitudes reasonable agreement is found while there are many examples of this work some notable studies include those by korvin kroukovsky and jacobs 1957 gerritsma and beukelman 1967 salvesen et al 1970 kaplan and raff 1972 kim et al 1980 bishop and price 1979a 1979b 1977 and 1986 published extensively on ship hydroelasticity both developing an early theoretical formulation for the hydroelasticity of rigid bodies and later flexible bodies and presented multiple numerical and experimental comparisons of linear ship structural response in regular and irregular waves using strip theory explorations into vertical responses were primary but consideration was also given to lateral and torsional modes however early work by jacobs 1958 noted that dynamic bending moment response was predominately a second order effect furthermore the bending moments were found to be sensitive to the hydrodynamic added mass and damping terms his experimental and analytical work concluded that linear predictions were not sufficient in capturing the important small local load variations and the resulting discrepancies were assumed to be attributed partly to the linear coefficients jensen and pedersen 1979 proposed a quadratic strip theory in which the coefficients are a linear function of the local draft which must be solved in the time domain their work also examined full scale short term experimental data and determined that the vertical bending moments predicted by linear theories were unsatisfactory jensen and pedersen 1981 their work was also extended to provide design values based on the results of the nonlinear theory jensen 2001 xia and wang 1997 implemented a time domain slender body theory and compared the numerical results to experimental results of rigid and flexible models their findings reiterated the importance of nonlinear effects on the hydroelastic response of ships and explored the body nonlinear solution of the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces fonseca and soares 2002 2004 presented multiple experimental and numerical investigations on the nonlinearity of vertical responses of a containership and concluded that strong nonlinearity could be observed in the structural responses as well as marked asymmetry in the time domain signals the mathematical model included body nonlinear hydrostatic and inertial forces as well as memory effects mikami and shimada 2006 also implemented a body nonlinear time domain strip method which included memory effects via a convolution function in more recent years many researchers have implemented similar strip theory methods including lee et al 2012 e silva and soares 2013 rajendran and soares 2016 rajendran et al 2016 and others in general it has been found that the nonlinear formulations are more effective in predicting the global loads especially in large waves recent research has also focused on the transfer of nonlinear seakeeping loads to finite element structural models including malencia et al 2006 tuitman et al 2009 ma et al 2012 these methods typically focus on hydrodynamic loads computed using 3d panel methods but some work has also focused on 2d and 2 5d strip theories however these methods typically do not fully couple the hydrodynamic and structural model directly the method presented here is a time domain strip theory coupled to a global finite element model which introduces body nonlinearity using a quadratic perturbation method and a non rigid hull girder for simplicity the ship is assumed to be in head seas μ 180 and moving with zero forward speed u 0 0 ft s time varying hydrostatic and hydrodynamic coefficients are computed from their mean stillwater values via a perturbation term that is a function of the local instantaneous draft along the hull this establishes the theory as a type of approximate body nonlinear theory where the submerged hull variation is approximated locally at each time step much more rapidly as opposed to a more computationally intensive direct solution of the hydrostatic and radiation problems at each time step the local drafts are computed continuously through time with consideration given to the local instantaneous vertical position the local deflection and the incident wave elevation geometric symmetry and the head seas limitation allow the diffraction forcing to be computed from the radiation and incident wave potentials using the haskind relation the inertial froude krylov forces are then computed using the head seas equations given by beck et al 1989 which depends on the hydrostatic stiffness coefficient because these formulations are developed to depend primarily on the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic coefficients both the inertial and diffraction forces are thereby also approximately body nonlinear incident waves are considered regular for simplicity the dynamic hull girder structure is modeled using standard eulerian beam elements which are free in vertical translation and rotation at each node the model is shown by fig 1 hydrostatic stiffness in heave and pitch is modeled using translational and rotational spring elements respectively structural stiffness is imparted by the sectional moment of inertia and modulus of elasticity in the beam element as is typical in finite element methods only vertical hydrodynamic potential damping is considered on the basis that the elements are small with a simplified approach to structural damping included in the formulation physical mass and hydrodynamic added mass are computed at each node by decomposing the longitudinal mass distribution to each node a similar approach is taken with the wave excitation forcing where the forces are computed locally for each node viscous and memory effects have been ignored 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 equation of motion in this section the theory and assumptions behind the method will be discussed as mentioned earlier fig 1 illustrates the theoretical dynamic model underlying the method the foundation of the method then is the assembly and solution of the equation of motion describing this model to apply the theoretical model to a hull geometry as shown by fig 2 the hull is discretized into n s stations or nodes we denote a particular node by n where the forward perpendicular is denoted by n 1 and the after perpendicular is denoted n n s hull elements are denoted by s each hull element is theoretically equivalent to a beam element as in fig 1 due to this discretization we denote the degrees of freedom for a single element as opposed to that for the entire hull as is the case in a typical rigid body motion problem as implied by fig 1 we permit each node on each element to be free in heave and pitch but fixed in all other modes the motions problem for each node is therefore 2 dof but because each element is defined by 2 nodes each element is said to have 4 dof in other words an individual hull element is free in vertical translation heave and rotation about the transverse axis pitch at each node 2 2 following this model the equation of motion is then defined over each element s in fig 2 resulting in 1 where the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the node number on the element note that the element specific 4 dof solution vectors are shown explicitly and that the local coefficient matrices are correspondingly of size 4 4 1 m s a s η 3 1 η 5 1 η 3 2 η 5 2 s b s t r u c t s b

matrices respectively b s t r u c t s is the elemental structural damping matrix and b s is the local hydrodynamic damping matrix c s t r u c t s and c s are the elemental structural stiffness and local hydrostatic stiffness matrices the forcing vector shown on the right hand side of 1 represents the forces and moments at each node at the elemental level these are therefore the element wise internal reactions where f 3 n is the vertical reaction force and f 5 n is the reaction moment about the transverse axis at the n th node equilibrium dictates that the internal moments at nodes shared by two elements will sum to zero in practice it was found that the moments are not quite identical due to numerical limitations however a simple average of the absolute value of each moment presents no loss in accuracy since the difference is small compared to the magnitude of the values respecting the connectivity of the local elements in the global structure the global system of equations is represented by the global matrix form of the equation of motion 2 where the coefficient matrices are now of size 2 n s 2 n s and f t is the external forcing vector of length 2 n s one will also observe that the solution and its derivatives must also be vectors of length 2 n s because the elements are connected serially i e end to end the global matrices are easily assembled by superimposing the local matrices for s 1 n s 1 along the diagonal as is typical in finite element formulations 2 m a η t b s t r u c t b η t c s t r u c t c η t f t let us reiterate that 2 denotes the global system which is the result of the superposition of the many local elemental systems 1 according to their connectivity the solution η t is therefore the global displacement vector which includes vertical displacement and rotation at each node along the length of the hull girder similarly f t is the external force vector which includes vertical forces and moments applied to the global system at each node this is quite different from the typical rigid body formulation in which the displacement is given for the entire hull typically about the center of gravity and the heave and pitch excitation are computed over the entire hull surface the distinction between the local systems and the global system is important as the theory is developed predominately at the element level 2 2 hydrodynamic hydrostatic coefficients the two dimensional heave hydrodynamic coefficients a 33 and b 33 are determined at the sections corresponding to each node using the two dimensional rankine patch boundary element method formulated by soding 1993 and described by bertram 2001 invoking the assumptions of potential flow there exists a potential ϕ such that the two dimensional laplace equation may be satisfied in the fluid domain the radiation problem is then formulated by the decay linearized body combined linearized free surface and an appropriate radiation boundary condition contrary to typical panel methods the boundary conditions are enforced over the entire patch not only at a single colocation point by integrating each boundary condition over the patch extents once the radiation potential is known the complex two dimensional radiation coefficient is then computed by integrating the total potential over the section body contour as given by 3 the two dimensional heave coefficients are then found from the real and imaginary parts of the complex coefficient as shown 3 ω e 2 a 33 i ω e b 33 ρ i ω e n 3 ϕ 3 y z x d l the two dimensional heave hydrostatic stiffness coefficient c 33 is computed according to equation 4 where b x is the local waterplane beam at the longitudinal location of a node ρ and g are the density of water and gravitational acceleration respectively 4 c 33 ρ g b x because the dynamic model is composed of finite beam elements as shown by fig 1 the two dimensional coefficients are not integrated over the length of the hull girder as is typical in a rigid body formulation instead the coefficients are determined at each node by integrating over the corresponding element length it can be said that the resulting nodal coefficients are three dimensional however they still represent only the local section associated with the element to this end and for a model with elements of constant length the two dimensional coefficients are simply scaled by the length of the element l s according to equation 5 through 10 to yield the three dimensional coefficients a 33 b 33 and c 33 at each node as shown in fig 1 the rotational coefficients a 55 b 55 and c 55 are computed according to equation 8 through 10 and are derived from the mass moment of inertia for a rod about its end here b 55 is considered zero on the basis that the element length is small general strip theory derivations for a 55 b 55 and c 55 will often include a second forward speed term that depends upon u and ω e recall that the method presented here assumes a vessel with zero forward speed and therefore these additional speed terms vanish 5 a 33 n a 33 n l s 6 b 33 n b 33 n l s 7 c 33 n c 33 n l s 8 a 55 n 1 3 a 33 n l s 2 9 b 55 n 0 10 c 55 n 1 3 c 33 n l s 2 equations 5 10 are computed for n 1 to ns note that the heave pitch coupling coefficients are omitted on the basis of local longitudinal symmetry about a node 2 3 external force vector the complex external heave excitation force per unit length is computed according to equation 11 this equation is derived from the summation of the froude krylov and diffraction exciting forces for a section assumptions include exclusively heave pitch forcing and zero forward speed a more comprehensive discussion of the derivation of this equation may be found in beck et al 1989 11 f 3 x t ζ a e i k w x e k w t x e i ω e t c 33 x ω 0 ω e a 33 x i b 33 x similar to the coefficients the heave excitation force for n th node is then computed by scaling the real part of 11 by the element length according to equation 12 note that this represents the external heave forces in the model shown in fig 1 12 f 3 n t re f 3 x t l s the external force vector is then assembled accordingly 13 f t f 3 1 t 0 f 3 2 t 0 f 3 n s t 0 t because the external forcing is applied at each node and the length of an element is considered small it is reasonable to assume that the external excitation moments about each node are zero as shown by 13 2 4 nonlinear formulation in the linear regime the coefficient matrices in equation 2 are assumed constant with time and independent of the solution η t this is of course true for the physical mass structural stiffness and structural damping matrices as these physical quantities are not affected by the motion or deformation of the vessel the elemental versions of these quantities are given below where again the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the node on the element s note the elemental structural stiffness matrix c s t r u c t s is that of a typical 4 dof beam element and the structural damping b s t r u c t s is taken proportional to the stiffness where tan δ is the visco elastic damping coefficient for steel tan δ is taken as 0 001 to 0 005 14 m s m 1 0 0

r u c t s when considering the hydrodynamic added mass damping and hydrostatic stiffness matrices the linear assumption is considered valid only for small amplitude first order responses given that it is contrary to the real world physics for example as the incident wave passes the hull and as the vessel heaves and pitches in the waves the hull girder will deflect and the submerged hull geometry will vary with time this means the coefficient matrices a b c are time varying quantities nonlinearity in the wave excitation forcing is also introduced as 11 depends on the unscaled coefficients in the present method the coefficients are interpreted as functions of the instantaneous nodal position η t this results in 17 the nonlinear form of equation 2 where the a b and c coefficient terms are no longer constant with time or position and the equation contains products of the solution and its derivatives with functions of the solution 17 m a η η t b s t r u c t b η η t c s t r u c t c η η t f t the nonlinear terms present obvious problems one cannot solve 17 unless the solution is already known to move forward it helps to consider a 33 b 33 and c 33 as functions of local draft t s t where t s t depends partly upon η t this distinction although more of an intermediary than a change of physical dependence allows the separation of a 33 b 33 and c 33 from η in an advantageous manner the coefficients are computed at the most basic level according to underwater geometry and wave characteristics the former of which is directly dependent upon draft making this a reasonable substitution the local draft can be computed according to 18 where t is the stillwater draft the second term represents the incident wave elevation and η 3 t is of course the instantaneous vertical position of the node where the coupling with pitch is already included fig 3 also illustrates this relationship 18 t s t t ζ a cos k w x ω e t η 3 t one will notice that as t s t is still dependent upon η 3 t we have seemingly only complicated the problem however if we invoke a small time step assumption it is possible to approximate t s t by replacing η 3 t with η 3 t δ t if δ t is sufficiently small the difference η 3 t η 3 t δ t will be sufficiently close to zero the coefficients can now be computed without trouble as η 3 t δ t is known for long wave periods it is not difficult to reach a suitable small value for δ t but it is an important consideration when assessing short wave periods and a worthy consideration otherwise computing the coefficients at each discrete time step by interpolating the submerged geometry of the hull using t s is common and this body exact method does have several advantages and is explored by many researchers but it is very computationally intensive especially if the radiation forces are recomputed directly in this method we use a different approach prior to solving equation 17 the coefficients are computed at two different stillwater drafts t t δ t where δ t has shown success when set equal to 0 1 ζ a using these two sets of coefficients it is possible to construct a proportional relationship for each coefficient as a function of draft as shown by equation 19 through 21 where the second term on the right hand side is the perturbation term note that in this formulation the partial derivative is assumed constant if the local draft is equal to the mean draft the second term vanishes and we are left with the coefficient at t note that the difference t s t t will be in some ways limited by the wave amplitude and the vertical position of the node in resonance these terms will be constructive and may lead to large perturbation terms 19 a 33 t s a 33 t a 33 t s t s t t s t t 20 b 33 t s b 33 t b 33 t s t s t t s t t 21 c 33 t s c 33 t c 33 t s t s t t s t t equation 19 through 21 may be visualized as a proportional relationship between the coefficients and sectional draft as shown by fig 4 to make this simplification valid the exact function of the hydrodynamic coefficient indicated arbitrarily by a dashed line must be close to linear within the draft range of interest this draft range is difficult to quantify without first estimating the vessel s motion response due to the wave because the heave response of the vessel may not be symmetric about t the coefficient also may not oscillate between t ζ a changes in hull geometry near the waterline should also be considered as any effects on the coefficients will not be captured unless t δ t includes the desired hull variation abrupt changes in hull geometry near the waterline will not be accurately represented by this approximation and would require a more direct method the proportional assumption mentioned above is an important consideration when selecting a suitable δ t for a particular wave and has a significant influence on the validity at certain wave amplitudes if for example the wave amplitude is very large it may be that the hydrodynamic coefficients are not reasonably proportional in the sectional draft range and therefore this approximation may not be valid one might compute multiple points within the expected draft range to check the validity of the assumption and this method may be extended beyond a simple proportional relationship although this has not been evaluated in the work presented here to complete the nonlinear formulation of the equation of motion 17 the nonlinear elemental hydrodynamic added mass matrix hydrodynamic damping matrix and hydrostatic stiffness matrix are given by equations 22 24

step is to determine the solution the system is solved using the newmark β direct integration scheme newmark 1959 with the careful selection of the coefficients γ 1 2 and β 1 4 the scheme offers unconditional numerical stability second order accuracy and does not introduce numerical damping the general method is given by equation 25 through 28 the constants a 0 through a 7 are also defined

nonlinear formulation and represent the total mass total damping and total stiffness and external excitation forcing 3 results experimental validation recent work by taravella and marlantes 2017 presented the midship heave pitch and bending moment response of a segmented korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso container ship model at the university of new orleans towing tank the experimental work was carried out before the computational work presented in this paper the model was constructed at the uno model shop to a 1 100 scale where the general particulars of the full scale and model scale hull are given by table 1 the segmented hull model was constructed using freeman plastics high density foam 5020 and the hull was divided at three locations along the length the divisions were placed at 1 89 ft aft of the forward perpendicular station 5 3 77 ft aft of the forward perpendicular midships station 10 and 5 66 ft aft of the forward perpendicular station 15 as shown in fig 5 hull girder stiffness was simulated with an aluminum square tube spine with a second moment of area equal to 0 218 in4 this translates to a full scale stiffness of 36 285 ft4 strain gages were installed in pairs on the top and bottom sides of the aluminum spine in the model the strain gage pairs were placed precisely at each of the segment gaps model motions were measured with a crossbow vg 400 inertial measuring unit imu the imu measures all three translational accelerations and angular rates and it also computes and outputs pitch and roll angles the study considered five different wave frequencies at wave amplitudes of 1 in and 1 5 in 8 33 ft and 12 5 ft full scale a body plan of the full scale hull geometry is shown by fig 6 the offsets were used to prepare a computer model for input into the computational method the theoretical weight distribution was also specified in the input file and is given by fig 7 at the design draft of 35 4 ft computational results were generated for ten different wave frequencies at a wave amplitude of 8 33 ft both linear and nonlinear results were generated for comparison in the nonlinear case δ t was taken as 0 1 ζ a or 0 833 ft for the 8 33 ft wave e was taken as 4 176e9 psf all simulations generated 300 s of data at a 0 1 s time step in the rigid body case the sectional moment of inertia i y y s was set to a very large value 10 000 000 000 ft4 to simulate rigid body motion i y y s and avoid effects of hull flexibility in the linear results this translates to a constant sectional inertia distribution along the length of the hull girder structural damping was also ignored in both the linear and nonlinear results tan δ 0 in the nonlinear case studies comparing the results with and without the full scale hull girder stiffness showed little difference in the results at lower wave frequencies therefore the results in this section present nonlinear effects due mainly to the nonlinear coefficients a 33 b 33 and c 33 as discussed in the theoretical formulation the midship heave and pitch raos for the linear and nonlinear maximum and minimum values were then plotted against the scaled model test measurements obtained by taravella and marlantes 2017 the mean values of the experimental data are plotted as points while the error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean for fig 8 through fig 12 although the focus of the computational method is the global structural response the heave and pitch response is the first step in achieving this result a comparison of the computational motion results to the model test data is important to validate the numerical solution before considering the internal reactions directly to this end the heave and pitch results are shown by figs 8 and 9 respectively the relative agreement between the model test data and the results obtained using the computational method is quite good as expected the asymptotic behavior of the heave and pitch response at low and high frequencies is observed the pitch response appears to be excited at ω e near 0 45 rad s 1 in general the nonlinear predicted heave and pitch response do not differ significantly from the linear formulation especially at low frequencies if anything the nonlinear pitch response may be slightly more pronounced near the natural frequency as well as the dip near 0 63 rad s 1 it does not appear that the nonlinear effects yield any appreciable difference at wave frequencies less than about 0 4 rad s 1 this makes physical sense as the lower frequency is paired with a longer wavelength thereby reducing the change in t s as the long wave period appears more or less like a still waterline this convergence is also observed in the heave response at high frequencies although minimal any deviation between linear and nonlinear heave and pitch response appears to be observed at or above 0 4 rad s 1 the nonlinear midship dynamic hogging and sagging bending moment amplitude functions are plotted against the model test data in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively again there appears to be a general agreement in terms of magnitude and shape between the computational and experimental results with both the maximum hogging and sagging bending moments occurring near the 0 55 rad s 1 wave frequency contrary to the heave and pitch response nonlinear coefficients impart significant variation in the predicted bending moment response when compared to the linear formulation it is evident that the sagging moment is markedly larger than the hogging moment at the peak frequency a difference of about 20 although the general agreement appears to be good the computational results do under predict the midship peak hogging moment in the current condition the sagging moment is also under predicted at wave frequencies below about 0 5 rad s 1 because the variation in the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic coefficients is dependent upon the change in local draft at low frequencies the change can be quite small yielding little change in the coefficients and ultimately a weakly nonlinear response it is believed that this behavior is one probable cause of the under prediction of bending moments at low wave frequencies the longitudinal dynamic bending moment distribution for the linear and nonlinear hogging and sagging results at wave frequencies of 0 503 rad s 1 and 0 635 rad s 1 are given by figs 12 and 13 respectively these frequencies correspond to the model test data near the peak bending moment response here it is most evident that the linear method may under predict the peak sagging bending moment for the given hull geometry the difference between the hogging and sagging bending moments is most notable in the after sections of the hull girder near node 16 at this node the difference between the hogging and sagging bending moment prediction is nearly 60 for the peak wave frequency of 0 503 rad s 1 the quadratic approximation of the change in coefficients influences considerable variation in the relatively flat after sections of the hull where the slope of the approximation is quite steep the results indicate a sensitivity to the local geometry as indicated by the distribution at 0 635 rad s 1 the sensitivity may be prone to overprediction it is expected that the variation is primarily influenced by the draft increment therefore determining a suitable draft increment for a particular geometry and or wave is consequently a topic of interest the experimental results show an asymmetry between the hogging and sagging bending moments with the deviation increasing as we move farther aft this behavior is expected and has been shown as typical it is therefore encouraging that the proposed method also exhibits this same behavior with a marked difference between the predicted hogging and sagging bending moments in the after section of the hull however while the method seems to well predict the sagging moments at nodes 6 11 and 16 at 0 503 rad s 1 the method does under predict the hogging moment conversely at 0 635 rad s 1 the hogging moment is better predicted and the sagging moment is overpredicted in the after part of the hull it is expected that these deviations are due to the relatively preliminary nature in which the δ t value was selected it is proposed that the δ t must be tuned to achieve better correlation between the experimental and theoretical results despite this in general terms the results follow the implied trend fig 14 and fig 15 show 50 s of steady state dynamic midship bending moment time series results for nodes 6 11 and 16 at wave frequencies of 0 503 rad s 1 and 0 635 rad s 1 respectively the black line is the rigid body linear case and the red is the nonlinear response matching the distributions in figs 12 and 13 nonlinear effects are small at node 6 where the slope of the approximate change in coefficients is small at node 11 the midship node the nonlinear effects become more apparent here it is observed that the hogging peaks become sharper and the sagging troughs become deeper and slightly more pronounced these general qualitative observations of shape are expected to properly consider the nonlinear variation at node 16 it is important to recall that the instantaneous vertical displacement of the node is included in the calculation of the local draft see eq 28 this means that the variation in coefficients is influenced more by the vertical motion response near peak heave response wave frequencies however near 0 503 rad s 1 and 0 635 rad s 1 the heave response is rather small therefore the primary influence on the variation in local drafts for the time series results shown is the change in wave elevation the reduction in the peak hogging response is expected to be the result of the phase relationship between the added mass damping and total forcing the peak added mass occurs at the same point in time as the step in the hogging moment further investigation of the phase relationships between the various components in equation 1 would be a worthy endeavor 4 conclusion the results of the computational method are validated by the model test data for the kriso containership hull geometry the nonlinear effects do not appear to have significant influence on vessel motions in heave and pitch although some small variations are observed at higher wave frequencies 0 4 rad s 1 and above dynamic midship bending moments were found to be highly sensitive to nonlinear effects yielding notable differences between the hogging and sagging bending moment peaks in the aft third of the vessel this was most apparent yielding a difference of nearly 60 at peak frequencies peak nonlinear sagging moments at midship exceeded linear predictions by about 12 moreover the longitudinal dynamic bending moment distribution near peak response is in fair agreement with the model test data with the nonlinear formulation capturing much of the significant variation in hogging and sagging bending moment response in the aft sections of the hull girder a qualitative assessment of the time series results also indicates expected trends of primary interest is the method s apparent tendency to under predict the hogging bending moments as evidenced in fig 10 and especially in fig 12 and overpredict the sagging moments as shown in fig 13 it is believed that this is due to the relatively simplistic assignment of δ t to 10 of the wave amplitude improved predictions may be had by setting different proportionality relationships for local drafts above vs below the calm waterline there also exists a strong dependence on geometry and sections with large changes in transverse offsets may yield highly sensitive coefficient variations such as in the after part of the kriso hull for this reason predictions may be further improved by varying δ t on a section by section basis perhaps based on sectional properties such as sectional area waterline tangent or sectional coefficients furthermore these variables may also have a significant effect on the stability and accuracy of the numerical solution this is especially true when analyzing a flexible hull or evaluating a wave frequency near resonance quantifying these numerical effects would be beneficial to improving the usability of the method and increasing confidence in the results to conclude the results presented in this paper show that the computational method may offer a viable means of evaluating dynamic global structural response of a ship due to waves with relatively little computational effort however further testing and improvements are required before the computational method might be suitable for use in design analysis a more robust set of model test data would allow a more comprehensive validation of the computational results the capability to specify non zero vessel speed an extension to more degrees of freedom or the ability to analyze responses in irregular waves are possible additions 
22627,the assessment of earthquake induced hydrodynamic added mass is critical in the seismic design of structures supported by immersed columns this paper developed an efficient potential based numerical model to determine the hydrodynamic added mass for immersed column with arbitrary cross section general formulations of the hydrodynamic added mass for a column with general cross section under horizontal earthquake were derived the accuracy of the developed model for immersed columns was validated analytically and experimentally the developed model was then applied to evaluate the hydrodynamic added mass of an immersed column with dumbbell cross section the hydrodynamic added mass of the example dumbbell column along various earthquake directions was determined and the directional dependent added mass was expressed as an analytical function of the added mass along the major and minor axes of the column and the earthquake direction the frequency and time domain seismic responses of the example dumbbell column were finally computed using both fluid structure interaction fsi model and the developed hydrodynamic added mass model the good agreement between seismic responses from the fsi and developed added mass model confirmed the high accuracy and efficiency of the developed model for the hydrodynamic added mass of immersed columns with arbitrary cross section under earthquakes keywords immersed column added mass arbitrary cross section potential based fluid element hydrodynamic pressure seismic analysis 1 introduction the dynamics of structures supported by columns submerged in water such as sea crossing bridge foundations qin and gao 2017 offshore platforms mirzadeh et al 2016 offshore wind turbines wei et al 2017 etc require consideration of fluid structure interaction fsi which does not arise for structures on land it is a common knowledge that the vibration of immersed column subjected to earthquakes induces the motion of nearby water producing an extra hydrodynamic force on the structure zhang et al 2019 pang et al 2015 this extra force is usually modeled as the combination of a hypothetical mass of water and the acceleration of the structure the hypothetical mass typically termed as added mass represents the effective mass of water that participates in the structural vibration through fsi it was firstly introduced by westergaard 1933 in the analyses of hydrodynamic pressure on the dam subjected to harmonic ground motion based on the concept of added mass uściłowska and kołodziej 1998 öz 2003 and wu and hsu 2007 derived the analytical solutions to determine the free vibration and natural frequencies of immersed columns for the added mass assessment of an immersed column the section of the column in the early literatures is usually assumed to be circular due to its accessibility to the equations of fsi interface boundary in the closed form solutions and many research efforts are devoted to the added mass model of columns with circular cross section liaw and chopra 1974 proposed a closed form solution of the added mass for circular columns surrounded by water han and xu 1996 presented a theoretical model of an added mass representation for a flexible immersed column vibrating in water different simplified equations for the added mass of immersed circular column were developed by li and yang 2013 and jiang et al 2017 respectively added mass models for both inner water and outer water of an immersed column with circular hollow cross section have also been developed by yang and li 2013 the continuing development of offshore engineering contributes to the broad application of immersed columns with complex geometry other than circular cross sections wang et al 2018a nagaya and hai 1985 developed a method for solving seismic response problems of a column of variable tapered cross section however the added mass of immersed column with non circular section was usually simplified as the added mass for column with equivalent circular cross section times a shape correction factor det norske veritas 2010 european committee for standardization 2005 which are limited to several typical cross sections such as ellipse or rectangle and insufficient for general engineering practices more recently yu et al 2019 dealt with the problem of radiation from a floating cylinder with an arbitrary cross section and proposed a semi analytical model based on linear potential flow theory zheng et al 2019 further developed and expanded the model from one single to multiple floating cylinders with arbitrary cross sections the numerical model allows the evaluation of the earthquake induced hydrodynamics through solution of the fsi equations which has been wildly adopted to address questions in complex fluid structure systems bouaanani and lu 2009 assessed the performance of potential based fluid elements pbfes regarding the dam reservoir system and investigated the effect of the reservoir bottom absorption on seismic responses of dam based on this numerical method wei et al 2013 conducted modal analyses of pile foundations submerged in water using pbfes and verified the numerical model with experimental results wang et al 2018b adopted lagrange formulation of fluid in the reservoir dam foundation numerical model to investigate the damage characteristic of dam boundary element method bem liu 2019 xu et al 2018 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale algorithm ozdemir et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 etc have also been applied to provide insight into the fsi issues in engineering fields although the seismic response of immersed column can now be computed using the fsi numerical approaches most of these techniques have yet been fully implemented in the common engineering practice especially at the preliminary stage of seismic design as they require specialized software or advanced programming and high level expertise and may result in extensive modeling and computational efforts since the added mass represents the earthquake induced hydrodynamic force in a simplified and efficient way a general hydrodynamic added mass model of columns with arbitrary cross section aided by fsi numerical method may facilitate the work of researchers and designers regarding the immersed columns for the purpose of developing an efficient numerical model to assess the hydrodynamic added mass this paper is organized as follows firstly a general formulation of hydrodynamic added mass and its corresponding numerical framework are developed for an immersed column with arbitrary cross section secondly the effectiveness of the developed model in the calculation of the added mass for uniform immersed columns with circular and elliptical sections and circular tapered columns is validated with the analytical results from previous literatures thirdly the added mass of an immersed cylinder is calculated through the developed model and is verified by comparison with experimental modal test results fourthly an immersed column with dumbbell cross section is selected as an example study the developed model is used to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass of the column and finally the frequency and time domain seismic responses of such column are compared between the results from the fsi model and the column model with added mass and the effect of ground motion direction on the hydrodynamic added mass are investigated 2 model for determination of hydrodynamic added mass 2 1 formulations of hydrodynamic added mass we consider an immersed column with arbitrary cross section subjected to horizontal ground acceleration u g t as illustrated in fig 1 assuming water to be inviscid and irrotational the hydrodynamic pressure p within the water

time although the effect of surface gravity waves will make the hydrodynamic pressure vary with the excitation frequency but its influence on the response of engineering structures in practice is not significant huang and li 2011 the surface gravity waves are hence not included in the following derivation the boundary conditions for the governing equation according to the aforementioned

chopra and his colleagues liaw and chopra 1974 goyal and chopra 1989a 1989b the amplitude of the hydrodynamic added mass per unit height m a is a function of z the distance above the column base moreover the hydrodynamic added mass m a depends on the vibration direction for columns with non circular cross section goyal and chopra 1989b therefore a general form of hydrodynamic added mass per unit height at z j of a column vibrating along the direction θ g is denoted as m a z j θ g which can calculated by 5 m a z j θ g f p z j θ g u g where f p z j θ g is the resultant hydrodynamic force along direction θ g per unit height at z j due to vibration of column under ground motion u g when the immersed column is subjected to a unit horizontal ground motion acceleration i e u g t 1 m s2 along direction θ g the added mass m a z j θ g can also be further expressed as follows 6 m a z j θ g f p z j θ g 1 s r θ z j p r θ z j n s n g d s where p r θ z j is the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the column surface induced by its rigid motion 2 2 potential based numerical analysis framework for hydrodynamic added mass the closed form solution of the hydrodynamic pressure p r θ z j only exists for typical cross sections such as circle and ellipse in order to compute the hydrodynamic pressure on the arbitrary cross section three dimensional 3d potential based fluid elements pbfes based on φ u formulation olson and bathe 1985 is implemented in the framework in this formulation φ and u denote the velocity potential of fluid domain and the displacement of solid domain respectively yielding simple fsi modeling and avoiding heavy computational burden the velocity potential of pbfes in the numerical model satisfies the wave equation as follows 7 2 φ 1 c 2 2 φ t 2 fluid structure interaction is accounted for through fsi boundary condition at the water column interfaces defined as 8 φ n u t n where n is the unit normal vector perpendicular to the water column interface towards the water domain the fluid velocity potential φ at the free surface boundary and the side and bottom walls of the fluid domain hence obeys the following equation 9 φ 0 for the given immersed column with arbitrary cross section the column and the surrounding water are discretized into solid elements and pbfes respectively as shown in fig 2 the velocity of pressure waves in water is set to be 1440 m s resulting in a bulk modulus of 2 1 gpa to include the compressibility of water the radius of the water domain should be larger than eight times the maximum radial dimension of the column cross section for the purpose of eliminating the wave reflection due to the side wall boundaries the properties of the column are defined according to its material information the vertical degrees of freedom for nodes at bottom of the immersed column are fully constrained while the horizontal degrees are set to be free once the potential based numerical model is developed the hydrodynamic pressure p r θ z j on the column with arbitrary cross section can be calculated using the finite element model in order to obtain the hydrodynamic pressure at different distance z above the column base sweeping algorithm is used to generate the hexahedral meshes for the immersed column as illustrated in fig 1 the division numbers of the column in the cylindrical coordinate along s r θ z and z direction are defined as n and m respectively the formulation of the hydrodynamic added mass can be given as 10 m a z j θ g i 1 n p r i θ i z j n s i n g l j n j 1 m 1 in which p r i θ i z j is the hydrodynamic pressure at point r i θ i z j i 1 2 n n s i is the unit vector at point r i θ i z j normal to the surface function s r θ z j pointing outwards s r θ z j is the surface function of the column at z z j l j is the circumference of s r θ z j considering that cartesian coordinate is more general in the finite element modeling for columns with complex cross section the general formulation of hydrodynamic added mass eq 10 can be replaced by eq 11 in cartesian coordinate 11 m a z j θ g i 1 n p x i y i z j n s i cos θ g sin θ g l j n j 1 m 1 where p x i y i z j is the hydrodynamic pressure at point x i y i z j i 1 2 n the added mass coefficient c a z defined as the added mass m a z divided by the column cross section area and water density can be calculated easily as well the following analysis process shown in fig 2 can be performed to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass of the immersed column with arbitrary cross section i apply a unit acceleration to the entire column along the ground motion direction the time history of the acceleration with the duration of 1 2 s is given in fig 2 ii carry out transient analysis to obtain the hydrodynamic pressure p r i θ i z j or p x i y i z j at each node on the water column interface oscillation exists in the initial zone of the time history of hydrodynamic pressure due to the compressibility of water but it disappears quickly the stable value of hydrodynamic pressure at the last time step is recommended iii compute the hydrodynamic added mass at each z j distance above the column base through the integration of hydrodynamic pressure on the water column interface following eq 10 or 11 iv plot the curve of hydrodynamic added mass as a function of distance above the base of immersed column 3 analytical validation of the developed added mass model immersed columns with circular and elliptical cross section and the circular tapered column are widely used in offshore structures such as foundations of sea crossing bridges and offshore wind turbines in order to validate the developed model the hydrodynamic added mass of three immersed column examples including two uniform columns circular and elliptical cross section and one tapered column with circular cross section is calculated by the developed model and analytical models from previous literatures accuracy of the hydrodynamic added mass is assessed through the comparison with the results from previous literatures 3 1 immersed column with circular cross section an immersed column with circular cross section as illustrated in fig 3 is taken as the first example for validation the diameter of the column is d and the water depth is h w the hydrodynamic added mass coefficients c a z of the columns with diameter d varying from 4 to 7 m and with a water depth of 30 m are calculated using the developed model and the formulas proposed in previous literatures the closed form analytical equation of hydrodynamic added mass for circular cylinder proposed by liaw and chopra 1974 based on radiation wave theory is given in eq 12 and selected as the reference simplified formulations of the added mass for such column developed by li and yang 2013 and jiang et al 2017 shown in eq 13 and eq 14 respectively are also used for comparison equation from liaw and chopra 1974 12 m a z 4 ρ w π d 1 n q i q 2 λ q h w e

2 d 2 h w d h w z h w in which i q 0 h w cos α q z dz λ q α q 2 q 1 π 2 h w e q x k 1 x k 0 x k 2 x k n x is the modified bessel function of order n of the second kind and q 1 2 n q where n q is the number of items suggested to be larger than 50 for a smooth solution the developed model is firstly used to assess the hydrodynamic added mass for the example columns potential based numerical model for the immersed column with circular cross section is built using adina adina 2010 according to the analysis framework depicted in section 2 hydrodynamic pressure on the column is calculated according to the flowchart given in fig 2 because the hydrodynamic added mass m a z of the circular column is independent of direction θ g it can be determined by eq 15 the analytical curves of the added mass m a z for the example column are assessed directly using eqs 12 14 respectively the added mass coefficient c a z for the column can then be calculated by eq 16 according to the curve of m a z 15 m a z i 1 n p x i y i z x i x i 2 y i 2 y i x i 2 y i 2 cos θ g sin θ g π d n 16 c a z 4 m a z ρ w π d 2 fig 4 shows the comparison of hydrodynamic added mass coefficients between the developed model and the analytical equations it is clear that the results predicted from the developed model agree well with the closed form results from eq 12 for all the circular columns the tolerance between the developed model and results from liaw and chopra 1974 is significantly better than the simplified equations eqs 13 and 14 the differences between the li and yang s results and jiang s results within the mediate water depth are mainly caused by the difference of the factors in the exponential function which affects the distribution of added mass significantly furthermore the coefficients c a z determined from developed model and results from liaw and chopra 1974 are integrated along water depth 0 h w c a z dz h w and the results are compared in table 1 the relative error of the developed model is less than 0 5 compared with the solutions from liaw and chopra 1974 all these results state that the developed model has high accuracy in the prediction of hydrodynamic added mass for immersed column with circular cross section 3 2 immersed column with elliptical cross section a column with elliptical cross section submerged in a water depth of h w as shown in fig 5 is taken as the second example for validation the length of major and minor axes of the elliptical cross section is d and b respectively immersed columns with b h w varying from 0 2 to 1 0 are selected as cases for direction of motion θ g 0 while columns with d h w varying from 0 2 to 1 0 are selected for direction of motion θ g 90 for each column the aspect ratio d b is set to 2 the analytical equation for elliptical cylinder developed by wang et al 2018c is used to calculate its hydrodynamic added mass as reference fsi model of the column and surrounding water is firstly built in adina adina 2010 to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure in the application of the developed model to the column with elliptical cross section the hydrodynamic added mass m a z θ g can be determined from the pressure as follows 17 m a z θ g i 1 n p x i y i z x i d 2 x i 2 d 4 y i 2 b 4 y i b 2 x i 2 d 4 y i 2 b 4 cos θ g sin θ g l n in which l 0 2 π d 2 sin 2 θ b 2 cos 2 θ 2 d θ is the circumference of the elliptical cross section for a given column with elliptical cross section its equivalent circular area of cross section is π b 2 4 for motion along major axis θ g 0 and is π d 2 4 for motion along minor axis θ g 90 the added mass coefficient c a z θ g can be defined by the following equation 18 c a z θ g 4 m a z θ g ρ w π b 2 θ g 0 along major axis 4 m a z θ g ρ w π d 2 θ g 90 along minor axis the hydrodynamic added mass coefficients c a z θ g for all of these columns are calculated using eqs 17 and 18 and compared with results from wang et al 2018c in fig 6 it can be seen that the scatters of c a z θ g as a function of distance to base determined by the developed model are in good agreement with the reference curves for all cases regardless of column dimension and ground motion direction the maximum value of added mass appears at the column bottom and decreases gradually to zero at the water free surface this tendency is similar to that of columns with circular cross section because the elliptical cross section is non circular the coefficients of columns with elliptical cross section depend on the direction θ g the integrated hydrodynamic added mass coefficients are then calculated according to 0 h w c a z θ g dz h w for comparison in number the results calculated from developed model and wang et al 2018c are listed and compared in table 2 it is clear that the relative error between the developed model and results from wang et al 2018c is less than 1 which further proves that the developed model can evaluate the hydrodynamic added mass of immersed columns with elliptical cross section accurately 3 3 tapered column with circular cross section the third example for validation is a tapered column with circular cross section as shown in fig 7 the top and bottom diameter of the column are d 1 and d 2 respectively with a taper angle of α and submerged depth of h w two categories of circular tapered columns including one with d 1 h w 0 4 and the other with d 1 h w 1 0 are adopted here and for each category three different taper angles varying from 60 to 80 are considered to validate the accuracy of the developed model the distribution of hydrodynamic pressure over water depth in the x z plane when the column moves along direction θ g 0 investigated by wang et al 2018d is selected as the reference for comparison the hydrodynamic pressure on these circular tapered columns divided by ρ w d 1 2 in the x z plane is determined through the solution of fsi models in adina adina 2010 and results are compared with results from wang et al 2018d in fig 8 results from the developed model agree well with the results from wang et al 2018d regardless of taper angle α or ratio d 1 h w it is interesting to notice that unlike the two types of column discussed above the peak value of the hydrodynamic pressure on the circular tapered column does not appear at the bottom of column the influence of the taper angle on the hydrodynamic pressure is more significant for columns with relatively small value of d 1 h w the hydrodynamic pressure is then integrated over water depth following 2 0 h w p dz ρ w d 1 h w the results from wang et al 2018d and the developed model are then presented and compared in table 3 good consistency of the integrated hydrodynamic pressure can still be found the maximum relative error is only 0 11 the developed model can also be applied to the evaluation of the hydrodynamic pressure for tapered columns with circular cross section 4 experimental validation of the developed added mass model in this section experimental modal tests of an immersed cylinder are conducted in a water tank to further verify the developed added mass model fig 9 illustrates the configuration of the cylinder and testing devices the f t transducer is bolted with the lifting rod fixed on a testing trestle the top surface of the testing cylinder is fastened with the f t transducer which measures the modal responses of the cylinder the diameter and length of the cylinder are 0 15 m and 1 2 m respectively the length of the gap between the bottom of water and the cylinder is 0 1 m the cylinder is made of acrylic material of which the elastic modulus and mass density of the cylinder are 0 65 gpa and 1470 kg m3 respectively three different water depths h i are considered 0 m 0 4 m and 0 75 m the corresponding fundamental period t i i 1 2 3 of the cylinder under each water depth is assessed through free vibration tests and the wet to dry period ratio t i t 1 i 2 3 can be then determined for the purpose of comparison finite element models of the cylinder are established the hydrodynamic added mass for each water depth is determined using the developed model and applied to corresponding numerical models the natural periods of the numerical models are obtained through modal analysis and the wet to dry period ratios can also be calculated the results of period ratios under different water depths are compared in fig 10 it can be seen that the numerical period ratios coincide with the experimental ones which demonstrates the high accuracy of the developed model for added mass evaluation 5 seismic analyses of immersed column with dumbbell cross section the accuracy of the developed model has been validated for some typical immersed columns in section 3 the efficiency and accuracy of the developed added mass model in the seismic analyses of immersed column with complex cross section still require further examination an immersed column with dumbbell cross section used as deepwater bridge piers is selected as example structure in seismic responses analyses the column is 45 m high with 30 m submerged in water the dimensions of the dumbbell are illustrated in fig 11 the x axis and y axis are defined as the major and minor axes of the column cross section respectively the material of the column is concrete and the elastic modulus poisson s ratio and mass density are set to 25 gpa 0 2 and 2500 kg m3 respectively the column is fully fixed on the bottom with a tip mass of 3000 t to simulate the weight of superstructure in the following discussion a refined and a simplified numerical model are built for comparison the refined model is the potential based fsi model of the example column with dumbbell cross section as illustrated in fig 11 in the fsi model the fsi boundary condition eq 8 is applied to the interface between solid elements and pbfes the free surface eq 9 and rigid wall boundary condition eq 9 are applied to free surface side and bottom walls of water respectively the simplified model is a solid element made column model with added mass applied as the nodal mass to nodes on the surface of immersed part of the column although it is efficient to adopt added mass in a beam element model the differences in the basic hypothesis between the beam and solid element could lead to differences in the deformation and force responses for the purpose of eliminating additional error arising from using different element solid elements are employed for both the refined and simplified model the added mass of the example column with dumbbell cross section along direction of motion θ g is calculated using the developed model the mesh generation of the column is same as the column in fsi model the fsi model contains 67 000 solid elements for column and 440 000 pbfes for water while the column model with added mass have 67 000 solid elements only these two types of models are adopted to perform frequency domain and time domain analyses to obtain seismic responses of the example column seismic analyses results of the fsi model are taken as the fsi results while the results of the column model with added mass are taken as the added mass results 5 rayleigh damping ratio is adopted in the time domain analyses the deformation and force responses can be estimated by the solution of the following structural dynamic equation bathe 2014 chopra 2000 19 m u c u k u r where m c k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices r is the vector of externally applied loads and u u u are the vectors of nodal point displacement velocity and acceleration respectively the frequency domain responses of the motion and acceleration can be computed through solving eq 19 in frequency domain based on modal orthogonality as 20 u ω φ k y k ω u ω ω 2 φ k y k ω where y k ω is the frequency dependent generalized coordinates in the kth mode of vibration φ k is the shape of the kth mode of the column then the element stress vectors in frequency domain τ ω are determined as 21 τ ω c e b e u ω where c e and b e are the element elasticity matrix and the element strain displacement matrix respectively the base shear v ω and base moment m ω in frequency domain are computed through the integration of the element stress at the bottom surface of the column as 22 v ω τ x y ω d a m ω τ z z ω x d a where τ x y ω and τ z z ω are the element shear stress and normal stress in frequency domain at the bottom surface of the column respectively x is the distance between the element and the neutral axis the time domain responses of the motion and acceleration u t and u t can be calculated by solving eq 19 through implicit time integration method after that the element stress vectors in time domain τ t are determined as 23 τ t c e b e u t similar with the calculation of frequency domain responses the base shear v t and base moment m t in time domain are computed as 24 v t τ x y t d a m t τ z z t x d a where τ x y t and τ z z t are the element shear stress and normal stress in time domain at the bottom surface of the column respectively 5 1 hydrodynamic added mass of the example column similar with the example column with elliptical cross section the added mass of the column with dumbbell cross section also differs with the direction of ground motion θ g in order to investigate the effect of direction of motion θ g the hydrodynamic added mass of the studied column along seven different directions ranging from 0 to 90 is calculated using the refined numerical model and presented in fig 12 it can be seen that the added mass of such column increases with the direction θ g because of the increasing projection length of the column cross section along the ground motion furthermore the hydrodynamic added mass per unit height at z h 0 z h 1 3 and z h 2 3 against the seven different directions are scattered in fig 13 and the solid curves are also plotted according to eq 25 as shown in fig 13 the solid curves agree well with the scattered points which indicates that when the added mass of the column with dumbbell cross section along the major and minor axes is determined the added mass along a specific ground motion direction θ g can be calculated by eq 25 25 m a z θ g m a x x z cos 2 θ g m a y y z sin 2 θ g where m a x x z and m a y y z are the hydrodynamic added mass at z distance above the column base along the major and minor axes of the column cross section respectively 5 2 seismic responses of the example column harmonic ground motion acceleration u g t e i ω t with frequency ω ranging from 0 to 10 hz is firstly applied to these numerical models along the column major and minor axes to obtained frequency domain responses fig 14 and fig 15 compare the frequency responses including the horizontal acceleration and displacement at column top base shear and base moment under ground motion along major and minor axes respectively the added mass results coincide well with the fsi results near the first modal frequency regardless of excitation direction because the hydrodynamic added mass used in this study is a frequency independent mass which only accounts for hydrodynamic force induced by structural rigid motion and neglects the effect of vibration mode goyal and chopra 1989a some differences between these curves can be observed near the second mode frequency as shown in fig 15 this phenomenon has also been mentioned by goyal and chopra 1989a with regard to frequency responses of immersed intake towers subjected to harmonic ground motion seismic time history analyses are carried out to address its influence on time domain structural responses the n s component of the 1940 imperial valley earthquake record at el centro peer 2013 with peak ground acceleration pga scaled to 0 1 g shown in fig 16 is selected as the earthquake input for time domain seismic analyses three different earthquake directions θ g are considered case 1 0 case 2 45 case 3 90 the seismic responses of the horizontal acceleration and displacement at column top base shear and base moment under various earthquake input direction are obtained through time history analyses of both fsi and column models with added mass and are shown in figs 17 19 the agreement between seismic responses from the fsi model and the column model with added mass is satisfactory and confirms that the hydrodynamic added mass computed by the developed model is valid in the seismic analyses of immersed columns in time domain meanwhile the computational time for the fsi model and the column model with added mass on the same computer with intel r xeon e5 2630 cpu at 2 4 ghz and 16 gb ram is 1 3 h and 0 6 h respectively the assessment time of the hydrodynamic added mass using the developed model is taken into account in the computational time associated with column model with added mass considering that the added mass can be employed repeatedly in seismic analyses towards structures supported by the same column the column model with added mass is obviously more efficient compared with the fsi model by avoiding solving complex fsi equations and is more useful for seismic fragility analyses 6 conclusions a potential based numerical model of the hydrodynamic added mass for immersed column with arbitrary cross section was developed the general formulation of the hydrodynamic added mass was derived with respect to the hydrodynamic force induced by the horizontal rigid motion of the column hydrodynamic added mass of columns with circular elliptical cross section and circular tapered columns was estimated through the developed model good agreements with results from previous literatures for all three examples revealed the accuracy of the developed model for these immersed columns in order to validate the model experimentally the modal response of an immersed cylinder as a function of water depth was obtained by both the developed added mass model and experimental modal tests good agreement was found between the developed model and experimental results the developed model was then further applied to evaluate the hydrodynamic added mass of an immersed column with dumbbell cross section the effect of direction of ground motion on the added mass of the example column was investigated although the hydrodynamic added mass of the immersed column with dumbbell cross section varies with the ground motion direction the added mass along a specific direction can be calculated based on an analytical function of the added masses along the column major and minor axes and the ground motion direction the obtained added mass was then adopted to construct the column model with added mass while the potential based fsi model was also established as reference the time and frequency domain seismic responses of the example column were obtained using both models the column model with added mass exhibits good accuracy in the calculation of seismic responses and shows great advantage in computational efficiency compared with complex fsi model these findings demonstrate that the earthquake induced hydrodynamic added mass for immersed column with arbitrary cross section can be efficiently predicted by the developed model and the developed model allows the implement of added mass in the seismic design of structures supported by immersed columns with complex cross section and waiving the substantial efforts for modeling and solving sophisticated fsi equations the reduction in computational time would become more significant especially when numerous nonlinear time history analyses for a probabilistic model are required it will provide an efficient approach for a comprehensive understanding towards the seismic performance and reliability of the structures supported by immersed columns in spite of that the developed added mass model have been verified for several commonly used types of columns additional efforts should be devoted to the throughout validation of the added mass model towards columns with more kinds of cross section the effects of higher order vibration modes and the surface gravity waves on the hydrodynamic added mass have not been included because the added mass developed in the framework is independent with frequency all these limitations deserve further investigation moreover bem can be implemented instead of pbfes to evaluate the hydrodynamic pressure in the developed model for the purpose of easier meshing process and faster computation with good accuracy acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the financial

22627,the assessment of earthquake induced hydrodynamic added mass is critical in the seismic design of structures supported by immersed columns this paper developed an efficient potential based numerical model to determine the hydrodynamic added mass for immersed column with arbitrary cross section general formulations of the hydrodynamic added mass for a column with general cross section under horizontal earthquake were derived the accuracy of the developed model for immersed columns was validated analytically and experimentally the developed model was then applied to evaluate the hydrodynamic added mass of an immersed column with dumbbell cross section the hydrodynamic added mass of the example dumbbell column along various earthquake directions was determined and the directional dependent added mass was expressed as an analytical function of the added mass along the major and minor axes of the column and the earthquake direction the frequency and time domain seismic responses of the example dumbbell column were finally computed using both fluid structure interaction fsi model and the developed hydrodynamic added mass model the good agreement between seismic responses from the fsi and developed added mass model confirmed the high accuracy and efficiency of the developed model for the hydrodynamic added mass of immersed columns with arbitrary cross section under earthquakes keywords immersed column added mass arbitrary cross section potential based fluid element hydrodynamic pressure seismic analysis 1 introduction the dynamics of structures supported by columns submerged in water such as sea crossing bridge foundations qin and gao 2017 offshore platforms mirzadeh et al 2016 offshore wind turbines wei et al 2017 etc require consideration of fluid structure interaction fsi which does not arise for structures on land it is a common knowledge that the vibration of immersed column subjected to earthquakes induces the motion of nearby water producing an extra hydrodynamic force on the structure zhang et al 2019 pang et al 2015 this extra force is usually modeled as the combination of a hypothetical mass of water and the acceleration of the structure the hypothetical mass typically termed as added mass represents the effective mass of water that participates in the structural vibration through fsi it was firstly introduced by westergaard 1933 in the analyses of hydrodynamic pressure on the dam subjected to harmonic ground motion based on the concept of added mass uściłowska and kołodziej 1998 öz 2003 and wu and hsu 2007 derived the analytical solutions to determine the free vibration and natural frequencies of immersed columns for the added mass assessment of an immersed column the section of the column in the early literatures is usually assumed to be circular due to its accessibility to the equations of fsi interface boundary in the closed form solutions and many research efforts are devoted to the added mass model of columns with circular cross section liaw and chopra 1974 proposed a closed form solution of the added mass for circular columns surrounded by water han and xu 1996 presented a theoretical model of an added mass representation for a flexible immersed column vibrating in water different simplified equations for the added mass of immersed circular column were developed by li and yang 2013 and jiang et al 2017 respectively added mass models for both inner water and outer water of an immersed column with circular hollow cross section have also been developed by yang and li 2013 the continuing development of offshore engineering contributes to the broad application of immersed columns with complex geometry other than circular cross sections wang et al 2018a nagaya and hai 1985 developed a method for solving seismic response problems of a column of variable tapered cross section however the added mass of immersed column with non circular section was usually simplified as the added mass for column with equivalent circular cross section times a shape correction factor det norske veritas 2010 european committee for standardization 2005 which are limited to several typical cross sections such as ellipse or rectangle and insufficient for general engineering practices more recently yu et al 2019 dealt with the problem of radiation from a floating cylinder with an arbitrary cross section and proposed a semi analytical model based on linear potential flow theory zheng et al 2019 further developed and expanded the model from one single to multiple floating cylinders with arbitrary cross sections the numerical model allows the evaluation of the earthquake induced hydrodynamics through solution of the fsi equations which has been wildly adopted to address questions in complex fluid structure systems bouaanani and lu 2009 assessed the performance of potential based fluid elements pbfes regarding the dam reservoir system and investigated the effect of the reservoir bottom absorption on seismic responses of dam based on this numerical method wei et al 2013 conducted modal analyses of pile foundations submerged in water using pbfes and verified the numerical model with experimental results wang et al 2018b adopted lagrange formulation of fluid in the reservoir dam foundation numerical model to investigate the damage characteristic of dam boundary element method bem liu 2019 xu et al 2018 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale algorithm ozdemir et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 etc have also been applied to provide insight into the fsi issues in engineering fields although the seismic response of immersed column can now be computed using the fsi numerical approaches most of these techniques have yet been fully implemented in the common engineering practice especially at the preliminary stage of seismic design as they require specialized software or advanced programming and high level expertise and may result in extensive modeling and computational efforts since the added mass represents the earthquake induced hydrodynamic force in a simplified and efficient way a general hydrodynamic added mass model of columns with arbitrary cross section aided by fsi numerical method may facilitate the work of researchers and designers regarding the immersed columns for the purpose of developing an efficient numerical model to assess the hydrodynamic added mass this paper is organized as follows firstly a general formulation of hydrodynamic added mass and its corresponding numerical framework are developed for an immersed column with arbitrary cross section secondly the effectiveness of the developed model in the calculation of the added mass for uniform immersed columns with circular and elliptical sections and circular tapered columns is validated with the analytical results from previous literatures thirdly the added mass of an immersed cylinder is calculated through the developed model and is verified by comparison with experimental modal test results fourthly an immersed column with dumbbell cross section is selected as an example study the developed model is used to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass of the column and finally the frequency and time domain seismic responses of such column are compared between the results from the fsi model and the column model with added mass and the effect of ground motion direction on the hydrodynamic added mass are investigated 2 model for determination of hydrodynamic added mass 2 1 formulations of hydrodynamic added mass we consider an immersed column with arbitrary cross section subjected to horizontal ground acceleration u g t as illustrated in fig 1 assuming water to be inviscid and irrotational the hydrodynamic pressure p within the water domain is governed by the wave equation in cylindrical coordinates r θ z as follows 1 2 p r 2 1 r p r 1 r 2 2 p θ 2 2 p z 2 1 c 2 2 p t 2 where c is velocity of the compression waves in water and t is time although the effect of surface gravity waves will make the hydrodynamic pressure vary with the excitation frequency but its influence on the response of engineering structures in practice is not significant huang and li 2011 the surface gravity waves are hence not included in the following derivation the boundary conditions for the governing equation according to the aforementioned assumptions are i no surface gravity waves at the free surface z h w 2 p r θ h w t 0 ii no vertical motion at the bottom of the fluid domain z 0 3 p z r θ 0 t 0 iii the consistency of radial motion of structure and surrounding water at fluid structure surface i e surface function s r θ z 4 p n s r θ z t s r θ z ρ w u g t n s n g in which h w is water depth ρ w is water density n s is the unit normal vector of surface function s r θ z pointing outwards n g is the unit directional vector of ground motion along the direction θ g and is the dot product between vectors according to the work of chopra and his colleagues liaw and chopra 1974 goyal and chopra 1989a 1989b the amplitude of the hydrodynamic added mass per unit height m a is a function of z the distance above the column base moreover the hydrodynamic added mass m a depends on the vibration direction for columns with non circular cross section goyal and chopra 1989b therefore a general form of hydrodynamic added mass per unit height at z j of a column vibrating along the direction θ g is denoted as m a z j θ g which can calculated by 5 m a z j θ g f p z j θ g u g where f p z j θ g is the resultant hydrodynamic force along direction θ g per unit height at z j due to vibration of column under ground motion u g when the immersed column is subjected to a unit horizontal ground motion acceleration i e u g t 1 m s2 along direction θ g the added mass m a z j θ g can also be further expressed as follows 6 m a z j θ g f p z j θ g 1 s r θ z j p r θ z j n s n g d s where p r θ z j is the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the column surface induced by its rigid motion 2 2 potential based numerical analysis framework for hydrodynamic added mass the closed form solution of the hydrodynamic pressure p r θ z j only exists for typical cross sections such as circle and ellipse in order to compute the hydrodynamic pressure on the arbitrary cross section three dimensional 3d potential based fluid elements pbfes based on φ u formulation olson and bathe 1985 is implemented in the framework in this formulation φ and u denote the velocity potential of fluid domain and the displacement of solid domain respectively yielding simple fsi modeling and avoiding heavy computational burden the velocity potential of pbfes in the numerical model satisfies the wave equation as follows 7 2 φ 1 c 2 2 φ t 2 fluid structure interaction is accounted for through fsi boundary condition at the water column interfaces defined as 8 φ n u t n where n is the unit normal vector perpendicular to the water column interface towards the water domain the fluid velocity potential φ at the free surface boundary and the side and bottom walls of the fluid domain hence obeys the following equation 9 φ 0 for the given immersed column with arbitrary cross section the column and the surrounding water are discretized into solid elements and pbfes respectively as shown in fig 2 the velocity of pressure waves in water is set to be 1440 m s resulting in a bulk modulus of 2 1 gpa to include the compressibility of water the radius of the water domain should be larger than eight times the maximum radial dimension of the column cross section for the purpose of eliminating the wave reflection due to the side wall boundaries the properties of the column are defined according to its material information the vertical degrees of freedom for nodes at bottom of the immersed column are fully constrained while the horizontal degrees are set to be free once the potential based numerical model is developed the hydrodynamic pressure p r θ z j on the column with arbitrary cross section can be calculated using the finite element model in order to obtain the hydrodynamic pressure at different distance z above the column base sweeping algorithm is used to generate the hexahedral meshes for the immersed column as illustrated in fig 1 the division numbers of the column in the cylindrical coordinate along s r θ z and z direction are defined as n and m respectively the formulation of the hydrodynamic added mass can be given as 10 m a z j θ g i 1 n p r i θ i z j n s i n g l j n j 1 m 1 in which p r i θ i z j is the hydrodynamic pressure at point r i θ i z j i 1 2 n n s i is the unit vector at point r i θ i z j normal to the surface function s r θ z j pointing outwards s r θ z j is the surface function of the column at z z j l j is the circumference of s r θ z j considering that cartesian coordinate is more general in the finite element modeling for columns with complex cross section the general formulation of hydrodynamic added mass eq 10 can be replaced by eq 11 in cartesian coordinate 11 m a z j θ g i 1 n p x i y i z j n s i cos θ g sin θ g l j n j 1 m 1 where p x i y i z j is the hydrodynamic pressure at point x i y i z j i 1 2 n the added mass coefficient c a z defined as the added mass m a z divided by the column cross section area and water density can be calculated easily as well the following analysis process shown in fig 2 can be performed to calculate the hydrodynamic added mass of the immersed column with arbitrary cross section i apply a unit acceleration to the entire column along the ground motion direction the time history of the acceleration with the duration of 1 2 s is given in fig 2 ii carry out transient analysis to obtain the hydrodynamic pressure p r i θ i z j or p x i y i z j at each node on the water column interface oscillation exists in the initial zone of the time history of hydrodynamic pressure due to the compressibility of water but it disappears quickly the stable value of hydrodynamic pressure at the last time step is recommended iii compute the hydrodynamic added mass at each z j distance above the column base through the integration of hydrodynamic pressure on the water column interface following eq 10 or 11 iv plot the curve of hydrodynamic added mass as a function of distance above the base of immersed column 3 analytical validation of the developed added mass model immersed columns with circular and elliptical cross section and the circular tapered column are widely used in offshore structures such as foundations of sea crossing bridges and offshore wind turbines in order to validate the developed model the hydrodynamic added mass of three immersed column examples including two uniform columns circular and elliptical cross section and one tapered column with circular cross section is calculated by the developed model and analytical models from previous literatures accuracy of the hydrodynamic added mass is assessed through the comparison with the results from previous literatures 3 1 immersed column with circular cross section an immersed column with circular cross section as illustrated in fig 3 is taken as the first example for validation the diameter of the column is d and the water depth is h w the hydrodynamic added mass coefficients c a z of the columns with diameter d varying from 4 to 7 m and with a water depth of 30 m are calculated using the developed model and the formulas proposed in previous literatures the closed form analytical equation of hydrodynamic added mass for circular cylinder proposed by liaw and chopra 1974 based on radiation wave theory is given in eq 12 and selected as the reference simplified formulations of the added mass for such column developed by li and yang 2013 and jiang et al 2017 shown in eq 13 and eq 14 respectively are also used for comparison equation from liaw and chopra 1974 12 m a z 4 ρ w π d 1 n q i q 2 λ q h w e

2 d 2 h w d h w z h w in which i q 0 h w cos α q z dz λ q α q 2 q 1 π 2 h w e q x k 1 x k 0 x k 2 x k n x is the modified bessel function of order n of the second kind and q 1 2 n q where n q is the number of items suggested to be larger than 50 for a smooth solution the developed model is firstly used to assess the hydrodynamic added mass for the example columns potential based numerical model for the immersed column with circular cross section is built using adina adina 2010 according to the analysis framework depicted in section 2 hydrodynamic pressure on the column is calculated according to the flowchart given in fig 2 because the hydrodynamic added mass m a z of the circular column is independent of direction θ g it can be determined by eq 15 the analytical curves of the added mass m a z for the example column are assessed directly using eqs 12 14 respectively the added mass coefficient c a z for the column can then be calculated by eq 16 according to the curve of m a z 15 m a z i 1 n p x i y i z x i x i 2 y i 2 y i x i 2 y i 2 cos θ g sin θ g π d n 16 c a z 4 m a z ρ w π d 2 fig 4 shows the comparison of hydrodynamic added mass coefficients between the developed model and the analytical equations it is clear that the results predicted from the developed model agree well with the closed form results from eq 12 for all the circular columns the tolerance between the developed model and results from liaw and chopra 1974 is significantly better than the simplified equations eqs 13 and 14 the differences between the li and yang s results and jiang s results within the mediate water depth are mainly caused by the difference of the factors in the exponential function which affects the distribution of added mass significantly furthermore the coefficients c a z determined from developed model and results from liaw and chopra 1974 are integrated along water depth 0 h w c a z dz h w and the results are compared in table 1 the relative error of the developed model is less than 0 5 compared with the solutions from liaw and chopra 1974 all these results state that the developed model has high accuracy in the prediction of hydrodynamic added mass for immersed column with circular cross section 3 2 immersed column with elliptical cross section a column with elliptical cross section submerged in a water depth of h w as shown in fig 5 is taken as the second example for validation the length of major and minor axes of the elliptical cross section is d and b respectively immersed columns with b h w varying from 0 2 to 1 0 are selected as cases for direction of motion θ g 0 while columns with d h w varying from 0 2 to 1 0 are selected for direction of motion θ g 90 for each column the aspect ratio d b is set to 2 the analytical equation for elliptical cylinder developed by wang et al 2018c is used to calculate its hydrodynamic added mass as reference fsi model of the column and surrounding water is firstly built in adina adina 2010 to calculate the hydrodynamic pressure in the application of the developed model to the column with elliptical cross section the hydrodynamic added mass m a z θ g can be determined from the pressure as follows 17 m a z θ g i 1 n p x i y i z x i d 2 x i 2 d 4 y i 2 b 4 y i b 2 x i 2 d 4 y i 2 b 4 cos θ g sin θ g l n in which l 0 2 π d 2 sin 2 θ b 2 cos 2 θ 2 d θ is the circumference of the elliptical cross section for a given column with elliptical cross section its equivalent circular area of cross section is π b 2 4 for motion along major axis θ g 0 and is π d 2 4 for motion along minor axis θ g 90 the added mass coefficient c a z θ g can be defined by the following equation 18 c a z θ g 4 m a z θ g ρ w π b 2 θ g 0 along major axis 4 m a z θ g ρ w π d 2 θ g 90 along minor axis the hydrodynamic added mass coefficients c a z θ g for all of these columns are calculated using eqs 17 and 18 and compared with results from wang et al 2018c in fig 6 it can be seen that the scatters of c a z θ g as a function of distance to base determined by the developed model are in good agreement with the reference curves for all cases regardless of column dimension and ground motion direction the maximum value of added mass appears at the column bottom and decreases gradually to zero at the water free surface this tendency is similar to that of columns with circular cross section because the elliptical cross section is non circular the coefficients of columns with elliptical cross section depend on the direction θ g the integrated hydrodynamic added mass coefficients are then calculated according to 0 h w c a z θ g dz h w for comparison in number the results calculated from developed model and wang et al 2018c are listed and compared in table 2 it is clear that the relative error between the developed model and results from wang et al 2018c is less than 1 which further proves that the developed model can evaluate the hydrodynamic added mass of immersed columns with elliptical cross section accurately 3 3 tapered column with circular cross section the third example for validation is a tapered column with circular cross section as shown in fig 7 the top and bottom diameter of the column are d 1 and d 2 respectively with a taper angle of α and submerged depth of h w two categories of circular tapered columns including one with d 1 h w 0 4 and the other with d 1 h w 1 0 are adopted here and for each category three different taper angles varying from 60 to 80 are considered to validate the accuracy of the developed model the distribution of hydrodynamic pressure over water depth in the x z plane when the column moves along direction θ g 0 investigated by wang et al 2018d is selected as the reference for comparison the hydrodynamic pressure on these circular tapered columns divided by ρ w d 1 2 in the x z plane is determined through the solution of fsi models in adina adina 2010 and results are compared with results from wang et al 2018d in fig 8 results from the developed model agree well with the results from wang et al 2018d regardless of taper angle α or ratio d 1 h w it is interesting to notice that unlike the two types of column discussed above the peak value of the hydrodynamic pressure on the circular tapered column does not appear at the bottom of column the influence of the taper angle on the hydrodynamic pressure is more significant for columns with relatively small value of d 1 h w the hydrodynamic pressure is then integrated over water depth following 2 0 h w p dz ρ w d 1 h w the results from wang et al 2018d and the developed model are then presented and compared in table 3 good consistency of the integrated hydrodynamic pressure can still be found the maximum relative error is only 0 11 the developed model can also be applied to the evaluation of the hydrodynamic pressure for tapered columns with circular cross section 4 experimental validation of the developed added mass model in this section experimental modal tests of an immersed cylinder are conducted in a water tank to further verify the developed added mass model fig 9 illustrates the configuration of the cylinder and testing devices the f t transducer is bolted with the lifting rod fixed on a testing trestle the top surface of the testing cylinder is fastened with the f t transducer which measures the modal responses of the cylinder the diameter and length of the cylinder are 0 15 m and 1 2 m respectively the length of the gap between the bottom of water and the cylinder is 0 1 m the cylinder is made of acrylic material of which the elastic modulus and mass density of the cylinder are 0 65 gpa and 1470 kg m3 respectively three different water depths h i are considered 0 m 0 4 m and 0 75 m the corresponding fundamental period t i i 1 2 3 of the cylinder under each water depth is assessed through free vibration tests and the wet to dry period ratio t i t 1 i 2 3 can be then determined for the purpose of comparison finite element models of the cylinder are established the hydrodynamic added mass for each water depth is determined using the developed model and applied to corresponding numerical models the natural periods of the numerical models are obtained through modal analysis and the wet to dry period ratios can also be calculated the results of period ratios under different water depths are compared in fig 10 it can be seen that the numerical period ratios coincide with the experimental ones which demonstrates the high accuracy of the developed model for added mass evaluation 5 seismic analyses of immersed column with dumbbell cross section the accuracy of the developed model has been validated for some typical immersed columns in section 3 the efficiency and accuracy of the developed added mass model in the seismic analyses of immersed column with complex cross section still require further examination an immersed column with dumbbell cross section used as deepwater bridge piers is selected as example structure in seismic responses analyses the column is 45 m high with 30 m submerged in water the dimensions of the dumbbell are illustrated in fig 11 the x axis and y axis are defined as the major and minor axes of the column cross section respectively the material of the column is concrete and the elastic modulus poisson s ratio and mass density are set to 25 gpa 0 2 and 2500 kg m3 respectively the column is fully fixed on the bottom with a tip mass of 3000 t to simulate the weight of superstructure in the following discussion a refined and a simplified numerical model are built for comparison the refined model is the potential based fsi model of the example column with dumbbell cross section as illustrated in fig 11 in the fsi model the fsi boundary condition eq 8 is applied to the interface between solid elements and pbfes the free surface eq 9 and rigid wall boundary condition eq 9 are applied to free surface side and bottom walls of water respectively the simplified model is a solid element made column model with added mass applied as the nodal mass to nodes on the surface of immersed part of the column although it is efficient to adopt added mass in a beam element model the differences in the basic hypothesis between the beam and solid element could lead to differences in the deformation and force responses for the purpose of eliminating additional error arising from using different element solid elements are employed for both the refined and simplified model the added mass of the example column with dumbbell cross section along direction of motion θ g is calculated using the developed model the mesh generation of the column is same as the column in fsi model the fsi model contains 67 000 solid elements for column and 440 000 pbfes for water while the column model with added mass have 67 000 solid elements only these two types of models are adopted to perform frequency domain and time domain analyses to obtain seismic responses of the example column seismic analyses results of the fsi model are taken as the fsi results while the results of the column model with added mass are taken as the added mass results 5 rayleigh damping ratio is adopted in the time domain analyses the deformation and force responses can be estimated by the solution of the following structural dynamic equation bathe 2014 chopra 2000 19 m u c u k u r where m c k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices r is the vector of externally applied loads and u u u are the vectors of nodal point displacement velocity and acceleration respectively the frequency domain responses of the motion and acceleration can be computed through solving eq 19 in frequency domain based on modal orthogonality as 20 u ω φ k y k ω u ω ω 2 φ k y k ω where y k ω is the frequency dependent generalized coordinates in the kth mode of vibration φ k is the shape of the kth mode of the column then the element stress vectors in frequency domain τ ω are determined as 21 τ ω c e b e u ω where c e and b e are the element elasticity matrix and the element strain displacement matrix respectively the base shear v ω and base moment m ω in frequency domain are computed through the integration of the element stress at the bottom surface of the column as 22 v ω τ x y ω d a m ω τ z z ω x d a where τ x y ω and τ z z ω are the element shear stress and normal stress in frequency domain at the bottom surface of the column respectively x is the distance between the element and the neutral axis the time domain responses of the motion and acceleration u t and u t can be calculated by solving eq 19 through implicit time integration method after that the element stress vectors in time domain τ t are determined as 23 τ t c e b e u t similar with the calculation of frequency domain responses the base shear v t and base moment m t in time domain are computed as 24 v t τ x y t d a m t τ z z t x d a where τ x y t and τ z z t are the element shear stress and normal stress in time domain at the bottom surface of the column respectively 5 1 hydrodynamic added mass of the example column similar with the example column with elliptical cross section the added mass of the column with dumbbell cross section also differs with the direction of ground motion θ g in order to investigate the effect of direction of motion θ g the hydrodynamic added mass of the studied column along seven different directions ranging from 0 to 90 is calculated using the refined numerical model and presented in fig 12 it can be seen that the added mass of such column increases with the direction θ g because of the increasing projection length of the column cross section along the ground motion furthermore the hydrodynamic added mass per unit height at z h 0 z h 1 3 and z h 2 3 against the seven different directions are scattered in fig 13 and the solid curves are also plotted according to eq 25 as shown in fig 13 the solid curves agree well with the scattered points which indicates that when the added mass of the column with dumbbell cross section along the major and minor axes is determined the added mass along a specific ground motion direction θ g can be calculated by eq 25 25 m a z θ g m a x x z cos 2 θ g m a y y z sin 2 θ g where m a x x z and m a y y z are the hydrodynamic added mass at z distance above the column base along the major and minor axes of the column cross section respectively 5 2 seismic responses of the example column harmonic ground motion acceleration u g t e i ω t with frequency ω ranging from 0 to 10 hz is firstly applied to these numerical models along the column major and minor axes to obtained frequency domain responses fig 14 and fig 15 compare the frequency responses including the horizontal acceleration and displacement at column top base shear and base moment under ground motion along major and minor axes respectively the added mass results coincide well with the fsi results near the first modal frequency regardless of excitation direction because the hydrodynamic added mass used in this study is a frequency independent mass which only accounts for hydrodynamic force induced by structural rigid motion and neglects the effect of vibration mode goyal and chopra 1989a some differences between these curves can be observed near the second mode frequency as shown in fig 15 this phenomenon has also been mentioned by goyal and chopra 1989a with regard to frequency responses of immersed intake towers subjected to harmonic ground motion seismic time history analyses are carried out to address its influence on time domain structural responses the n s component of the 1940 imperial valley earthquake record at el centro peer 2013 with peak ground acceleration pga scaled to 0 1 g shown in fig 16 is selected as the earthquake input for time domain seismic analyses three different earthquake directions θ g are considered case 1 0 case 2 45 case 3 90 the seismic responses of the horizontal acceleration and displacement at column top base shear and base moment under various earthquake input direction are obtained through time history analyses of both fsi and column models with added mass and are shown in figs 17 19 the agreement between seismic responses from the fsi model and the column model with added mass is satisfactory and confirms that the hydrodynamic added mass computed by the developed model is valid in the seismic analyses of immersed columns in time domain meanwhile the computational time for the fsi model and the column model with added mass on the same computer with intel r xeon e5 2630 cpu at 2 4 ghz and 16 gb ram is 1 3 h and 0 6 h respectively the assessment time of the hydrodynamic added mass using the developed model is taken into account in the computational time associated with column model with added mass considering that the added mass can be employed repeatedly in seismic analyses towards structures supported by the same column the column model with added mass is obviously more efficient compared with the fsi model by avoiding solving complex fsi equations and is more useful for seismic fragility analyses 6 conclusions a potential based numerical model of the hydrodynamic added mass for immersed column with arbitrary cross section was developed the general formulation of the hydrodynamic added mass was derived with respect to the hydrodynamic force induced by the horizontal rigid motion of the column hydrodynamic added mass of columns with circular elliptical cross section and circular tapered columns was estimated through the developed model good agreements with results from previous literatures for all three examples revealed the accuracy of the developed model for these immersed columns in order to validate the model experimentally the modal response of an immersed cylinder as a function of water depth was obtained by both the developed added mass model and experimental modal tests good agreement was found between the developed model and experimental results the developed model was then further applied to evaluate the hydrodynamic added mass of an immersed column with dumbbell cross section the effect of direction of ground motion on the added mass of the example column was investigated although the hydrodynamic added mass of the immersed column with dumbbell cross section varies with the ground motion direction the added mass along a specific direction can be calculated based on an analytical function of the added masses along the column major and minor axes and the ground motion direction the obtained added mass was then adopted to construct the column model with added mass while the potential based fsi model was also established as reference the time and frequency domain seismic responses of the example column were obtained using both models the column model with added mass exhibits good accuracy in the calculation of seismic responses and shows great advantage in computational efficiency compared with complex fsi model these findings demonstrate that the earthquake induced hydrodynamic added mass for immersed column with arbitrary cross section can be efficiently predicted by the developed model and the developed model allows the implement of added mass in the seismic design of structures supported by immersed columns with complex cross section and waiving the substantial efforts for modeling and solving sophisticated fsi equations the reduction in computational time would become more significant especially when numerous nonlinear time history analyses for a probabilistic model are required it will provide an efficient approach for a comprehensive understanding towards the seismic performance and reliability of the structures supported by immersed columns in spite of that the developed added mass model have been verified for several commonly used types of columns additional efforts should be devoted to the throughout validation of the added mass model towards columns with more kinds of cross section the effects of higher order vibration modes and the surface gravity waves on the hydrodynamic added mass have not been included because the added mass developed in the framework is independent with frequency all these limitations deserve further investigation moreover bem can be implemented instead of pbfes to evaluate the hydrodynamic pressure in the developed model for the purpose of easier meshing process and faster computation with good accuracy acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the financial

22628,the literature survey reveals that there is no available flow structure study on effects of modifying a square cylinder to a u shape cylinder in the present paper flow structures and downstream wake behind a u shape cylinder usc and a square cylinder sc have been studied at reynolds number of 18 100 constant temperature hot wire anemometers cta are employed to measure the wake properties downstream of the u shape cylinder and the square cylinder the flow structures are investigated in terms of velocity components turbulent kinetic energy and similarities and dissimilarities in coherent and incoherent structures are addressed in detail quantitatively keywords square cylinder u shape cylinder vortex shedding coherent structure incoherent structure near wake 1 introduction vortex shedding is a well known phenomenon which occurs in the wake of bluff bodies this phenomenon has been investigated on various geometries with applications in engineering and industry the vortex shedding phenomenon induces an unsteady loading on the structure and as a result it requires consideration during design stages of industrial systems therefore many researchers have investigated the vortex shedding phenomenon in order to quantify the severity of the possible structural damages the vortex shedding phenomenon in the wake region of a square cylinder has been investigated by many researchers hacışevki and teimourian 2015 kurtulus et al 2007 okajima 1982 saha et al 2000 2003 saha 2013 sohankar et al 1998 1999 2015 teimourian et al 2017b kim et al 2004 they investigated different features of vortex shedding phenomena in the wake of a square cylinder and reported the wake flow structures strouhal number variation and other aerodynamic characteristics beside these numerous and extensive investigations on flow structures in the wake of square cylinders several studies focused on features of the flow behind modified square cylinders tamura and miyagi 1999 tamura et al 1998 carassale et al 2014 and miran and sohn 2015 have investigated the vortex shedding from square cylinders with rounded corners the results demonstrate that rounding the corners of square cylinders is an effective approach to reduce the drag and lift forces generated behind the cylinder it was demonstrated that in the wake region of a square cylinder the alternate vortices are deflecting away from the centerline on the contrary in the wake region of a rounded corner square such a phenomenon has not been observed as a result the drag and lift coefficients decrease by reducing the wake width in addition it was reported that as the corner radius ratio r d increases the strouhal number also increases while it is essential to investigate the features of modified square cylinders due to their applications in industry identifying the similarities and dissimilarities between different geometries will be also valuable in this context flow similarity between different geometries such as circular and rectangular cylinder ozgoren 2006 sarioglu and yavuz 2000 and two tandem plates and square cylinder hacışevki and teimourian 2015 have been investigated in detail in case of comparison between rectangular and circular cylinder it was reported that the rectangular cylinder at zero angle of rotation with equal hydraulic diameter to the circular cylinder exhibits lower strouhal number in addition a larger length scale for the square cylinder was observed in both streamwise and transverse directions on the other hand in the wake region of both rectangular and circular cylinders a linear increment of strouhal number on logarithmic scale was observed as reynolds number increased as two identical tandem plates resemble a rectangular body without the top and bottom boundaries hacışevki and teimourian 2015 investigated these geometries in terms of flow structure turbulent kinetic energy and strouhal number it was reported that the wake region behind a square cylinder exhibits lower strouhal number than for the two plates in tandem to sum up the literature survey reveals that there is a limited number of studies regarding the effect of shape modification such as rounded corners or perforation on the vortex shedding from square cylinders however to the best knowledge of the authors there is no available study on effects of modifying a square cylinder to a u shape cylinder therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of such a shape modification on the flow structure and vortex shedding phenomenon the wake regions of a square and a u shape cylinder have been compared in terms of flow structure and other aerodynamic characteristics hence coherent and incoherent flow structures of wake regions are presented in detail for a square cylinder or a u shape cylinder to demonstrate the possible dissimilarities in flow structures 2 experimental setup investigations are conducted in an open return subsonic wind tunnel as shown in fig 1 the wind tunnel test section dimension is 0 5m 0 5m x 1 0m with contraction ratio of 10 1 a 12 kw danfoss frequency controller is used to control the wind tunnel speed with the maximum speed of 30 m s the experiment was conducted at a free stream velocity u 11 2 2 m s with measured turbulence intensity of 0 6 at this speed a u shape cylinder and a square cylinder with a cross section of 25 mm 25 mm were investigated in this study note that the thickness of the u shape cylinder profile is 2 mm with the end plates employed the aspect ratio ar of the cylinders were 14 and the corresponding blockage ratio of cylinders were 5 the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 2 and extra details of the experimental setup have been described in teimourian et al 2017a the square cylinder or the u shape cylinder is placed at the centerline of the channel with a distance of 25d from the inlet the corresponding reynolds number in the domain of investigation between 1 0 d to 6 0 d in the wake region of the cylinders 1 0 x d 6 0 is re 18 100 r e ρ u d μ based on cylinder width d tsi flowpoint 1500 cta hotwire system has been employed to acquire the data the u and v velocity components free stream velocity and reference signal of periodic shedding were acquired by one x type 1241 t1 5 and two s type 1210 t1 5 hot wires respectively triple decomposition and ensemble averaging techniques were employed to analyze the flow properties such as streamwise velocity component or transverse velocity component as proposed by hussain 1986 and hussain and reynolds 1972 the instantaneous velocity can be defined as superposition of time mean averaged component u coherent component phase averaged u and incoherent component random fluctuations u 1 u u u u in this study it is required to obtain the dependency of the triple components of the velocity on time normalized with respect to total period t during one complete cycle of events hence the periodic vortex shedding velocity fluctuation has been selected as the reference signal therefore corresponding to same t t of consecutive reference cycles the acquired streamwise and transverse velocity components at the same relative instant are summed and averaged as follows teimourian et al 2017a 2 u x y t lim n 1 n n 1 n u x y t n t where n is the number of cycles used for phase averaging this averaging process is repeated for different normalized times during one cycle to construct the variation of different properties the time averaging and phase averaging techniques are applied as defined previously and it can be applied for all velocity components or products of velocity components applying triple decomposition together with phase averaging techniques on the navier stokes momentum equation will result in the modified navier stokes equation as follows teimourian et al 2017a 3 d u i d t 1 ρ p x j ν 2 u i x j x j x j u i u j u i u j the final consideration is to determine the acceptable minimum number of cycles n to perform phase averaging such that the properties should be cycle independent therefore such dependency has been investigated and it was observed that for convergence of properties such as normal and shear stress at least 150 cycles is required to obtain steady values for a number of cycles lower than 150 significant errors in the order of 50 have been observed therefore in this study the number of cycles to perform phase averaging was set as 400 3 experimental results 3 1 time and phase averaged properties in this section flow structures downstream of a u shape cylinder or a square cylinder are investigated quantitatively in this study the time averaged properties are computed as phase averaged time mean values rather than time averaging the latter performing time averaging process over all the cycles as a series of unconditioned samples however for phase averaged time mean properties averaging process performed across one cycle with acquired value from all cycles both techniques imply the same averaging and therefore the computed results are equal saha et al 2000 teimourian et al 2017b the time averaged streamwise and transverse velocity profiles are depicted in figs 3 and 4 respectively acquired at various x d values in the downstream wake behind the cylinders note that all time and phase averaged properties within the present paper are normalized by the free stream velocity u as it was anticipated the wake region behind usc demonstrates a symmetrical streamwise and transverse velocity profiles similar to sc as depicted in figs 3 and 4 it can be observed from figs 3 and 4 that the wake region behind the usc exhibit a delay in wake recovery in comparison to the sc measurements revealed that in the near wake region i e x d 1 0 of the usc the streamwise velocity is around 0 6 u on the other hand for the case of sc it was observed that the wake recovers to 0 8 u as the probe moves downstream in the wake the streamwise velocity component recovers to 0 8 u and 0 9 u for usc and sc respectively such discrepancy caused by entrainment of fluid into the hollow space of usc and therefore the wake recovery delayed the transverse velocity profile decaying downstream in the wake region is also apparent from the figure however it can be seen from the figure that the wake region behind usc exhibits higher momentum transfer towards the centerline as the shear layers separate from square cylinder the fluid flow is subjected to momentum loss in the wake region therefore the time averaged streamwise velocity profile exhibits a drop in the wake region behind the cylinders however outside the wake it returns to the free stream value which is apparent from the figure as the flow develops downstream the wake widens as fluid entrained into the wake from the edges of cylinder periodically another sign of such entrainment process can be perceived from time averaged transverse velocity profile at very near the wake region exhibit high fluid entrainment towards the centerline however such process dissipated significantly beyond the distance of 3d in the downstream wake figs 5 and 6 illustrate the phase averaged streamwise and transverse velocity components acquired at various x d values in the downstream wake regions of sc and usc respectively from figs 5 and 6 it is apparent that the flow structures behind the usc have been affected by the employed modification figs 7 and 8 demonstrate temporal and spatial development of coherent structure acquired at various x d values in the downstream wake regions of sc and usc respectively it can be concluded from figs 7 and 8 that usc modification resulted in an alteration of coherent structure in the wake region very close to the cylinder base i e x d 1 0 and a narrower coherent structure is observed however further downstream in the wake region the effect of usc diminishes and flow exhibit similar structure to a sc development of the coherent structures is clearly apparent as the vortices being convected downstream in the wake region from comparison between the u peak and u peak on average it was observed that the coherent structure peak is around 20 of the phase averaged values for both cases of usc and sc on the other hand for the case of transverse velocity on average the coherent structure peak is around 77 and 70 of the sc and usc phase averaged values respectively which was caused by a significant lateral momentum during the shedding process dividing a cycle into insufficient number of phases resulted in discrete variation for phase averaging rather than a continuous variation of the properties in this research 60 phases during one cycle have been employed figs 9 and 10 illustrate the phase averaged variations of coherent streamwise and transverse velocity components measured at x d 3 0 at four different phases respectively time mean phase averaged coherent properties over one cycle implies zero values over the cycle figs 9 and 10 demonstrate such observation for both sc and usc cases 3 2 turbulent kinetic energy the turbulent kinetic energy tke definition defined by the triple decomposition technique is quite different to the well known turbulent kinetic energy term defined by the reynolds decomposition method hussain and reynolds 1972 mccaffrey et al 2015 jiménez 2018 in fact based on eq 1 the triple decomposition technique introduces two terms namely coherent turbulent kinetic energy ctke and incoherent turbulent kinetic energy itke as follows 4 c t k e u i u i 2 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 5 i t k e u i u i 2 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 figs 11 and 12 demonstrate the phase averaged coherent and incoherent turbulent kinetic energy acquired at various x d values in the downstream wake regions of sc and usc respectively as previously mentioned all time and phase averaged properties within the present paper are normalized by the free stream velocity as a result the presented coherent and incoherent turbulent kinetic energy values are normalized by 0 5 u 2 a comparison between usc and sc shows a similar development of tke in the wake region at near wake i e x d 1 0 coherent turbulent kinetic energy peaks are observed along the edges as the probe moves downstream in the wake region namely x d 3 0 these peaks develop toward the centerline however from a comparison between usc and sc it can be concluded that the u modification causes a delay on the development of vortex structure moreover a phase shift between peaks of incoherent and coherent turbulent kinetic energy in the wake regions has been observed for both cases of usc and sc it can be concluded from the figure that at wake region close to the base the wake behind sc exhibit higher coherent tke peak on the contrary further downstream in the wake region usc demonstrate higher peak level for coherent tke as discussed triple decomposition distinguishes between coherent structure or vortex shedding phenomenon and incoherent structure of turbulent fluctuations therefore it is possible to put the periodic shedding phenomenon aside and perform a detailed investigation on incoherent fluctuations therefore higher incoherent tke peaks in the wake behind square cylinder for all investigated x d values has been observed such a reduction in incoherent tke caused by flow entraining into the gap space inside usc additional observation associated to flow entrainment into the usc is a stronger coherent structure as discussed in previous section the usc delays the development of alternate vortices at the near base hence the wake region demonstrates lower coherent tke as apparent in the figures however further downstream in the wake region behind usc flow possess higher coherent tke which implies that entrainment of fluid into usc gap eventually causes development of stronger vortices figs 13 and 14 show the detected peak value of coherent and incoherent tke for various x d values respectively it is seen from fig 13 that the coherent tke peak of usc is lower than the coherent tke peak of sc in the near wake region the detected reductions in usc coherent tke peak at x d 1 and x d 2 are about 26 and 27 respectively the situation is different in the far wake region the coherent tke peak of usc is higher than the coherent tke peak of sc in the far wake region the detected increases in usc coherent tke peak at x d 3 x d 4 x d 5 and x d 6 are about 15 13 22 and 11 respectively it is apparent from the figure that the maximum coherent tke peak of usc occurs at a larger x d value which can be concluded as an indication of a location delay in the wake region in comparison to the sc case it can be observed from fig 14 that the incoherent tke peak of usc is lower than the incoherent tke peak of sc on average the detected reduction in usc incoherent tke peak is about 17 it is noticeable that the detected reduction in usc incoherent tke peak is higher in the near wake region it is also apparent from the figure that the maximum incoherent tke peak of usc occurs at a larger x d value in comparison to the sc case 4 conclusions in this paper flow structures downstream of a u shape cylinder and a square cylinder have been studied at reynolds number of 18 100 the flow structures have been investigated in terms of velocity components turbulent kinetic energy and similarities and dissimilarities in coherent and incoherent structures have been addressed in detail it was found that the wake region behind the usc exhibits a delay in the wake recovery in comparison to the sc it was also observed that the coherent tke peak of usc is about 25 lower than the coherent tke peak of sc in the near wake region while on average it is about 15 higher in the far wake region the incoherent tke peak of usc is lower than the incoherent tke peak of sc on average the detected reduction in usc incoherent tke peak is about 17 in case of a bluff body existence in the wake region of usc and sc the presented results give valuable insight into the basic understanding of the flow structures around the tandem body 
22628,the literature survey reveals that there is no available flow structure study on effects of modifying a square cylinder to a u shape cylinder in the present paper flow structures and downstream wake behind a u shape cylinder usc and a square cylinder sc have been studied at reynolds number of 18 100 constant temperature hot wire anemometers cta are employed to measure the wake properties downstream of the u shape cylinder and the square cylinder the flow structures are investigated in terms of velocity components turbulent kinetic energy and similarities and dissimilarities in coherent and incoherent structures are addressed in detail quantitatively keywords square cylinder u shape cylinder vortex shedding coherent structure incoherent structure near wake 1 introduction vortex shedding is a well known phenomenon which occurs in the wake of bluff bodies this phenomenon has been investigated on various geometries with applications in engineering and industry the vortex shedding phenomenon induces an unsteady loading on the structure and as a result it requires consideration during design stages of industrial systems therefore many researchers have investigated the vortex shedding phenomenon in order to quantify the severity of the possible structural damages the vortex shedding phenomenon in the wake region of a square cylinder has been investigated by many researchers hacışevki and teimourian 2015 kurtulus et al 2007 okajima 1982 saha et al 2000 2003 saha 2013 sohankar et al 1998 1999 2015 teimourian et al 2017b kim et al 2004 they investigated different features of vortex shedding phenomena in the wake of a square cylinder and reported the wake flow structures strouhal number variation and other aerodynamic characteristics beside these numerous and extensive investigations on flow structures in the wake of square cylinders several studies focused on features of the flow behind modified square cylinders tamura and miyagi 1999 tamura et al 1998 carassale et al 2014 and miran and sohn 2015 have investigated the vortex shedding from square cylinders with rounded corners the results demonstrate that rounding the corners of square cylinders is an effective approach to reduce the drag and lift forces generated behind the cylinder it was demonstrated that in the wake region of a square cylinder the alternate vortices are deflecting away from the centerline on the contrary in the wake region of a rounded corner square such a phenomenon has not been observed as a result the drag and lift coefficients decrease by reducing the wake width in addition it was reported that as the corner radius ratio r d increases the strouhal number also increases while it is essential to investigate the features of modified square cylinders due to their applications in industry identifying the similarities and dissimilarities between different geometries will be also valuable in this context flow similarity between different geometries such as circular and rectangular cylinder ozgoren 2006 sarioglu and yavuz 2000 and two tandem plates and square cylinder hacışevki and teimourian 2015 have been investigated in detail in case of comparison between rectangular and circular cylinder it was reported that the rectangular cylinder at zero angle of rotation with equal hydraulic diameter to the circular cylinder exhibits lower strouhal number in addition a larger length scale for the square cylinder was observed in both streamwise and transverse directions on the other hand in the wake region of both rectangular and circular cylinders a linear increment of strouhal number on logarithmic scale was observed as reynolds number increased as two identical tandem plates resemble a rectangular body without the top and bottom boundaries hacışevki and teimourian 2015 investigated these geometries in terms of flow structure turbulent kinetic energy and strouhal number it was reported that the wake region behind a square cylinder exhibits lower strouhal number than for the two plates in tandem to sum up the literature survey reveals that there is a limited number of studies regarding the effect of shape modification such as rounded corners or perforation on the vortex shedding from square cylinders however to the best knowledge of the authors there is no available study on effects of modifying a square cylinder to a u shape cylinder therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the effects of such a shape modification on the flow structure and vortex shedding phenomenon the wake regions of a square and a u shape cylinder have been compared in terms of flow structure and other aerodynamic characteristics hence coherent and incoherent flow structures of wake regions are presented in detail for a square cylinder or a u shape cylinder to demonstrate the possible dissimilarities in flow structures 2 experimental setup investigations are conducted in an open return subsonic wind tunnel as shown in fig 1 the wind tunnel test section dimension is 0 5m 0 5m x 1 0m with contraction ratio of 10 1 a 12 kw danfoss frequency controller is used to control the wind tunnel speed with the maximum speed of 30 m s the experiment was conducted at a free stream velocity u 11 2 2 m s with measured turbulence intensity of 0 6 at this speed a u shape cylinder and a square cylinder with a cross section of 25 mm 25 mm were investigated in this study note that the thickness of the u shape cylinder profile is 2 mm with the end plates employed the aspect ratio ar of the cylinders were 14 and the corresponding blockage ratio of cylinders were 5 the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 2 and extra details of the experimental setup have been described in teimourian et al 2017a the square cylinder or the u shape cylinder is placed at the centerline of the channel with a distance of 25d from the inlet the corresponding reynolds number in the domain of investigation between 1 0 d to 6 0 d in the wake region of the cylinders 1 0 x d 6 0 is re 18 100 r e ρ u d μ based on cylinder width d tsi flowpoint 1500 cta hotwire system has been employed to acquire the data the u and v velocity components free stream velocity and reference signal of periodic shedding were acquired by one x type 1241 t1 5 and two s type 1210 t1 5 hot wires respectively triple decomposition and ensemble averaging techniques were employed to analyze the flow properties such as streamwise velocity component or transverse velocity component as proposed by hussain 1986 and hussain and reynolds 1972 the instantaneous velocity can be defined as superposition of time mean averaged component u coherent component phase averaged u and incoherent component random fluctuations u 1 u u u u in this study it is required to obtain the dependency of the triple components of the velocity on time normalized with respect to total period t during one complete cycle of events hence the periodic vortex shedding velocity fluctuation has been selected as the reference signal therefore corresponding to same t t of consecutive reference cycles the acquired streamwise and transverse velocity components at the same relative instant are summed and averaged as follows teimourian et al 2017a 2 u x y t lim n 1 n n 1 n u x y t n t where n is the number of cycles used for phase averaging this averaging process is repeated for different normalized times during one cycle to construct the variation of different properties the time averaging and phase averaging techniques are applied as defined previously and it can be applied for all velocity components or products of velocity components applying triple decomposition together with phase averaging techniques on the navier stokes momentum equation will result in the modified navier stokes equation as follows teimourian et al 2017a 3 d u i d t 1 ρ p x j ν 2 u i x j x j x j u i u j u i u j the final consideration is to determine the acceptable minimum number of cycles n to perform phase averaging such that the properties should be cycle independent therefore such dependency has been investigated and it was observed that for convergence of properties such as normal and shear stress at least 150 cycles is required to obtain steady values for a number of cycles lower than 150 significant errors in the order of 50 have been observed therefore in this study the number of cycles to perform phase averaging was set as 400 3 experimental results 3 1 time and phase averaged properties in this section flow structures downstream of a u shape cylinder or a square cylinder are investigated quantitatively in this study the time averaged properties are computed as phase averaged time mean values rather than time averaging the latter performing time averaging process over all the cycles as a series of unconditioned samples however for phase averaged time mean properties averaging process performed across one cycle with acquired value from all cycles both techniques imply the same averaging and therefore the computed results are equal saha et al 2000 teimourian et al 2017b the time averaged streamwise and transverse velocity profiles are depicted in figs 3 and 4 respectively acquired at various x d values in the downstream wake behind the cylinders note that all time and phase averaged properties within the present paper are normalized by the free stream velocity u as it was anticipated the wake region behind usc demonstrates a symmetrical streamwise and transverse velocity profiles similar to sc as depicted in figs 3 and 4 it can be observed from figs 3 and 4 that the wake region behind the usc exhibit a delay in wake recovery in comparison to the sc measurements revealed that in the near wake region i e x d 1 0 of the usc the streamwise velocity is around 0 6 u on the other hand for the case of sc it was observed that the wake recovers to 0 8 u as the probe moves downstream in the wake the streamwise velocity component recovers to 0 8 u and 0 9 u for usc and sc respectively such discrepancy caused by entrainment of fluid into the hollow space of usc and therefore the wake recovery delayed the transverse velocity profile decaying downstream in the wake region is also apparent from the figure however it can be seen from the figure that the wake region behind usc exhibits

22629,a gurney flap gf placed at pressure side of the trailing edge of an airfoil and perpendicular to the chord line enhances lift in aircraft wings helicopter rotors and wind turbines etc in this article the gf concept was introduced for wells turbine blade used to harvest wave energy with special consideration as the blades are having symmetric airfoil and faces bidirectional flow hence the flap was extended to both pressure and suction sides of the trailing edge te to maintain blade symmetry and the turbine performance was evaluated using opensource computational fluid dynamics code openfoam 4 0 different gf lengths 0 5 3 chord length were considered and the performance parameters such as non dimensional torque pressure drop and efficiency were evaluated the gf blades produced a counter rotating vortex pair behind the te which modified the te kutta condition and increased the circulation and lift in addition the gf blades increased the blade loading and enhanced the torque

ocean wave energy is one of the renewable sources which is clean easily predictable and available throughout the year mustapa et al 2017 in recent years various countries have installed the pilot and technology demonstration wave energy plants around the world renewables 2018 however immature technology of the wave energy converters inhibits its commercial operation and dedicated research and development are required to make it economically viable there are various types of wave energy converter wec are available and the oscillating water column owc is one of the most commonly used and actively researched wec shalby et al 2018 the owc consists of a partially submerged concrete structure that provides an opening for the incoming wave the incoming wave compresses and expands the air above the air water interface which drives an air turbine falnes 2004 the wells turbine is one such kind of air turbine it comprises symmetric blades with zero twist placed perpendicular to the incoming flow and rotates in same direction irrespective of the airflow direction fig 1 shows the working principle of the turbine owing to the blade symmetry the tangential force component f t acts in the same direction for both the outgoing and the incoming flow this self rectifying feature is advantageous as it eliminates the need for guide vane and reduces design complexity however it suffers from noisy operation narrow operating range and reduced torque at low airflow rates falcão 2010 the flow separation at higher angle of attack causes stall and restricts power extraction the wells turbine is an actively researched turbine and a detailed study on the different parameters influencing its performance is reported by raghunathan 1995 for an in depth review of various works performed on wells turbine the readers can refer to the studies performed by shehata et al 2017a and cui et al 2019 many researchers adopted different design modifications to improve turbine performance table 1 provides a comprehensive list of important design modifications and their effects from table 1 we can conclude that improving torque coefficient and delaying stall are important to produce an increased power output on the other hand the gurney flap gf is a passive lift enhancement device that is used to improve the performance of wind turbines helicopters aircraft etc it is a small plate 1 2 c attached perpendicular to the pressure side ps of the trailing edge te the gf increases the circulation by deflecting the flow towards the ps and enhances lift fig 2 however it increases drag due to the modified wake flow liebeck 1978 experimentally studied newman airfoil with gf 1 25 c and reported that it enhanced lift and reduced drag the author suggested that the height of gf should be 1 2 c and the height 2 c increases the drag substantially many researchers studied the gf and its parameters to comprehend the underlying flow physics behind the lift enhancement jeffrey and hurst 1996 li et al 2007 maughmer and bramesfeld 2008 traub and freienmuth 2011 vieira et al 2013 graham et al 2017 according to literature the flap height fh should be less than the boundary layer thickness to achieve better performance the increase in fh enhances the lift up to a critical value and then advances stall the lift enhancement of gf is directly proportional to the fh porosity and inclination of the flap traub et al 2006 a detailed review of various gf applications and lift augmentation mechanisms can be found in the study of wang et al 2008 liu and montefort 2007 calculated the lift and pitch coefficients theoretically using classical thin airfoil theory they reported that the induced camber effect caused the lift enhancement owing to their aerodynamic benefits and simple design the gf finds application in many areas such as supercritical airfoils li et al 2007 delta wings li et al 2002 aircrafts zhang et al 2006 helicopters kentfield 1993 unmanned aerial vehicles agarwal et al 2009 flapping airfoils xie et al 2016 wind turbines bao et al 2000 tongchitpakdee et al 2006 holst et al 2017 bianchini et al 2019 axial fans chen et al 2018 and pumps thamsen et al 2015 etc the gf can either be applied on the suction side ss or both ps and ss based on the design constraints xie et al 2016 bianchini et al 2019 from the studies above it is evident that the gf has a huge prospective to augment the aerodynamic performance and its design primarily depends on the application type moreover no literature is available on using gfs to enhance the wells turbine performance in the light of gf s aerodynamic benefits it is worth considering it as a potential lift enhancement device to improve its performance however the gf should be implemented on both sides to preserve blade symmetry of wells turbine similarly xie et al 2016 encountered this problem in using gfs for flapping airfoil and employed gfs on both ps and ss to retain blade symmetry hence in this study the gf is applied on both sides and the fh is varied from 0 5 to 3 c to understand its effect on wells turbine performance the numerical simulations are performed using opensource cfd code openfoam and a detailed flow analysis has been presented to comprehend the influence of gf on aerodynamic behaviour of wells turbine 2 reference turbine and gf implementation the reference wells turbine geometry was adopted from the work of torresi et al 2008 and its specifications were provided in table 2 as discussed earlier the gf was applied on both ps and ss to maintain blade symmetry the gf was implemented by extending the te perpendicular to chord line on both sides symmetrically without altering the features of base airfoil in this study the gf height was varied from 0 5 to 3 c and the thickness of flap was fixed as 0 5 c fig 3 shows the reference airfoil and airfoil with gf on both sides 3 numerical methodology 3 1 computational domain the wells turbine is axisymmetric about the rotational axis hence to exploit its rotational symmetry a single blade with periodic interface was selected as the computational domain the single blade domain saves computational time and power the computational domain was extended by 4c and 6c along the upstream and downstream directions respectively the turbine blade rotates in a counter clockwise direction when viewed from the inlet in addition the x y and z axis represents the chordwise streamwise and spanwise directions respectively fig 4 shows the computational domain used in this study 3 2 mesh and boundary conditions the unstructured tetrahedral elements were generated using icem cfd 15 0 ansys 2012 as they consume less time for grid generation compared to the structured hexahedral elements to resolve the boundary layer region prism elements are created on the blade surface with a height ratio of 1 2 the first cell height was fixed as 0 01 mm to maintain the non dimensional wall distance y value less than 1 the grid was exported as fluent mesh from icem cfd ansys 2012 and later imported in openfoam greenshields 2015 using the fluent3dmeshtofoam command the quality of the imported mesh was checked by checkmesh command to analyse critical parameters like non orthogonality skewness aspect ratio and face pyramids etc fig 5 displays the meshed computational domain and the blade with prism layers regarding the boundary conditions the periodic interface is applied to the lateral faces through cyclic arbitrary mesh interface cyclicami and to implement it the neighbour patch rotational axis and centre were provided the hub shroud and blade were provided with no slip boundary whereas uniform axial velocity and zero pressure gradient were given at inlet zero velocity gradient and fixed pressure value of 0 were provided at the outlet additionally the inlet turbulence intensity was kept as 5 and the inlet axial velocity was varied from 4 to 18 m s with air as working fluid the problem was solved in a moving reference frame which realizes the turbine rotation without physically rotating it and the setbatch command assigns the specified cells to the rotating zone defined in mrfproperties file 3 3 turbulence model selection the wells turbine problem involves flow separation due to severe adverse pressure gradient and the k w shear stress transport sst model is more suitable for such problems it is a combined model that uses k w near the wall and k e away from the wall menter 1994 the openfoam offers implementation of k w sst as low and high reynolds re number model in low re number formulation the boundary layer region is resolved whereas the high re number model employs wall functions in this present study the k w sst was implemented as a low re model for better prediction of turbine performance in addition many researchers have successfully used the k w sst model to simulate the wells turbine problem halder et al 2015 nazeryan and lakzian 2018 gratton et al 2018 3 4 solver selection and numerical schemes the openfoam offers a variety of solvers based on the application type and an appropriate solver selection is crucial regarding the wells turbine the tip leakage flow behaviour is a very critical parameter and it affects performance significantly hence a three dimensional analysis was adopted in this study in addition the blade tip velocity based mach number is 0 19 which is less than 0 3 hence the flow was assumed to be incompressible gratton et al 2018 lately it has been shown that the hysteresis is caused by the compressibility effects of the owc chamber and not due to the dynamic effects of wells turbine ghisu et al 2015 2016 and 2017 hence the present problem was treated as a steady flow accordingly the simplefoam solver was chosen as it is suitable for the three dimensional steady and incompressible flow problems greenshields 2015 the consistent version of simple semi implicit method of pressure linked equations algorithm simplec simple consistent was used to realize the pressure velocity coupling holzmann 2016 all the gradient terms use second order central differencing gaussian integration for discretization excluding the velocity

simulation was around 15 h 4 results and discussion 4 1 grid convergence study the cfd simulations are prone to various types of errors and the discretization error or numerical error is one of the most critical errors that affect the uncertainty of the solution the discretization error is divided into spatial and temporal discretization errors since the present study is steady the temporal discretization error was neglected and the spatial discretization error alone was taken into account the numerical uncertainty caused by discretization error was assessed using the grid convergence index gci the procedure suggested by celik et al 2008 was used to calculate the gci three grids with a different resolution such as fine 5 77 million cells medium 2 54 million cells and coarse 1 11 million cells were considered as recommended in the literature a grid refinement factor greater than 1 3 was selected and the efficiency was chosen as the performance parameter table 4 provides the result of gci calculation it shows that the numerical uncertainty reduces with increase in grid refinement the gci value of fine and medium grid is 0 045 and 0 387 respectively as the gci value between the consecutive grids is less than 1 we can assume that the spatial convergence of the grid has been achieved and the solution is not affected by further refinement in this study the medium grid was retained for the further computations as it offers a better trade off between accuracy and computational cost fig 6 shows the y distribution on the blade surface for the medium grid 4 2 numerical validation the present results were validated against the existing experiment curran and gato 1997 and numerical results torresi et al 2008 halder et al 2015 available in open literature the turbine parameters are expressed as efficiency η t ω q δ p non dimensional torque t t ρ ω 2 r t i p 5 and pressure drop δ p δ p ρ ω 2 r t i p 2 plotted against flow coefficient u u a u t i p the performance parameters were plotted for entire flow range by varying the inlet axial velocity u a from 4 to 18 m s as shown in fig 7 the present model slightly over predicts torque and pressure drop at higher flow coefficients in addition it captures the stall point accurately and follows same trend as the existing numerical results hence the present numerical model can be reliably used to analyse the aerodynamic performance of wells turbine with gfs 4 3 aerodynamic effect of gfs fig 8 reports the effect of gf location on the lift coefficient principally the gf improves the performance when placed on the ps and degrades the performance when located on the ss holst et al 2017 baker et al 2007 since the wells turbine experiences bi directional flow the ps and ss of blade changes periodically for the incoming and outgoing flow hence the gf extends on both direction to maintain blade symmetry and their aerodynamic effects with varying fh 0 5 3 c is shown in fig 9 at a low flow coefficient fc 0 075 the torque enhancement decreases as the fh increases from 0 5 to 1 c and for a fh greater than 1 c the torque diminishes as the fh increases in addition the torque augmentation is appreciable at higher fcs the combined effect of gfs on both sides as shown in fig 8 explains the obtained torque characteristic at a low angle of attack aoa the detrimental effect of ss gf is more significant relative to a higher aoa case at a higher aoa the ss flow separation nullifies the effect of ss gf as it is immersed in the separated flow whereas the ps gf enhances the performance holst et al 2017 the present torque characteristic exhibits a similar behaviour in addition for fh greater than 1 5 c the aerodynamic benefit of gf diminishes as it advances the stall condition also the gf increases the pressure drop noticeably and it increases with the fh likewise the efficiency decreases as the fh increases owing to the increased pressure drop furthermore the 0 5 and 1 c gf blades improved the relative average torque by 10 7 and 13 respectively before stall condition with a corresponding decrement in the average efficiency of 4 7 and 8 75 4 4 flow field analyses to understand the blade loading effects of gf a comparison of pressure distribution at blade midspan 0 5 c and near tip 0 95 c for different blade configurations is shown in fig 10 gfs with height 1 5 c were omitted for the analyses as they advanced stall and reduced the operating range as revealed in the figure blade loading increases from midspan to tip for all cases at fc 0 075 a marginal increase in suction pressure visible for the gf blades compared to the reference blade and the te loading increases significantly for the gf blades because of the presence of flap at te as the fc increases the increase in suction at le is significant for the gf blades and the 1 5 c gf design produces relatively higher suction pressure and it corroborates the result shown in fig 9a also the higher blade loading in gf blade increases the axial velocity and reduces the efficiency fig 9c at fc 0 275 the suction pressure at le diminishes and stall for all cases moreover the upper side pressure increases with the fh and the advanced stall in gf blades 1 5 c can be attributed to the increased tip loading because of the increased fh fig 11 provides the spanwise axial velocity distribution plotted over a line near blade ss at fc 0 075 the axial velocity increases from hub to tip for all cases as apparent the gf blades exhibit higher axial velocity compared to the reference blade owing to the increased blade loading fig 10 the axial velocity increases with fc up to 0 225 and later stall occurs at fc 0 275 the axial velocity at tip reduces for all cases implying flow separation and increased blockage in addition the axial velocity intensifies with fh because of the increased blade loading in gf blades the increased axial velocity near tip implies higher aoa and subsequently higher torque the advanced stall in gf blades 1 5 c can be explained by the higher aoa at blade tip which causes flow separation likewise higher axial velocity indicates a stronger tip leakage flow and increases the associated losses which decrease the efficiency to gain further insight paraview 5 5 2 ayachit 2015 is used for flow visualization purposes fig 12 illustrates the velocity distribution along the blade midspan as evident a low velocity and a high velocity zone are visible near the ps and ss le respectively for all blades the low velocity zone shifts downstream with an increase in fc additionally for the gf blades the ss le and the ps le velocity increases and decreases due to a corresponding change in suction and upper side pressure fig 10 the overall effect is to improve the circulation and the lift it intensifies with fh which explains the torque augmentation in gf blades fig 9a at fc 0 275 a low velocity region engulfs the blade ss which implies stall due to flow separation furthermore a wake low velocity region appears behind the te because of flow separation comparing the wake behaviour of all cases it can be noticed that the gf blade increases the wake as they extend on both ps and ss in contrast to the reference blade the above behaviour intensifies with the increase in fc and the enlarged wake reduces the efficiency by increasing the drag the gf enhances lift by altering the trailing edge kutta condition and the effective camber the counter rotating vortex pair generated behind the flap modifies the te stagnation point and increases circulation and lift wang et al 2008 hence to comprehend the te flow behaviour of gf blades an enlarged view of te streamlines is shown in fig 13 the reference blade shows a counter clockwise separation vortex near the te at fc 0 225 and the separation point tends to move towards the le as the fc is increased because of the increased aoa the reference blade stalls at fc 0 275 and the separation region occupies the blade ss fig 12 furthermore a distinct vortical structure that consists of a ps and ss upstream separation bubble and a counter rotating vortex pair is visible at te for the gf blades this flow behaviour is consistent with the theory formulated by liebeck 1978 the strength of vortical structures grows with the increase in gf height and aoa however at higher aoa post stall the counter rotating vortex pair breakdowns for all gf blades and the aerodynamic benefit of gf diminishes additionally the vortices formed by the gf blade increases the induced drag and reduces efficiency fig 14 displays the tangential velocity distribution along the blade midchord section as evident the tip leakage flow low velocity appears near the ss blade tip for all cases the pressure variation between the blade ps and ss is responsible for the tip leakage flow the strength of tip leakage flow increases with fc and aoa the tip leakage flow offers blockage to the mainstream flow by reducing the effective flow passage at fc 0 075 the tip leakage flow provides less blockage to the mainstream flow and the blockage amplifies with the increase in fc because of higher aoa at higher fc 0 275 a strong interaction between tip leakage and mainstream flow is noticed and it increases the blockage significantly hence the mainstream flow separates and stall occurs for all cases in addition it can be observed that the gf blades show increased tangential velocity along span compared to the reference blade the tangential velocity is a critical parameter which affects torque the increased suction pressure at blade le for the gf blade explains the enhanced tangential velocity and torque fig 10 to visualize the three dimensional vortical structures around the blade the q criterion q 5 5 10 6 s 2 isosurface coloured with velocity contour is shown in fig 15 the q value is given by the second invariant of velocity gradient tensor and expressed as 1 q 0 5 ω 2 s 2 where ω is the vorticity tensor and s is the shear strain rate tensor haller 2005 the value of q is positive when the vorticity dominates the shear strain rate tensor and it helps in visualization of the vortices in a flow field at fc 0 075 the tip leakage vortex and te vortex originates from the blade tip and te respectively and they are convected downstream the gf blade te vortex shows higher strength compared to the reference blade because of modified te flow behaviour due to protruding flaps the intensity of te vortex increases with fh in gf blades and it is consistent with the results shown in fig 13 the high strength vortices shed from gf increases the losses and reduces efficiency fig 9c as the fc increases the strength of vortical structures intensifies due to increased axial velocity and aoa the hub region experiences higher aoa compared to the tip owing to velocity variation caused by the rotational effects likewise at fc 0 225 a hub separation vortex appears on the hub ss for all blades with further increase in fc 0 275 the tip leakage vortex breakdowns due to adverse pressure gradient and interacts strongly with mainstream flow causing the blades to stall 5 conclusion the concept of gurney flap for the wells turbine performance was introduced and analysed using an opensource cfd code openfoam 4 0 the gurney flap with varying height 0 5 3 chord length was simulated to study its effect on wells turbine performance the important conclusions drawn are the gurney flap increased blade loading and the torque produced a pair of counter rotating vortex was generated behind the trailing edge that modified the trailing edge kutta condition which increased circulation and lift at a higher angle of attack the counter rotating vortex pair collapsed and aerodynamic benefit of the flap was diminished a flap height greater than 1 5 chord length advanced the stall and reduced the operating range the gurney flap blades showed reduced efficiency because of the increased pressure drop a flap of 0 5 chord length enhanced the relative average torque produced by 10 7 with a decrement in relative average efficiency by 4 7 before stall condition moreover a detailed study of the flap position and angle is recommended as future work acknowledgment the high speed computing facility provided by the indian institute of technology madras was gratefully acknowledged 
22629,a gurney flap gf placed at pressure side of the trailing edge of an airfoil and perpendicular to the chord line enhances lift in aircraft wings helicopter rotors and wind turbines etc in this article the gf concept was introduced for wells turbine blade used to harvest wave energy with special consideration as the blades are having symmetric airfoil and faces bidirectional flow hence the flap was extended to both pressure and suction sides of the trailing edge te to maintain blade symmetry and the turbine performance was evaluated using opensource computational fluid dynamics code openfoam 4 0 different gf lengths 0 5 3 chord length were considered and the performance parameters such as non dimensional torque pressure drop and efficiency were evaluated the gf blades produced a counter rotating vortex pair behind the te which modified the te kutta condition and increased the circulation and lift in addition the gf blades increased the blade loading and enhanced the torque

ocean wave energy is one of the renewable sources which is clean easily predictable and available throughout the year mustapa et al 2017 in recent years various countries have installed the pilot and technology demonstration wave energy plants around the world renewables 2018 however immature technology of the wave energy converters inhibits its commercial operation and dedicated research and development are required to make it economically viable there are various types of wave energy converter wec are available and the oscillating water column owc is one of the most commonly used and actively researched wec shalby et al 2018 the owc consists of a partially submerged concrete structure that provides an opening for the incoming wave the incoming wave compresses and expands the air above the air water interface which drives an air turbine falnes 2004 the wells turbine is one such kind of air turbine it comprises symmetric blades with zero twist placed perpendicular to the incoming flow and rotates in same direction irrespective of the airflow direction fig 1 shows the working principle of the turbine owing to the blade symmetry the tangential force component f t acts in the same direction for both the outgoing and the incoming flow this self rectifying feature is advantageous as it eliminates the need for guide vane and reduces design complexity however it suffers from noisy operation narrow operating range and reduced torque at low airflow rates falcão 2010 the flow separation at higher angle of attack causes stall and restricts power extraction the wells turbine is an actively researched turbine and a detailed study on the different parameters influencing its performance is reported by raghunathan 1995 for an in depth review of various works performed on wells turbine the readers can refer to the studies performed by shehata et al 2017a and cui et al 2019 many researchers adopted different design modifications to improve turbine performance table 1 provides a comprehensive list of important design modifications and their effects from table 1 we can conclude that improving torque coefficient and delaying stall are important to produce an increased power output on the other hand the gurney flap gf is a passive lift enhancement device that is used to improve the performance of wind turbines helicopters aircraft etc it is a small plate 1 2 c attached perpendicular to the pressure side ps of the trailing edge te the gf increases the circulation by deflecting the flow towards the ps and enhances lift fig 2 however it increases drag due to the modified wake flow liebeck 1978 experimentally studied newman airfoil with gf 1 25 c and reported that it enhanced lift and reduced drag the author suggested that the height of gf should be 1 2 c and the height 2 c increases the drag substantially many researchers studied the gf and its parameters to comprehend the underlying flow physics behind the lift enhancement jeffrey and hurst 1996 li et al 2007 maughmer and bramesfeld 2008 traub and freienmuth 2011 vieira et al 2013 graham et al 2017 according to literature the flap height fh should be less than the boundary layer thickness to achieve better performance the increase in fh enhances the lift up to a critical value and then advances stall the lift enhancement of gf is directly proportional to the fh porosity and inclination of the flap traub et al 2006 a detailed review of various gf applications and lift augmentation mechanisms can be found in the study of wang et al 2008 liu and montefort 2007 calculated the lift and pitch coefficients theoretically using classical thin airfoil theory they reported that the induced camber effect caused the lift enhancement owing to their aerodynamic benefits and simple design the gf finds application in many areas such as supercritical airfoils li et al 2007 delta wings li et al 2002 aircrafts zhang et al 2006 helicopters kentfield 1993 unmanned aerial vehicles agarwal et al 2009 flapping airfoils xie et al 2016 wind turbines bao et al 2000 tongchitpakdee et al 2006 holst et al 2017 bianchini et al 2019 axial fans chen et al 2018 and pumps thamsen et al 2015 etc the gf can either be applied on the suction side ss or both ps and ss based on the design constraints xie et al 2016 bianchini et al 2019 from the studies above it is evident that the gf has a huge prospective to augment the aerodynamic performance and its design primarily depends on the application type moreover no literature is available on using gfs to enhance the wells turbine performance in the light of gf s aerodynamic benefits it is worth considering it as a potential lift enhancement device to improve its performance however the gf should be implemented on both sides to preserve blade symmetry of wells turbine similarly xie et al 2016 encountered this problem in using gfs for flapping airfoil and employed gfs on both ps and ss to retain blade symmetry hence in this study the gf is applied on both sides and the fh is varied from 0 5 to 3 c to understand its effect on wells turbine performance the numerical simulations are performed using opensource cfd code openfoam and a detailed flow analysis has been presented to comprehend the influence of gf on aerodynamic behaviour of wells turbine 2 reference turbine and gf implementation the reference wells turbine geometry was adopted from the work of torresi et al 2008 and its specifications were provided in table 2 as discussed earlier the gf was applied on both ps and ss to maintain blade symmetry the gf was implemented by extending the te perpendicular to chord line on both sides symmetrically without altering the features of base airfoil in this study the gf height was varied from 0 5 to 3 c and the thickness of flap was fixed as 0 5 c fig 3 shows the reference airfoil and airfoil with gf on both sides 3 numerical methodology 3 1 computational domain the wells turbine is axisymmetric about the rotational axis hence to exploit its rotational symmetry a single blade with periodic interface was selected as the computational domain the single blade domain saves computational time and power the computational domain was extended by 4c and 6c along the upstream and downstream directions respectively the turbine blade rotates in a counter clockwise direction when viewed from the inlet in addition the x y and z axis represents the chordwise streamwise and spanwise directions respectively fig 4 shows the computational domain used in this study 3 2 mesh and boundary conditions the unstructured tetrahedral elements were generated using icem cfd 15 0 ansys 2012 as they consume less time for grid generation compared to the structured hexahedral elements to resolve the boundary layer region prism elements are created on the blade surface with a height ratio of 1 2 the first cell height was fixed as 0 01 mm to maintain the non dimensional wall distance y value less than 1 the grid was exported as fluent mesh from icem cfd ansys 2012 and later imported in openfoam greenshields 2015 using the fluent3dmeshtofoam command the quality of the imported mesh was checked by checkmesh command to analyse critical parameters like non orthogonality skewness aspect ratio and face pyramids etc fig 5 displays the meshed computational domain and the blade with prism layers regarding the boundary conditions the periodic interface is applied to the lateral faces through cyclic arbitrary mesh interface cyclicami and to implement it the neighbour patch rotational axis and centre were provided the hub shroud and blade were provided with no slip boundary whereas uniform axial velocity and zero pressure gradient were given at inlet zero velocity gradient and fixed pressure value of 0 were provided at the outlet additionally the inlet turbulence intensity was kept as 5 and the inlet axial velocity was varied from 4 to 18 m s with air as working fluid the problem was solved in a moving reference frame which realizes the turbine rotation without physically rotating it and the setbatch command assigns the specified cells to the rotating zone defined in mrfproperties file 3 3 turbulence model selection the wells turbine problem involves flow separation due to severe adverse pressure gradient and the k w shear stress transport sst model is more suitable for such problems it is a combined model that uses k w near the wall and k e away from the wall menter 1994 the openfoam offers implementation of k w sst as low and high reynolds re number model in low re number formulation the boundary layer region is resolved whereas the high re number model employs wall functions in this present study the k w sst was implemented as a low re model for better prediction of turbine performance in addition many researchers have successfully used the k w sst model to simulate the wells turbine problem halder et al 2015 nazeryan and lakzian 2018 gratton et al 2018 3 4 solver selection and numerical schemes the openfoam offers a variety of solvers based on the application type and an appropriate solver selection is crucial regarding the wells turbine the tip leakage flow behaviour is a very critical parameter and it affects performance significantly hence a three dimensional analysis was adopted in this study in addition the blade tip velocity based mach number is 0 19 which is less than 0 3 hence the flow was assumed to be incompressible gratton et al 2018 lately it has been shown that the hysteresis is caused by the compressibility effects of the owc chamber and not due to the dynamic effects of wells turbine ghisu et al 2015 2016 and 2017 hence the present problem was treated as a steady flow accordingly the simplefoam solver was chosen as it is suitable for the three dimensional steady and incompressible flow problems greenshields 2015 the consistent version of simple semi implicit method of pressure linked equations algorithm simplec simple consistent was used to realize the pressure velocity coupling holzmann 2016 all the gradient terms use second order central differencing gaussian integration for discretization excluding the velocity

and angle is recommended as future work acknowledgment the high speed computing facility provided by the indian institute of technology madras was gratefully acknowledged
