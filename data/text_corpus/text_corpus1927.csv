9635,salt accumulation in irrigated lands is an intercontinental environmental issue that adversely influences the sustainable land use agricultural land productivity and global food security with the higher level of groundwater table gwt and its increased mineralization global climate emergency in arid lands also obviously increase soil salinity ss in uzbekistan analyses of perennial data on saline agricultural lands were performed by principally depending on conventional outdated methods the integration of gis approach to map the widespread of gwt groundwater mineralization gwm and ss in irrigated lands of syrdarya province in uzbekistan were manipulated within the limited time period nevertheless in particular irrigated areas where gwt is shallow and highly mineralized insufficient scientific data and gwt maps created in accordance with gis based methods is identified restricting a better establishment of tracing the ss of irrigated land over time as gwt and gwm rise thus our study is to trace and delineate the dynamic and spatial changes in gwt gwm and ss caused by climate factors over 2000 2019 by integrating traditional research methods and cross validated gis methods in the example of irrigated land of syrdarya province in uzbekistan to reach this goal a fieldwork was organized and relying on the in situ data collected from around 3800 different points for soil sampling and 1500 observation wells for groundwater studies gis based maps were created for four last experimental years 2016 2019 using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation by comparing the idw maps with the in situ data an overall accuracy of maps per each variable was calculated and data from maps were quantified a statistical approach was applied to examine the interrelationship between gwt gwm ss and climatic factors such as seasonal air temperature and seasonal precipitation gwt and gwm are moderately correlated each other but these two variables are considered as the main drivers to the enlargement of saline irrigated areas in the province keywords groundwater table groundwater mineralization soil salinity climate change gis spatial interpolation idw correlation analysis data availability not applicable 1 introduction in our contemporary society soil salinization in irrigated lands is an intercontinental environmental issue that adversely influences the sustainable land use agricultural land productivity and global food security as a consequence of the primary and human induced salinization processes of irrigated soils reduced crop yields are commonly observed and this causes food insecurity in particular countries located with aridic climate kulmatov et al 2020 zewdu et al 2017 moreover the risk of soil salinization grows with reference to human induced factors and stressed economic and demographic growth thus decreasing in land quality in arid lands which are susceptible to climate change kovda 1949 1977 worldwide tierce of all irrigated land is mainly saline including over 100 countries with all types of climate zones particularly one billion hectares ha of irrigated land are diversely salt affected counting fewer than 80 million ha caused by anthropogenic activities soil salinization has a significantly adverse repercussion for the economic sector of semi arid regions sidike et al 2014 squires and glenn 2011 regarding the united nations facts approximately six million ha of irrigated land are nowadays and differently affected by soil salinization and over 40 of the total agricultural land worldwide is degraded because of unsustainable land reclamation practices foreshadowing irrigated land ill suited for land cultivation kulmatov 2014 pankova and konyushkova 2013 central asia due to its geo location is mainly in nature saline and is deemed a likely intimidation to the advances of human induced soil salinization processes conrad et al 2020 kovda 1980 liu et al 2020 salinization of irrigated arable lands is causing a significant impairment to agronomics in the semi arid regions of central asia specifically one third of 2 3 million ha in kazakhstan followed by over one tenth of 1 1 million ha of irrigated land in kyrgyz republic 16 1 of 720 000 ha in tajikistan 96 of 1 7 million ha in turkmenistan and in uzbekistan a significant part a half of 4 3 million ha is highly vulnerable to soil salinization shirokova and forkutsa 2000 however climatic variations and aridic hot climates obviously increase the risk of soil salinization in central asia as well due to a potentially high evaporation of mineralized shallow gwt ruzikulova et al 2021 furthermore in view of intensive irrigation secondary or human induced soil salinization jeopardizes the agricultural lands in such countries of the lower aral sea basin particularly in southern kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan hbirkou et al 2011 kitamura et al 2006 irrigated areas in the aral sea basin have expanded from 3 6 million to 8 5 million ha since the 1950 s a gradual usage of river water to irrigate and land owning practices in watersheds of syrdarya and amudarya rivers in central asia triggered the downturn of the regional ecosystem aydarov 1988 minashina 1970 2009 pankova 1981 the catastrophic shrinkage of the aral sea begat to a considerable reduction in the quality and quantity water resources in the catchment and a contravention of the regional ecosystem and water balance akramkhanov et al 2011 groll et al 2013 nowadays the total irrigated area of uzbekistan is nearly 4 3 million ha or 9 8 of the total territory roughly a half of the local water resources are principally utilized for agricultural purposes and other economic sectors unsustainable utilization of agricultural lands in uzbekistan in regards to insufficient scientific consultancy on agro technical requirements has caused increased groundwater table gwt and mineralization and salt contents of the soil the main reason behind this is using highly mineralized irrigation water inadequate maintenance and operation and non functional condition of drainage systems akramkhanov et al 2011 groll et al 2013 sabitova et al 2021 nevertheless in central asian countries a scientific significance of groundwater mineralization gwm is not completely considered in the impact assessment of groundwater on soil salinization thus rising highly mineralized gwt and increasing its chemical contents lead to the withdrawal of irrigated lands from agriculture and a reduction in land productivity kulmatov 2014 the agricultural sector is an integral part of economic well being of uzbekistan composing about 23 of the total gross domestic product and employing 27 of total population kulmatov et al 2020 mamatkulov et al 2021 irrigated agriculture brings out over 85 of the agricultural production and unsustainably utilizes over 80 of the transboundary water resources of uzbekistan annually matyakubov et al 2020 kulmatov 2014 opp et al 2017 nevertheless ascribable to the vast plain relief of majority agricultural areas of the aral sea basin countries uzbekistan possesses fairly less natural drainage system and extensive areas of conventional irrigation with highly mineralized surface and groundwater pankova and konyushkova 2013 besides that substantial utilization and mismanagement of agricultural lands in uzbekistan reason behind the non acquiescence with agro technical requirements and standards has caused gwt to rise and a high concentration of gwm kulmatov et al 2020 groll et al 2013 this in turn leads to soil salinization to higher spatial extent and soil degradation of the irrigated land ibrakhimov et al 2007 isaev et al 2020 karavanova et al 2001 teshaev et al 2020 yang et al 2019 2020 nowadays uzbekistan utilizes its 9 7 or just over 4 3 million ha of total territory for agricultural purposes and over 50 of the total irrigated land is diversely salt affected leading to a decrease in nationwide agricultural productivity i e 25 30 for raw cotton and endangering food and agro industry security at a country level alikhanov et al 2021 isaev et al 2020 jumanov et al 2020 kulmatov et al 2018 the increased and intensive reclamation of leached and runoff irrigation water and wide application of mineral fertilizers usually prevail these losses over kulmatov et al 2020 kulmatov et al 2021 opp et al 2017 teshaev et al 2020 aligning with the motives leading to soil salinity ss industrial urban and agricultural development have all becoming bestowed to the high risk of salinity and mineralization in rivers and groundwater however the likelihood of subsequent advances and climatic variations are undisclosed ivushkin et al 2017 mainly environmental imbalance is emanated from the human induced unsustainable land management amounting to 15 of an increase fu et al 2021 kulmatov et al 2021 nonetheless soil degradation and salinization are engendered by the susceptibility of the arid lands to climate change in uzbekistan in semi arid regions in the case of uzbekistan rising gwt and gwm change processes are not adequately considered in the study of groundwater as a leading factor to ss choudhury et al 2001 rakhmatullaev et al 2012 thus rising mineralized gwt and an increase in its total dissolved solids beget the dismantling of agricultural land and downgrading its quality and productivity level which is often adjudicated by agricultural experts and specialists hbirkou et al 2011 the mineral contents of groundwater could be managed by superintending the hydraulic gradient the geological conditions of the area and the irrigation and runoff water seeped through subsurface in irrigated lands gerts and juliev 2020 li et al 2019 throughout assessing gwm according to its chemical contents cation elements as na mg k and ca and anionic compounds as no3 hco3 so4 and cl electrical conductivity ec and ph values are mostly taken into account moussa and kamel 2009 thus requiring regular hydrogeological and hydrochemical studies in the larger scale alternatively with the higher gwt and its increased mineralization climatic variations and aridic climates naturally elevate ss in uzbekistan as well due to the inflated evaporation rate of mineralized groundwater gorji et al 2015 ibrakhimov et al 2019 nationwide weakly saline soils account for 30 following by moderately saline soils 16 and severely saline soils 4 of the total irrigated land moreover 95 of the irrigated land in khorezm province 95 in syrdarya province 87 in bukhara province 87 in navoi province 79 in jizakh province and 78 in the republic of karakalpakstan is saline kulmatov et al 2021 moa 2020 mowr 2021 teshaev et al 2020 recent studies revealed that the amalgamation of conventional methods and geo informational systems gis techniques is an efficacious instrument in tracking tracing assessing and monitoring ss and spatial mapping gwt and gwm alikhanov et al 2020 jagannathan 1996 as gis techniques advance data handling supplementary in situ fieldwork results enabling to validate and corroborate the accuracy of gis based results jagannathan 1996 solomon and quiel 2006 these days gis technologies are far apart applied in detecting and evaluating soil salinity in irrigated areas and mapping such qualitative data i e gwt and gwm which are underivable through gis itself this wide application endorses to derive exceptional results and these results are an important core of research in the accurate mapping li et al 2018 a number of experts and scientists from well developed and developing countries have investigated and determined the interrelationship between the ss gwt and gwm climatic and other anthropogenic factors by using gis based approaches i e spatial interpolation vegetation and salinity indices ibrakhimov et al 2019 kulmatov et al 2020 consequently the ongoing soil salinization process under climate change in irrigated land with rising gwt and gwm has been examined to a great extent and evidentially adequate scientific findings have been procured and vindicated furthermore the gis approaches applied in these investigations were likely to provide the intended results while recapitulating in such other areas akin to the geomorphology of the area of study ivushkin et al 2019 nayak et al 2015 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2013 from local perspective in uzbekistan eshchanov 2008 ibrakhimov 2004 pulatov et al 2020 ibrakhimov et al 2018 and sultanov et al 2019 also applied gis approaches in the analysis and assessment of gwt gwm and ss within certain limits the main limitations were pinpointed as a deficiency of experts in the field of geo informatics and confined proper methodology towards mapping these three variables gwt gwm and ss besides that researchers tend to keep relying on traditional in field approaches on mapping in these studies three gis based tools inverse distance weighting idw spline and kriging were potentially tested and exerted to map the spatial changes of variables in a short period all of these three tools were compared each other as a matter of accurate mapping as a consequence kriging method revealed second acceptable results in mapping interpolated gwt whereas the idw method magnificently mapped all variables regarding the results of these studies the spline method had the highest error in mapping all variables and kriging was the second appropriate option for mapping gwt both are not strongly encouraged to apply mapping these three variables and instead the idw is highly recommended to use in the context of uzbekistan kulmatov et al 2021 conforming to the literature review results above the analysis of perennial data on soil salinity in uzbekistan was conducted by mainly depending on conventional outdated methods besides that gis approaches to map three variables gwt gwm and ss were applied under the limited time period only one year and system boundary at a district level these studies only focused on the cross validation of gis maps however the accuracy of these maps set beyond the scope yet in such areas where the gwt is close and highly mineralized there is an insufficient scientific data and maps created in accordance with gis techniques monitoring soil salinity in the agricultural land over time as gwt rise another limitation of these studies was that the impact of climatic factors on the dynamic changes of gwt gwm and ss was insufficiently pondered considering these weaknesses implementing perennial data analyses expanding the spatial extent undertaking the accuracy assessment of gis maps the impact assessment of climatic factors and the deeper extent of the interrelationship between gwt gwm and ss could be the novel aspects of this research which can cover above mentioned limitations therefore the first objective of this paper is to analyze and map the dynamic and spatial changes in gwt gwm and ss under climatic factors over 20 years 2000 2019 aligning with this the second objective is to integrate traditional research methods and accuracy validated gis methods in the example of irrigated land of syrdarya province in uzbekistan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area uzbekistan is one of the arid countries located in central asia sandwiched between the syr darya and the amu darya rivers the area of uzbekistan is 447 400 km2 and around 10 of this area is allocated for agricultural purposes plain deserts large valleys foothills and mountainous regions epitomize the topography of uzbekistan since the geo location of uzbekistan is classified as an arid zone dry and continental weather is observed at any time of the year aslanov et al 2021 khasanov 2019 uzbekistan boasts a distinctive climate and weather condition composing of dry long and exceptionally hot summers humid and cool falls and extremely cold winters kulmatov et al 2021 the average countrywide air temperature in the hottest summer time july is 29 c whilst the average winter air temperature is 2 c in january sum of the precipitation is averaged as 424 mm according to the perennial observation data from 2000 to 2019 kulmatov et al 2021 liu et al 2020 syrdarya province as our study area is one of the main agroeconomically important provinces located in central uzbekistan on the left bank of the syrdarya river the province is a semi arid area ascribed to its local climate and likely to become susceptible to soil salinization risk the province shares borders with tajikistan kazakhstan and jizakh and tashkent provinces of uzbekistan fig 1 syrdarya province lies on an area of around 4300 km2 and the steppe of mirzachul takes a significant portion of the province platonov and karimov 2015 as of december 2019 the territory of irrigated land of the syrdarya province outnumbers 287 200 ha or 70 6 of the provincial area chernishov 2019 soils of irrigated land are mainly anthrosols technosols solonchaks arenosols and cambisols these soils have relatively low organic matter content on average 1 0 with reserves of nearly 40 tons ha kulmatov et al 2021 syrdarya province is split into eight administrative districts saykhunabad sirdarya khovost gulistan boyout mirzaabad sardoba and akaltin districts chernishov 2019 scsru 2020 the climate of the province is a typically semi aridic continental distinguished by hot and dry summers atmospheric precipitation mostly falls in winter and spring seasons and it is not a primary source of irrigation a parching wind garmsil frequently blows and evaporates the actual soil moisture inauspiciously decelerating plant development chernishov 2019 and increasing evaporation rate of groundwater kulmatov et al 2020 kulmatov et al 2021 according to uzhydromet uzhydromet 2020 the average annual air temperature was 14 9 c the main rationale why we study the climate of this province is that the local meteorological conditions directly influence gwt and gwm jeopardizing soils of irrigated areas under the risk of secondary salinization 2 2 data provision since 1991 gwm and gwt in irrigated areas of syrdarya province has been systematically surveilled by the hydrological and geological reclamation expedition of syrdarya province hgresp under the ministry of water resources from about 1500 observation wells lsbais 2020 hgresp usually undertakes this monitoring in each quartile of the year regarding the ss the cadaster agency under the subsidiary of the state committee for tax former the state committee for land resources geodesy cartography and state cadaster and hgresp are the key organizations responsible for monitoring and conducting in situ expeditions to assess the actual state of soil in terms of ss since 1994 these two organizations perform this assessment twice per annum in the beginning of vegetation period of the country spring april and in end the period autumn october these monitoring and assessment results went beyond the use for scientific and political purposes as these data left just in official tables hence these collected perennial numerical data from official tables on three variables from 2000 to 2019 were used as a primary data in this article it is important to note that the authors of this article also took a role in the fieldwork in 2019 and 2020 as of october 2019 2020 groundwater and soil samples were taken from coordinated 3800 points and 1500 wells on average respectively in each year from 287 200 ha of irrigated lands in syrdarya province groundwater samples were taken away from two different wells one for shallow groundwater 0 3 m and another one for comparatively deep groundwater 3 m in the region while soil samples were extracted from 0 to 30 cm 30 70 cm and 70 100 cm of soil layer along with 11 200 soil samples in total to determine gwm and ss in the laboratory condition in our study soil samples taken from 0 to 30 cm and 30 70 cm of soil layer were analyzed in regards to soil samples from 70 to 100 cm depth they were omitted in reasonable cases seeing that these samples do not contribute to the overall results of a sampling point 2 3 methodology the primary gwt gwm and ss tabular data were principally examined from 2000 to 2015 and to formalize the accuracy of gis methods by juxtaposing with the primary tabular data the maps depicting the space time changes of three variables for 2016 2019 were created these maps were hinged on concurrent measurements extracted from groundwater monitoring wells and soil sampling points in the province the distance between wells and soil sampling points was unevenly distributed ranging from 500 to 1000 m since this study targets mapping the dynamic spatial changes of classified gwt gwm and ss in irrigated lands of syrdarya province the classification tables below were given table 1 these three variables were perceived to be hypothetically inseparable related each other and significantly depend on following factors as irrigation and land practice soil properties drainage efficiency crop type and critical depth gwt greater than 3 m was proven safe in terms of ss followed by gwt with 2 3 m weakly unsafe 1 5 2 m moderately unsafe 1 1 5 m severely unsafe and 0 1 m extremely unsafe in the conditions of uzbekistan such scientists categorized gwm in irrigated areas of uzbekistan by determining the chloride cl concentration which does not adversely affect the crop growth and development throughout the entire vegetation period table 1 akramkhanov et al 2008 akramkhanov and vlek 2012 since 2006 during the field expedition the ss has been determined in soil pastes using a digital conductometer thermometer hereinafter ec meter progress 1 t akramkhanov et al 2011 2014 kulmatov et al 2021 this instrument is relatively common and easy to use in fieldwork according to its gauzy weight simple ordinary structure and convenient orientation of electronic components besides that a manual drill was employed for soil sampling in some conditions in which soil was unduly compact to sample rhoades and chanduvi 1999 pinpointed that values of ss for irrigated lands identified by ec meter were served for classifying ss to determine the extent to which the total dissolvent salts do not adversely influence crop yield within the whole growing season table 2 the vector based maps which illustrate gwm gwt and ss maps for irrigated lands of syrdarya province were created with the idw interpolation method by using arcgis 10 6 software esri 2018 why we selected this method was that idw runs a straightforward mathematical circuitry formed by statistical modeling representing the data generating process lakshmi 2020 souza et al 2020 this process in turn is reasonably efficient in this research by its void filling ability and outliers between groundwater wells and soil sampling points ibrakhimov 2004 ibrakhimov et al 2018 eshchanov 2008 sultanov et al 2019 and pulatov et al 2020 claimed that the minimum errors in creating gwt gwm and ss maps were observed by using the idw method the results derived in the afore emphasized investigations and studies proved that the idw interpolation method provides appropriate results when adequate information was uploaded eshchanov 2008 ibrakhimov 2004 considering this aspect as it was biased that the idw method also does not show a perfect output with 100 accuracy the overall accuracy of created idw maps of irrigated areas was ascertained by comparing our quantified tabular gis based results with official tabular data once the accuracy of interpolated maps was evaluated statistical analysis was undertaken to discern the actual relationship between three variables gwt gwm and ss and the extent to which climate factors annual average seasonal air temperature and annual seasonal precipitation influence spatial distribution dynamics of gwt gwm and ss perennial climate data from three meteo stations located in syrdarya province were derived as an open source from the center of hydro meteorological service of uzbekistan uzhydromet 2020 and the annual data from these three meteo stations were triangulated to determine the unique average value as a potential tool to show the correlation in statistics a simple pearson s correlation and a linear regression analysis were performed to perceive the actual dependence using r studio program edelmann et al 2021 rstudio team 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 3 1 changing dynamics of gwt gwm and ss over 2000 2015 years in irrigated lands of syrdarya province 3 1 1 groundwater table dynamics regarding the obtained in field data on gwt the irrigated areas with gwt 1 0 m were almost not detected in syrdarya province within 15 years moreover the irrigated land with gwt 1 0 1 5 m expanded by 7 6 or 21 846 ha of the total irrigated area of the province by 2003 compared to 0 25 703 ha in 2008 and 0 73 2050 ha as of 2015 the area with gwt 1 5 2 0 m accounted for 20 2 58 526 ha in 2000 followed by 36 7 106 215 ha peaking in 2004 and 18 9 52 881 ha as of 2015 likewise the irrigated area with gwt 2 0 3 0 m outnumbered 64 8 187 389 ha in 2000 then reached its peak by 72 3 210 991 ha in 2011 and 65 7 190 210 ha as of 2015 returning its starting point lastly irrigated areas in the province with gwt 3 m was 11 44 33 172 ha in 2000 4 5 13 059 ha in 2007 and peaking by 14 66 41 061 ha as of 2015 fig 2 irrigated areas with gwt 2 0 3 0 m reduced by 7801 ha in 2015 comparing to the recorded point in 2014 this could be explained that the dependence of irrigation water outflow by drainage water from irrigated lands in these administrative districts was sufficiently high last but not least irrigated land areas with gwt 3 0 m in the study area rose by 4297 ha in contrast to the results in 2014 which was considered as an adequate improvement sign these dynamic changes in gwt over years are assumed to be caused by unsustainable management of land resources and irrigation water as these results identify the area of gwt closer to the surface leading to ss these irrigated areas are needed to be reconsidered to utilize them for growing halophyte plants in regards to gwt as a matter of soil salinity gwt 2 3 m is considered expedient and safe interestingly such irrigated areas with gwt 2 3 m in syrdarya province took place in nearly 66 8 of the total area this is a satisfactory indicator theoretically gwt 1 m straightforwardly accelerates soil salinization processes because of solonchak soil texture in this study area wang et al 2020 potentially the severe levels of ss were occurred in such circumstances in which groundwater is close to the soil surface thus monitoring the dynamic changes in gwt to investigate the salinization processes in irrigated lands is essential 3 1 2 groundwater mineralization dynamics according to the detailed fieldwork results on gwm over the period of 2000 2015 approximately 41 of the total irrigated area in the study area was mainly consisted of gwm 3 5 g l irrigated lands with gwm 1 3 g l constituted nearly 85 441 ha 20 2 in 2000 and there was a remarkable increase to 125 211 ha or 30 1 of the total irrigated land of the province in 2015 reaching the endpoint of the gwm 3 5 g l line fig 2 the increase in the irrigated land with gwm 1 3 g l led to an overabundant decrease by around 51 in the irrigated area with gwm 5 10 g l and this is regarded as a magnificent indicator the trend for the irrigated lands with gwm 0 1 g l were remained almost unchanged however the irrigated areas with gwm 10 g l were exceptionally unpredictable over the period this unpredictability was mainly perceived to observe in such bare irrigated lands where the evaporation rate was potentially and comparatively high due to the global change of climate nevertheless this does not influence gwm 0 1 g l significantly where gwt is deeper thus remaining almost stable over time 3 1 3 soil salinity dynamics according to the long term ss data classified for irrigated lands in syrdarya province about 62 of the total irrigated land of the study area was mainly composed of weakly saline areas throughout 2000 2015 non saline irrigated lands were just under 4000 ha 1 1 in 2000 followed by escalating to 7500 ha 2 in 2015 once the moderately saline irrigated areas have experienced an abrupt decrease by nearly 51 044 ha 17 4 these areas occupied 47 205 ha 16 4 in 2015 this decrease indicating a significant effect size is an affirmative indicator in the beginning period of the experiment the severely saline areas widespread on 23 085 ha 8 4 and experienced a considerable reduction in the last 15 years to just under 5000 ha 1 6 in 2015 fig 2 despite having a negligible spatial change in the areas of gwt 3 m and gwm 0 1 g l during 15 years non saline irrigated land magnified twofold this meant that changing dynamics of salt affected areas is logically correlated to its two drivers namely gwt and gwm howbeit other land reclamation and agro technical measures i e the proper and sustainable establishment of salt leaching crop rotation and conservation agriculture are highly encouraged to apply in time 3 2 mapping gwt gwm and ss in the irrigated areas of syrdarya province by using gis from 2016 to 2019 3 2 1 gis maps for groundwater table groundwater mineralization and soil salinity gis is nowadays one of the most time efficient and innovative technologies to remotely monitor the environmental changes groll et al 2013 however in some cases a number of studies were undertaken by kulmatov 2014 kulmatov et al 2020 rashid kulmatov et al 2021 and kulmatov et al 2021 on the hydrology of groundwater in bukhara and navoi provinces using conventional approaches without gis tools to map the dynamic changes in contrast to these studies this research depicts the gis maps of differently classified gwt gwm and ss widespread per administrative districts of syrdarya province for the past four years fig 3 the advances of gis tools and techniques accurately and adequately exemplifies the differently classified gwm gwt and ss distribution in irrigated lands of the study area above hinged on the accurate and available primary data regarding fig 5 below created by idw interpolation irrigated areas with gwt 2 3 m and 3 m were eye catching and could virtually be detected such irrigated areas with gwt 1 2 m could be mainly observed in the eastern part of the study area whereas the irrigated areas with gwt below 1 m were negligibly mapped with respect to the gwm results the irrigated lands with gwm 0 1 g l could be spotted easily in eyes only in 2018 in the other experimental years such areas were barely visible on the idw maps because of negligible low dynamic values similar to the gwm results the non saline areas could be virtually and easily distinguished from other ss levels in 2018 throughout 2016 2019 weakly saline irrigated lands preoccupied as large areas as other ss levels while the moderately and severely saline irrigated areas gradually dwindled the idw maps were afterwards quantified considering each class of three variables and interpreted in ha next these hectares were collated with the official in situ tabular data obtained from above mentioned responsible organizations lsbais 2020 consequently the idw based gwt maps acquired an accuracy of 91 4 with p 0 001 following by gwm 84 1 p 0 00003 and ss 76 7 p 0 0006 furthermore the root mean square error of created idw maps with power 2 was 0 03 for gwt 0 04 for gwm and 0 06 for ss this rendered a robust evidence for the wide application of the idw interpolation method as a gis based approach to map gwt gwm and ss this resemblance can be discerned in the results of such investigations and studies conducted in mirzaabad district of syrdarya province khorezm and navoi provinces of uzbekistan pulatov et al 2020 eshchanov 2008 ibrakhimov 2004 ibrakhimov et al 2018 kulmatov et al 2021 sultanov et al 2019 however the exact accuracy of official data is not particularly discussed since it has the governmental significance and we deem these data is correctly formed under in depth field surveys the accuracy of maps we derived is relative to the official data 3 2 2 idw based trends corresponding to the years of 2016 2019 the idw based results of each variable are given in the graphs for the remaining experimental years 2016 2019 as an annex to fig 2 above overall trends for the irrigated areas with gwt 0 1 m and 2 3 m were almost stable after 2015 occupying over 200 ha 0 01 of province s total irrigated area ptia and 191 017 ha 66 ptia in 2019 however in the irrigated lands with the rest three classes of gwt 1 1 5 m 1 5 2 m and above 3 m the trends were generally fluctuated regarding the irrigated areas with gwt 1 5 2 and 2 3 m there were upward trends taking up extra 6000 20 of ptia and 2000 ha 0 015 of ptia in 2019 respectively interestingly the irrigated areas with gwt 3 m experienced a steep decrease by 35 000 ha 19 8 of ptia in 2019 fig 4 whereas lines for gwm 1 3 g l and 3 5 g l of irrigated lands were almost united in the late 2015 the irrigated lands with gwm 1 3 g l over four year time period rose significantly and outnumbered almost 190 000 ha 47 7 of ptia inclinations corresponding to the other classes of gwm have practically reinstated to 2016 despite having some fluctuations over four years irrigated areas with gwm 0 1 g l reached its acme point with about 22 047 ha 5 7 of ptia in 2018 and returned to an unnoticeable rate in 2019 fig 4 while the lines which show non saline and severely saline irrigated lands until the post 2015 were proportionately stable these lines increased slowly and constituted around 9100 ha 3 1 of ptia in the end of the period the increasingly growing weakly saline irrigated lands slightly reduced whereas moderately saline irrigated lands almost unchanged until 2019 taking place in approximately 220 500 ha 77 2 of ptia and 51 400 ha 17 6 of ptia respectively fig 4 3 3 correlation and regression analysis 3 3 1 correlation analysis between groundwater table groundwater mineralization soil salinity and climatic factors global climate change impact on water management and regional hydrology of the syrdarya river basin is immensely complex glacier masses in the syrdarya river basin melted around 14 of the total amount within the last 50 years and roughly 20 45 of them is predicted to perish in the adjacent 50 years immerzeel et al 2012 siegfried et al 2012 thus the wise and sustainable groundwater utilization in syrdarya province is deemed to lessen the risk of water shortage in agriculture simultaneously regular monitoring of the climatic effects on gwm and gwt and the influence of these variables on ss is exceptionally important in this case wang et al 2020 average annual seasonal air temperature each for 2000 2019 years in summer june july august and winter december january february and annual seasonal precipitation were considered in this research as climatic factors this is due to as air temperature increases logically and undeniably the shallow groundwater in irrigated lands evaporates correspondingly and its mineralization increases proportionally with reference to the dissolvent solids in soil ibrakhimov et al 2007 kulmatov et al 2020 besides that the groundwater salt concentration remains and could accumulate in the soil surface akramkhanov et al 2011 moreover precipitation has undeniably a direct effect on the dynamic changes in gwm gwt and ss precipitation seeps into groundwater throughout rainy seasons reducing the actual mineralization level kulmatov et al 2020 and contributes to salt leaching in the soil surface of irrigated areas this happens to reduce certain agricultural lands with higher gwm and particular severe salt concentrations in soils several statistical analyzes in uzbekistan were undertaken by kulmatov et al 2020 groll et al 2013 to test the climate factor impacts on the surface water mineralization and ss of irrigated lands in navoi province within this research the average perennial air temperature and atmospheric precipitation were taken climate factors the results of this research proved that climate parameters were correlated weakly to the mineralization of surface water 20 and ss 15 below could be discerned that how gwt gwm and ss are interrelated each other and along with that average seasonal air temperature and precipitation influence preponderating of these variables fig 5 referring to the data of fig 5 regarding gwt rising groundwater is mainly due to capillarity of soil and precipitation in many cases 0 50 however as air temperature in summer and winter increases gwt is kept lower assuming that is due to the high rate of groundwater evaporation gwt also accelerates soil salinization processes since where there is a deeper gwt lower risk of ss engrossingly gwt is in most cases unrelated to gwm and precipitation in winter 0 2 gwm manifested a relative weak correlation with the average air temperature in both seasons and the regional precipitation 0 3 logically and evidentially the mineralization contents of groundwater surge the salinization processes of soil up and strongly correlated with each level of ss in many cases another point is evidenced that climate change influences to extend irrigated lands with gwm 5 10 g l and gwm 10 g l as a rise in air temperature naturally causes a negative change in gwm of irrigated lands due to evaporation this could be presumed that the irrigated land with such gwm classes are comparatively enlarged because of existing soluble surface minerals in the soil texture with respect to ss the change in non saline agricultural lands mainly relies on precipitation and annual average seasonal air temperature weak saline irrigated land depends on the seasonal air temperature in summer as well as reveals insignificant dependence on precipitation in summer evidentially climate change has a potential impact on the change in moderately saline agricultural lands these areas also change commensurately while seasonal air temperature increases the reason behind climate factors within the correlation analysis the dependence of severely saline areas on average seasonal air temperature is ascertained yet such saline areas are not dependent on atmospheric precipitation in summer at all but precipitation in winter 3 3 2 specific regression models for groundwater table groundwater mineralization and soil salinity in the simple regression graphs below the interrelation between the classes of gwt gwm and ss was examined the main task for illustrating these graphs is to obtain a deeper insight into the key leading classes of gwt and gwm to ss since in the previous sub section no significant correlation was found between gwt and gwm however in many cases such gwm classes were particularly observed in such gwt levels which were not recorded with reference to the other gwt levels thus the same regression model results for gwt and gwm is given below fig 6 making reference to fig 6 gwm 0 1 g l could be infrequently found in such irrigated lands where gwt is higher than 2 m r2 0 52 fig 6a however gwm with 1 3 g l is mostly identified where gwt 1 5 2 m r2 0 68 and partially might appear in irrigated lands with gwt 2 m and deeper fig 6b moving onto fig 6c there was almost a negligible correlation between gwm 3 5 g l and gwt 0 1 m r2 0 5 but fairly no correlation with gwt higher than 1 m gwm 5 10 and 10 g l could be detected in such irrigated areas with gwt 0 1 m r2 0 63 and in many cases with gwt 1 1 5 m r2 0 64 figs 6d and 6e according to these results it is assumed that as the mineralization contents of groundwater increases the higher gwm can be found in the shallow gwt as it was perceived that in the case of syrdarya province higher gwm is one of potential leading factor to soil salinization considering this a simple regression model was simulated to test the specific correlation between gwm classes and ss degrees and the results are given in fig 7 below as can be distinguished from the figure above saline irrigated lands extension did not correspond to gwm 0 5 g l figs 7a 7b and 7c in regards to gwm 5 10 g l weak moderate and severe soil salinity mainly occurs in irrigated areas with such gwm and in some cases these kinds of gwm could possibly accelerate the extension of weakly saline irrigated lands fig 7d as identified that there is no effect of gwm 10 g l on the extension of saline irrigated areas fig 7e another factor gwt is also seemed to become an inherent driver leading to salinization of the irrigated area for this reason to gain an understanding of the specific interrelation between gwt and ss the following regression graph was plotted fig 8 by scrutinizing the figure above in the irrigated areas with a shallow gwt 0 1 m none of weakly moderately and severely saline soils could be observed fig 8a however gwt 1 1 5 m has a negligible impact on the extension of weakly saline irrigated land fig 8b irrigated areas with gwt 1 5 2 m were found to insignificantly contribute to the widespread of saline soils fig 8c but gwt 2 3 m has a trivial effect on the extension of weakly saline irrigated land r2 0 5 fig 8d lastly irrigated areas with gwt 3 m were not correlated to the extension of any degrees of ss in the province fig 8e these all identified relationships are perceived due to the aridic high evaporation rate which dries up the shallow groundwater thus causing the higher degrees of ss to widespread in the study area 4 conclusions this paper investigated the mapping techniques relying on the in situ data collected to provide potential risky and susceptible areas to higher gwt gwm and ss the integration of gis technologies can accurately map these three variables as well as enabling the gis based results obtained to become practical and scientific significant encapsulating the results of mapping taking into account the existing occurred errors of created idw maps for gwt gwm and ss respectively in the formulation of measures is strongly advocated when our used and validated idw interpolation method is applied in practice either in this province or in such semi aridic region as the core of this research is the ss assessment and identification of the contribution of gwt and gwm to ss it is assumed that the widespread of differently classified ss levels in agricultural areas of sirdarya province causes a decrease in land quality and productivity even though non saline irrigated lands in the study area expanded trivially in the past 20 years such areas now account for 5 9 of ptia in total it is perceived that the province composes mainly of weakly 54 9 moderately 32 8 saline irrigated areas and a relative reduction in ss by carrying out science based agro technical work is achievable in this circumstance the idw maps are highly encouraged to utilize in ss monitoring of the province to decide on and to place crop species and to develop practical and scientific inputs on soil amelioration summarizing the results of correlation and regression analysesthe climate change impact was considerably related to the dynamic changes in salinity level of irrigated areas whereas an increase in air temperature proportionally changes salinity levels of irrigated lands because of potential evaporation of highly mineralized groundwater from the shallow groundwater level the effect of high atmospheric precipitation on ss is not observed in our study funding not applicable ethics

9635,salt accumulation in irrigated lands is an intercontinental environmental issue that adversely influences the sustainable land use agricultural land productivity and global food security with the higher level of groundwater table gwt and its increased mineralization global climate emergency in arid lands also obviously increase soil salinity ss in uzbekistan analyses of perennial data on saline agricultural lands were performed by principally depending on conventional outdated methods the integration of gis approach to map the widespread of gwt groundwater mineralization gwm and ss in irrigated lands of syrdarya province in uzbekistan were manipulated within the limited time period nevertheless in particular irrigated areas where gwt is shallow and highly mineralized insufficient scientific data and gwt maps created in accordance with gis based methods is identified restricting a better establishment of tracing the ss of irrigated land over time as gwt and gwm rise thus our study is to trace and delineate the dynamic and spatial changes in gwt gwm and ss caused by climate factors over 2000 2019 by integrating traditional research methods and cross validated gis methods in the example of irrigated land of syrdarya province in uzbekistan to reach this goal a fieldwork was organized and relying on the in situ data collected from around 3800 different points for soil sampling and 1500 observation wells for groundwater studies gis based maps were created for four last experimental years 2016 2019 using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation by comparing the idw maps with the in situ data an overall accuracy of maps per each variable was calculated and data from maps were quantified a statistical approach was applied to examine the interrelationship between gwt gwm ss and climatic factors such as seasonal air temperature and seasonal precipitation gwt and gwm are moderately correlated each other but these two variables are considered as the main drivers to the enlargement of saline irrigated areas in the province keywords groundwater table groundwater mineralization soil salinity climate change gis spatial interpolation idw correlation analysis data availability not applicable 1 introduction in our contemporary society soil salinization in irrigated lands is an intercontinental environmental issue that adversely influences the sustainable land use agricultural land productivity and global food security as a consequence of the primary and human induced salinization processes of irrigated soils reduced crop yields are commonly observed and this causes food insecurity in particular countries located with aridic climate kulmatov et al 2020 zewdu et al 2017 moreover the risk of soil salinization grows with reference to human induced factors and stressed economic and demographic growth thus decreasing in land quality in arid lands which are susceptible to climate change kovda 1949 1977 worldwide tierce of all irrigated land is mainly saline including over 100 countries with all types of climate zones particularly one billion hectares ha of irrigated land are diversely salt affected counting fewer than 80 million ha caused by anthropogenic activities soil salinization has a significantly adverse repercussion for the economic sector of semi arid regions sidike et al 2014 squires and glenn 2011 regarding the united nations facts approximately six million ha of irrigated land are nowadays and differently affected by soil salinization and over 40 of the total agricultural land worldwide is degraded because of unsustainable land reclamation practices foreshadowing irrigated land ill suited for land cultivation kulmatov 2014 pankova and konyushkova 2013 central asia due to its geo location is mainly in nature saline and is deemed a likely intimidation to the advances of human induced soil salinization processes conrad et al 2020 kovda 1980 liu et al 2020 salinization of irrigated arable lands is causing a significant impairment to agronomics in the semi arid regions of central asia specifically one third of 2 3 million ha in kazakhstan followed by over one tenth of 1 1 million ha of irrigated land in kyrgyz republic 16 1 of 720 000 ha in tajikistan 96 of 1 7 million ha in turkmenistan and in uzbekistan a significant part a half of 4 3 million ha is highly vulnerable to soil salinization shirokova and forkutsa 2000 however climatic variations and aridic hot climates obviously increase the risk of soil salinization in central asia as well due to a potentially high evaporation of mineralized shallow gwt ruzikulova et al 2021 furthermore in view of intensive irrigation secondary or human induced soil salinization jeopardizes the agricultural lands in such countries of the lower aral sea basin particularly in southern kazakhstan turkmenistan and uzbekistan hbirkou et al 2011 kitamura et al 2006 irrigated areas in the aral sea basin have expanded from 3 6 million to 8 5 million ha since the 1950 s a gradual usage of river water to irrigate and land owning practices in watersheds of syrdarya and amudarya rivers in central asia triggered the downturn of the regional ecosystem aydarov 1988 minashina 1970 2009 pankova 1981 the catastrophic shrinkage of the aral sea begat to a considerable reduction in the quality and quantity water resources in the catchment and a contravention of the regional ecosystem and water balance akramkhanov et al 2011 groll et al 2013 nowadays the total irrigated area of uzbekistan is nearly 4 3 million ha or 9 8 of the total territory roughly a half of the local water resources are principally utilized for agricultural purposes and other economic sectors unsustainable utilization of agricultural lands in uzbekistan in regards to insufficient scientific consultancy on agro technical requirements has caused increased groundwater table gwt and mineralization and salt contents of the soil the main reason behind this is using highly mineralized irrigation water inadequate maintenance and operation and non functional condition of drainage systems akramkhanov et al 2011 groll et al 2013 sabitova et al 2021 nevertheless in central asian countries a scientific significance of groundwater mineralization gwm is not completely considered in the impact assessment of groundwater on soil salinization thus rising highly mineralized gwt and increasing its chemical contents lead to the withdrawal of irrigated lands from agriculture and a reduction in land productivity kulmatov 2014 the agricultural sector is an integral part of economic well being of uzbekistan composing about 23 of the total gross domestic product and employing 27 of total population kulmatov et al 2020 mamatkulov et al 2021 irrigated agriculture brings out over 85 of the agricultural production and unsustainably utilizes over 80 of the transboundary water resources of uzbekistan annually matyakubov et al 2020 kulmatov 2014 opp et al 2017 nevertheless ascribable to the vast plain relief of majority agricultural areas of the aral sea basin countries uzbekistan possesses fairly less natural drainage system and extensive areas of conventional irrigation with highly mineralized surface and groundwater pankova and konyushkova 2013 besides that substantial utilization and mismanagement of agricultural lands in uzbekistan reason behind the non acquiescence with agro technical requirements and standards has caused gwt to rise and a high concentration of gwm kulmatov et al 2020 groll et al 2013 this in turn leads to soil salinization to higher spatial extent and soil degradation of the irrigated land ibrakhimov et al 2007 isaev et al 2020 karavanova et al 2001 teshaev et al 2020 yang et al 2019 2020 nowadays uzbekistan utilizes its 9 7 or just over 4 3 million ha of total territory for agricultural purposes and over 50 of the total irrigated land is diversely salt affected leading to a decrease in nationwide agricultural productivity i e 25 30 for raw cotton and endangering food and agro industry security at a country level alikhanov et al 2021 isaev et al 2020 jumanov et al 2020 kulmatov et al 2018 the increased and intensive reclamation of leached and runoff irrigation water and wide application of mineral fertilizers usually prevail these losses over kulmatov et al 2020 kulmatov et al 2021 opp et al 2017 teshaev et al 2020 aligning with the motives leading to soil salinity ss industrial urban and agricultural development have all becoming bestowed to the high risk of salinity and mineralization in rivers and groundwater however the likelihood of subsequent advances and climatic variations are undisclosed ivushkin et al 2017 mainly environmental imbalance is emanated from the human induced unsustainable land management amounting to 15 of an increase fu et al 2021 kulmatov et al 2021 nonetheless soil degradation and salinization are engendered by the susceptibility of the arid lands to climate change in uzbekistan in semi arid regions in the case of uzbekistan rising gwt and gwm change processes are not adequately considered in the study of groundwater as a leading factor to ss choudhury et al 2001 rakhmatullaev et al 2012 thus rising mineralized gwt and an increase in its total dissolved solids beget the dismantling of agricultural land and downgrading its quality and productivity level which is often adjudicated by agricultural experts and specialists hbirkou et al 2011 the mineral contents of groundwater could be managed by superintending the hydraulic gradient the geological conditions of the area and the irrigation and runoff water seeped through subsurface in irrigated lands gerts and juliev 2020 li et al 2019 throughout assessing gwm according to its chemical contents cation elements as na mg k and ca and anionic compounds as no3 hco3 so4 and cl electrical conductivity ec and ph values are mostly taken into account moussa and kamel 2009 thus requiring regular hydrogeological and hydrochemical studies in the larger scale alternatively with the higher gwt and its increased mineralization climatic variations and aridic climates naturally elevate ss in uzbekistan as well due to the inflated evaporation rate of mineralized groundwater gorji et al 2015 ibrakhimov et al 2019 nationwide weakly saline soils account for 30 following by moderately saline soils 16 and severely saline soils 4 of the total irrigated land moreover 95 of the irrigated land in khorezm province 95 in syrdarya province 87 in bukhara province 87 in navoi province 79 in jizakh province and 78 in the republic of karakalpakstan is saline kulmatov et al 2021 moa 2020 mowr 2021 teshaev et al 2020 recent studies revealed that the amalgamation of conventional methods and geo informational systems gis techniques is an efficacious instrument in tracking tracing assessing and monitoring ss and spatial mapping gwt and gwm alikhanov et al 2020 jagannathan 1996 as gis techniques advance data handling supplementary in situ fieldwork results enabling to validate and corroborate the accuracy of gis based results jagannathan 1996 solomon and quiel 2006 these days gis technologies are far apart applied in detecting and evaluating soil salinity in irrigated areas and mapping such qualitative data i e gwt and gwm which are underivable through gis itself this wide application endorses to derive exceptional results and these results are an important core of research in the accurate mapping li et al 2018 a number of experts and scientists from well developed and developing countries have investigated and determined the interrelationship between the ss gwt and gwm climatic and other anthropogenic factors by using gis based approaches i e spatial interpolation vegetation and salinity indices ibrakhimov et al 2019 kulmatov et al 2020 consequently the ongoing soil salinization process under climate change in irrigated land with rising gwt and gwm has been examined to a great extent and evidentially adequate scientific findings have been procured and vindicated furthermore the gis approaches applied in these investigations were likely to provide the intended results while recapitulating in such other areas akin to the geomorphology of the area of study ivushkin et al 2019 nayak et al 2015 sadat noori and ebrahimi 2013 from local perspective in uzbekistan eshchanov 2008 ibrakhimov 2004 pulatov et al 2020 ibrakhimov et al 2018 and sultanov et al 2019 also applied gis approaches in the analysis and assessment of gwt gwm and ss within certain limits the main limitations were pinpointed as a deficiency of experts in the field of geo informatics and confined proper methodology towards mapping these three variables gwt gwm and ss besides that researchers tend to keep relying on traditional in field approaches on mapping in these studies three gis based tools inverse distance weighting idw spline and kriging were potentially tested and exerted to map the spatial changes of variables in a short period all of these three tools were compared each other as a matter of accurate mapping as a consequence kriging method revealed second acceptable results in mapping interpolated gwt whereas the idw method magnificently mapped all variables regarding the results of these studies the spline method had the highest error in mapping all variables and kriging was the second appropriate option for mapping gwt both are not strongly encouraged to apply mapping these three variables and instead the idw is highly recommended to use in the context of uzbekistan kulmatov et al 2021 conforming to the literature review results above the analysis of perennial data on soil salinity in uzbekistan was conducted by mainly depending on conventional outdated methods besides that gis approaches to map three variables gwt gwm and ss were applied under the limited time period only one year and system boundary at a district level these studies only focused on the cross validation of gis maps however the accuracy of these maps set beyond the scope yet in such areas where the gwt is close and highly mineralized there is an insufficient scientific data and maps created in accordance with gis techniques monitoring soil salinity in the agricultural land over time as gwt rise another limitation of these studies was that the impact of climatic factors on the dynamic changes of gwt gwm and ss was insufficiently pondered considering these weaknesses implementing perennial data analyses expanding the spatial extent undertaking the accuracy assessment of gis maps the impact assessment of climatic factors and the deeper extent of the interrelationship between gwt gwm and ss could be the novel aspects of this research which can cover above mentioned limitations therefore the first objective of this paper is to analyze and map the dynamic and spatial changes in gwt gwm and ss under climatic factors over 20 years 2000 2019 aligning with this the second objective is to integrate traditional research methods and accuracy validated gis methods in the example of irrigated land of syrdarya province in uzbekistan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area uzbekistan is one of the arid countries located in central asia sandwiched between the syr darya and the amu darya rivers the area of uzbekistan is 447 400 km2 and around 10 of this area is allocated for agricultural purposes plain deserts large valleys foothills and mountainous regions epitomize the topography of uzbekistan since the geo location of uzbekistan is classified as an arid zone dry and continental weather is observed at any time of the year aslanov et al 2021 khasanov 2019 uzbekistan boasts a distinctive climate and weather condition composing of dry long and exceptionally hot summers humid and cool falls and extremely cold winters kulmatov et al 2021 the average countrywide air temperature in the hottest summer time july is 29 c whilst the average winter air temperature is 2 c in january sum of the precipitation is averaged as 424 mm according to the perennial observation data from 2000 to 2019 kulmatov et al 2021 liu et al 2020 syrdarya province as our study area is one of the main agroeconomically important provinces located in central uzbekistan on the left bank of the syrdarya river the province is a semi arid area ascribed to its local climate and likely to become susceptible to soil salinization risk the province shares borders with tajikistan kazakhstan and jizakh and tashkent provinces of uzbekistan fig 1 syrdarya province lies on an area of around 4300 km2 and the steppe of mirzachul takes a significant portion of the province platonov and karimov 2015 as of december 2019 the territory of irrigated land of the syrdarya province outnumbers 287 200 ha or 70 6 of the provincial area chernishov 2019 soils of irrigated land are mainly anthrosols technosols solonchaks arenosols and cambisols these soils have relatively low organic matter content on average 1 0 with reserves of nearly 40 tons ha kulmatov et al 2021 syrdarya province is split into eight administrative districts saykhunabad sirdarya khovost gulistan boyout mirzaabad sardoba and akaltin districts chernishov 2019 scsru 2020 the climate of the province is a typically semi aridic continental distinguished by hot and dry summers atmospheric precipitation mostly falls in winter and spring seasons and it is not a primary source of irrigation a parching wind garmsil frequently blows and evaporates the actual soil moisture inauspiciously decelerating plant development chernishov 2019 and increasing evaporation rate of groundwater kulmatov et al 2020 kulmatov et al 2021 according to uzhydromet uzhydromet 2020 the average annual air temperature was 14 9 c the main rationale why we study the climate of this province is that the local meteorological conditions directly influence gwt and gwm jeopardizing soils of irrigated areas under the risk of secondary salinization 2 2 data provision since 1991 gwm and gwt in irrigated areas of syrdarya province has been systematically surveilled by the hydrological and geological reclamation expedition of syrdarya province hgresp under the ministry of water resources from about 1500 observation wells lsbais 2020 hgresp usually undertakes this monitoring in each quartile of the year regarding the ss the cadaster agency under the subsidiary of the state committee for tax former the state committee for land resources geodesy cartography and state cadaster and hgresp are the key organizations responsible for monitoring and conducting in situ expeditions to assess the actual state of soil in terms of ss since 1994 these two organizations perform this assessment twice per annum in the beginning of vegetation period of the country spring april and in end the period autumn october these monitoring and assessment results went beyond the use for scientific and political purposes as these data left just in official tables hence these collected perennial numerical data from official tables on three variables from 2000 to 2019 were used as a primary data in this article it is important to note that the authors of this article also took a role in the fieldwork in 2019 and 2020 as of october 2019 2020 groundwater and soil samples were taken from coordinated 3800 points and 1500 wells on average respectively in each year from 287 200 ha of irrigated lands in syrdarya province groundwater samples were taken away from two different wells one for shallow groundwater 0 3 m and another one for comparatively deep groundwater 3 m in the region while soil samples were extracted from 0 to 30 cm 30 70 cm and 70 100 cm of soil layer along with 11 200 soil samples in total to determine gwm and ss in the laboratory condition in our study soil samples taken from 0 to 30 cm and 30 70 cm of soil layer were analyzed in regards to soil samples from 70 to 100 cm depth they were omitted in reasonable cases seeing that these samples do not contribute to the overall results of a sampling point 2 3 methodology the primary gwt gwm and ss tabular data were principally examined from 2000 to 2015 and to formalize the accuracy of gis methods by juxtaposing with the primary tabular data the maps depicting the space time changes of three variables for 2016 2019 were created these maps were hinged on concurrent measurements extracted from groundwater monitoring wells and soil sampling points in the province the distance between wells and soil sampling points was unevenly distributed ranging from 500 to 1000 m since this study targets mapping the dynamic spatial changes of classified gwt gwm and ss in irrigated lands of syrdarya province the classification tables below were given table 1 these three variables were perceived to be hypothetically inseparable related each other and significantly depend on following factors as irrigation and land practice soil properties drainage efficiency crop type and critical depth gwt greater than 3 m was proven safe in terms of ss followed by gwt with 2 3 m weakly unsafe 1 5 2 m moderately unsafe 1 1 5 m severely unsafe and 0 1 m extremely unsafe in the conditions of uzbekistan such scientists categorized gwm in irrigated areas of uzbekistan by determining the chloride cl concentration which does not adversely affect the crop growth and development throughout the entire vegetation period table 1 akramkhanov et al 2008 akramkhanov and vlek 2012 since 2006 during the field expedition the ss has been determined in soil pastes using a digital conductometer thermometer hereinafter ec meter progress 1 t akramkhanov et al 2011 2014 kulmatov et al 2021 this instrument is relatively common and easy to use in fieldwork according to its gauzy weight simple ordinary structure and convenient orientation of electronic components besides that a manual drill was employed for soil sampling in some conditions in which soil was unduly compact to sample rhoades and chanduvi 1999 pinpointed that values of ss for irrigated lands identified by ec meter were served for classifying ss to determine the extent to which the total dissolvent salts do not adversely influence crop yield within the whole growing season table 2 the vector based maps which illustrate gwm gwt and ss maps for irrigated lands of syrdarya province were created with the idw interpolation method by using arcgis 10 6 software esri 2018 why we selected this method was that idw runs a straightforward mathematical circuitry formed by statistical modeling representing the data generating process lakshmi 2020 souza et al 2020 this process in turn is reasonably efficient in this research by its void filling ability and outliers between groundwater wells and soil sampling points ibrakhimov 2004 ibrakhimov et al 2018 eshchanov 2008 sultanov et al 2019 and pulatov et al 2020 claimed that the minimum errors in creating gwt gwm and ss maps were observed by using the idw method the results derived in the afore emphasized investigations and studies proved that the idw interpolation method provides appropriate results when adequate information was uploaded eshchanov 2008 ibrakhimov 2004 considering this aspect as it was biased that the idw method also does not show a perfect output with 100 accuracy the overall accuracy of created idw maps of irrigated areas was ascertained by comparing our quantified tabular gis based results with official tabular data once the accuracy of interpolated maps was evaluated statistical analysis was undertaken to discern the actual relationship between three variables gwt gwm and ss and the extent to which climate factors annual average seasonal air temperature and annual seasonal precipitation influence spatial distribution dynamics of gwt gwm and ss perennial climate data from three meteo stations located in syrdarya province were derived as an open source from the center of hydro meteorological service of uzbekistan uzhydromet 2020 and the annual data from these three meteo stations were triangulated to determine the unique average value as a potential tool to show the correlation in statistics a simple pearson s correlation and a linear regression analysis were performed to perceive the actual dependence using r studio program edelmann et al 2021 rstudio team 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 3 1 changing dynamics of gwt gwm and ss over 2000 2015 years in irrigated lands of syrdarya province 3 1 1 groundwater table dynamics regarding the obtained in field data on gwt the irrigated areas with gwt 1 0 m were almost not detected in syrdarya province within 15 years moreover the irrigated land with gwt 1 0 1 5 m expanded by 7 6 or 21 846 ha of the total irrigated area of the province by 2003 compared to 0 25 703 ha in 2008 and 0 73 2050 ha as of 2015 the area with gwt 1 5 2 0 m accounted for 20 2 58 526 ha in 2000 followed by 36 7 106 215 ha peaking in 2004 and 18 9 52 881 ha as of 2015 likewise the irrigated area with gwt 2 0 3 0 m outnumbered 64 8 187 389 ha in 2000 then reached its peak by 72 3 210 991 ha in 2011 and 65 7 190 210 ha as of 2015 returning its starting point lastly irrigated areas in the province with gwt 3 m was 11 44 33 172 ha in 2000 4 5 13 059 ha in 2007 and peaking by 14 66 41 061 ha as of 2015 fig 2 irrigated areas with gwt 2 0 3 0 m reduced by 7801 ha in 2015 comparing to the recorded point in 2014 this could be explained that the dependence of irrigation water outflow by drainage water from irrigated lands in these administrative districts was sufficiently high last but not least irrigated land areas with gwt 3 0 m in the study area rose by 4297 ha in contrast to the results in 2014 which was considered as an adequate improvement sign these dynamic changes in gwt over years are assumed to be caused by unsustainable management of land resources and irrigation water as these results identify the area of gwt closer to the surface leading to ss these irrigated areas are needed to be reconsidered to utilize them for growing halophyte plants in regards to gwt as a matter of soil salinity gwt 2 3 m is considered expedient and safe interestingly such irrigated areas with gwt 2 3 m in syrdarya province took place in nearly 66 8 of the total area this is a satisfactory indicator theoretically gwt 1 m straightforwardly accelerates soil salinization processes because of solonchak soil texture in this study area wang et al 2020 potentially the severe levels of ss were occurred in such circumstances in which groundwater is close to the soil surface thus monitoring the dynamic changes in gwt to investigate the salinization processes in irrigated lands is essential 3 1 2 groundwater mineralization dynamics according to the detailed fieldwork results on gwm over the period of 2000 2015 approximately 41 of the total irrigated area in the study area was mainly consisted of gwm 3 5 g l irrigated lands with gwm 1 3 g l constituted nearly 85 441 ha 20 2 in 2000 and there was a remarkable increase to 125 211 ha or 30 1 of the total irrigated land of the province in 2015 reaching the endpoint of the gwm 3 5 g l line fig 2 the increase in the irrigated land with gwm 1 3 g l led to an overabundant decrease by around 51 in the irrigated area with gwm 5 10 g l and this is regarded as a magnificent indicator the trend for the irrigated lands with gwm 0 1 g l were remained almost unchanged however the irrigated areas with gwm 10 g l were exceptionally unpredictable over the period this unpredictability was mainly perceived to observe in such bare irrigated lands where the evaporation rate was potentially and comparatively high due to the global change of climate nevertheless this does not influence gwm 0 1 g l significantly where gwt is deeper thus remaining almost stable over time 3 1 3 soil salinity dynamics according to the long term ss data classified for irrigated lands in syrdarya province about 62 of the total irrigated land of the study area was mainly composed of weakly saline areas throughout 2000 2015 non saline irrigated lands were just under 4000 ha 1 1 in 2000 followed by escalating to 7500 ha 2 in 2015 once the moderately saline irrigated areas have experienced an abrupt decrease by nearly 51 044 ha 17 4 these areas occupied 47 205 ha 16 4 in 2015 this decrease indicating a significant effect size is an affirmative indicator in the beginning period of the experiment the severely saline areas widespread on 23 085 ha 8 4 and experienced a considerable reduction in the last 15 years to just under 5000 ha 1 6 in 2015 fig 2 despite having a negligible spatial change in the areas of gwt 3 m and gwm 0 1 g l during 15 years non saline irrigated land magnified twofold this meant that changing dynamics of salt affected areas is logically correlated to its two drivers namely gwt and gwm howbeit other land reclamation and agro technical measures i e the proper and sustainable establishment of salt leaching crop rotation and conservation agriculture are highly encouraged to apply in time 3 2 mapping gwt gwm and ss in the irrigated areas of syrdarya province by using gis from 2016 to 2019 3 2 1 gis maps for groundwater table groundwater mineralization and soil salinity gis is nowadays one of the most time efficient and innovative technologies to remotely monitor the environmental changes groll et al 2013 however in some cases a number of studies were undertaken by kulmatov 2014 kulmatov et al 2020 rashid kulmatov et al 2021 and kulmatov et al 2021 on the hydrology of groundwater in bukhara and navoi provinces using conventional approaches without gis tools to map the dynamic changes in contrast to these studies this research depicts the gis maps of differently classified gwt gwm and ss widespread per administrative districts of syrdarya province for the past four years fig 3 the advances of gis tools and techniques accurately and adequately exemplifies the differently classified gwm gwt and ss distribution in irrigated lands of the study area above hinged on the accurate and available primary data regarding fig 5 below created by idw interpolation irrigated areas with gwt 2 3 m and 3 m were eye catching and could virtually be detected such irrigated areas with gwt 1 2 m could be mainly observed in the eastern part of the study area whereas the irrigated areas with gwt below 1 m were negligibly mapped with respect to the gwm results the irrigated lands with gwm 0 1 g l could be spotted easily in eyes only in 2018 in the other experimental years such areas were barely visible on the idw maps because of negligible low dynamic values similar to the gwm results the non saline areas could be virtually and easily distinguished from other ss levels in 2018 throughout 2016 2019 weakly saline irrigated lands preoccupied as large areas as other ss levels while the moderately and severely saline irrigated areas gradually dwindled the idw maps were afterwards quantified considering each class of three variables and interpreted in ha next these hectares were collated with the official in situ tabular data obtained from above mentioned responsible organizations lsbais 2020 consequently the idw based gwt maps acquired an accuracy of 91 4 with p 0 001 following by gwm 84 1 p 0 00003 and ss 76 7 p 0 0006 furthermore the root mean square error of created idw maps with power 2 was 0 03 for gwt 0 04 for gwm and 0 06 for ss this rendered a robust evidence for the wide application of the idw interpolation method as a gis based approach to map gwt gwm and ss this resemblance can be discerned in the results of such investigations and studies conducted in mirzaabad district of syrdarya province khorezm and navoi provinces of uzbekistan pulatov et al 2020 eshchanov 2008 ibrakhimov 2004 ibrakhimov et al 2018 kulmatov et al 2021 sultanov et al 2019 however the exact accuracy of official data is not particularly discussed since it has the governmental significance and we deem these data is correctly formed under in depth field surveys the accuracy of maps we derived is relative to the official data 3 2 2 idw based trends corresponding to the years of 2016 2019 the idw based results of each variable are given in the graphs for the remaining experimental years 2016 2019 as an annex to fig 2 above overall trends for the irrigated areas with gwt 0 1 m and 2 3 m were almost stable after 2015 occupying over 200 ha 0 01 of province s total irrigated area ptia and 191 017 ha 66 ptia in 2019 however in the irrigated lands with the rest three classes of gwt 1 1 5 m 1 5 2 m and above 3 m the trends were generally fluctuated regarding the irrigated areas with gwt 1 5 2 and 2 3 m there were upward trends taking up extra 6000 20 of ptia and 2000 ha 0 015 of ptia in 2019 respectively interestingly the irrigated areas with gwt 3 m experienced a steep decrease by 35 000 ha 19 8 of ptia in 2019 fig 4 whereas lines for gwm 1 3 g l and 3 5 g l of irrigated lands were almost united in the late 2015 the irrigated lands with gwm 1 3 g l over four year time period rose significantly and outnumbered almost 190 000 ha 47 7 of ptia inclinations corresponding to the other classes of gwm have practically reinstated to 2016 despite having some fluctuations over four years irrigated areas with gwm 0 1 g l reached its acme point with about 22 047 ha 5 7 of ptia in 2018 and returned to an unnoticeable rate in 2019 fig 4 while the lines which show non saline and severely saline irrigated lands until the post 2015 were proportionately stable these lines increased slowly and constituted around 9100 ha 3 1 of ptia in the end of the period the increasingly growing weakly saline irrigated lands slightly reduced whereas moderately saline irrigated lands almost unchanged until 2019 taking place in approximately 220 500 ha 77 2 of ptia and 51 400 ha 17 6 of ptia respectively fig 4 3 3 correlation and regression analysis 3 3 1 correlation analysis between groundwater table groundwater mineralization soil salinity and climatic factors global climate change impact on water management and regional hydrology of the syrdarya river basin is immensely complex glacier masses in the syrdarya river basin melted around 14 of the total amount within the last 50 years and roughly 20 45 of them is predicted to perish in the adjacent 50 years immerzeel et al 2012 siegfried et al 2012 thus the wise and sustainable groundwater utilization in syrdarya province is deemed to lessen the risk of water shortage in agriculture simultaneously regular monitoring of the climatic effects on gwm and gwt and the influence of these variables on ss is exceptionally important in this case wang et al 2020 average annual seasonal air temperature each for 2000 2019 years in summer june july august and winter december january february and annual seasonal precipitation were considered in this research as climatic factors this is due to as air temperature increases logically and undeniably the shallow groundwater in irrigated lands evaporates correspondingly and its mineralization increases proportionally with reference to the dissolvent solids in soil ibrakhimov et al 2007 kulmatov et al 2020 besides that the groundwater salt concentration remains and could accumulate in the soil surface akramkhanov et al 2011 moreover precipitation has undeniably a direct effect on the dynamic changes in gwm gwt and ss precipitation seeps into groundwater throughout rainy seasons reducing the actual mineralization level kulmatov et al 2020 and contributes to salt leaching in the soil surface of irrigated areas this happens to reduce certain agricultural lands with higher gwm and particular severe salt concentrations in soils several statistical analyzes in uzbekistan were undertaken by kulmatov et al 2020 groll et al 2013 to test the climate factor impacts on the surface water mineralization and ss of irrigated lands in navoi province within this research the average perennial air temperature and atmospheric precipitation were taken climate factors the results of this research proved that climate parameters were correlated weakly to the mineralization of surface water 20 and ss 15 below could be discerned that how gwt gwm and ss are interrelated each other and along with that average seasonal air temperature and precipitation influence preponderating of these variables fig 5 referring to the data of fig 5 regarding gwt rising groundwater is mainly due to capillarity of soil and precipitation in many cases 0 50 however as air temperature in summer and winter increases gwt is kept lower assuming that is due to the high rate of groundwater evaporation gwt also accelerates soil salinization processes since where there is a deeper gwt lower risk of ss engrossingly gwt is in most cases unrelated to gwm and precipitation in winter 0 2 gwm manifested a relative weak correlation with the average air temperature in both seasons and the regional precipitation 0 3 logically and evidentially the mineralization contents of groundwater surge the salinization processes of soil up and strongly correlated with each level of ss in many cases another point is evidenced that climate change influences to extend irrigated lands with gwm 5 10 g l and gwm 10 g l as a rise in air temperature naturally causes a negative change in gwm of irrigated lands due to evaporation this could be presumed that the irrigated land with such gwm classes are comparatively enlarged because of existing soluble surface minerals in the soil texture with respect to ss the change in non saline agricultural lands mainly relies on precipitation and annual average seasonal air temperature weak saline irrigated land depends on the seasonal air temperature in summer as well as reveals insignificant dependence on precipitation in summer evidentially climate change has a potential impact on the change in moderately saline agricultural lands these areas also change commensurately while seasonal air temperature increases the reason behind climate factors within the correlation analysis the dependence of severely saline areas on average seasonal air temperature is ascertained yet such saline areas are not dependent on atmospheric precipitation in summer at all but precipitation in winter 3 3 2 specific regression models for groundwater table groundwater mineralization and soil salinity in the simple regression graphs below the interrelation between the classes of gwt gwm and ss was examined the main task for illustrating these graphs is to obtain a deeper insight into the key leading classes of gwt and gwm to ss since in the previous sub section no significant correlation was found between gwt and gwm however in many cases such gwm classes were particularly observed in such gwt levels which were not recorded with reference to the other gwt levels thus the same regression model results for gwt and gwm is given below fig 6 making reference to fig 6 gwm 0 1 g l could be infrequently found in such irrigated lands where gwt is higher than 2 m r2 0 52 fig 6a however gwm with 1 3 g l is mostly identified where gwt 1 5 2 m r2 0 68 and partially might appear in irrigated lands with gwt 2 m and deeper fig 6b moving onto fig 6c there was almost a negligible correlation between gwm 3 5 g l and gwt 0 1 m r2 0 5 but fairly no correlation with gwt higher than 1 m gwm 5 10 and 10 g l could be detected in such irrigated areas with gwt 0 1 m r2 0 63 and in many cases with gwt 1 1 5 m r2 0 64 figs 6d and 6e according to these results it is assumed that as the mineralization contents of groundwater increases the higher gwm can be found in the shallow gwt as it was perceived that in the case of syrdarya province higher gwm is one of potential leading factor to soil salinization considering this a simple regression model was simulated to test the specific correlation between gwm classes and ss degrees and the results are given in fig 7 below as can be distinguished from the figure above saline irrigated lands extension did not correspond to gwm 0 5 g l figs 7a 7b and 7c in regards to gwm 5 10 g l weak moderate and severe soil salinity mainly occurs in irrigated areas with such gwm and in some cases these kinds of gwm could possibly accelerate the extension of weakly saline irrigated lands fig 7d as identified that there is no effect of gwm 10 g l on the extension of saline irrigated areas fig 7e another factor gwt is also seemed to become an inherent driver leading to salinization of the irrigated area for this reason to gain an understanding of the specific interrelation between gwt and ss the following regression graph was plotted fig 8 by scrutinizing the figure above in the irrigated areas with a shallow gwt 0 1 m none of weakly moderately and severely saline soils could be observed fig 8a however gwt 1 1 5 m has a negligible impact on the extension of weakly saline irrigated land fig 8b irrigated areas with gwt 1 5 2 m were found to insignificantly contribute to the widespread of saline soils fig 8c but gwt 2 3 m has a trivial effect on the extension of weakly saline irrigated land r2 0 5 fig 8d lastly irrigated areas with gwt 3 m were not correlated to the extension of any degrees of ss in the province fig 8e these all identified relationships are perceived due to the aridic high evaporation rate which dries up the shallow groundwater thus causing the higher degrees of ss to widespread in the study area 4 conclusions this paper investigated the mapping techniques relying on the in situ data collected to provide potential risky and susceptible areas to higher gwt gwm and ss the integration of gis technologies can accurately map these three variables as well as enabling the gis based results obtained to become practical and scientific significant encapsulating the results of mapping taking into account the existing occurred errors of created idw maps for gwt gwm and ss respectively in the formulation of measures is strongly advocated when our used and validated idw interpolation method is applied in practice either in this province or in such semi aridic region as the core of this research is the ss assessment and identification of the contribution of gwt and gwm to ss it is assumed that the widespread of differently classified ss levels in agricultural areas of sirdarya province causes a decrease in land quality and productivity even though non saline irrigated lands in the study area expanded trivially in the past 20 years such areas now account for 5 9 of ptia in total it is perceived that the province composes mainly of weakly 54 9 moderately 32 8 saline irrigated areas and a relative reduction in ss by carrying out science based agro technical work is achievable in this circumstance the idw maps are highly encouraged to utilize in ss monitoring of the province to decide on and to place crop species and to develop practical and scientific inputs on soil amelioration summarizing the results of correlation and regression analysesthe climate change impact was considerably related to the dynamic changes in salinity level of irrigated areas whereas an increase in air temperature proportionally changes salinity levels of irrigated lands because of potential evaporation of highly mineralized groundwater from the shallow groundwater level the effect of high atmospheric precipitation on ss is not observed in our study funding not applicable ethics

9636,cultivation after converting saline and alkaline wasteland to agricultural land is usually accompanied by accelerated soil salinization there is general agreement that freezing thawing process plays a crucial role in soil salinization in mostly cold arid agricultural areas which leads to the impoverishment of soil productivity to investigate the migration characteristics of soil salinity in saline sodic cotton field with different reclamation time in non irrigation season we examined the soil bulk total porosity and spatial and temporal migration of soil salinity in winter in an oasis agroecosystem of northern xinjiang china experimental plots include a saline alkali wasteland as control and cotton fields under four age categories cultivation start years were 1998 2006 2008 and 2012 respectively the results showed that converting saline alkali wasteland to cotton land significantly decreased soil bulk density but increased total soil porosity especially at 0 40 cm conversion significantly decreased soil salinity at 0 200 cm soil depths with a greater decrease in cotton land after relatively longer time of cultivation after freezing thawing process soil bulk density decreased 4 87 on average and total porosity increased 5 98 soil salt dynamics showed that there were two stages in salt accumulation firstly soil salt storage increased at 0 100 cm depth but decreased at 100 200 cm depth during freezing period secondly rapid increase of salt storage appeared at late thawing period in addition salt accumulation positively correlated to initial salt content and bulk density but negatively correlated to total porosity at springtime cotton land with short term cultivation was desalination comparing with pre freezing but salt accumulation occurred after long term cultivation these results highlighted that long term cultivation with mulched drip irrigation decreased soil salinity in the 0 200 cm soil profiles but freezing thawing process induced soil salinization which poses a potential risk to agricultural sustainability keywords mulched drip irrigation soil salinity freezing thawing action cotton artificial oasis 1 introduction arid agricultural regions are the primary source of agricultural production daryanto et al 2017 but soil salinity and water deficit continuously restricted the crop growth in most densely populated regions zhang et al 2018 in china there are about 46 of agricultural land suffering from soil salinization and mostly distributing in seasonally frozen area tan et al 2021 chen et al 2018 freezing thawing process has been identified playing crucial role in soil salinization in mostly arid agricultural areas tian et al 2021 wu et al 2019 zhang and wang 2001 investigating the migration characteristics of soil salinity in saline sodic cotton field in non irrigation season is beneficial to understand the mechanisms of soil salinization and provide proper managements suggestions for policy makers in spring irrigation agricultural land in arid regions is usually converted from natural ecosystems which is considered to alleviate the stress of land demand meng et al 2017 li et al 2021b previous studies observed that reclamation activities include a series of processes associating with the improvement of soil productivity li et al 2014 zou et al 2008 for example sun et al 2011 indicated that soil salinity and particle size tended to decrease with increase in reclamation time wang et al 2014 showed that long term agricultural reclamation reduced electrical conductivity and salinity at 0 100 cm layer and xie et al 2020 showed that soil ph electrical conductivity and bulk density significantly decreased after reclamation meanwhile there is general agreement that salinity changes significantly influence soil water and nutrition availability for crop cheng et al 2021 grattan and grieve 1999 however in reclaimed agricultural land soil salinization due to improper irrigation practices or soil compaction caused by heavy agricultural machinery poses a potential risk to agricultural sustainability brady and weil 2002 wang et al 2019 salt migration was drove from convection and diffusion together liu et al 2021 bing et al 2015 which is particularly affected by soil structure eden et al 2020 and seasonal freezing and thawing greatly affected by soil physiochemical properties qin et al 2021 liu et al 2021 tan et al 2021 meanwhile long term cultivation alters soil structure and hydrological processes which further influence the spatial and temporal migration of soil salinity blanco canqui et al 2017 kuhwald et al 2017 noellemeyer et al 2008 migration of soil salinity in agricultural land with different reclamation time in non irrigation season might be more complex however few studies addressed the dynamic mechanism of salt migration to freezing thawing cycles following long term cultivation after the conversion of saline sodic wasteland to cropland in mulched drip irrigation fields there is an obvious salinity layer in soil profiles wang et al 2019 this is attributable to the special infiltration and redistribution of soil moisture caused by drip irrigation solat et al 2021 in cotton growth seasons higher frequency of irrigation is adopted to flush out salts from root zone to meet the demand of the crop growth however because there is no salt drainage outlet therefore the salt continuously accumulates in deeper subsoil kisi et al 2021 mmolawa and or 2000 mostly previous studies focused on the variations of soil salinity in cropped seasons for example li et al 2021b reported the average soil salt content and ion concentrations at 0 100 cm soil depths continuously decreased in a 6 years field experiment guan et al 2019 indicated that soil salt content was relatively high at pre sowing and late harvest during cotton growth period r zhang et al 2013 and q q zhang et al 2013 found that soil salt would accumulate in 40 80 cm depths after drip irrigation and the average salinity accumulation layer tended to deep depth as the increases of irrigation years it is true that irrigation event changes the salt distribution in soil profiles and the influences might be different in various application years in winter seasons without irrigation applying large quantities of salt which concentrating in the subsoils will upward redistribute which leads to salts accumulation at topsoil again at springtime qin et al 2021 ongoing global warming might reduce snowfall amounts and increase the frequency of freezing thawing cycles kreyling et al 2008 which promotes salt accumulation in surface soil wan et al 2021 however the redistribution characteristics of salt in long term mulched drip irrigation fields remains unknown in non irrigation seasons artificial oasis as affected by arid desert climate is challenged by severe soil salinization and water shortage xinjiang in which agricultural cultivation is concentrated in piedmont oases is the largest cotton gossypium hirsutum l production area in china wang et al 2021 2019 the conversion of saline sodic wasteland to cotton land was launched in this area to increase crop production with mulched drip irrigation in 1960 s wang et al 2019 the movements of soil salt in this region can be clearly divided into the desalination period in irrigation seasons from april to september during cotton growth and the salt accumulation period in non irrigation seasons from october to march of next year q q zhang et al 2013 r zhang et al 2013 however few studies have investigated the salt dynamics in agricultural soil with different cultivation time and freezing thawing process therefore in this study we hypothesis that 1 the conversion of saline alkali wasteland to cotton land will improve soil properties due to the input of fertilizer and cotton residues 2 and long term mulched drip irrigation will decrease soil salinity in cotton growth and non growth seasons we aimed to determine the soil salinity dynamics with different cultivation time in non irrigation season and addresses whether salt accumulation is closely linked to the cultivation time 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site during winter seasons in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 we conducted the experiment in the 121 regiment 85 33 85 35 e 44 48 44 50 n shihezi xinjiang uygur autonomous region china which is characterized by a typical arid continental climate the average annual precipitation temperature sunshine duration and frost free period is 142 mm 6 2 2860 h and 163 days respectively the annual groundwater depth is 2 3 5 m the experimental site located at the alluvial plain of the lower reaches of manas river near the gurbantunggut desert and was suffering from water shortage and soil salinization fig 1a cotton is the main crop in this area and the entire cotton field is irrigated with mulched drip irrigation in this study the total precipitation and mean air temperature is 43 6 mm and 7 4 in the first winter season and 56 5 mm and 8 2 in the second season respectively the daily precipitation and air temperature which was obtained from the weather station adjacent to study sites are showed in fig 2 five fields included saline alkali wasteland was selected as control and four cotton fields that were converted from saline alkali wasteland in 1998 2006 2008 and 2012 respectively before reclamation all of the selected fields were saline alkali wasteland cotton has been planted after the conversion of saline alkali wasteland to cotton land five experimental fields are adjacent and their distributions is showed in fig 1b the study sites belong to shihezi university to investigate the effects of cultivation time and thus agricultural management practices i e cotton cultivar irrigation fertilization schedules tillage pattern weed pest control sowing and harvesting dates are similar between years the cultivation age of selected four cotton fields is 21 13 11 7 years in the first experimental year 2019 2020 and is 22 14 12 8 years in the second experimental year 2020 2021 respectively therefore the extent of cultivation age was 7 22 years for selected four cotton fields in irrigation season from april to october cotton is sown in early april with alternation of wide narrow row and harvested in early october fig 3a b the space of wide and narrow is 66 cm and 11 cm respectively we use one polyethylene film to mulch 6 rows of cotton which the film width and space between films is 205 and 60 cm respectively the planting pattern is showed in fig 3c total amounts of irrigation in cotton growth season is 816 15 mm table 1 before the first experimental year we determined the soil bulk density and soil texture from selected fields after cotton harvest table 2 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 soil bulk density and total porosity in early november before ploughing 2019 and 2020 and early april 2020 and 2021 the undisturbed soil cores were sampled to measure the bulk density and total porosity respectively the samples were collected using 100 cm3 stainless steel cylinders from soil depths of 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 120 and 120 140 cm soil undisturbed samples were carefully transported back to the laboratory for bulk density determination soil bulk density was determined with oven drying method at 105 until to reach the constant weight ferraro and ghersa 2007 the total porosity was calculated according to the equation as follow aikins and afuakwa 2012 total porosity 1 bd pd 100 where bd g cm 3 is the soil bulk density pd g cm 3 is the particle density and we use 2 74 in this study which was determined according to the pycnometer method aimrun et al 2004 2 2 2 soil salt content and salt accumulation soil disturbed samples from each cotton field were collected using a 5 cm diameter anger by 10 cm interval from 0 to 100 cm soil profiles but 20 intervals from 100 to 200 cm soil profiles such samples were collected for 15 20 d intervals from november to march next year the first sampling is on october 30th in 2019 and november 6th in 2020 respectively and the last sampling is on march 28th in 2019 and april 1st in 2021 soil salinity was determined using electrical conductivity from 1 5 soil water extraction according to pang et al 2010 changes of soil salt accumulation δssa was calculated as following zhao et al 2016 ssa ss bd h δssa ssat ssaf where ssa is soil salinity of unit area mg ha 1 ss is soil salt content g kg 1 bd is soil bulk density g cm 3 h is thickness of soil layer cm ssaf is salt storage at cotton harvest and ssat is salt storage in the next year before sowing 2 2 3 statistical analysis the paired t test and one way analysis of variance anova was performed with ibm spss statistics 26 spss inc chicago usa the least significant difference lsd was adopted as the method of multiple comparisons to determined significance of data among various groups differences were considered statistically significant at the 0 05 level 3 results 3 1 soil bulk density and total porosity when averaged across 0 200 cm soil depths soil bulk density was significantly 12 86 lower in cotton fields compared with wasteland table 3 soil bulk density decreased firstly and then increased with cultivation time at the below 40 cm soil depths but did not differ among all cotton plots at 0 40 cm soil depths compared with before freezing soil bulk density in cropland decreased by 6 04 4 34 and 4 24 and in wasteland decreased by 7 47 9 36 and 6 32 at 0 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 140 cm soil depths after thawing respectively soil total porosity increased by 29 25 after converting wasteland to cotton land table 4 the total porosity firstly increased within approximately 13 years of conversion but then decreased over 20 years compared with before freezing total porosity in cropland decreased by 6 77 5 24 and 5 90 and in wasteland decreased by 12 99 15 54 and 10 99 at 0 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 140 cm soil depths after thawing respectively 3 2 soil salt distribution fig 4 shows the soil salt distribution at different plots which was the first observation at two experimental seasons over the two years the soil salt content generally ranked with the order of 8 a 12 a 14 a 22 a 0 a at 0 80 cm soil depths the soil salt content was significantly lower in the cotton land than the wasteland and was lowest in field after 22 years of cultivation for the below 100 cm soil soil salt content was relatively higher in field within 12 years of cultivation but was still smaller in fields after 14 22 years of cultivation the soil salinity was higher at the 100 200 cm soil depth than 0 100 cm soil depth in cotton land contrarily with regard of wasteland soil salt content at 100 200 cm soil layer was lower than that at the 0 100 cm soil layer except 160 200 cm in the second year 3 3 soil salt storage at cotton harvest fig 5 shows the soil salt storage at various soil layers 0 40 cm 40 100 cm 100 200 cm and 0 200 cm at cotton harvest salt storage of 0 200 cm soil depths significantly decreased after converting wasteland to cotton land compared to wasteland the average soil salt storage was decreased by 60 26 91 49 61 50 95 22 33 13 91 22 and 49 53 92 31 at 0 40 cm 40 100 cm 100 200 cm and 0 200 cm soil depths in cotton land respectively at 40 200 cm soil depths soil salt storage decreased with the increase of cultivation time and the annual desalination rate was 2 01 4 08 and 7 45 mg ha 1 at the 40 100 cm 100 200 cm and 0 200 cm soil depths in cotton land respectively in addition the desalination rate was lower in fields after 15 years of cultivation compared with fields after 7 14 years of cultivation 3 4 soil salt dynamics the dynamics of soil salt content in all fields were similar over two winter seasons and could be divided into three stages including two salt accumulation stages and one desalination stage fig 6 firstly during freezing period soil salt storage slightly increased at 0 100 cm soil depths over the two years except for 0 40 cm in 2020 the soil salt content at 100 200 cm soil depths increased with increase of cultivation time secondly during thawing period the soil salt storage significantly reduced in 0 200 cm soil profiles especially at the 40 100 cm soil depths in addition the decline was greater in wasteland finally clearly salt accumulation appeared at the late thawing period in general the average salt accumulation in thawing process in two years is 4 50 8 63 and 8 39 mg ha 1 in cropland and 15 14 47 55 28 07 mg ha 1 in wasteland at 0 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil depths respectively fig 7 3 5 soil salt accumulation in cotton fields after long term cultivation 22 a salt accumulation mainly occurred at the 90 160 cm soil depths but varied little at the above 90 cm soil depths and 160 200 soil depths in fields after short term cultivation 8 12 a soil salt decreased at the above 60 cm soil depths but increased at 90 100 cm soil depths with regards to wasteland soil salt accumulation mainly occurred at the above 100 cm soil depths except for 40 cm in the first year and 0 20 cm in the second year effects of cultivation time after conversion of wasteland to cotton land on soil salt accumulation depend on soil depths fig 8 at the 40 100 cm soil depths soil salt began to accumulate in fields after 11 22 years of cultivation soil salt contents decreased at the 100 200 cm soil depths in fields within 12 years of cultivation but soil salt accumulated reached 7 75 mg ha 1 on average at this depth after that at the whole 0 200 cm soil profiles the soil salt accumulation occurred in fields after 13 22 years of cultivation but soil desalination happened in fields in 12 years of cultivation 4 discussion in this study converting wasteland to cotton field decreased soil bulk density and increased total porosity at the 0 40 cm soil depths the results were agreement with the findings of havaee et al 2014 who indicated that the irrigation farming had the lower bulk density compared with dryland the changes in bulk density and total porosity were mainly attributed to mechanical disturbance of tillage and the accumulation of soil organic matter at cotton land li et al 2021b havaee e al 2014 for example silveira et al 2008 showed that continuous tillage with plow reduced bulk density but increased total porosity from topsoil due to disturbance of topsoil by deep ploughing zebarth et al 1999 also demonstrated that annual application of organic matter reduced soil bulk density and improved soil water retention we found that the bulk density in deep layer below 40 cm also decreased and total porosity improved in cotton field which could be attributed to the improvement of organic matter in deep soil due to long term application of fertilizers h q li et al 2021 soil organic matter storage and distributions strongly associated with agricultural practices and soil depths jobbagy and jackson 2000 dissolved organic matter dom is an important component of soil organic matter previous studies demonstrated that fertilizer application to soils increased the proportion of dom liu et al 2019 dong et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 and repeated fertilization promoted dom migration to deeper soil layers 60 100 cm rosa and debska 2018 in addition the contribution of crop residues and root exudates to soil dom input might increase with increasing reclamation time shen et al 2020 drip irrigation brings dom to the deeper subsoil and soil organic matter below 40 cm consequently increases similar results were showed by h q li et al 2021 many reports have found that inputs of organic matter generally increased soil total porosity yakupoglu and ozdemir 2012 eynard et al 2006 the effects long term drip irrigation on physico chemical processes of soil are complex which includes many deriving interactions however regular irrigation fertilizer applications generally have beneficial influences on soil physical conditions in fact total porosity of natural saline alkali land was low but bulk density and salinity were high tables 3 and 4 salt accumulation positively correlated to initial salt content and bulk density but negatively correlated to total porosity table 5 addition of fertilizers and irrigation into soils changes ionic composition ionic strength the ph soil organic matter and biological activity leading to increases in repulsive forces between particles and dispersion haynes and naidu 1998 as results compared with wasteland total porosity in cotton land increased but bulk density decreased similar results were consisted with by rasool et al 2007 and tejada and gonzales 2008 who showed that the soil properties positively related to irrigation fertilizer applications we also showed that bulk density decreased and total porosity increased after thawing compared with freezing the results were because that soil structure was destructed with water phase transitions such as ice crystal growth and water migration during freezing process sun et al 2021 consequently soil bulk density and porosity were greatly modified after freezing thawing cycle the results were consistent with previous studies that the effects of freezing thawing process on the soil structure were influences by initial soil moisture texture and properties resulting in frost heave and destruction of the soil structure zhou and tang 2018 starkloff et al 2017 sahin et al 2008 sun et al 2021 for example zhao and hu 2020 indicated that freezing thawing cycles damaged pore network characteristics of the sand soil but did not clearly modify them in silt soil zhao et al 2004 demonstrated that the pore volume increased 9 after phase changed from liquid water to ice and the expansion of ice crystals pressed soil particles and thus the connections with soil particles were destroyed zhang et al 2021 gao et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 therefore higher soil moisture promoted the damage of soil structure induced by freezing process in this study long term conversion significantly decreased soil salt content especially in deep soil below 100 cm the findings were consistent with previous observation li et al 2021b the results were attributed to that the study sites located at artificial oasis area and experienced temperate continental climate with annual rainfall of 50 250 mm wang et al 2019 therefore the migration of soil moisture and salt was mainly determined by irrigation events wang et al 2021 and in such dryland irrigation in winter spring autumn is generally explored to inhibit soil salts restoration and thus provide appropriate soil climate to guarantee crop growth tan et al 2021 yang et al 2016 therefore the annual decrease in soil salty content at the 100 200 cm soil depths was mainly attributed to large irrigation water inputs and relative less evaporation single drip irrigation event without other any assistance drainage measure effectively leached soil salinity from root zone and salts accumulation at wetting front wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 as a result soil salt content was higher in deep soil 100 200 cm than upper soil 0 100 cm from cotton fields fig 4 however salt concentrated on the shallow soil layer but was lower in deep soil in wasteland due to large potential evaporation wang et al 2019 drip irrigation is considered efficient in uniformly distributing water and restraining deep percolation karlberg et al 2007 however improper irrigation practices exacerbate soil salinization wang et al 2019 the evapotranspiration totaled 538 mm during cotton growing season from april to mid october zhou et al 2012 and the irrigation amount was approximately 816 mm table 1 which was 278 mm more than the average evapotranspiration of cotton salts flushing amount volume of irrigation water in leaching of salts should be adjusted with the decrease in salt content in root zone appropriate irrigation strategy for cotton fields with various age categories needs to further study in this study we observed two phases of salt accumulation at 0 100 cm soil depths including freezing period and thawing period fig 6 the results were ascribed to the relationship of salt migration to soil water transfer liu et al 2021 in the first phase the soil water transfers from deeper soil to upper soil with lower temperature due to the forces of thermal gradient in freezing process bing et al 2015 the result was supported by zhang and wang 2001 who indicated that the salinization significantly increased in the frozen soil layers in the second phase snow melt resulted in the redistribution of water and salinity but the soil salt moved from deep soils towards surface soils due to violent evaporation after snow melt we found that long term cultivation decreased soil salt content at 0 100 cm soil depths but more 13 years cultivation led to reaccumulating of salt at the 100 200 cm soil depths fig 8 which challenged the sustainability of drip irrigation the results were possibly attributed to the variation of salt content in original soil the degree of soluble salt accumulation decreased with the increases of the salt content in original soil the explanation was supported by liu et al 2021 who demonstrated that water and salt transportation was more evident in soil with smaller salt content due to the larger matric suction gradient in lower salt content status consequently resulting in the increase of water molecule mobility wen et al 2012 our results were consistent with previous observation that amount of soil water migration was depends on the initial soil salt content watanabe et al 2001 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the responses characteristics of soil salt migration to the long term cultivation with mulched drip irrigation and freezing thawing cycle in winter season in an artificial oasis agroecosystem of northwest china converting wasteland to cotton land significantly decreased soil bulk density and increased total porosity due to tillage disturbances long term cultivation with mulched drip irrigation decreased soil salt storage due to annually excessive amount of irrigation water freezing thawing processes decreased by 6 78 5 24 and 5 91 in soil bulk density but increased by 6 04 4 34 and 4 24 in soil total porosity from cotton land at 0 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm soil depths respectively salt migration in 0 200 cm soil profiles could be divided into three stages soil salt accumulation in top soils during freezing process decrease in soil salt during early thawing process and re increase of soil salinity after thawing process salt accumulation was appeared in cultivations which conversion time is more than 13 years on the contrary desalination was observed in cotton land within 12 years cultivation our results demonstrated that long term cultivation with mulched drip irrigation decreased soil salt storage in the 0 200 cm soil profiles but freezing thawing process play crucial roles in soil salinization which poses a potential risk to agricultural sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9636,cultivation after converting saline and alkaline wasteland to agricultural land is usually accompanied by accelerated soil salinization there is general agreement that freezing thawing process plays a crucial role in soil salinization in mostly cold arid agricultural areas which leads to the impoverishment of soil productivity to investigate the migration characteristics of soil salinity in saline sodic cotton field with different reclamation time in non irrigation season we examined the soil bulk total porosity and spatial and temporal migration of soil salinity in winter in an oasis agroecosystem of northern xinjiang china experimental plots include a saline alkali wasteland as control and cotton fields under four age categories cultivation start years were 1998 2006 2008 and 2012 respectively the results showed that converting saline alkali wasteland to cotton land significantly decreased soil bulk density but increased total soil porosity especially at 0 40 cm conversion significantly decreased soil salinity at 0 200 cm soil depths with a greater decrease in cotton land after relatively longer time of cultivation after freezing thawing process soil bulk density decreased 4 87 on average and total porosity increased 5 98 soil salt dynamics showed that there were two stages in salt accumulation firstly soil salt storage increased at 0 100 cm depth but decreased at 100 200 cm depth during freezing period secondly rapid increase of salt storage appeared at late thawing period in addition salt accumulation positively correlated to initial salt content and bulk density but negatively correlated to total porosity at springtime cotton land with short term cultivation was desalination comparing with pre freezing but salt accumulation occurred after long term cultivation these results highlighted that long term cultivation with mulched drip irrigation decreased soil salinity in the 0 200 cm soil profiles but freezing thawing process induced soil salinization which poses a potential risk to agricultural sustainability keywords mulched drip irrigation soil salinity freezing thawing action cotton artificial oasis 1 introduction arid agricultural regions are the primary source of agricultural production daryanto et al 2017 but soil salinity and water deficit continuously restricted the crop growth in most densely populated regions zhang et al 2018 in china there are about 46 of agricultural land suffering from soil salinization and mostly distributing in seasonally frozen area tan et al 2021 chen et al 2018 freezing thawing process has been identified playing crucial role in soil salinization in mostly arid agricultural areas tian et al 2021 wu et al 2019 zhang and wang 2001 investigating the migration characteristics of soil salinity in saline sodic cotton field in non irrigation season is beneficial to understand the mechanisms of soil salinization and provide proper managements suggestions for policy makers in spring irrigation agricultural land in arid regions is usually converted from natural ecosystems which is considered to alleviate the stress of land demand meng et al 2017 li et al 2021b previous studies observed that reclamation activities include a series of processes associating with the improvement of soil productivity li et al 2014 zou et al 2008 for example sun et al 2011 indicated that soil salinity and particle size tended to decrease with increase in reclamation time wang et al 2014 showed that long term agricultural reclamation reduced electrical conductivity and salinity at 0 100 cm layer and xie et al 2020 showed that soil ph electrical conductivity and bulk density significantly decreased after reclamation meanwhile there is general agreement that salinity changes significantly influence soil water and nutrition availability for crop cheng et al 2021 grattan and grieve 1999 however in reclaimed agricultural land soil salinization due to improper irrigation practices or soil compaction caused by heavy agricultural machinery poses a potential risk to agricultural sustainability brady and weil 2002 wang et al 2019 salt migration was drove from convection and diffusion together liu et al 2021 bing et al 2015 which is particularly affected by soil structure eden et al 2020 and seasonal freezing and thawing greatly affected by soil physiochemical properties qin et al 2021 liu et al 2021 tan et al 2021 meanwhile long term cultivation alters soil structure and hydrological processes which further influence the spatial and temporal migration of soil salinity blanco canqui et al 2017 kuhwald et al 2017 noellemeyer et al 2008 migration of soil salinity in agricultural land with different reclamation time in non irrigation season might be more complex however few studies addressed the dynamic mechanism of salt migration to freezing thawing cycles following long term cultivation after the conversion of saline sodic wasteland to cropland in mulched drip irrigation fields there is an obvious salinity layer in soil profiles wang et al 2019 this is attributable to the special infiltration and redistribution of soil moisture caused by drip irrigation solat et al 2021 in cotton growth seasons higher frequency of irrigation is adopted to flush out salts from root zone to meet the demand of the crop growth however because there is no salt drainage outlet therefore the salt continuously accumulates in deeper subsoil kisi et al 2021 mmolawa and or 2000 mostly previous studies focused on the variations of soil salinity in cropped seasons for example li et al 2021b reported the average soil salt content and ion concentrations at 0 100 cm soil depths continuously decreased in a 6 years field experiment guan et al 2019 indicated that soil salt content was relatively high at pre sowing and late harvest during cotton growth period r zhang et al 2013 and q q zhang et al 2013 found that soil salt would accumulate in 40 80 cm depths after drip irrigation and the average salinity accumulation layer tended to deep depth as the increases of irrigation years it is true that irrigation event changes the salt distribution in soil profiles and the influences might be different in various application years in winter seasons without irrigation applying large quantities of salt which concentrating in the subsoils will upward redistribute which leads to salts accumulation at topsoil again at springtime qin et al 2021 ongoing global warming might reduce snowfall amounts and increase the frequency of freezing thawing cycles kreyling et al 2008 which promotes salt accumulation in surface soil wan et al 2021 however the redistribution characteristics of salt in long term mulched drip irrigation fields remains unknown in non irrigation seasons artificial oasis as affected by arid desert climate is challenged by severe soil salinization and water shortage xinjiang in which agricultural cultivation is concentrated in piedmont oases is the largest cotton gossypium hirsutum l production area in china wang et al 2021 2019 the conversion of saline sodic wasteland to cotton land was launched in this area to increase crop production with mulched drip irrigation in 1960 s wang et al 2019 the movements of soil salt in this region can be clearly divided into the desalination period in irrigation seasons from april to september during cotton growth and the salt accumulation period in non irrigation seasons from october to march of next year q q zhang et al 2013 r zhang et al 2013 however few studies have investigated the salt dynamics in agricultural soil with different cultivation time and freezing thawing process therefore in this study we hypothesis that 1 the conversion of saline alkali wasteland to cotton land will improve soil properties due to the input of fertilizer and cotton residues 2 and long term mulched drip irrigation will decrease soil salinity in cotton growth and non growth seasons we aimed to determine the soil salinity dynamics with different cultivation time in non irrigation season and addresses whether salt accumulation is closely linked to the cultivation time 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site during winter seasons in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 we conducted the experiment in the 121 regiment 85 33 85 35 e 44 48 44 50 n shihezi xinjiang uygur autonomous region china which

and 7 4 in the first winter season and 56 5 mm and 8 2 in the second season respectively the daily precipitation and air temperature which was obtained from the weather station adjacent to study sites are showed in fig 2 five fields included saline alkali wasteland was selected as control and four cotton fields that were converted from saline alkali wasteland in 1998 2006 2008 and 2012 respectively before reclamation all of the selected fields were saline alkali wasteland cotton has been planted after the conversion of saline alkali wasteland to cotton land five experimental fields are adjacent and their distributions is showed in fig 1b the study sites belong to shihezi university to investigate the effects of cultivation time and thus agricultural management practices i e cotton cultivar

first experimental year 2019 2020 and is 22 14 12 8 years in the second experimental year 2020 2021 respectively therefore the extent of cultivation age was 7 22 years for selected four cotton fields in irrigation season from april to october cotton is sown in early april with alternation of wide narrow row and harvested in early october fig 3a b the space of wide and narrow is 66 cm and 11 cm respectively we use one polyethylene film to mulch 6 rows of cotton which the film width and space between films is 205 and 60 cm respectively the planting pattern is showed in fig 3c total amounts of irrigation in cotton growth season is 816 15 mm table 1 before the first experimental year we determined the soil bulk density and soil texture from selected fields after cotton harvest table 2 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 soil bulk density and total porosity in early november before ploughing 2019 and 2020 and early april 2020 and 2021 the undisturbed soil cores were sampled to measure the bulk density and total porosity respectively the samples were collected using 100 cm3 stainless steel cylinders from soil depths of 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 120 and 120 140 cm soil undisturbed samples were carefully transported back to the laboratory for bulk density determination soil bulk density was determined with oven drying method at 105 until to reach the constant weight ferraro and ghersa 2007 the total porosity was calculated according to the equation as follow aikins and afuakwa 2012 total porosity 1 bd pd 100 where bd g cm 3 is the soil bulk density pd g cm 3 is the particle density and we use 2 74 in this study which was determined according to the pycnometer method aimrun et al 2004 2 2 2 soil salt content and salt accumulation soil disturbed samples from each cotton field were collected using a 5 cm diameter anger by 10 cm interval from 0 to 100 cm soil profiles but 20 intervals from 100 to 200 cm soil profiles such samples were collected for 15 20 d intervals from november to march next year the first sampling is on october 30th in 2019 and november 6th in 2020 respectively and the last sampling is on march 28th in 2019 and april 1st in 2021 soil salinity was determined using electrical conductivity from 1 5 soil water extraction according to pang et al 2010 changes of soil salt accumulation δssa was calculated as following zhao et al 2016 ssa

chicago usa the least significant difference lsd was adopted as the method of multiple comparisons to determined significance of data among various groups differences were considered statistically significant at the 0 05 level 3 results 3 1 soil bulk density and total porosity when averaged across 0 200 cm soil depths soil bulk density was significantly 12 86 lower in cotton fields compared with wasteland table 3 soil bulk density decreased firstly and then increased with cultivation time at the below 40 cm soil depths but did not differ among all cotton plots at 0 40 cm soil depths compared with before freezing soil bulk density in cropland decreased by 6 04 4 34 and 4 24 and in wasteland decreased by 7 47 9 36 and 6 32 at 0 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 140 cm soil depths after thawing respectively soil total porosity increased by 29 25 after converting wasteland to cotton land table 4 the total porosity firstly increased within approximately 13 years of conversion but then decreased over 20 years compared with before freezing total porosity in cropland decreased by 6 77 5 24 and 5 90 and in wasteland decreased by 12 99 15 54 and 10 99 at 0 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 140 cm soil depths after thawing respectively 3 2 soil salt distribution fig 4 shows the soil salt distribution at different plots which was the first observation at two experimental seasons over the two years the soil salt content generally ranked with the order of 8 a 12 a 14 a 22 a 0 a at 0 80 cm soil depths the soil salt content was significantly lower in the cotton land than the wasteland and was lowest in field after 22 years of cultivation for the below 100 cm soil soil salt content was relatively higher in field within 12 years of cultivation but was still smaller in fields after 14 22 years of cultivation the soil salinity was higher at the 100 200 cm soil depth than 0 100 cm soil depth in cotton land contrarily with regard of wasteland soil salt content at 100 200 cm soil layer was lower than that at the 0 100 cm soil layer except 160 200 cm in the second year 3 3 soil salt storage at cotton harvest fig 5 shows the soil salt storage at various soil layers 0 40 cm 40 100 cm 100 200 cm and 0 200 cm at cotton harvest salt storage of 0 200 cm soil depths significantly decreased after converting wasteland to cotton land compared to wasteland the average soil salt storage was decreased by 60 26 91 49 61 50 95 22 33 13 91 22 and 49 53 92 31 at 0 40 cm 40 100 cm 100 200 cm and 0 200 cm soil depths in cotton land respectively at 40 200 cm soil depths soil salt storage decreased with the increase of cultivation time and the annual desalination rate was 2 01 4 08 and 7 45 mg ha 1 at the 40 100 cm 100 200 cm and 0 200 cm soil depths in cotton land respectively in addition the desalination rate was lower in fields after 15 years of cultivation compared with fields after 7 14 years of cultivation 3 4 soil salt dynamics the dynamics of soil salt content in all fields were similar over two winter seasons and could be divided into three stages including two salt accumulation stages and one desalination stage fig 6 firstly during freezing period soil salt storage slightly increased at 0 100 cm soil depths over the two years except for 0 40 cm in 2020 the soil salt content at 100 200 cm soil depths increased with increase of cultivation time secondly during thawing period the soil salt storage significantly reduced in 0 200 cm soil profiles especially at the 40 100 cm soil depths in addition the decline was greater in wasteland finally clearly salt accumulation appeared at the late thawing period in general the average salt accumulation in thawing process in two years is 4 50 8 63 and 8 39 mg ha 1 in cropland and 15 14 47 55 28 07 mg ha 1 in wasteland at 0 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm soil depths respectively fig 7 3 5 soil salt accumulation in cotton fields after long term cultivation 22 a salt accumulation mainly occurred at the 90 160 cm soil depths but varied little at the above 90 cm soil depths and 160 200 soil depths in fields after short term cultivation 8 12 a soil salt decreased at the above 60 cm soil depths but increased at 90 100 cm soil depths with regards to wasteland soil salt accumulation mainly occurred at the above 100 cm soil depths except for 40 cm in the first year and 0 20 cm in the second year effects of cultivation time after conversion of wasteland to cotton land on soil salt accumulation depend on soil depths fig 8 at the 40 100 cm soil depths soil salt began to accumulate in fields after 11 22 years of cultivation soil salt contents decreased at the 100 200 cm soil depths in fields within 12 years of cultivation but soil salt accumulated reached 7 75 mg ha 1 on average at this depth after that at the whole 0 200 cm soil profiles the soil salt accumulation occurred in fields after 13 22 years of cultivation but soil desalination happened in fields in 12 years of cultivation

period fig 6 the results were ascribed to the relationship of salt migration to soil water transfer liu et al 2021 in the first phase the soil water transfers from deeper soil to upper soil with lower temperature due to the forces of thermal gradient in freezing process bing et al 2015 the result was supported by zhang and wang 2001 who indicated that the salinization significantly increased in the frozen soil layers in the second phase snow melt resulted in the redistribution of water and salinity but the soil salt moved from deep soils towards surface soils due to violent evaporation after snow melt we found that long term cultivation decreased soil salt content at 0 100 cm soil depths but more 13 years cultivation led to reaccumulating of salt at the 100 200 cm soil depths fig 8 which challenged the sustainability of drip irrigation the results were possibly attributed to the variation of salt content in original soil the degree of soluble salt accumulation decreased with the increases of the salt content in original soil the explanation was supported by liu et al 2021 who demonstrated that water and salt transportation was more evident in soil with smaller salt content due to the larger matric suction gradient in lower salt content status consequently resulting in the increase of water molecule mobility wen et al 2012 our results were consistent with previous observation that amount of soil water migration was depends on the initial soil salt content watanabe et al 2001 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the responses characteristics of soil salt migration to the long term cultivation with mulched drip irrigation and freezing thawing cycle in winter season in an artificial oasis agroecosystem of northwest china converting wasteland to cotton land significantly decreased soil bulk density and increased total porosity due to tillage disturbances long term cultivation with mulched drip irrigation decreased soil salt storage due to annually excessive amount of irrigation water freezing thawing processes decreased by 6 78 5 24 and 5 91 in soil bulk density but increased by 6 04 4 34 and 4 24 in soil total porosity from cotton land at 0 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm soil depths respectively salt migration in 0 200 cm soil profiles could be divided into three stages soil salt accumulation in top soils during freezing process decrease in soil salt during early thawing process and re increase of soil salinity after thawing process salt accumulation was appeared in cultivations which conversion time is more than 13 years on the contrary desalination was observed in cotton land within 12 years cultivation our results demonstrated that long term cultivation with mulched drip irrigation decreased soil salt storage in the 0 200 cm soil profiles but freezing thawing process play crucial roles in soil salinization which poses a potential risk to agricultural sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9637,water reuse is a strategic priority for water authorities in europe to reduce the pressure on water resources although implementation is lagging behind expectations due to financial administrative and social acceptance concerns in this context there is a special interest to identify in which specific wastewater treatment plants it would be interesting to add a water regeneration plant taking account of potential existing clients in the vicinity and the implied costs and benefits this paper proposes a method to quantify the infrastructure and operation costs of project implementation and the benefits of the additional water offer an algorithm designs the distribution network allowing for a quick cost analysis the method is applied in the upper guadiana in central spain where irrigation led to the overexploitation of the local aquifers and the subsequent restrictions on water use taking account of the existing wastewater treatment plants candidate reuse projects are classified according to their benefit cost ratio showing large differences according to the location and potential use of the regenerated water the analysis allows for a quick assessment of the costs and benefits implied in different reuse projects and scenarios providing science based evidence to support water policy decisions graphical abstract ga1 keywords wastewater treatment reclaimed water optimization irrigation network cost benefit analysis spain 1 introduction the growing competition on water abstraction for urban industrial agricultural and other uses and the perspective of diminishing availability due to climate change are pushing the agenda for the quest of alternative water sources un water 2020 one of these sources is urban wastewater qadir et al 2003 which is normally discharged to rivers and seas after a convenient treatment an additional treatment of regeneration recycling reuse different terms are used in the literature can make these waters available for further use voulvoulis 2018 regenerated treated wastewater use is increasing it is recognized as a promising and necessary solution to alleviate water stress especially in areas where the shortages of conventional water resources is a structural problem european parliament and council 2020 in the european union eu numerous initiatives have been recently put in place to foster wastewater reuse promoting a more resource efficient circular economy the maximization of treated wastewater reuse for irrigation has been underlined as a specific objective in several communications by the commission a blueprint to safeguard europe s water resources 2012 and closing the loop an eu action plan for the circular economy 2015 and identified as a top priority in the strategic implementation plan of the european innovation partnership on water recently a new regulation eu 2020 741 has been set to facilitate the use of urban wastewater for agricultural purposes by providing harmonized minimum water quality requirements european parliament and council 2020 the regulation defines four different classes class a being the strictest of water quality depending on the contact level between the reused water and the edible part of the crop a maximum level of microbial pollution is set for each class in order to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases the regulation also requires that the input of water regeneration plants i e the output of urban wastewater treatment plants is compliant with the wastewater directive council of the european communities 1991 in sum it completes the existing eu legal framework on water the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec european parliament and council 2000 and the urban waste water treatment directive uwwtd council of the european communities 1991 although major regulatory strides have been made to boost water reuse in the eu only a small part of treated wastewater is currently reused bio deloitte 2015 the widespread implementation of water reuse projects appears to be limited due to several technical and non technical barriers alcalde sanza and gawlik 2014 licciardello et al 2018 ricart and rico 2019 van rensburg 2016 recent research on the subject claims that while technical barriers related to water reuse could largely be resolved e g through adapted irrigation systems improved storage and treatment methods xylem 2020 social and economic issues e g public acceptance and the cost of reclamation may seriously condition the success of water reuse projects and yet they are poorly investigated saliba et al 2018 smith et al 2018 economic analyses related to wastewater reuse have primarily focused on the evaluation of water reuse practices in comparison with other non conventional sources mainly desalinization lapuente 2012 much less efforts have been spent on the study of the financial and economical sustainability of wastewater reuse investments and on the prioritization of water reuse projects arborea et al 2017 arena et al 2020 although new decision support tools such as the poseidon software oertlé et al 2019 are currently being developed to support pre feasibility studies on water reuse projects cost benefit analysis cba remains the major appraisal method to assess water related investments molinos senante et al 2010 this method enables a direct comparison of the total costs and benefits of a project using a common metric monetary units in the case of wastewater treatment reuse projects its application is not straightforward one of the major difficulties in assessing the costs consists of the determination of the distribution network that connects the regenerated water plant to the final users other issues such as on site versus at source and the short term and long term nature of the cost and benefits attained e g the discount rate are also commonly discussed giannoccaro et al 2019 the paper aims to provide a method to quantify the costs and benefits of water reuse projects for irrigation identifying potential projects with higher net benefits and hence contributing to the development of cba in water reuse the work provides a method for prioritizing wastewater reuse projects in agriculture irrigation we use the upper guadiana in central spain as a case study to arrange candidate reuse projects according to their cost and benefit ratio the proposed method streamlines the process through the minimization of input data wastewater treatment plant location and capacity potential clients location and water use as a novelty the definition of the pipe distribution network is automated through the design of an algorithm based on minimum span trees jarník 1930 prim 1957 the benefits of agricultural uses are also calculated and the methodology allows for other potential uses industrial urban of regenerated water given their water consumption and monetarized benefits the flexibility facilitates the definition of alternative scenarios and provides solid scientific evidence to support water policy decisions 1 1 study area the methodology is applied in the upper guadiana area in spain where overexploited aquifers can no longer provide for the water volumes required by agricultural users the regeneration of a portion of the wastewater generated by the urban agglomerations may alleviate the pressure on water resources the area of study comprises the groundwater bodies mancha occidental i and mancha occidental ii fig 1 in central spain the implementation of irrigation projects in the 20th century has led to the overexploitation of the groundwater bodies table 1 this has implied a drawdown of the local water level igme 2020 currently the river basin authority has restricted water abstractions to match the available renewable resources therefore permitted irrigation for herbaceous crops ranges between 2000 and 2200 m3 ha year in the case of permanent crops it is restricted to 1500 m3 ha year these figures have been further reduced to 1800m3 ha year herbaceous crops and 1350 m3 ha year permanent in 2021 due to drought conditions the guadiana river basin management plan non conventional resources section chg 2016 declares that in the deficit areas and especially in the upper guadiana subsystem water reuse will exclusively be allowed to substitute irrigation or industrial water rights that is that water reuse should be a relief to the existing abstraction and not a net increase in the water offer current water reuse in the area is marginal with 4 75 and 1 27 hm3 year being produced at the alcazar and tomelloso wastewater treatment plants wwtp chg 2016 fig 2 shows the location and relative size of the larger wwtps in the area and table 2 lists their size in population equivalent european commission 2019 2 materials and methods we propose a cba method to systematically quantify all the costs and benefits of the water reuse projects in order to assess its economic feasibility first we estimate the costs of implementing a water reuse project initial investment in the reuse plant and distribution network operation and maintenance costs using secondary data from official sources then we calculate the benefits of the additional productivity of the agricultural fields irrigated with the reused waters the methodology is summarized in fig 3 given a wwtp capacity the costs both initial investment and operation of regenerating the water to reuse standards are assessed if water uses are not simultaneous to regenerated water production a storage tank can be envisaged and its costs assessed for a geographical setup of potential users a distribution network is automatically generated through a purpose developed algorithm once the length and diameter of connection pipes is known their supply and installation cost is assessed given the relative elevation of wwtp and water users the friction head losses through the distribution network and the required water pressure at each distribution point a pumping unit is sized and the investment and operation costs are assessed the initial investment costs are then annualized using a financial function in order to perform the analysis in monetary units per year european commission 2003 on the benefit side each user is characterized by the annual volume of water required and the monetarized benefit generated by the use of the water the methodology allows for any kind of user urban industrial agriculture in the application shown in this paper a rural area in the upper guadiana in central spain the potential use is irrigation agriculture so the required annual volume and the potential benefit assessment is based on local crop data once the total costs and benefits are assessed for each candidate project the potential net benefit can be calculated and projects can be prioritized according to their investment returns the flexibility of the methodology allows for the creation of different scenarios that facilitate the optimization of the process in particular the methodology allows for the quantification of the effects of the yearly regeneration period whether the water regeneration plant works all year long or only in the irrigation months and the choice of output water quality and process technologies 2 1 data the methodology has been designed to exploit existing secondary data in order to minimize the cost of the analysis the data used in this paper has been extracted from the following databases groundwater bodies extension chg 2020 to delimitate the study area digital elevation model instituto geográfico nacional 2020 in order to calculate the elevation of each wwtp and agricultural land plot wwtps location and capacity european commission 2019 and list of authorized wastewater discharges in the study area chg 2013 local wastewater production per inhabitant ine 2020 griculture land plots shapefile with the location and surface and crop type of the agriculture land plots in the vicinity of each wwtp in order to identify the potential water users of each reuse project candidate mapa 2010 years 2000 2010 weather data and crop parameters mapa 2020 the additional gains in terms of gross margin for each crop have been calculated based on mapa 2018 2019 and fieldwork developed in the study area initial investment capex and operation and maintenance cost opex of a water

installation costs canal 2018 joint research centre 2017 oecd 2000 2 2 method cost benefit analysis 2 2 1 distribution network definition algorithm for each water reuse infrastructure project the distribution network must connect the water source the water regeneration plant to the water users irrigated plots industrial or urban users with a minimum cost while the detailed design of a distribution network requires a dedicated effort of a design team this network can be approximated through minimum span tree algorithms jarník 1930 prim 1957 the algorithm proposed in this paper bolinches et al 2021 exploits the initial data water regeneration plant position elevation and water availability water clients position elevation and water needs to design a distribution network set of pipes with initial and final positions length and diameter that connects all users to the water source minimizing the cost through the following steps the water source is defined by the coordinates elevation and annual volume of produced water of the water regeneration plant the water users are defined by the coordinates and elevation of the center point crop type and annual water demand of the land plots potentially irrigated with regenerated water the points are divided in two subsets subset a plots connected to the distribution tree and subset b plots not yet connected to the distribution tree initially subset a only contains the water regeneration plant and subset b contains all the land plots elements in subset b are arranged according to their distance to the water regeneration plant and at each step the algorithm grows the distribution tree i e adds elements from subset b to subset a by choosing the pair of elements one in subset a and another in subset b for which the connection presents the minimum cost this is done through the calculation of the cost of each candidate connection pipe from the first element in the arranged b subset i e the closest plot to the water regeneration plant which is still unconnected to the tree to each of the elements in subset a then choosing the candidate with minimum cost at each step the algorithm identifies the parent element in subset a from which the connection pipe departs child element in subset b to which the connection pipe arrives and the hydraulic parameters geometric head water consumption of child element the tree is grown sequentially until the cumulative water consumption of the land plots matches the capacity of the water regeneration plant once all pipes initial and final positions are defined the diameter of each pipe stretch is set according to the circulating flow 2 2 2 clients of water reuse volume requirements and benefits a selection of the most relevant crop types in the area was used for the analysis namely vineyard olives fruit crops almond horticulture particularly melon and onion and cereals water requirements have been calculated based on a daily water balance set for each crop using weather data and crop parameters gathered from local weather stations mapa 2020 irrigation water requirements have been estimated in 1310 m3 ha year for vineyard 2566 m3 ha year for olives 4059 m3 ha year for almond 5355 m3 ha year for horticulture and 3556 for cereals with regard to the benefits associated to crop irrigation the increase of crop gross margin per hectare is calculated comparing rain fed and irrigated cropping systems gross margin per hectare for each cropping system is obtained by subtracting production costs costs of inputs machinery and labor costs from revenues value of production estimated by multiplying average crop yields by crop prices and subsidies see table 3 the study assumes that irrigating with reclaimed wastewater would allow for changing from rain fed to irrigated crop production thus the benefits associated to reclaimed wastewater use are calculated as the difference between irrigated and rain fed crop gross margins per hectare gross margin increase in table 3 2 2 3 water regeneration plant costs the treatment of wwtp effluents to reach the reuse grade requires the implementation of infrastructure the water regeneration plant with initial investment capex and operation and maintenance opex costs these costs will depend on the technology used and the water quality required iglesias 2016 joint research centre 2017 an estimation of these costs based on the experience of previous projects simón 2018 is shown in table 4 the regenerated water quality classes are defined according to the european regulation 2020 741 european parliament and council 2020 where the most strict class a is required for all food crops consumed raw where the edible part is in direct contact with reclaimed water and root crops consumed raw and class b is required for food crops consumed raw where the edible part is produced above ground and is not in direct contact with reclaimed water processed food crops and non food crops including crops used to feed milk or meat producing animals the maximum allowed pollution for each class is defined accordingly limiting for example the escherichia coli bacterial presence to 10 units per 100 ml for class a and 100 units per 100 ml for class b the required regeneration process is then defined to guarantee these requirements in the case of class a the regeneration process can be chosen between a traditional filtration followed by ultraviolet and chemical disinfection with relatively low initial investment costs but higher operational costs or an initial ultrafiltration process with higher investment costs but relatively lower operational costs the annual equivalent investment costs in eur year eq 1 can be assessed through the annualization of initial costs throughout the infrastructure

equipment years where the lifetime of the water regeneration plant may range between 15 and 25 years and the discount rate depends on the economic conditions a 3 discount rate has been used in the baseline scenario 2 2 4 water storage costs since the water reuse time patterns may differ from the water production it is advisable to provide the system with some water storage capability it is estimated that the cost of a water storage tank ranges between 2 and 8 eur m3 joint research centre 2017 it must be noted that particular precautions must be taken to monitor the evolution of the quality of the water upon storage 2 2 5 water pipes infrastructure cost given a pipe length and diameter the supply and installation cost will depend on the material of the pipes eq 2 shows the averaged cost estimation of madrid water utility company canal isabel ii cyii and oecd for different materials canal de isabel ii 2018 oecd 2000 2 pipe cost eur m 0 019 diameter mm 1 8819 the lifetime of the distribution network is taken as 50 years 2 2 6 water pumping costs given a distribution network a pumping station is needed to provide the necessary energy to the water to reach the land plots the required pumping power is assessed through the flow and head of each water client eq 3 3 power w 1 e fficiency density kg m 3 gravity m s 2 head m flow m 3 s the total head for each water client is the addition of three factors the geometric head elevation of water point above water station which is calculated by the network algorithm from the initial data instituto geográfico nacional 2020 the water friction losses taken as a fraction which ranges from 1 to 5 of the total pipe length and water pressure required at the final point taken as 10 50 m of water column the pump efficiency can be approximated to 75 joint research centre 2017 once the required power is known the implementation cost of the pumping station can be approximated from previous literature joint research centre 2017 oecd 2000 and taking into account current prices grundfos 2021 a trend line is calculated eq 4 4 pump cost eur 1178 8 pump power kw 0 6816 to annualize the pump capex a lifetime cycle of 15 25 years can be considered the energy consumption of water is then calculated with the total head and the pumped volume the operational cost eq 5 is calculated multiplying the energy consumption and the energy

the definition of case scenarios where the consequences of different techniques and policy choices can be compared the benefits and costs of each candidate project can be analized for the different envisaged scenarios a baseline scenario is proposed with the following parameters plots are chosen according to their proximity to the wwtp regardless of their current crop type the quality of regenerated water is defined to its highest standard class a with filtration technologies that minimize initial investments taking into account that water use is concentrated in the summer months only water produced along 5 months may september is reused to avoid high storage costs the storage infrastructure is designed to contain one month of water production the following values are used regeneration capex 200 eur m3 day regeneration opex 0 18 eur m3 storage capex 5 eur m3 friction head losses 0 01 m head per linear m user pressure 30 m of water column interest rate 3 regeneration and pumping station lifetime 20 years distribution pipes lifetime 50 years a second scenario all year reuse scenario analyzes the expected costs and benefits when the water regeneration plant treats the output of the wwtp all year long since the water consumption is concentrated on spring and summer months the additional water regenerated throughout the autumn and winter months has to be stored implying an increase in storage costs the additional water supply allows tor the irrigation of supplementary water plots with additional benefits but also additional distribution and pumping costs the method quantifies these costs and benefits allowing to compare the potential benefits with respect to the baseline scenario an externality of water reuse that cannot be ignored in inland projects is the effect on surface water flows an abuse of water reuse may result in diminishing flows in surface waters and water authorities may impose minimum effluent restrictions to guarantee the sustainability of water environments downstream of the wwtp a particular scenario is built to quantify the effect of these restrictions another scenario reused water quality and technology is also proposed to assess the implications of implementing different water regeneration plant technologies achieving different output water quality among the water quality classes defined by the european regulation european parliament and council 2020 regeneration cost structures are available for class b and two different technologies achieving class a filtration and ultrafiltration the scenario compares the cost structures for each choice thus providing quantitative information for infrastructure choices 2 4 sensitivity analysis the values of the inputs chosen in the baseline scenario are estimates that may change in real life scenarios in order to assess the effect of input changes two scenarios labeled as more favorable and less favorable have been considered in the former parameters change from the baseline scenario to values which reduce costs and increase benefits in the latter parameters take values that increase costs and reduce benefits table 5 shows the values of the baseline scenario and the range of the variables cost values have been obtained from joint research center 2017 benefit values increase in annual gross margin due to irrigation per crop type have been calculated based on mapa 2018 2019 2020 the model is run iteratively in each iteration the inputs take a random value in a uniform distribution within the shown range in order to assess the robustness of the results shown for the baseline scenario 3 results 3 1 baseline scenario 3 1 1 pipe network definition this section shows the developed piping network that connects the water regeneration station to the agricultural land plots water regeneration station capacity can be calculated from wwtp discharge data or as it was the case for this implementation inferred from the population equivalent per wwtp and the local wastewater production per inhabitant fig 4 shows the networks generated by the algorithm for the considered project the detailed view of the almagro area shows how the pipes supply all the plots in the vicinity of the water regeneration station in the implementation it is assumed that the water regeneration plant and the pipe network are fully operational from the first year of implementation which is consistent with the relatively small sizes of the wwtps under study in the implementation of larger schemes a phased implementation can be considered 3 1 2 cost and benefit structure once the distribution network is defined length size and elevation the model can assess the initial investments and operational costs for each of the candidate projects fig 5 shows the results for the six main wastewater treatment plants in the study area baseline scenario the cost of regenerated water varies between 34 and 39 euro cents per cubic meter the difference among projects corresponds to the distribution network a larger dispersion of irrigated crops in the alcazar project implies longer distribution pipes and topography considerations larger pumping costs to elevated land plots it must be noted that the 3 9 euro cents per cubic meter storing costs correspond to the decision of storing the equivalent of one month regenerated water production and are subject to further optimization see paragraph 3 2 adding the benefits to the analysis allows to compare if these outweigh the costs and provide a net benefit to the project fig 6 shows the cost and benefit structure of the tomelloso project the inner ring shows the percentage of irrigated area covered by each crop type the middle ring displays the annual benefit generated by the transition from rainfed to irrigated crops showing the larger benefit potential of the vineyard crops finally the outer ring shows the annual operation cost breakdown the analysis shows that most of the benefit is generated through the irrigation of vineyard crops the higher annual cost is represented by the operation and maintenance of the water regeneration station followed by the annualized costs of the initial investment of the station these are followed by other initial costs storage and distribution infrastructure while the pumping costs are comparingly smaller this cost structure is similar in the other candidate projects since the cumulative benefits are larger than the cumulative costs the project generates a net benefit of 162 433 eur year the detailed results for each project are presented in the appendix considering the variety of assumptions the net benefit should not be taken as an absolute result but rather as a tool of comparison under the baseline assumptions candidate projects can be organized according to their return of investment fig 7 shows a wide range of results depending on the local geometry and the crop types projects with a high percentage of high value crops in the proximity of the wwtp are likely to produce net benefits while candidate projects with a bigger share of low value crops in the vicinity may present losses the methodology is able to quantify these values and provide alternative scenarios 3 2 all year reuse scenario the presence of net benefits of water reuse in some potential projects opens the question if expanding the water regeneration to all year storing the water in the winter months for a larger availability in the summer months would generate additional benefits fig 8 shows the cost and benefit structure of the reuse project if the regeneration station is exploited all year long since water use is concentrated in the summer months the storage capacity has to be resized to accommodate the additional needs here assessed to six months capacity the analysis quantifies the increase of storage costs larger tanks or ponds to accumulate the water in non irrigation periods and distribution network costs longer and bigger pipes to reach additional water users although the benefit also increases due to the additional irrigated land plots the net benefit cost ratio falls from a 31 to a 25 3 3 minimum effluent restriction scenario the minimum effluent restriction scenario described in section 2 3 is studied for the case of tomelloso wwtp where a minimum 10 effluent is considered according to the guadiana river basin management plan chg 2016 fig 9 shows the changes in total costs and benefits after the restriction is applied the minimum effluent restriction implies a limitation on the irrigated area and the crop benefit will be affected also the total cost of the project will be affected since less infrastructure is needed in this instance the minimum effluent restriction implies a reduction of 30 of the expected net benefits from 331 160 to 230 982 euros it must be noted that the effect on net benefit depends on the particular plot distribution of each project and the dependence of net benefit on available water may not be monotonically increasing and present local maxima the model allows to quantify the costs and benefits for each case 3 4 water reuse quality and technology choices the choice of the technology used to regenerate the treated wastewater has a major effect on the structure of the project costs and on the expected net benefit compared to the baseline case class a filtration the choice of ultrafiltration technology to achieve class a water quality implies a sharp increase in the initial investment of the regeneration plant although the operation and maintenance costs are reduced significantly fig 10 in this example the net benefit is reduced although the actual result will depend on each case fig 10 shows the cost structure if the water authorities considered that the irrigated crops allow for a class b regenerated water quality the lower regeneration costs would imply an increase of the expected benefits 3 5 sensitivity analysis results a sensitivity analysis is conducted through the calculation of costs and benefits for 100 instances where the input values are allowed to change within the ranges exposed in table 5 fig 11 shows the net benefit cost ratio when inputs are allowed to change within value range more favorable to less favorable the results indicate that the net benefit cost ratio relative positions are consistent with the baseline scenario prioritization the relative ranking of net benefit cost shown in fig 7 socuellamos alcazar tomelloso almagro manzanares and argamasilla stays true in all the iterations except a 5 where almagro and manzanares swap positions a closer study of the exceptions shows that this happens in iterations where the increase in annual gross margin of olive crops is particularly small penalizing the olive rich almagro area the analysis demonstrates the robustness of the model and its utility for policy assessment another result that can be extracted from the study is the sensitivity of the net benefit to changes in one of the input factors fig 12 shows the values for alcazar wwtp in the case of interest rate changes in the envisaged scenarios both a regeneration station with class b quality water and class a quality with filtration technology would produce benefits even for high interest rates in the case of the more capital intensive ultrafiltration technology the sensibility would be higher although the break even scenario would still happen at high interest rates the analysis also shows that for this case ultrafiltration technology can be cost competitive for low interest rates similar analysis can be made to take account of the volatility of other input factors such as electricity price or benefits of agricultural production and further analysis may identify the parameters with a higher influence on the outputs and assess scenario uncertainty marchau et al 2019 4 discussion the results presented show the wide variety of options available to water authorities to deal with the management of regenerated water resources the methodology allows for a quick assessment of the costs and benefits implied in different reuse projects and scenarios providing science based evidence to support water policy decisions the flexibility of the model facilitates the quantitative comparison of concrete choices such as the particular technology of the water regeneration plant the volume of the storage tank and the extent of the distribution network the baseline scenario shows that prioritization is driven by the benefits obtained rather than the cost structure that has minor differences between projects since the water regeneration costs considered section 2 2 3 are independent of the plant size the equivalent costs are equal for all candidate projects however more detailed data on these cost structures may show economy of scale advantages and diminishing costs per cubic meter for larger projects arborea et al 2017 at the same time these economies of scale may be counterbalanced by capital and operating costs of the distribution networks guo et al 2014 in this regard the methodology proposed in this research can contribute to the design of distribution networks that take full advantage of potential economies of scale the generation of a net benefit depends highly on the presence of crops where irrigation implies an important additional value previous studies calatrava et al 2011 ofori et al 2021 demonstrate that the use of alternative sources of water desalinization water reuse can be beneficial in areas with highly profitable crops in areas where agricultural plots close to the wwtps are devoted to crops for which the added value of irrigation is low some choices should be made to achieve the economic feasibility one could be to avoid the current low benefit crops and extend the water distribution network to reach existing high benefit crops this would increase the distribution and pumping costs and permanently neglect land plots in the vicinity of the water source another choice would be the change of the crop type of the land plots in the vicinity of the wwtp although more advantageous in the long term this option would imply to sacrifice the productivity of the time period required by the new crops to develop which may imply several years in the case of woody crops the proposed methodology can quantify these scenarios the length of the irrigation season is often also considered a relevant technical barrier to the exploitation of the full potential of wastewater reuse giannoccaro et al 2019 in our study we assessed the effect of all year reuse by simulating the effect of increased water storage capacity in this scenario users could benefit from the full potential of the wwtp and the unit cost per cubic meter of treated water could be reduced however the results of the analysis showed that the increased storage costs and the cost of the enlarged distribution network to reach new users would outweigh potential benefits of having additional water the results also show how critical on the benefit cost structure is the decision of the quality of reused water the choice of a less strict class within the options of annex i of the european regulation european parliament and council 2020 implies lower costs quantified in section 3 3 but also restricts current and future uses of the reclaimed water complying with the new european regulation could also imply important transaction costs e g in terms of negotiation adoption of risk assessment plans future research should take these costs into account to accurately assess new water reuse projects in line with other studies alcon et al 2013 birol et al 2010 giannoccaro et al 2019 our research indicates that the interest rate remains a key determinant of changes in net benefit for water reuse projects the interest rate and the project lifespan are consistent with the authorities recommendations european commission 2014 in the lower range of the rates for the case of the baseline scenario at higher rates only class b quality water and class a quality with filtration technology would produce net benefits interestingly at low interest rates ultrafiltration technology is also competitive this finding supports recent studies demonstrating the economic viability of ultrafiltration technology bai et al 2020 it must be noted that these decisions should take into account other externalities to the project that are not included in this analysis and should be considered for future developments the first externality is the effect on surface bodies of water the exploitation of reused water can have unintended consequences on the functioning of the integral water cycle in particular in inland areas as it is the case for the study area where the effluent from the treatment plants constitutes a non negligible part of the circulating flow through the rivers an excessive reuse could lead to a decrease in flow that compromises the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems mezger et al 2019 valerio et al 2020 or the guarantee of supply downstream of wwtp discharge points andreu et al 1996 any wastewater reuse project should analyze the impact on receiving waters and the risk to compromise the ecological flows defined by the water authorities which may impose restrictions on the minimum effluent flow as shown in section 3 3 a second externality positive in this case is the effect of the reuse project on the current extraction pressures of water resources in a context of scarcity water reuse projects should not be designed as an increment of the offer but rather as a diversification tool and a relief on the natural resources hristov et al 2021 in this case the implementation of a project should be linked to the decrease in the exploitation level of natural resources supporting the long term sustainability of the water use this contribution should be considered a non market benefit to society in many instances this benefit is neglected but it could be very high even exceeding the cost of treating wastewater for reuse alcon et al 2013 ofori et al 2021 in addition the difficulties inherent to a practical implementation of groundwater abstraction restrictions should be acknowledged groundwater abstraction policing can be challenging in particular in the area of study where even water theft has been reported loch et al 2020 another risk to be addressed is the possibility that further availability of water create an increase in water demand as identified in previous literature randall 1981 furthermore the potential effects of a water reuse project on surface water quality cannot be ignored although the positive and negative attributes and their balance may be hard to assess on the positive side the implementation of a water reuse project normally implies the reduction of the nutrient concentration in the effluent which implies a reduction in the point load pollution of the plant discharge on the negative side agricultural reuse of water may introduce new sources of non point pollution another consideration is the effect of water quality parameters on crop efficiency that are not included in the urban wastewater treatment or reuse legislation these parameters can be divided in two groups on the one hand the presence of macronutrients in the wastewater can imply a reduction in the fertilization costs of agricultural users chojnacka et al 2020 the european urban wastewater treatment directive council of the european communities 1991 does include a limitation on total nitrogen and total phosphorus on wwtp effluents but these only apply when the receiving waters are identified as sensitive to eutrophication to one of these elements there is room for additional integration of the wastewater directive and the reuse regulation for agriculture european parliament and council 2020 in this aspect to optimize the opportunities of exploiting these untapped resources minimizing the risks on the receiving waters on the other hand the presence of heavy metals and ions that increase the salinity and conductivity in regenerated urban wastewater may have a negative impact on the irrigated crops gola et al 2016 salgot and folch 2018 none of these concentrations are limited in the european legislation the negative effect may be tackled through the mixture of regenerated water with water coming from natural resources further investigation is needed to better understand the best way to combine these resources and optimize the water management in the new scenarios opened by the availability of regenerated water 5 conclusions the technological advances in water treatment and microbiological pollution reduction and the evolution of the regulation for the reuse of water for agricultural production are widening the number of water regeneration projects that are economically feasible the main conclusions can be summarized as follows the proposed methodology can analyze the relative weights of the different cost and benefits of a particular regeneration project with low requirements of initial data and time regeneration project candidates with higher potential benefits can be identified and different scenarios can be projected to optimize the choice of design variables annual volume of regenerated water storage and distribution costs regeneration technology in the upper guadiana where the methodology is applied results show that prioritization is driven by the benefits obtained rather than the cost structure that has minor differences between projects the generation of net benefits is restricted to candidate projects where high benefit crops are present in the vicinity of the wastewater treatment plant the regeneration plant initial investment and operation and maintenance costs represent the biggest portion of the overall costs with the current cost structure ultrafiltration technology is only competitive at very low interest rates having such a prominence in the cost structure further price cuts in the water regeneration technology will have a major impact in the availability of economically feasible projects several aspects require further investigation to fully assess the effect of a water regeneration project in inland locations a negative externality is the reduction in circulating waters that may affect the depending ecosystems and downstream users a positive externality is the reduction of the pressure on natural resources although its quantification remains elusive and the regulation tools that manage the transition from natural to regenerated resources are yet to be developed finally a better understanding of the effect of nutrients heavy metals and conductivity of regenerated water on irrigated crops will help to define water management policies that combine all the resources available funding this work was

9637,water reuse is a strategic priority for water authorities in europe to reduce the pressure on water resources although implementation is lagging behind expectations due to financial administrative and social acceptance concerns in this context there is a special interest to identify in which specific wastewater treatment plants it would be interesting to add a water regeneration plant taking account of potential existing clients in the vicinity and the implied costs and benefits this paper proposes a method to quantify the infrastructure and operation costs of project implementation and the benefits of the additional water offer an algorithm designs the distribution network allowing for a quick cost analysis the method is applied in the upper guadiana in central spain where irrigation led to the overexploitation of the local aquifers and the subsequent restrictions on water use taking account of the existing wastewater treatment plants candidate reuse projects are classified according to their benefit cost ratio showing large differences according to the location and potential use of the regenerated water the analysis allows for a quick assessment of the costs and benefits implied in different reuse projects and scenarios providing science based evidence to support water policy decisions graphical abstract ga1 keywords wastewater treatment reclaimed water optimization irrigation network cost benefit analysis spain 1 introduction the growing competition on water abstraction for urban industrial agricultural and other uses and the perspective of diminishing availability due to climate change are pushing the agenda for the quest of alternative water sources un water 2020 one of these sources is urban wastewater qadir et al 2003 which is normally discharged to rivers and seas after a convenient treatment an additional treatment of regeneration recycling reuse different terms are used in the literature can make these waters available for further use voulvoulis 2018 regenerated treated wastewater use is increasing it is recognized as a promising and necessary solution to alleviate water stress especially in areas where the shortages of conventional water resources is a structural problem european parliament and council 2020 in the european union eu numerous initiatives have been recently put in place to foster wastewater reuse promoting a more resource efficient circular economy the maximization of treated wastewater reuse for irrigation has been underlined as a specific objective in several communications by the commission a blueprint to safeguard europe s water resources 2012 and closing the loop an eu action plan for the circular economy 2015 and identified as a top priority in the strategic implementation plan of the european innovation partnership on water recently a new regulation eu 2020 741 has been set to facilitate the use of urban wastewater for agricultural purposes by providing harmonized minimum water quality requirements european parliament and council 2020 the regulation defines four different classes class a being the strictest of water quality depending on the contact level between the reused water and the edible part of the crop a maximum level of microbial pollution is set for each class in order to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases the regulation also requires that the input of water regeneration plants i e the output of urban wastewater treatment plants is compliant with the wastewater directive council of the european communities 1991 in sum it completes the existing eu legal framework on water the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec european parliament and council 2000 and the urban waste water treatment directive uwwtd council of the european communities 1991 although major regulatory strides have been made to boost water reuse in the eu only a small part of treated wastewater is currently reused bio deloitte 2015 the widespread implementation of water reuse projects appears to be limited due to several technical and non technical barriers alcalde sanza and gawlik 2014 licciardello et al 2018 ricart and rico 2019 van rensburg 2016 recent research on the subject claims that while technical barriers related to water reuse could largely be resolved e g through adapted irrigation systems improved storage and treatment methods xylem 2020 social and economic issues e g public acceptance and the cost of reclamation may seriously condition the success of water reuse projects and yet they are poorly investigated saliba et al 2018 smith et al 2018 economic analyses related to wastewater reuse have primarily focused on the evaluation of water reuse practices in comparison with other non conventional sources mainly desalinization lapuente 2012 much less efforts have been spent on the study of the financial and economical sustainability of wastewater reuse investments and on the prioritization of water reuse projects arborea et al 2017 arena et al 2020 although new decision support tools such as the poseidon software oertlé et al 2019 are currently being developed to support pre feasibility studies on water reuse projects cost benefit analysis cba remains the major appraisal method to assess water related investments molinos senante et al 2010 this method enables a direct comparison of the total costs and benefits of a project using a common metric monetary units in the case of wastewater treatment reuse projects its application is not straightforward one of the major difficulties in assessing the costs consists of the determination of the distribution network that connects the regenerated water plant to the final users other issues such as on site versus at source and the short term and long term nature of the cost and benefits attained e g the discount rate are also commonly discussed giannoccaro et al 2019 the paper aims to provide a method to quantify the costs and benefits of water reuse projects for irrigation identifying potential projects with higher net benefits and hence contributing to the development of cba in water reuse the work provides a method for prioritizing wastewater reuse projects in agriculture irrigation we use the upper guadiana in central spain as a case study to arrange candidate reuse projects according to their cost and benefit ratio the proposed method streamlines the process through the minimization of input data wastewater treatment plant location and capacity potential clients location and water use as a novelty the definition of the pipe distribution network is automated through the design of an algorithm based on minimum span trees jarník 1930 prim 1957 the benefits of agricultural uses are also calculated and the methodology allows for other potential uses industrial urban of regenerated water given their water consumption and monetarized benefits the flexibility facilitates the definition of alternative scenarios and provides solid scientific evidence to support water policy decisions 1 1 study area the methodology is applied in the upper guadiana area in spain where overexploited aquifers can no longer provide for the water volumes required by agricultural users the regeneration of a portion of the wastewater generated by the urban agglomerations may alleviate the pressure on water resources the area of study comprises the groundwater bodies mancha occidental i and mancha occidental ii fig 1 in central spain the implementation of irrigation projects in the 20th century has led to the overexploitation of the groundwater bodies table 1 this has implied a drawdown of the local water level igme 2020 currently the river basin authority has restricted water abstractions to match the available renewable resources therefore permitted irrigation for herbaceous crops ranges between 2000 and 2200 m3 ha year in the case of permanent crops it is restricted to 1500 m3 ha year these figures have been further reduced to 1800m3 ha year herbaceous crops and 1350 m3 ha year permanent in 2021 due to drought conditions the guadiana river basin management plan non conventional resources section chg 2016 declares that in the deficit areas and especially in the upper guadiana subsystem water reuse will exclusively be allowed to substitute irrigation or industrial water rights that is that water reuse should be a relief to the existing abstraction and not a net increase in the water offer current water reuse in the area is marginal with 4 75 and 1 27 hm3 year being produced at the alcazar and tomelloso wastewater treatment plants wwtp chg 2016 fig 2 shows the location and relative size of the larger wwtps in the area and table 2 lists their size in population equivalent european commission 2019 2 materials and methods we propose a cba method to systematically quantify all the costs and benefits of the water reuse projects in order to assess its economic feasibility first we estimate the costs of implementing a water reuse project initial investment in the reuse plant and distribution network operation and maintenance costs using secondary data from official sources then we calculate the benefits of the additional productivity of the agricultural fields irrigated with the reused waters the methodology is summarized in fig 3 given a wwtp capacity the costs both initial investment and operation of regenerating the water to reuse standards are assessed if water uses are not simultaneous to regenerated water production a storage tank can be envisaged and its costs assessed for a geographical setup of potential users a distribution network is automatically generated through a purpose developed algorithm once the length and diameter of connection pipes is known their supply and installation cost is assessed given the relative elevation of wwtp and water users the friction head losses through the distribution network and the required water pressure at each distribution point a pumping unit is sized and the investment and operation costs are assessed the initial investment costs are then annualized using a financial function in order to perform the analysis in monetary units per year european commission 2003 on the benefit side each user is characterized by the annual volume of water required and the monetarized benefit generated by the use of the water the methodology allows for any kind of user urban industrial agriculture in the application shown in this paper a rural area in the upper guadiana in central spain the potential use is irrigation agriculture so the required annual volume and the potential benefit assessment is based on local crop data once the total costs and benefits are assessed for each candidate project the potential net benefit can be calculated and projects can be prioritized according to their investment returns the flexibility of the methodology allows for the creation of different scenarios that facilitate the optimization of the process in particular the methodology allows for the quantification of the effects of the yearly regeneration period whether the water regeneration plant works all year long or only in the irrigation months and the choice of output water quality and process technologies 2 1 data the methodology has been designed to exploit existing secondary data in order to minimize the cost of the analysis the data used in this paper has been extracted from the following databases groundwater bodies extension chg 2020 to delimitate the study area digital elevation model instituto geográfico nacional 2020 in order to calculate the elevation of each wwtp and agricultural land plot wwtps location and capacity european commission 2019 and list of authorized wastewater discharges in the study area chg 2013 local wastewater production per inhabitant ine 2020 griculture land plots shapefile with the location and surface and crop type of the agriculture land plots in the vicinity of each wwtp in order to identify the potential water users of each reuse project candidate mapa 2010 years 2000 2010 weather data and crop parameters mapa 2020 the additional gains in

installation costs canal 2018 joint research centre 2017 oecd 2000 2 2 method cost benefit analysis 2 2 1 distribution network definition algorithm for each water reuse infrastructure project the distribution network must connect the water source the water regeneration plant to the water users irrigated plots industrial or urban users with a minimum cost while the detailed design of a distribution network requires a dedicated effort of a design team this network can be approximated through minimum span tree algorithms jarník 1930 prim 1957 the algorithm proposed in this paper bolinches et al 2021 exploits the initial data water regeneration plant position elevation and water availability water clients position elevation and water needs to design a distribution network set of pipes with initial and final positions length and diameter that connects all users to the water source minimizing the cost through the following steps the water source is defined by the coordinates elevation and annual volume of produced water of the water regeneration plant the water users are defined by the coordinates and elevation of the center point crop type and annual water demand of the land plots potentially irrigated with regenerated water the points are divided in two subsets subset a plots connected to the distribution tree and subset b plots not yet connected to the distribution tree initially subset a only contains the water regeneration plant and subset b contains all the land plots elements in subset b are arranged according to their distance to the water regeneration plant and at each step the algorithm grows the distribution tree i e adds elements from subset b to subset a by choosing the pair of elements one in subset a and another in subset b for which the connection presents the minimum cost this is done through the calculation of the cost of each candidate connection pipe from the first element in the arranged b subset i e the closest plot to the water regeneration plant which is still unconnected to the tree to each of the elements in subset a then choosing the candidate with minimum cost at each step the algorithm identifies the parent element in subset a from which the connection pipe departs child element in subset b to which the connection pipe arrives and the hydraulic parameters geometric head water consumption of child element the tree is grown sequentially until the cumulative water consumption of the land plots matches the capacity of the water regeneration plant once all pipes initial and final positions are defined the diameter of each pipe stretch is set according to the circulating flow 2 2 2 clients of water reuse volume requirements and benefits a selection of the most relevant crop types in the area was used for the analysis namely vineyard olives fruit crops almond horticulture particularly melon and onion and cereals water requirements have been calculated based on a daily water balance set for each crop using weather data and crop parameters gathered from local weather stations mapa 2020 irrigation water requirements have been estimated in 1310 m3 ha year for vineyard 2566 m3 ha year for olives 4059 m3 ha year for almond 5355 m3 ha year for horticulture and 3556 for cereals with regard to the benefits associated to crop irrigation the increase of crop gross margin per hectare is calculated comparing rain fed and irrigated cropping systems gross margin per hectare for each cropping system is obtained by subtracting production costs costs of inputs machinery and labor costs from revenues value of production estimated by multiplying average crop yields by crop prices and subsidies see table 3 the study assumes that irrigating with reclaimed wastewater would allow for changing from rain fed to irrigated crop production thus the benefits associated to reclaimed wastewater use are calculated as the difference between irrigated and rain fed crop gross margins per hectare gross margin increase in table 3 2 2 3 water regeneration plant costs the treatment of wwtp effluents to reach the reuse grade requires the implementation of infrastructure the water regeneration plant with initial investment capex and operation and maintenance opex costs these costs will depend on the technology used and the water quality required iglesias 2016 joint research centre 2017 an estimation of these costs based on the experience of previous projects simón 2018 is shown in table 4 the regenerated water quality classes are defined according to the european regulation 2020 741 european parliament and council 2020 where the most strict class a is required for all food crops consumed raw where the edible part is in direct contact with reclaimed water and root crops consumed raw and class b is required for food crops consumed raw where the edible part is produced above ground and is not in direct contact with reclaimed water processed food crops and non food crops including crops used to feed milk or meat producing animals the maximum allowed pollution for each class is defined accordingly limiting for example the escherichia coli bacterial presence to 10 units per 100 ml for class a and 100 units per 100 ml for class b the required regeneration process is then defined to guarantee these requirements in the case of class a the regeneration process can be chosen between a traditional filtration followed by ultraviolet and chemical disinfection with relatively low initial investment costs but higher operational costs or an initial ultrafiltration process with higher investment costs but relatively lower operational costs the annual equivalent investment costs in eur year eq 1 can be assessed through the annualization of initial costs throughout the infrastructure

equipment years where the lifetime of the water regeneration plant may range between 15 and 25 years and the discount rate depends on the economic conditions a 3 discount rate has been used in the baseline scenario 2 2 4 water storage costs since the water reuse time patterns may differ from the water production it is advisable to provide the system with some water storage capability it is estimated that the cost of a water storage tank ranges between 2 and 8 eur m3 joint research centre 2017 it must be noted that particular precautions must be taken to monitor the evolution of the quality of the water upon storage 2 2 5 water pipes infrastructure cost given a pipe length and diameter the supply and installation cost will depend on the material of the pipes eq 2 shows the averaged cost estimation of madrid water utility company canal isabel ii cyii and oecd for different materials canal de isabel ii 2018 oecd 2000 2 pipe cost eur m 0 019 diameter mm 1 8819 the lifetime of the distribution network is taken as 50 years 2 2 6 water pumping costs given a distribution network a pumping station is needed to provide the necessary energy to the water to reach the land plots the required pumping power is assessed through the flow and head of each water client eq 3 3 power w 1 e fficiency density kg m 3 gravity m s 2 head m flow m 3 s the total head for each water client is the addition of three factors the geometric head elevation of water point above water station which is calculated by the network algorithm from the initial data instituto geográfico nacional 2020 the water friction losses taken as a fraction which ranges from 1 to 5 of the total pipe length and water pressure required at the final point taken as 10 50 m of water column the pump efficiency can be approximated to 75 joint research centre 2017 once the required power is known the implementation cost of the pumping station can be approximated from previous literature joint research centre 2017 oecd 2000 and taking into account current prices grundfos 2021 a trend line is calculated eq 4 4 pump cost eur 1178 8 pump power kw 0 6816 to annualize the pump capex a lifetime cycle of 15 25 years can be considered the energy consumption of water is then calculated with the total head and the pumped volume the operational cost eq 5 is calculated multiplying the energy consumption and the energy

the definition of case scenarios where the consequences of different techniques and policy choices can be compared the benefits and costs of each candidate project can be analized for the different envisaged scenarios a baseline scenario is proposed with the following parameters plots are chosen according to their proximity to the wwtp regardless of their current crop type the quality of regenerated water is defined to its highest standard class a with filtration technologies that minimize initial investments taking into account that water use is concentrated in the summer months only water produced along 5 months may september is reused to avoid high storage costs the storage infrastructure is designed to contain one month of water production the following values are used regeneration capex 200 eur m3 day regeneration opex 0 18 eur m3 storage capex 5 eur m3 friction head losses 0 01 m head per linear m user pressure 30 m of water column interest rate 3 regeneration and pumping station lifetime 20 years distribution pipes lifetime 50 years a second scenario all year reuse scenario analyzes the expected costs and benefits when the water regeneration plant treats the output of the wwtp all year long since the water consumption is concentrated on spring and summer months the additional water regenerated throughout the autumn and winter months has to be stored implying an increase in storage costs the additional water supply allows tor the irrigation of supplementary water plots with additional benefits but also additional distribution and pumping costs the method quantifies these costs and benefits allowing to compare the potential benefits with respect to the baseline scenario an externality of water reuse that cannot be ignored in inland projects is the effect on surface water flows an abuse of water reuse may result in diminishing flows in surface waters and water authorities may impose minimum effluent restrictions to guarantee the sustainability of water environments downstream of the wwtp a particular scenario is built to quantify the effect of these restrictions another scenario reused water quality and technology is also proposed to assess the implications of implementing different water regeneration plant technologies achieving different output water quality among the water quality classes defined by the european regulation european parliament and council 2020 regeneration cost structures are available for class b and two different technologies achieving class a filtration and ultrafiltration the scenario compares the cost structures for each choice thus providing quantitative information for infrastructure choices 2 4 sensitivity analysis the values of the inputs chosen in the baseline scenario are estimates that may change in real life scenarios in order to assess the effect of input changes two scenarios labeled as more favorable and less favorable have been considered in the former parameters change from the baseline scenario to values which reduce costs and increase benefits in the latter parameters take values that increase costs and reduce benefits table 5 shows the values of the baseline scenario and the range of the variables cost values have been obtained from joint research center 2017 benefit values increase in annual gross margin due to irrigation per crop type have been calculated based on mapa 2018 2019 2020 the model is run iteratively in each iteration the inputs take a random value in a uniform distribution within the shown range in order to assess the robustness of the results shown for the baseline scenario 3 results 3 1 baseline scenario 3 1 1 pipe network definition this section shows the developed piping network that connects the water regeneration station to the agricultural land plots water regeneration station capacity can be calculated from wwtp discharge data or as it was the case for this implementation inferred from the population equivalent per wwtp and the local wastewater production per inhabitant fig 4 shows the networks generated by the algorithm for the considered project the detailed view of the almagro area shows how the pipes supply all the plots in the vicinity of the water regeneration station in the implementation it is assumed that the water regeneration plant and the pipe network are fully operational from the first year of implementation which is consistent with the relatively small sizes of the wwtps under study in the implementation of larger schemes a phased implementation can be considered 3 1 2 cost and benefit structure once the distribution network is defined length size and elevation the model can assess the initial investments and operational costs for each of the candidate projects fig 5 shows the results for the six main wastewater treatment plants in the study area baseline scenario the cost of regenerated water varies between 34 and 39 euro cents per cubic meter the difference among projects corresponds to the distribution network a larger dispersion of irrigated crops in the alcazar project implies longer distribution pipes and topography considerations larger pumping costs to elevated land plots it must be noted that the 3 9 euro cents per cubic meter storing costs correspond to the decision of storing the equivalent of one month regenerated water production and are subject to further optimization see paragraph 3 2 adding the benefits to the analysis allows to compare if these outweigh the costs and provide a net benefit to the project fig 6 shows the cost and benefit structure of the tomelloso project the inner ring shows the percentage of irrigated area covered by each crop type the middle ring displays the annual benefit generated by the transition from rainfed to irrigated crops showing the larger benefit potential of the vineyard crops finally the outer ring shows the annual operation cost breakdown the analysis shows that most of the benefit is generated through the irrigation of vineyard crops the higher annual cost is represented by the operation and maintenance of the water regeneration station followed by the annualized costs of the initial investment of the station these are followed by other initial costs storage and distribution infrastructure while the pumping costs are comparingly smaller this cost structure is similar in the other candidate projects since the cumulative benefits are larger than the cumulative costs the project generates a net benefit of 162 433 eur year the detailed results for each project are presented in the appendix considering the variety of assumptions the net benefit should not be taken as an absolute result but rather as a tool of comparison under the baseline assumptions candidate projects can be organized according to their return of investment fig 7 shows a wide range of results depending on the local geometry and the crop types projects with a high percentage of high value crops in the proximity of the wwtp are likely to produce net benefits while candidate projects with a bigger share of low value crops in the vicinity may present losses the methodology is able to quantify these values and provide alternative scenarios 3 2 all year reuse scenario the presence of net benefits of water reuse in some potential projects opens the question if expanding the water regeneration to all year storing the water in the winter months for a larger availability in the summer months would generate additional benefits fig 8 shows the cost and benefit structure of the reuse project if the regeneration station is exploited all year long since water use is concentrated in the summer months the storage capacity has to be resized to accommodate the additional needs here assessed to six months capacity the analysis quantifies the increase of storage costs larger tanks or ponds to accumulate the water in non irrigation periods and distribution network costs longer and bigger pipes to reach additional water users although the benefit also increases due to the additional irrigated land plots the net benefit cost ratio falls from a 31 to a 25 3 3 minimum effluent restriction scenario the minimum effluent restriction scenario described in section 2 3 is studied for the case of tomelloso wwtp where a minimum 10 effluent is considered according to the guadiana river basin management plan chg 2016 fig 9 shows the changes in total costs and benefits after the restriction is applied the minimum effluent restriction implies a limitation on the irrigated area and the crop benefit will be affected also the total cost of the project will be affected since less infrastructure is needed in this instance the minimum effluent restriction implies a reduction of 30 of the expected net benefits from 331 160 to 230 982 euros it must be noted that the effect on net benefit depends on the particular plot distribution of each project and the dependence of net benefit on available water may not be monotonically increasing and present local maxima the model allows to quantify the costs and benefits for each case 3 4 water reuse quality and technology choices the choice of the technology used to regenerate the treated wastewater has a major effect on the structure of the project costs and on the expected net benefit compared to the baseline case class a filtration the choice of ultrafiltration technology to achieve class a water quality implies a sharp increase in the initial investment of the regeneration plant although the operation and maintenance costs are reduced significantly fig 10 in this example the net benefit is reduced although the actual result will depend on each case fig 10 shows the cost structure if the water authorities considered that the irrigated crops allow for a class b regenerated water quality the lower regeneration costs would imply an increase of the expected benefits 3 5 sensitivity analysis results a sensitivity analysis is conducted through the calculation of costs and benefits for 100 instances where the input values are allowed to change within the ranges exposed in table 5 fig 11 shows the net benefit cost ratio when inputs are allowed to change within value range more favorable to less favorable the results indicate that the net benefit cost ratio relative positions are consistent with the baseline scenario prioritization the relative ranking of net benefit cost shown in fig 7 socuellamos alcazar tomelloso almagro manzanares and argamasilla stays true in all the iterations except a 5 where almagro and manzanares swap positions a closer study of the exceptions shows that this happens in iterations where the increase in annual gross margin of olive crops is particularly small penalizing the olive rich almagro area the analysis demonstrates the robustness of the model and its utility for policy assessment another result that can be extracted from the study is the sensitivity of the net benefit to changes in one of the input factors fig 12 shows the values for alcazar wwtp in the case of interest rate changes in the envisaged scenarios both a regeneration station with class b quality water and class a quality with filtration technology would produce benefits even for high interest rates in the case of the more capital intensive ultrafiltration technology the sensibility would be higher although the break even scenario would still happen at high interest rates the analysis also shows that for this case ultrafiltration technology can be cost competitive for low interest rates similar analysis can be made to take account of the volatility of other input factors such as electricity price or benefits of agricultural production and further analysis may identify the parameters with a higher influence on the outputs and assess scenario uncertainty marchau et al 2019 4 discussion the results presented show the wide variety of options available to water authorities to deal with the management of regenerated water resources the methodology allows for a quick assessment of the costs and benefits implied in different reuse projects and scenarios providing science based evidence to support water policy decisions the flexibility of the model facilitates the quantitative comparison of concrete choices such as the particular technology of the water regeneration plant the volume of the storage tank and the extent of the distribution network the baseline scenario shows that prioritization is driven by the benefits obtained rather than the cost structure that has minor differences between projects since the water regeneration costs considered section 2 2 3 are independent of the plant size the equivalent costs are equal for all candidate projects however more detailed data on these cost structures may show economy of scale advantages and diminishing costs per cubic meter for larger projects arborea et al 2017 at the same time these economies of scale may be counterbalanced by capital and operating costs of the distribution networks guo et al 2014 in this regard the methodology proposed in this research can contribute to the design of distribution networks that take full advantage of potential economies of scale the generation of a net benefit depends highly on the presence of crops where irrigation implies an important additional value previous studies calatrava et al 2011 ofori et al 2021 demonstrate that the use of alternative sources of water desalinization water reuse can be beneficial in areas with highly profitable crops in areas where agricultural plots close to the wwtps are devoted to crops for which the added value of irrigation is low some choices should be made to achieve the economic feasibility one could be to avoid the current low benefit crops and extend the water distribution network to reach existing high benefit crops this would increase the distribution and pumping costs and permanently neglect land plots in the vicinity of the water source another choice would be the change of the crop type of the land plots in the vicinity of the wwtp although more advantageous in the long term this option would imply to sacrifice the productivity of the time period required by the new crops to develop which may imply several years in the case of woody crops the proposed methodology can quantify these scenarios the length of the irrigation season is often also considered a relevant technical barrier to the exploitation of the full potential of wastewater reuse giannoccaro et al 2019 in our study we assessed the effect of all year reuse by simulating the effect of increased water storage capacity in this scenario users could benefit from the full potential of the wwtp and the unit cost per cubic meter of treated water could be reduced however the results of the analysis showed that the increased storage costs and the cost of the enlarged distribution network to reach new users would outweigh potential benefits of having additional water the results also show how critical on the benefit cost structure is the decision of the quality of reused water the choice of a less strict class within the options of annex i of the european regulation european parliament and council 2020 implies lower costs quantified in section 3 3 but also restricts current and future uses of the reclaimed water complying with the new european regulation could also imply important transaction costs e g in terms of negotiation adoption of risk assessment plans future research should take these costs into account to accurately assess new water reuse projects in line with other studies alcon et al 2013 birol et al 2010 giannoccaro et al 2019 our research indicates that the interest rate remains a key determinant of changes in net benefit for water reuse projects the interest rate and the project lifespan are consistent with the authorities recommendations european commission 2014 in the lower range of the rates for the case of the baseline scenario at higher rates only class b quality water and class a quality with filtration technology would produce net benefits interestingly at low interest rates ultrafiltration technology is also competitive this finding supports recent studies demonstrating the economic viability of ultrafiltration technology bai et al 2020 it must be noted that these decisions should take into account other externalities to the project that are not included in this analysis and should be considered for future developments the first externality is the effect on surface bodies of water the exploitation of reused water can have unintended consequences on the functioning of the integral water cycle in particular in inland areas as it is the case for the study area where the effluent from the treatment plants constitutes a non negligible part of the circulating flow through the rivers an excessive reuse could lead to a decrease in flow that compromises the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems mezger et al 2019 valerio et al 2020 or the guarantee of supply downstream of wwtp discharge points andreu et al 1996 any wastewater reuse project should analyze the impact on receiving waters and the risk to compromise the ecological flows defined by the water authorities which may impose restrictions on the minimum effluent flow as shown in section 3 3 a second externality positive in this case is the effect of the reuse project on the current extraction pressures of water resources in a context of scarcity water reuse projects should not be designed as an increment of the offer but rather as a diversification tool and a relief on the natural resources hristov et al 2021 in this case the implementation of a project should be linked to the decrease in the exploitation level of natural resources supporting the long term sustainability of the water use this contribution should be considered a non market benefit to society in many instances this benefit is neglected but it could be very high even exceeding the cost of treating wastewater for reuse alcon et al 2013 ofori et al 2021 in addition the difficulties inherent to a practical implementation of groundwater abstraction restrictions should be acknowledged groundwater abstraction policing can be challenging in particular in the area of study where even water theft has been reported loch et al 2020 another risk to be addressed is the possibility that further availability of water create an increase in water demand as identified in previous literature randall 1981 furthermore the potential effects of a water reuse project on surface water quality cannot be ignored although the positive and negative attributes and their balance may be hard to assess on the positive side the implementation of a water reuse project normally implies the reduction of the nutrient concentration in the effluent which implies a reduction in the point load pollution of the plant discharge on the negative side agricultural reuse of water may introduce new sources of non point pollution another consideration is the effect of water quality parameters on crop efficiency that are not included in the urban wastewater treatment or reuse legislation these parameters can be divided in two groups on the one hand the presence of macronutrients in the wastewater can imply a reduction in the fertilization costs of agricultural users chojnacka et al 2020 the european urban wastewater treatment directive council of the european communities 1991 does include a limitation on total nitrogen and total phosphorus on wwtp effluents but these only apply when the receiving waters are identified as sensitive to eutrophication to one of these elements there is room for additional integration of the wastewater directive and the reuse regulation for agriculture european parliament and council 2020 in this aspect to optimize the opportunities of exploiting these untapped resources minimizing the risks on the receiving waters on the other hand the presence of heavy metals and ions that increase the salinity and conductivity in regenerated urban wastewater may have a negative impact on the irrigated crops gola et al 2016 salgot and folch 2018 none of these concentrations are limited in the european legislation the negative effect may be tackled through the mixture of regenerated water with water coming from natural resources further investigation is needed to better understand the best way to combine these resources and optimize the water management in the new scenarios opened by the availability of regenerated water 5 conclusions the technological advances in water treatment and microbiological pollution reduction and the evolution of the regulation for the reuse of water for agricultural production are widening the number of water regeneration projects that are economically feasible the main conclusions can be summarized as follows the proposed methodology can analyze the relative weights of the different cost and benefits of a particular regeneration project with low requirements of initial data and time regeneration project candidates with higher potential benefits can be identified and different scenarios can be projected to optimize the choice of design variables annual volume of regenerated water storage and distribution costs regeneration technology in the upper guadiana where the methodology is applied results show that prioritization is driven by the benefits obtained rather than the cost structure that has minor differences between projects the generation of net benefits is restricted to candidate projects where high benefit crops are present in the vicinity of the wastewater treatment plant the regeneration plant initial investment and operation and maintenance costs represent the biggest portion of the overall costs with the current cost structure ultrafiltration technology is only competitive at very low interest rates having such a prominence in the cost structure further price cuts in the water regeneration technology will have a major impact in the availability of economically feasible projects several aspects require further investigation to fully assess the effect of a water regeneration project in inland locations a negative externality is the reduction in circulating waters that may affect the depending ecosystems and downstream users a positive externality is the reduction of the pressure on natural resources although its quantification remains elusive and the regulation tools that manage the transition from natural to regenerated resources are yet to be developed finally a better understanding of the effect of nutrients heavy metals and conductivity of regenerated water on irrigated crops will help to define water management policies that combine all the resources available funding this work was

development strategies 4 provide scientific support for sustainable agricultural development and ecological protection in the yrb based on the n flow routes influencing factors and local conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river is the fifth longest river in the world and the second longest in china the yellow river originates from the bayan har mountains in qinghai province and flows through nine provinces including qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong and finally flows into the bohai sea in kenli district dongying city shandong province fig 1 qinghai province has the largest area on the yellow river basin 153 000 km2 accounting for 19 1 of the total area of the yrb and shandong province has the lowest area with only 13 000 km2 approximately 1 6 of the total basin area table 1 2 2 nufer model and calculations the nufer model is a nutrient flow model developed by ma et al 2010 to study nutrients flow in food chain at regional and national scales the nufer model can quantitatively analyze the flow characteristics and loss of n and other nutrients in cropping and animal farming systems and is widely used to evaluate nutrients in multiple regions of china ma et al 2010 2012 2018 all the nine provinces that the yrb passes through were selected as the research area which mainly includes two systems of crop and animal husbandry production the model was composed of four modules input calculation optimization and output the main calculation formulas are as follows 1 n intake of import feed n content in animal production n content in main product n content of straw feed 2 total n content in crop system n content in fertilizer n content in crop production deposition total n content in crop production nitrogen fixation total n content in straw n content in manure 3 total n content in livestock system n content in total animal production including meat bone egg and milk n content in total animal manure n content in total nh3 manure storage n content in total field manure 4 total system n loss crop system n loss nh3 n2o denitrification leaching runoff and erosion livestock system n loss direct n discharge excrement treatment storage n volatilization and n excretion n was calculated as kg hm2 agricultural land the research boundary is the same as that in the nufer model 2 3 green development evaluation to quantitatively evaluate the agricultural green development of the yrb based on the connotation and theoretical framework of agricultural green development ma et al 2020 we have referred to the chinese agricultural green development index system j j zhang et al 2020 and its grading standards furthermore the agricultural green development system analysis coupling model nutrient flows in food chains environment and resources use agricultural green development nufer agd was applied to further analyze and clarify the key factors restricting the agricultural green development jin et al 2020 the nufer agd model conducts a comprehensive analysis of the selected indicators to reflect its integrity based on the classification and grading standards of agricultural green development indicators 50 indicators were selected which were divided into direct indirect and self selected indicators including social development economic growth agricultural production resource input and ecological environment all indicators were divided into four levels based on the degree of green development indicators that could not be calculated temporarily are indicated with an asterisk table 2 selected indicators and grading standards are listed in table 2 the selection of indicators can clarify the bottlenecks and restrictive factors of the green development of agriculture in the yrb via analysis and a strategy was proposed for scientifically promoting the future green development of agriculture in the yrb 2 4 data collection the area of arable land sown area and output of the main crops amount of chemical fertilizers stock of various animals in animal husbandry and the number of slaughters were obtained from the national bureau of statistics and the statistical yearbooks of the nine provinces and cities in the yrb 1999 2009 and 2019 the crop grass to grain ratio n fixation number of different crops nutrient content and emission coefficient parameters involved in the model parameters were derived from the literature bi et al 2009 li and jin 2011 lu et al 1996 ma et al 2012 the n content of the fodder and animal products was obtained from the nufer model ma et al 2012 3 results 3 1 characteristics of n flow with time from 1999 2019 the amount of n input in the overall cropping and animal farming systems of the yrb increased from 2 10 107 t to 3 66 107 t mainly from fertilizer input from 2009 to 2019 after implementing the zero growth policy for chemical fertilizers the amount of n applied remained stable in the past 20 years the n input in feed imports has gradually increased from 4 6 106 t in 1999 1 45 107 t in 2019 accounting for an increase in total n input from 21 92 in 1999 to 39 54 in 2019 therefore the cumulative effect of feed on system n increased annually in addition the amount of n input into the yrb in the form of atmospheric deposition and biological n fixation has remained stable for the past 20 years atmospheric deposition increased from 1 541 106 t in 1999 1 97 106 t in 2019 and the amount of biological n fixation increased from 6 32 105 t in 1999 7 84 105 t in 2019 fig 2a the environmental loss of n was divided into two main parts one part was discharged into the atmosphere via gaseous forms such as ammonia volatilization nitrous oxide and n and the other part flowed into the surface water and groundwater via leaching and runoff from 1999 2019 the total n loss increased from 8 27 106 t to 13 77 106 t an increase of 66 57 in 2019 7 31 106 t n was lost through ammonia volatilization 1 84 105 t n was discharged in the form of n2o 13 52 105 t n was discharged from denitrification and the amount of n discharged into the atmosphere reached 59 67 105 t in addition n was discharged into the water bodies via leaching runoff and erosion the amount of n in gaseous form reached 23 01 105 t and the amount of n discharged into gas was 2 59 times of n in gaseous form compared to 1999 the amount of n lost through ammonia volatilization increased by 28 75 105 t the amount of n loss by n2o emissions and because of denitrification increased by 1 18 105 t and 9 53 105 t respectively the amount of n loss by leaching increased by 11 91 106 t fig 2b 3 2 characteristics of n flow in different regions n flow in different regions of the yrb changed with variations in the structure of the cropping and animal farming systems in the crop production system the main n input came from fertilizers in terms of the time series ningxia inner mongolia shanxi shaanxi and henan showed sustained growth in n fertilizer amounts among them henan province and inner mongolia increased n fertilizers by 266 87 104 t and 142 43 104 t respectively in the output of the production system the main crop products comprised the main part of the n output over 20 years the crop output of the yrb increased to varying degrees in different provinces henan province had the largest growth from 112 72 104 t in 1999 177 83 104 t in 2019 an increase of 65 11 104 t n which followed by inner mongolia and shandong province with an increase of 54 98 104 t and 28 34 104 t from 1999 to 2019 respectively among n losses in the output of the production system in 2019 ammonia volatilization was 730 62 104 t accounting for 30 50 of the total loss making it the main source of n loss fig 3 in the animal husbandry production system most inputs are from external fodder and the n structure of feed has changed significantly over the past 20 years from 1999 2019 inner mongolia shandong and shanxi received the largest increase in external fodder input by 85 24 104 t 43 91 104 t and 23 88 104 t respectively the output of livestock production systems was divided into animal products and manure from 1999 2019 the main n output from animal products increased from 60 65 104 t to 160 98 104 t which was mostly in inner mongolia shandong and henan provinces with increases of 18 61 104 t 12 91 104 t and 11 88 104 t respectively the main form of n loss in animal farming systems is from manure organic fertilizer in 2019 manure organic fertilizer was accounted for the majority of cropping and animal farming systems of sichuan henan and shandong provinces the manure amount was 142 65 104 t 142 67 104 t and 141 64 104 t respectively in these three provinces fig 4 3 3 characteristics of spatial distribution of n flow from the total n input per unit area in 2019 the highest value was in ningxia province reaching 635 51 kg hm2 and the lowest value was in qinghai province where the input amount reached 368 14 kg hm2 based on the n input amount the entire yrb was divided into three levels the first level 400 kg hm2 included qinghai and sichuan provinces the second level 400 600 kg hm2 included gansu inner mongolia shanxi shaanxi henan and shandong provinces and the third level 600 kg hm2 included ningxia province the area with the highest n fertilizer input was henan province where the n input per unit area reached 448 22 kg hm2 qinghai province had the highest fodder input with an input per unit area of 224 01 kg hm2 the region with the lowest n fertilizer input was sichuan province with 85 70 kg hm2 however the highest amount of biological n fixation and atmospheric deposition occurred in sichuan province and the amounts of n per unit area were 17 51 kg hm2 and 47 87 kg hm2 respectively in contrast the lowest amount of biological n fixation and atmospheric deposition were found in qinghai province where the n contents per unit area were 8 91 kg hm2 and 21 40 kg hm2 respectively the lowest feed import volume occurred in shaanxi province at 70 40 kg hm2 fig 5 based on the results of n loss in the entire cropping and animal farming systems of the yrb in 2019 ammonia volatilization soil runoff erosion and leaching were the main loss pathways the spatial loss characteristics of the yrb varied greatly across the provinces based on the amount of n loss per unit area of arable land in 2019 the yrb was divided into three levels the first level 200 kg n hm2 included gansu shanxi and shandong provinces the second level 200 250 kg n hm2 included qinghai sichuan ningxia and henan provinces and the third level 250 kg n hm2 included inner mongolia and shaanxi provinces the amount of n loss was consistent with the agricultural development of each province from the perspective of the entire watershed the highest n loss occurred in inner mongolia 447 57 kg hm2 and the lowest was in gansu province 134 92 kg hm2 the areas with the highest and lowest n losses denitrification were consistent with the ammonia volatilization area the ammonia volatilization in inner mongolia shaanxi and henan provinces were relatively high at 224 56 kg hm2 135 37 kg hm2 and 129 66 kg hm2 respectively gansu province had the lowest n losses from runoff erosion and leaching with 10 65 kg hm2 and 25 79 kg hm2 respectively fig 6 3 4 evaluation of green development change based on the statistics and classification of 50 indicators in the yrb in 2019 the first and second level indicators combined accounted for 52 of the total the third level indicators accounted for 30 and the fourth level indicators accounted for 6 the non calculated index accounted for 12 the development of green agriculture in the yrb is ongoing among the first and second level indicators agricultural productivity and ecological environment accounted for 54 of the overall indicators therefore to promote green agriculture it is essential to improve productivity and solve environmental pollution problems fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 temporal characteristics of n flow the total amount of n input in the cropping and animal farming production systems of the yrb have been increasing between 1999 and 2019 it increased by 1 56 107 t based on the composition of n input the main reasons for this increase were the excessive application of n fertilizer and the input of imported fodder in the yangtze river basin the main agricultural source of n is synthetic fertilizer chen et al 2020 with the increase in the planting area and planting ratio of cash crops blind and excessive fertilization caused a continuous increase in the n input of the system resulting in low nutrient use efficiency which is consistent with the main reason for the low n use efficiency of the chinese agricultural systems ma et al 2012 the main direction of development in the planting industry must be improved through effectively applying science and technology improve product quality and increase the utilization rate of n because of the transformation of production methods animal husbandry systems have a high dependence rate on exogenous n furthermore lagging management of livestock and poultry manure and insufficient attention to nutrient recycling resulted in a low rate of manure and urine nitrogen returning to the field but a high risk of environmental emissions the management of livestock and poultry manure should be improved and the proportion and quantity of nutrients circulating in farmland increased to reduce n losses the flow of n between the cropping and animal farming systems of the yrb that it relies on fertilizers and nutrients to input grain and fodder production and the rapid development of intensive animal husbandry reflects the shortcomings of nutrient management in cropping and animal husbandry the separation of cropping and animal husbandry is an important reason for the low utilization rate of n combining cropping and animal husbandry is the only way to solve the environmental problem of n loss and develop sustainable intensive agriculture 4 2 spatial characteristics of n flow the distribution of n input and loss in the cropping and animal farming systems of the yrb are not balanced among regions based on the classification of n input and loss the yrb provinces were divided into three types the provinces in the upper reaches of the yrb were low input and high emission agricultural production methods in this region are backward and focus on animal husbandry development attention should be given to managing nutrient during animal husbandry production and nutrient planning for combined cropping and animal farming the high environmental emissions are due to the low return rate of livestock and poultry manure and urine it is necessary to improve the utilization of nutrients reduce the input of external n increase the proportion of local fodder in the region establish a better breeding structure and integrate resources the provinces in the middle reaches of the yrb were high input and high emission the cropping system in this area relies on fertilizer input and the animal husbandry system has a low nutrient recycling rate it is imperative to focus on the rational utilization of nutrients paying attention to nutrient recycling and reuse popularizing scientific fertilization concepts increasing the area of grain and fodder crops strengthening the conversion and utilization of straw and forage crops in the area changing the separation of planting and animal husbandry production methods and rationally distributing resources the provinces in the lower reaches of the yrb were high input and low emission the region is pursuing the economic benefits of agriculture with high consumption and input of nitrogen fertilizer and other production factors it is necessary to introduce scientific planting technology pay attention to the reasonable input of fertilizers in farmland production effectively integrate land resources strengthen the degree of integration of cropping and animal farming and increase nutrient utilization based on the different planting structures different crop needs and farmers habits among provinces reasonable adjustments of n input strengthening the coordinated management of nutrients between provinces optimizing the use of nutrients in the cropping and animal farming systems and promoting the sustainable development of nutrient resources of highly importance for sustainability along the whole yrb 4 3 green development analysis the evaluation results of the green development indicators of the nine provinces indicate that green development is not optimistic it was found that the ecological environment is facing unprecedented challenges through an in depth analysis of the indicators eco environmental indicators are key indicators restricting green river basin development we propose corresponding measures to improve the green development of agriculture in the yrb as follows 1 in terms of social economy qinghai sichuan gansu and ningxia provinces in the upper reaches of the yrb all need to strengthen professional science technology and education to promote social development based on the results of the yrb economic and social indicators the main factors are the low level of agricultural modernization backward agricultural production methods and low per capita gdp gross domestic product the social level of education and education investment is insufficient which slows or restricts socio economic development it is recommended to increase education investment reduce educational differences between regions strengthen the cultivation of population quality and improve the education level 2 developing new agricultural models and promoting the transformation of agricultural methods in the middle reaches of inner mongolia most agriculture and animal husbandry use traditional high consumption methods and need to be developed intensively the remaining provinces are mostly limited by backward agricultural production methods slow urbanization process and a low level of agricultural modernization the production method is significant therefore advanced agricultural planting technology needs to be introduced to improve agricultural modernization development 3 regarding the ecological environment soil erosion is a vital problem in the yrb the ecological environment indicators of the upper middle and lower reaches were quite different therefore ecological environmental governance must be coordinated among all provinces to protect the yrb to improve the quality of the ecological environment a comprehensive governance mechanism for the linkage of the nine provinces must be formulated the ecological environment of the nine provinces was limited by low forest coverage and soil erosion control areas therefore it is necessary to control soil erosion gansu and ningxia as major ecological and environmental protection provinces should actively respond to the national implementation of returning farmland to forests and grazing to grassland to strengthen ecological environment management as a major province with developed animal husbandry inner mongolia must implement measures such as rotation grazing and fencing to further ensure grassland productivity henan and shandong provinces are mainly limited by agricultural pollution due to the backward agricultural production model traditional agricultural planting methods rely on high chemical fertilizer inputs this production model needs to be changed to introduce advanced agricultural planting technologies and adopt scientific agricultural technology based on local conditions such as increasing straw return to the field introducing new production technology for integrating water and fertilizers adjusting the agricultural planting structure increasing the nutrient utilization rate and realizing the potential production capacity of the land furthermore there should be training in strengthening skills for farmers and agricultural technicians and promoting the transformation of agriculture to an advanced agricultural production model 5 conclusions the characteristics of n flow in the cropping and animal farming systems have been greatly changed over the past 20 year in the yrb from 1999 2019 the total n input and loss increased by 74 29 and 66 57 the n flux differs greatly the upper reaches were low input and high emission the middle reaches were high input and high emission the lower reaches were high input and low emission the overall green development assessment results show that 36 variables reached the green level parameters of agricultural production and ecological environment are limiting factors for green development in the area to accelerating the yrb green development it is necessary to integrate cropping and animal farming and optimize agricultural resources and to protect ecological environment declaration of competing

guo et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 kuzyakov et al 2021 raza et al 2021 which need protection to achieve overall sustainable development in the past few decades agricultural production in the yrb has been restricted by many factors including soil erosion low carrying capacity of cultivated land resources and agricultural non point source pollution which has hindered high quality agricultural development in this region therefore green development of agriculture has become particularly important wang et al 2004 2020 an and li 2020 rui et al 2021 yu et al 2022 green development emphasizes the simultaneous development of the economy and ecology and more importantly balances the development of various factors pearce and atkinson 1993 qiu et al 2020 chinese scholars have extensively studied the agriculture and greening of the yrb the coordinated development levels of the upper middle and lower reaches of the yrb on a provincial scale zhang and huang 2021 showed obvious regional differences because contrast provincial agricultural development modes thus an index system of multiple dimensions was needed fang et al 2020 to evaluated the involved indicators a comprehensive combination of social economy and ecological knowledge including green development to provide an in depth exploration of sustainable development hu 2012 zou and liao 2017 li et al 2021 the high input and consumption of nitrogen n in the agricultural production system causes low return rates of straw in the farmland system and manure recovery rates in the livestock system sweeney et al 2012 nowak et al 2015 chirinda et al 2010 lead to serious n load to the environment the excessive n in the agricultural and pastoral systems of the yrb polluted the atmosphere soil and water bodies conley et al 2009 grahama et al 2022 liu et al 2013 nosengo 2003 wang et al 2022 and resulted in soil acidification raza et al 2021 water eutrophication zamanian et al 2021 and greenhouse gas emissions cai et al 2002 the yrb is an important agricultural prodution area with diverse of agri ecological functional units in northwest china the agricultural products of the yrb play a pivotal role in china s policy and development thus studying the n flow in the cropping and animal farming systems of the yrb is important to achieve high quality development and ecological environmental protection the statistical and literature data were collected and combined with the model nutrient flows in food chains environment and resources use nufer to analyze the n flow characteristics in the cropping and animal farming systems of nine provinces in the yrb the present study aimed to 1 clarify the temporal and spatial variation of nutrients particularly n as well as the input to and environmental losses from the cropping and animal farming systems in 1999 2009 and 2019 2 illustrate the main driving forces of regional n flow 3 examine the status and sustainability of green development strategies 4 provide scientific support for sustainable agricultural development and ecological protection in the yrb based on the n flow routes influencing factors and local conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river is the fifth longest river in the world and the second longest in china the yellow river originates from the bayan har mountains in qinghai province and flows through nine provinces including qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong and finally flows into the bohai sea in kenli district dongying city shandong province fig 1 qinghai province has the largest area on the yellow river basin 153 000 km2 accounting for 19 1 of the total area of the yrb and shandong province has the lowest area with only 13 000 km2 approximately 1 6 of the total basin area table 1 2 2 nufer model and calculations the nufer model is a nutrient flow model developed by ma et al 2010 to study nutrients flow in food chain at regional and national scales the nufer model can quantitatively analyze the flow characteristics and loss of n and other nutrients in cropping and animal farming systems and is widely used to evaluate nutrients in multiple regions of china ma et al 2010 2012 2018 all the nine provinces that the yrb passes through were selected as the research area which mainly includes two systems of crop and animal husbandry production the model was composed of four modules input calculation optimization and output the main calculation formulas are as follows 1 n intake of import feed n content in animal production n content in main product n content of straw feed 2 total n content in crop system n content in fertilizer n content in crop production deposition total n content in crop production nitrogen fixation total n content in straw n content in manure 3 total n content in livestock system n content in total animal production including meat bone egg and milk n content in total animal manure n content in total nh3 manure storage n content in total field manure 4 total system n loss crop system n loss nh3 n2o denitrification leaching runoff and erosion livestock system n loss direct n discharge excrement treatment storage n volatilization and n excretion n was calculated as kg hm2 agricultural land the research boundary is the same as that in the nufer model 2 3 green development evaluation to quantitatively evaluate the agricultural green development of the yrb based on the connotation and theoretical framework of agricultural green development ma et al 2020 we have referred to the chinese agricultural green development index system j j zhang et al 2020 and its grading standards furthermore the agricultural green development system analysis coupling model nutrient flows in food chains environment and resources use agricultural green development nufer agd was applied to further analyze and clarify the key factors restricting the agricultural green development jin et al 2020 the nufer agd model conducts a comprehensive analysis of the selected indicators to reflect its integrity based on the classification and grading standards of agricultural green development indicators 50 indicators were selected which were divided into direct indirect and self selected indicators including social development economic growth agricultural production resource input and ecological environment all indicators were divided into four levels based on the degree of green development indicators that could not be calculated temporarily are indicated with an asterisk table 2 selected indicators and grading standards are listed in table 2 the selection of indicators can clarify the bottlenecks and restrictive factors of the green development of agriculture in the yrb via analysis and a strategy was proposed for scientifically promoting the future green development of agriculture in the yrb 2 4 data collection the area of arable land sown area and output of the main crops amount of chemical fertilizers stock of various animals in animal husbandry and the number of slaughters were obtained from the national bureau of statistics and the statistical yearbooks of the nine provinces and cities in the yrb 1999 2009 and 2019 the crop grass to grain ratio n fixation number of different crops nutrient content and emission coefficient parameters involved in the model parameters were derived from the literature bi et al 2009 li and jin 2011 lu et al 1996 ma et al 2012 the n content of the fodder and animal products was obtained from the nufer model ma et al 2012 3 results 3 1 characteristics of n flow with time from 1999 2019 the amount of n input in the overall cropping and animal farming systems of the yrb increased from 2 10 107 t to 3 66 107 t mainly from fertilizer input from 2009 to 2019 after implementing the zero growth policy for chemical fertilizers the amount of n applied remained stable in the past 20 years the n input in feed imports has gradually increased from 4 6 106 t in 1999 1 45 107 t in 2019 accounting for an increase in total n input from 21 92 in 1999 to 39 54 in 2019 therefore the cumulative effect of feed on system n increased annually in addition the amount of n input into the yrb in the form of atmospheric deposition and biological n fixation has remained stable for the past 20 years atmospheric deposition increased from 1 541 106 t in 1999 1 97 106 t in 2019 and the amount of biological n fixation increased from 6 32 105 t in 1999 7 84 105 t in 2019 fig 2a the environmental loss of n was divided into two main parts one part was discharged into the atmosphere via gaseous forms such as ammonia volatilization nitrous oxide and n and the other part flowed into the surface water and groundwater via leaching and runoff from 1999 2019 the total n loss increased from 8 27 106 t to 13 77 106 t an increase of 66 57 in 2019 7 31 106 t n was lost through ammonia volatilization 1 84 105 t n was discharged in the form of n2o 13 52 105 t n was discharged from denitrification and the amount of n discharged into the atmosphere reached 59 67 105 t in addition n was discharged into the water bodies via leaching runoff and erosion the amount of n in gaseous form reached 23 01 105 t and the amount of n discharged into gas was 2 59 times of n in gaseous form compared to 1999 the amount of n lost through ammonia volatilization increased by 28 75 105 t the amount of n loss by n2o emissions and because of denitrification increased by 1 18 105 t and 9 53 105 t respectively the amount of n loss by leaching increased by 11 91 106 t fig 2b 3 2 characteristics of n flow in different regions n flow in different regions of the yrb changed with variations in the structure of the cropping and animal farming systems in the crop production system the main n input came from fertilizers in terms of the time series ningxia inner mongolia shanxi shaanxi and henan showed sustained growth in n fertilizer amounts among them henan province and inner mongolia increased n fertilizers by 266 87 104 t and 142 43 104 t respectively in the output of the production system the main crop products comprised the main part of the n output over 20 years the crop output of the yrb increased to varying degrees in different provinces henan province had the largest growth from 112 72 104 t in 1999 177 83 104 t in 2019 an increase of 65 11 104 t n which followed by inner mongolia and shandong province with an increase of 54 98 104 t and 28 34 104 t from 1999 to 2019 respectively among n losses in the output of the production system in 2019 ammonia volatilization was 730 62 104 t accounting for 30 50 of the total loss making it the main source of n loss fig 3 in the animal husbandry production system most inputs are from external fodder and the n structure of feed has changed significantly over the past 20 years from 1999 2019 inner mongolia shandong and shanxi received the largest increase in external fodder input by 85 24 104 t 43 91 104 t and 23 88 104 t respectively the output of livestock production systems was divided into animal products and manure from 1999 2019 the main n output from animal products increased from 60 65 104 t to 160 98 104 t which was mostly in inner mongolia shandong and henan provinces with increases of 18 61 104 t 12 91 104 t and 11 88 104 t respectively the main form of n loss in animal farming systems is from manure organic fertilizer in 2019 manure organic fertilizer was accounted for the majority of cropping and animal farming systems of sichuan henan and shandong provinces the manure amount was 142 65 104 t 142 67 104 t and 141 64 104 t respectively in these three provinces fig 4 3 3 characteristics of spatial distribution of n flow from the total n input per unit area in 2019 the highest value was in ningxia province reaching 635 51 kg hm2 and the lowest value was in qinghai province where the input amount reached 368 14 kg hm2 based on the n input amount the entire yrb was divided into three levels the first level 400 kg hm2 included qinghai and sichuan provinces the second level 400 600 kg hm2 included gansu inner mongolia shanxi shaanxi henan and shandong provinces and the third level 600 kg hm2 included ningxia province the area with the highest n fertilizer input was henan province where the n input per unit area reached 448 22 kg hm2 qinghai province had the highest fodder input with an input per unit area of 224 01 kg hm2 the region with the lowest n fertilizer input was sichuan province with 85 70 kg hm2 however the highest amount of biological n fixation and atmospheric deposition occurred in sichuan province and the amounts of n per unit area were 17 51 kg hm2 and 47 87 kg hm2 respectively in contrast the lowest amount of biological n fixation and atmospheric deposition were found in qinghai province where the n contents per unit area were 8 91 kg hm2 and 21 40 kg hm2 respectively the lowest feed import volume occurred in shaanxi province at 70 40 kg hm2 fig 5 based on the results of n loss in the entire cropping and animal farming systems of the yrb in 2019 ammonia volatilization soil runoff erosion and leaching were the main loss pathways the spatial loss characteristics of the yrb varied greatly across the provinces based on the amount of n loss per unit area of arable land in 2019 the yrb was divided into three levels the first level 200 kg n hm2 included gansu shanxi and shandong provinces the second level 200 250 kg n hm2 included qinghai sichuan ningxia and henan provinces and the third level 250 kg n hm2 included inner mongolia and shaanxi provinces the amount of n loss was consistent with the agricultural development of each province from the perspective of the entire watershed the highest n loss occurred in inner mongolia 447 57 kg hm2 and the lowest was in gansu province 134 92 kg hm2 the areas with the highest and lowest n losses denitrification were consistent with the ammonia volatilization area the ammonia volatilization in inner mongolia shaanxi and henan provinces were relatively high at 224 56 kg hm2 135 37 kg hm2 and 129 66 kg hm2 respectively gansu province had the lowest n losses from runoff erosion and leaching with 10 65 kg hm2 and 25 79 kg hm2 respectively fig 6 3 4 evaluation of green development change based on the statistics and classification of 50 indicators in the yrb in 2019 the first and second level indicators combined accounted for 52 of the total the third level indicators accounted for 30 and the fourth level indicators accounted for 6 the non calculated index accounted for 12 the development of green agriculture in the yrb is ongoing among the first and second level indicators agricultural productivity and ecological environment accounted for 54 of the overall indicators therefore to promote green agriculture it is essential to improve productivity and solve environmental pollution problems fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 temporal characteristics of n flow the total amount of n input in the cropping and animal farming production systems of the yrb have been increasing between 1999 and 2019 it increased by 1 56 107 t based on the composition of n input the main reasons for this increase were the excessive application of n fertilizer and the input of imported fodder in the yangtze river basin the main agricultural source of n is synthetic fertilizer chen et al 2020 with the increase in the planting area and planting ratio of cash crops blind and excessive fertilization caused a continuous increase in the n input of the system resulting in low nutrient use efficiency which is consistent with the main reason for the low n use efficiency of the chinese agricultural systems ma et al 2012 the main direction of development in the planting industry must be improved through effectively applying science and technology improve product quality and increase the utilization rate of n because of the transformation of production methods animal husbandry systems have a high dependence rate on exogenous n furthermore lagging management of livestock and poultry manure and insufficient attention to nutrient recycling resulted in a low rate of manure and urine nitrogen returning to the field but a high risk of environmental emissions the management of livestock and poultry manure should be improved and the proportion and quantity of nutrients circulating in farmland increased to reduce n losses the flow of n between the cropping and animal farming systems of the yrb that it relies on fertilizers and nutrients to input grain and fodder production and the rapid development of intensive animal husbandry reflects the shortcomings of nutrient management in cropping and animal husbandry the separation of cropping and animal husbandry is an important reason for the low utilization rate of n combining cropping and animal husbandry is the only way to solve the environmental problem of n loss and develop sustainable intensive agriculture 4 2 spatial characteristics of n flow the distribution of n input and loss in the cropping and animal farming systems of the yrb are not balanced among regions based on the classification of n input and loss the yrb provinces were divided into three types the provinces in the upper reaches of the yrb were low input and high emission agricultural production methods in this region are backward and focus on animal husbandry development attention should be given to managing nutrient during animal husbandry production and nutrient planning for combined cropping and animal farming the high environmental emissions are due to the low return rate of livestock and poultry manure and urine it is necessary to improve the utilization of nutrients reduce the input of external n increase the proportion of local fodder in the region establish a better breeding structure and integrate resources the provinces in the middle reaches of the yrb were high input and high emission the cropping system in this area relies on fertilizer input and the animal husbandry system has a low nutrient recycling rate it is imperative to focus on the rational utilization of nutrients paying attention to nutrient recycling and reuse popularizing scientific fertilization concepts increasing the area of grain and fodder crops strengthening the conversion and utilization of straw and forage crops in the area changing the separation of planting and animal husbandry production methods and rationally distributing resources the provinces in the lower reaches of the yrb were high input and low emission the region is pursuing the economic benefits of agriculture with high consumption and input of nitrogen fertilizer and other production factors it is necessary to introduce scientific planting technology pay attention to the reasonable input of fertilizers in farmland production effectively integrate land resources strengthen the degree of integration of cropping and animal farming and increase nutrient utilization based on the different planting structures different crop needs and farmers habits among provinces reasonable adjustments of n input strengthening the coordinated management of nutrients between provinces optimizing the use of nutrients in the cropping and animal farming systems and promoting the sustainable development of nutrient resources of highly importance for sustainability along the whole yrb 4 3 green development analysis the evaluation results of the green development indicators of the nine provinces indicate that green development is not optimistic it was found that the ecological environment is facing unprecedented challenges through an in depth analysis of the indicators eco environmental indicators are key indicators restricting green river basin development we propose corresponding measures to improve the green development of agriculture in the yrb as follows 1 in terms of social economy qinghai sichuan gansu and ningxia provinces in the upper reaches of the yrb all need to strengthen professional science technology and education to promote social development based on the results of the yrb economic and social indicators the main factors are the low level of agricultural modernization backward agricultural production methods and low per capita gdp gross domestic product the social level of education and education investment is insufficient which slows or restricts socio economic development it is recommended to increase education investment reduce educational differences between regions strengthen the cultivation of population quality and improve the education level 2 developing new agricultural models and promoting the transformation of agricultural methods in the middle reaches of inner mongolia most agriculture and animal husbandry use traditional high consumption methods and need to be developed intensively the remaining provinces are mostly limited by backward agricultural production methods slow urbanization process and a low level of agricultural modernization the production method is significant therefore advanced agricultural planting technology needs to be introduced to improve agricultural modernization development 3 regarding the ecological environment soil erosion is a vital problem in the yrb the ecological environment indicators of the upper middle and lower reaches were quite different therefore ecological environmental governance must be coordinated among all provinces to protect the yrb to improve the quality of the ecological environment a comprehensive governance mechanism for the linkage of the nine provinces must be formulated the ecological environment of the nine provinces was limited by low forest coverage and soil erosion control areas therefore it is necessary to control soil erosion gansu and ningxia as major ecological and environmental protection provinces should actively respond to the national implementation of returning farmland to forests and grazing to grassland to strengthen ecological environment management as a major province with developed animal husbandry inner mongolia must implement measures such as rotation grazing and fencing to further ensure grassland productivity henan and shandong provinces are mainly limited by agricultural pollution due to the backward agricultural production model traditional agricultural planting methods rely on high chemical fertilizer inputs this production model needs to be changed to introduce advanced agricultural planting technologies and adopt scientific agricultural technology based on local conditions such as increasing straw return to the field introducing new production technology for integrating water and fertilizers adjusting the agricultural planting structure increasing the nutrient utilization rate and realizing the potential production capacity of the land furthermore there should be training in strengthening skills for farmers and agricultural technicians and promoting the transformation of agriculture to an advanced agricultural production model 5 conclusions the characteristics of n flow in the cropping and animal farming systems have been greatly changed over the past 20 year in the yrb from 1999 2019 the total n input and loss increased by 74 29 and 66 57 the n flux differs greatly the upper reaches were low input and high emission the middle reaches were high input and high emission the lower reaches were high input and low emission the overall green development assessment results show that 36 variables reached the green level parameters of agricultural production and ecological environment are limiting factors for green development in the area to accelerating the yrb green development it is necessary to integrate cropping and animal farming and optimize agricultural resources and to protect ecological environment declaration of competing

9639,in india chickpea cicer arietinum l is mostly cultivated in post rice residual soil water on marginal lands low crop productivity due to terminal water and heat stress during reproductive stages

cicer arietinum l is a cool season food legume and an important source of protein for millions of people in developing countries particularly in south asia who are largely vegetarian either by choice or because of economic reasons it is the major pulse crop of india grown in 10 56 mha with an annual production of 11 38 mt and average productivity of 1078 kg ha 1 goi government of india 2019 with the ever increasing population enhancement of the pulse production to meet the nutritional demand as well as curbing the protein malnutrition is the need of the hour kumar et al 2015 being the major pulse crop in india chickpea can play a vital role as it is not only important as a food legume for human consumption but also due to its higher yield potential it can contribute significantly towards the sustainability and profitability of the production systems amiri et al 2020 the majority of the chickpea growing area in india is confined within some states with marginal post rice residual water under rainfed conditions as rice chickpea cropping system and hence the overall crop productivity is far less as compared to the other developed countries kumar et al 2015 in recent years the rice fallow areas got an ample share of importance for the crop intensification programmes in south asia the rice fallow systems cover around 11 7 mha especially in the lower gangetic plains lgp expanded over the eastern states of the country saha et al 2020 these areas offer a great opportunity for pulse cultivation as a second crop and chickpea being one of the important pulse crops of the country with greater yield potential can be a suitable choice however the uncertainty of winter rainfall rapid depletion of available soil water and heat stress during the reproductive period result in forced maturity of the post rainy season crops with detrimental effects on the crop productivity in rice fallows ghosh et al 2016 moreover cultivation of long duration puddled transplanted rice 140 150 days delays the sowing of the subsequent crop and yield decline becomes inevitable due to further shortening of soil water availability period therefore there is an urgent need to establish a suitable crop and water management strategy to meet the potential yield gap of chickpea in these marginal soils recently there is a significant interest and emphasis on the shift from extreme tillage to conservation or zero tillage methods as a low cost production technology with a substantial effect on minimizing soil and crop residue disturbance evaporative loss of soil water as well as the energy needs erenstein and laxmi 2008 the establishment of crops in zero tillage may not only eliminate the problems associated with creating an adequate seedbed but also reduce the turnaround time through its ability to conserve soil water by minimizing the soil water depletion rate piggin et al 2015 the positive influence of minimum tillage on the pulse crops in the post rice soils has been reported by several researchers kar and kumar 2009 2019 moreover under conservation tillage systems retention of crop residues of the preceding crop plays a pivotal role in soil water conservation for the second crop through modification of the hydrothermal regime of the soil atmosphere interface and its comparative yield advantage has been reported in succeeding crops such as chickpea lathyrus lentil etc ghosh et al 2016 ramamoorthy et al 2017 kumar et al 2020 therefore adopting conservation tillage practice in post rice marginal soils for chickpea production can not only be a win win strategy to overcome the terminal drought induced yield reductions but also serve the purpose of sustainable intensification of the rice fallows though chickpea is generally cultivated as a rainfed crop grown on residual soil water shreds of evidence support that the application of supplemental irrigation resulted in significant yield increment with single irrigation munirathnam and sangita 2009 two irrigations abraham et al 2010 pau 2011 or three irrigations mansur et al 2010 throughout the growing season out of the several techniques of irrigation scheduling the application of irrigation based on crop phenological stage is quite effective in terms of technology transfer to the farmers field due to its ease of understanding among the various phenological stages of chickpea the flowering and pod formation stages are widely considered as water sensitive and application of irrigation at these stages is shown to increase above ground biomass as well as seed yield zhang et al 2000 oweis et al 2004 nayyar et al 2005 however the amount of irrigation will depend on the antecedent soil water rainfall pattern evaporative demand crop duration etc therefore a proper phenophase based irrigation management system can effectively cater down the yield gap of chickpea in these marginal post rice soils research evidence showed that soil water stress sets in when actual evapotranspiration eta falls below the potential evapotranspiration etp of a particular crop allen et al 1998 the degree of soil water stress also modifies the canopy architecture relative leaf water content rlwc leaf chlorophyll content lcc thereby affecting the cell turgor and crop growth rate nilsen and orcutt 1996 similarly the intensity of soil water stress significantly affects the stomatal opening and leaf water potential thereby decreasing transpiration rate stomatal conductance and the overall photosynthetic activity of the plants baronti et al 2014 moreover plants respond to soil water stress through the accumulation of certain osmolytes such as proline which results in lowering of the osmotic potential of the plant to maintain plant water status and other necessary physiological activities under water stress conditions sanders and arndt 2012 paudel et al 2016 therefore systematic monitoring of these plant physiological parameters will present a great opportunity in the elucidation of the soil water stress induced decrement in plant growth and productivity further the use of canopy temperature for estimation of stomatal closure and or transpiration rate has also been recognized long ago wiegand and namken 1966 idso et al 1977 jackson et al 1981 based on canopy temperature depression ctd and vapour pressure deficit vpd considering all the micrometeorological parameters influencing the canopy temperature the crop water stress index cwsi is defined as a non contact non destructive and reliable measure for appropriate approximation of crop water stress idso et al 1981 saha et al 1986 dejonge et al 2015 however a comprehensive report on quantification of growth stage wise soil water stress and its manifestation into various biochemical attributes in the elucidation of the water stress induced yield decrement in chickpea is scarce therefore a study to assess the interactive effect of different tillage and irrigation management induced alteration of soil water availability on temporal dynamics of soil water stress and its indication through various biochemical as well as canopy attributes will help in further strengthening the notion of yield water relationship based improvement of growth and water productivity of chickpea keeping this in mind in the current experiment it has been hypothesized that i adoption of zero tillage after puddled transplanted rice through modification of the soil hydrothermal properties will increase the effective soil water utilization period and can alleviate the negative effect of soil water stress on growth and productivity of chickpea ii application of phenophase wise supplemental irrigation through maintaining a higher plant water status can bridge the yield gap of chickpea and iii the interactive impact assessment of different tillage and irrigation management on plant biochemical and canopy attributes will help in designing an improved less intensive water efficient production system for chickpea in the post rice marginal soils of lgp to address these hypotheses an experiment was conducted in rice fallows of lgp to grow chickpea with combinations of different tillage and phenophase wise irrigation management with the following objectives i to assess the temporal distribution of soil water storage and field water balance of chickpea under different tillage and irrigation management ii to monitor and quantify crop water stress and its effect on yield and water productivity of chickpea under the above mentioned management systems and iii to assess the most effective treatment under different management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 details of the experimental site field trials were carried out during the post rainy seasons of 2017 18 and 2018 19 in the ab block seed farm bidhan

using the r programme version 3 6 1 3 results 3 1 root zone soil water storage the temporal distribution of root zone soil water storage from 0 to 400 mm soil layer for the entire growth period of chickpea during the two consecutive cropping seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 is presented in fig 2 during both cropping seasons at the time of sowing the root zone soil water storage was well above the θfc under zt while under ct it was 20 0 and 11 1 lower than θfc moreover the soil water storage in the root zone of chickpea decreased with the advancement of growth periods on average during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons the soil water depletion in the root zone of chickpea was 54 7 and 52 6 mm for ct and 74 3 and 67 7 mm for zt respectively within a time frame of 118 and 116 days of the crop growth period it was further revealed that conventionally tilled plots depleted 16 6 28 8 and 12 2 while zero tilled plots depleted 6 0 40 2 and 19 9 water from the root zone of chickpea during vegetative flowering and pod formation stages individually the readily available water raw was maintained up to the late vegetative stage under ct and initiation of the flowering stage under zt on average during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons zt retained 23 and 18 37 and 33 25 and 22 and 17 and 14 more soil water in the root zone of chickpea as compared to ct at sowing vegetative 4 39 das flowering 39 66 das and pod formation stages 66 94 das respectively fig 2a and b the effect of irrigation application on root zone soil water storage is evident from the periodic peak and trough movement of the otherwise progressively downward curve the sole effect of irrigation as well as the tillage irrigation interaction was found to be significant at both flowering and pod formation stages during both the cropping seasons application of growth stage wise irrigation not only increased root zone soil water but it also extended the water availability period delay in approaching towards θwp under both the tillage practices 3 2 soil water stress coefficient ks temporal variation in soil water stress was evaluated for both the cropping seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 by measuring the water deficit faced by the crop under different tillage and irrigation management systems addressed by a stress co efficient term ks which is depicted in fig 3 the tillage management practices significantly alter the stress intensity faced by chickpea at the critical growth periods during both the cropping seasons under ct the crop fell under water stress from the late vegetative period 39 40 das onwards whereas under zt the crop fell under water stress from the initiation of the flowering period 56 das onwards during both years in the 2017 18 cropping season ct faced 57 and 74 soil water stress as compared to 18 and 44 under zt at flowering and pod formation stages respectively similarly during the 2018 19 cropping season zt faced only 7 and 40 soil water stress as compared to 40 and 66 under ct at these above mentioned periods further the degree of soil water stress faced by chickpea was lower under irrigated regimes as compared to unirrigated regimes under both the tillage practices during both years fig 3a and b the order of soil water stress among the irrigation treatments was i0 ipf if if pf at flowering stage and i0 if ipf if pf at pod formation stage under both ct and zt during the 2017 18 cropping season application of irrigation at the initiation of the flowering stage helped to decrease the intensity of soil water stress for if and if pf treatments as they faced 30 stress as compared to i0 and ipf treatments experiencing 84 stress under ct while under zt if and if pf treatments maintained their non stress condition ks 1 while i0 and ipf treatments were facing 36 stress with no irrigation application i0 exhausted all of its root zone available soil water by 76 das under ct and by 107 das under zt with only one irrigation at the initiation of the flowering stage if water was hardly available for evapotranspiration by 94 das under ct whereas zt faced only 50 stress during that time fig 3a irrigation at the initiation of the pod formation stage ipf reduced the degree of water stress from 95 to 70 for ct and from 65 to 39 for zt during 76 94 das on the other hand irrigation at the initiation of flowering and the initiation of the pod formation stage if pf maintained a very lesser degree of soil water stress compared to other treatments in the second year 2018 19 higher ks values were recorded as compared to the previous year 2017 18 crop with no irrigation i0 faced 100 water stress by 91 das under ct while under zt it faced 77 water stress at the time of harvesting irrigation at the initiation of the flowering stage if depleted half of its available soil water 50 water stress by 73das under ct and by 91das under zt again irrigation at the initiation of pod formation stage ipf showed a similar water stress pattern as of i0 up to 73das degree of water stress was 83 under ct and 43 under zt after which it regains its water availability 57 and 20 water stress by 91das under ct and zt respectively application of two irrigations both at the initiation of flowering and the initiation of pod formation stage if pf maintained the intensity of water stress at 51 under ct and 29 under zt at the end of the cropping period 3 3 actual evapotranspiration eta at critical growth stages the eta of chickpea at different critical growth stages as influenced by various tillage and irrigation management systems during the 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping season is presented in fig 4 the eta was observed maximum during the flowering period under different treatments in both the years interestingly the results also indicated that in both the cropping seasons eta recorded under ct was significantly p 0 001 higher 35 8 and 73 8 than zt in the vegetative period whereas zt showed higher eta as compared to ct during the flowering 24 4 and 33 1 and pod formation stages 36 9 and 23 5 respectively application of irrigation was also found to be significant p 0 001 in terms of eta as the sole effect of irrigation as well as tillage irrigation interaction at both flowering and pod formation stages were significant during both the years in general the number of applications of irrigation water at the critical growth stages significantly increased eta as compared to unirrigated treatments under both ct and zt notable results from the average data of 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons were that with no irrigation i0 zt recorded 47 5 mm eta during flowering and 21 4 mm eta during the pod formation stage however under ct it was 32 1 and 10 6 mm at the above mentioned growth stages again with the application of one irrigation at the initiation of the flowering period if zt recorded 11 3 mm higher eta during flowering and 14 0 mm higher eta during the pod formation stage as compared to ct further with the application of two irrigations if pf zt maintained higher eta during both flowering and pod formation stages when irrigation was applied at the initiation of pod formation ipf stage the eta values were 49 0 mm under ct and 56 7 mm under zt during pod formation stage 3 4 canopy temperature depression ctd and crop water stress index cwsi temporal variation of canopy temperature depression ctd and crop water stress index cwsi of chickpea under different tillage and irrigation treatments during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons are depicted in figs 5 and 6 respectively the data reveals that zt maintained a lower ctd value as compared to ct throughout the crop growth period during both years the ctd values at vegetative flowering and pod formation stages were 1 1 1 4 and 0 9 ºc lower under zt than ct during 2017 18 however they were 0 6 0 6 and 0 8 ºc lower during 2018 19 cropping season further with no irrigation i0 a positive canopy temperature depression was observed by 66 das and 73 das under ct and by 76 das and 91 das under zt during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons respectively the application of irrigation water further reduced the canopy temperature during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons the ctd values were 3 8 and 3 1 ºc for ct and 5 2 and 4 2 ºc for zt when they were irrigated at the initiation of flowering stage if when irrigated at the initiation of pod formation stage ipf the ctd values were 3 0 and 1 0 ºc for ct and 4 0 and 2 0 under zt for the two cropping seasons again a large temperature depression was observed when irrigated at both the initiation of flowering and initiation of pod formation stages if pf under both the tillage practices in each year of the study the daily cwsi decreased after an irrigation event and increased daily during the period between irrigation events fig 6a and b the amount of decrease and the rate of increase in the cwsi corresponded inversely with the amount of rainfall received and irrigation applied in chickpea in each study year the irrigation treatment that supplied the least amount of water i0 had the highest daily cwsi under both ct and zt systems the cwsi of well watered chickpea at if pf under zt fig 6a and b was close to zero for most of the growing period in the 2017 18 cropping season the daily cwsi of the ct treatment ranged between 0 29 and 1 24 for if 0 31 and 1 32 for ipf and 0 32 and 1 20 for if pf fig 6a on the other hand under zt treatment the cwsi ranged between 0 20 and 0 99 for if 0 33 and 1 06 for ipf and 0 15 and 0 88 for if pf fig 6a similarly in the 2018 19 cropping season the daily cwsi of the ct treatment ranged between 0 34 and 1 18 for if 0 49 and 1 30 for ipf and 0 32 and 1 15 for if pf fig 6b on the other hand under zt treatment the cwsi ranged between 0 17 and 0 95 for if 0 41 and 1 04 for ipf and 0 17 and 0 84 for if pf fig 6b fig 6a and b also depict that at vegetative flowering and pod formation stages under zt cwsi was 37 7 and 17 2 41 6 and 35 2 and 26 4 and 18 5 lower than ct during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons though the cwsi value ranges from 0 to 1 some of the values in the current experiment occasionally crossed the upper limit cwsi 1 especially at the later stages of crop growth 3 5 profile water change and seasonal evapotranspiration seasonal eta the profile water change from sowing to harvesting and seasonal crop water use or seasonal eta in chickpea under different tillage and irrigation management systems during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons are presented in table 3 the results revealed that on average zt recorded a 32 5 higher profile water change as compared to ct which is also reflected in the seasonal eta zt recorded 13 8 higher seasonal eta than ct the individual effect of tillage and irrigation on profile water change and seasonal eta was found to be significant p 0 001 during both the years whereas the interaction effect of tillage irrigation on profile water change and seasonal eta was significant only during 2017 18 cropping season during both the cropping seasons profile water change was recorded highest under i0 followed by if ipf and if pf on the contrary seasonal eta was recorded highest under if pf 175 5 mm followed by if 139 3 mm ipf 133 4 mm and i0 92 6 mm further zt recorded significantly higher seasonal eta than ct not only under rainfed condition 22 4 higher under zt than ct but also under the irrigated condition as under if ipf and if pf seasonal eta was 17 4 12 8 and 8 9 higher under zt as compared to ct 3 6 leaf area index lai across all the treatments lai increased with the advancement of the growth period on average the per cent increase of lai under zt as compared to ct was 30 3 22 1 and 29 2 at vegetative flowering and pod formation stages respectively fig 7 application of irrigation at the critical growth periods also influenced lai positively as higher lai was recorded under irrigated regimes as compared to unirrigated regimes under both ct and zt the per cent increase in lai under irrigated regime was 22 7 due to irrigation application at the initiation of the flowering stage whereas the increase was 13 6 due to application of irrigation at the initiation of pod formation stage as compared to the unirrigated regime i0 significantly higher lai was recorded for if pf as compared to other irrigation regimes under ct while under zt lai recorded for if and if pf irrigation regimes were statistically at par noticeably under ct i0 lai decreased from 2 0 at the flowering stage to 1 8 at the pod formation stage 3 7 relative leaf water content rlwc and proline content the pooled data of 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping season revealed that rlwc of chickpea under different tillage and irrigation management increased from vegetative to flowering period but decreased from flowering to the pod formation stage fig 8 whereas proline content increases with the advancement of the growth stages fig 9 at the vegetative period the effect of tillage was found to be non significant in terms of rlwc but for proline content the difference between tillage practices was significant at that period under zt rlwc was10 2 higher at flowering and 12 3 higher at the pod formation stage as compared to ct however proline content was found to be 60 3 and 32 2 higher under ct as compared to zt at flowering and pod formation stages respectively moreover the results also indicated that the application of irrigation at the critical growth stages of chickpea recorded significantly higher rlwc but lower proline content as compared to unirrigated regimes application of one irrigation at the initiation of the flowering period if under zt performed way better than the application of two irrigation both at the initiation of flowering and pod formation stages if pf under ct in terms of maintaining higher rlwc as well as lower proline content 3 8 leaf chlorophyll content lcc the effect of tillage irrigation and tillage irrigation interaction on the total leaf chlorophyll content lcc of chickpea mg g 1 fresh weight was found to be significant p 0 001 especially at flowering and pod formation stages during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons fig 10 the per cent increment of the lcc recorded under zt was 27 4 and 53 0 during 2017 18 and was 21 8 and 25 3 during the 2018 19 cropping season as compared to ct at flowering and pod formation stages respectively results also showed that the lcc increased significantly in response to irrigation application at the critical growth stages except for ct i0 moreover the lcc was found at par for if pf and if under zt whereas under ct it was significantly higher for if pf than if 3 9 transpiration rate tr and stomatal conductance gs irrespective of tillage and irrigation management practice tr and gs were recorded highest during the flowering period and then decreases subsequently table 4 from the pooled data of 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping season it is evident that significantly higher tr 2 6 3 2 and 2 0 mmol m 2 s 1 and gs 169 6 304 8 and 206 8 mmol m 2 s 1 were recorded under zt as compared to ct atall the growth stages of chickpea irrigation application at the critical growth stages of chickpea resulted in a significant increase in tr and gs as compared to unirrigated regimes under both ct and zt irrigation application at the initiation of flowering if proved to be better in terms of maintaining higher tr and gs as compared to irrigation application at the initiation of pod formation ipf under both ct and zt the treatment if pf with two irrigation applications recorded significantly higher tr and gs at both flowering and pod formation stages than other irrigation regimes under ct whereas the tr and gs recorded under if pf and if were statistically at par under zt 3 10 yield and water productivity wp the seed yield of chickpea ranged from 576 to 1975 kg ha 1 and 582 1984 kg ha 1 with an average yield of 1414 8 and 1441 4 kg ha 1 during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons respectively table 5 the range of wp was recorded from 7 6 to 13 7 kg ha 1mm 1 and 6 5 13 0 kg ha 1mm 1 with an average wp of 10 6 and 10 2 kg ha 1mm 1 during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons irrespective of irrigation application zt improved the yield and wp of chickpea by 37 1 and 23 7 as compared to ct irrigation application at critical growth stages also significantly improved yield and wp of chickpea on average if if pf and ipf improved yield by 841 948 and 404 kg ha 1 as compared to i0 on the other hand if if pf improved wp by 32 3 and 11 8 as compared to i0 while no improvement of wp was recorded under ipf than i0 under ct the highest yield was recorded under if pf 1675 kg ha 1 followed by if 1458 kg ha 1 ipf 1106 kg ha 1 though the highest yield under ct was recorded for if pf wp was the highest in if 11 3 kg ha 1mm 1 whereas under zt no significant difference was found between if pf and if in terms of yield 1984 and 1981 kg ha 1 respectively while wp was significantly higher under if 13 3 kg ha 1mm 1 further ipf under ct significantly improved both yield and wp as compared to i0 while under zt it only improved yield as wp was higher under i0 as compared to ipf overall the treatment combination zt if produced the highest yield 1984 kg ha 1 and also obtained maximum wp 13 3 kg ha 1mm 1 3 11 principal component analysis the principal component analysis reduced the eight treatment combinations of tillage and irrigation to two orthogonal components pc1 and pc2 which all together explained 94 of the total variance within the variables fig 11 the pc1 explained 85 of the total variance and had a significant loading on each of the variables and the highest loading was observed on rlwc on the other hand pc2 explained 9 of the total variance and had the highest loading on seasonal eta the pca biplot showed the position of different variables and treatments in the orthogonal space defined by the two pcs the biplot distinctly represented the distribution of observations corresponding to each treatment and the resulting interaction between the two main components all the assessed variables showed a positive correlation with pc1 except proline content and cwsi by analysing pc1 there was a clear separation between treatments ct i0 and ct ipf on the left hand side and others on the right hand sides of the vertical line as presented in table 6 from the scores on the pc1 it can be interpreted that zt if resulted in better performance of chickpea than did the other treatments growth promoting action of zt treatments on chickpea was established by the pca 4 discussion 4 1 root zone soil water storage and soil water stress dynamic changes in the root zone soil water storage under different tillage and irrigation management modified the water availability pattern as well as the intensity of soil water stress at various critical growth periods of chickpea the soil profile managed with standing rice stubbles under zt resulted in a longer period of water availability during the crop growth period which may be attributed to higher initial water content in the root zone θfc lower evaporative depletion of soil water in the presence of standing rice stubbles along with the reduced rate of vertical soil water movement within the compacted puddled rice soil having low macro porosity saxena 2009 araya et al 2015 nandi et al 2021 on the other hand the tilled and porous structure of soil created by tillage operation not only hastened the root zone soil water depletion owing to the exposed soil surface but it also increases the soil water movement through modification of the pore geometry of the soil jin et al 2007 obia et al 2020 the benefits of zt in terms of soil water conservation under post rainy season pulse crops in igp were also reported by other researchers kar and kumar 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2018 saha et al 2020 further periodic recharging of the root zone with the application of irrigation at the critical growth stages of chickpea not only increased the soil water storage but also helped in modifying residence time of the water availability under both the tillage practices the initial rapid rate of soil water depletion from the disturbed and exposed soil surfaces under ct forced chickpea towards an early soil water stress condition ks 1 as compared to zt the downward progression of the ks values may also be attributed to the increased water depletion in the root zone due to evapotranspiration loss of water inducing water stress conditions bandyopadhyay et al 2018 higher water content in the root zone of chickpea under zt and its longer availability period could serve as a buffer for the dry spells during the crop growing season especially under rainfed conditions nandi et al 2021 irrigation application at the critical growth stages of chickpea significantly reduced the degree of soil water stress by increasing the water availability in the root zone complete exhaustion of the root zone soil water as indicated by a ks value approaching towards 0 during the later stages of crop growth substantiate the necessity of irrigation application at the critical growth stages especially under erratic rainfall condition to prevent the crop to fall under severe water stress condition these results were in line with turner et al 2007 who reported that severe soil water stress at the time of initiation of the reproductive phase could lead to the cessation of flowering ultimately resulting in yield decrement of chickpea though a higher root zone soil water storage as well as a lower degree of soil water stress was obtained with the combination of two irrigation applications if pf under zt application of only one irrigation at the initiation of flowering stage if also performed fairly well in terms of efficient utilization of soil water within the taw range and also in moderating soil water stress 4 2 field water balance and actual evapotranspiration eta the soil surface with standing crop stubble under zt created a barrier between the soil surface and the atmosphere causing lower evaporative loss of stored soil water during the initial stages of crop growth as compared to ct acharya and sharma 1994 and bandyopadhyay et al 2016 demonstrated that standing crop stubbles modify the hydro thermal regimes between the soil atmosphere interface which in turn mitigates the soil water stress however with the advancement of the crop growth period the establishment of a substantial amount of canopy cover increases the contribution of the transpiration component of eta due to higher root water extraction at the same time owing to canopy shading the contribution from the loss of soil water through evaporative flux decreases hence a favourable hydrothermal regime as well as higher biomass and lai under zt significantly increased the transpiration rate table 4 resulting in an overall increase in eta as compared to ct these results were also affirmed by higher root zone profile water change under zt as compared to ct in this study the higher availability of water in the root zone throughout the cropping season under zt facilitated a greater depletion of stored water through evapotranspiration however a lesser degree of tortuosity due to better continuity of pores in the undisturbed soil profile coupled with the deep crack formation in the previous puddled rice soils at the later stages of crop growth under zt may also have attributed towards higher profile water change kumar et al 2020 and nandi et al 2021 also reported that puddled rice soils under zero till management may be subjected to deep crack formation which has a major contribution towards increased soil water storage depletion under zt the application of the number of irrigation water induced surface wetness of the soil followed by higher root water extraction from the recharged soil profile significantly increased the eta as evidenced by higher seasonal eta under if pf irrigation regime compared to the unirrigated treatments the seasonal eta is assured mainly from a profile water change and effective rainfall under rainfed conditions while under irrigated conditions frequency of irrigation application plays a crucial role in determining the seasonal eta or actual crop water use in this study the variation of seasonal eta from 83 3 to 183 1 mm was attributed to not only the interaction effect of tillage and irrigation management practices but also the antecedent soil water content daily weather parameters size of the treatment plots canopy architecture of the variety used and its duration of growth different researchers rao and poonia 2004 panday et al 2008 patel et al 2009 etc reported seasonal crop water use of chickpea in the range of 110 343 mm in india under both rainfed and irrigated conditions after harvesting of long duration puddled transplanted rice under contrasting tillage and residue management practices 4 3 crop water stress and plant physiological response the canopy temperature is mainly regulated by transpiration as it cools the leaf surfaces by taking off the latent heat of vaporization a cooler canopy is generally associated with higher soil water status and consequently higher plant water uptake resulting in stomata being open thereby maintaining a higher transpiration rate chaturvedi et al 1999 the undisturbed soil profile under zt along with standing stubbles enhanced the crop water availability period which further manifested into higher transpiration and better shading effect owing to higher canopy coverage higher lai thereby maintaining a lower canopy temperature than the mean air temperature as compared to ct accordingly in the present study ctd showed a significant negative relationship with eta r2 0 68 p 0 001 fig 12 indicating that with every 10 mm increase in eta the mean difference between a canopy and air temperature is lowered by 0 92 ºc application of irrigation water at the critical growth stages significantly increased eta and canopy coverage resulting in cooler canopies by maintaining higher soil water status these results were also affirmed by saha et al 1986 showing that irrigated chickpea maintained a lower ctd throughout the crop growth period as compared to unirrigated chickpea no irrigation under both ct and zt within the crop growth period with positive ctd values indicated severe terminal soil water stress associated with stomatal closure and reduction in a transpirational cooling effect patel et al 2001 also reported a significant terminal soil water stress associated with positive ctd values in late shown pigeon pea higher soil water in the root zone throughout the crop growth period under zt helped the plants to keep up higher transpiration and a cooler canopy thereby retaining cwsi values significantly lower than ct the two major peaks found in the temporal changes of cwsi values in chickpea coincided with the initiation of flowering and the initiation of pod formation stages under both the tillage practices affirmed these two stages to be water sensitive water demanding lower cwsi values at the critical growth stages under zt than ct substantiate efficient water utilization and lower intensity of soil water stress under zt further periodic application of irrigation water at the critical growth stages significantly lowered the cwsi values alleviating the deleterious effect of soil water stress though cwsi values usually range between 0 no stress and 1 maximum stress some of the values in the current experiment crossed the upper value cwsi 1 at the later stages of crop growth it is well documented that cwsi values range between 0 and 1 only when the vpd range between 20 and 40 kpa and can exceed the upper value in locations with low vpd in the range of 11 15 kpa alderfasi and nielsen 2001 the humid climate in the experimental location with vpd ranging between 9 8 and 15 kpa at the later stages of crop growth 76 das onwards may have contributed towards this anomaly i e cwsi exceeding 1 gardner et al 1992 also pointed out that because of natural variability associated with field measurements an occasional cwsi value greater than 1 under extreme water stressed conditions may not be a cause of concern as it refers to a further reduction in transpiration due to complete stomatal closure and a decrease in lai similarly under the current experiment cwsi values greater than 1 were reported at 76 das only for the treatments experiencing severe water stress i0 and ipf under ct while at 94 das it was only for i0 treatment under both ct and zt posing no issues in its interpretability further cwsi values greater than 1 at 107 and 118 das were a result of senescence and crop maturity further in this study a significant negative linear relationship between cwsi and rlwc r2 0 81 p 0 001 fig 13 depicts that less than 67 rlwc is an indicator of plant water stress in chickpea 4 4 soil water stress and physiological response the rlwc is closely associated with cell turgor and is controlled by water availability jones 1990 lawlor and cornic 2002 lower rlwc values under ct is indicative of limited root water uptake under water stress condition as evidenced by the steep decrease of ks fig 3 which resulted in the loss of turgor and limited water availability for cell expansion subsequently suppressing plant growth and development this is confirmed by the significant positive relationship between rlwc and soil water storage indicating that with every 10 mm decrease in soil water storage rlwc decreased by 4 fig 15 a similar relationship between soil water deficit and rlwc was also reported by talukdar 2013 saha et al 2020 nandi et al 2021 with lentil again a significant negative relationship r2 0 7968 p 0 001 fig 15 between proline content and soil water storage in this study strengthens our hypothesis that proline accumulation is an indicator of soil water stress several researchers reported higher proline accumulation under water stress conditions in maize moussa and abdel aziz 2008 mulberry ramanjulu and sudhakar 2000 lentil saha et al 2020 and chickpea cevik et al 2019 the decrease in soil water storage as well as the decline in rlwc under ct resulted in lower lcc as compared to zt higher water availability under zt induced a higher root water uptake as well as higher translocation of nutrients giving rise to higher lai and lcc nandi et al 2021 ahmadi and siosemardeh 2005 observed that the increase in lcc with plant age was due to increased leaf area index a positive and significant correlation fig 14 between lcc and lai r2 0 95 p 0 001 and lcc and soil water storage r2 0 96 p 0 001 indicate that water is an integral part of leaf expansion as well as chlorophyll synthesis soil water stress reportedly enhances the degradation of synthesized chlorophyll as well as inhibits the synthesis of new chlorophyll pigments mathobo et al 2017 the increased plant water status as well as higher lai under zt also resulted in significantly higher tr and gs as compared to ct table 4 earlier studies snider et al 2014 baronti et al 2014 reported that stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were increased with an increase in available soil water status snider et al 2014 baronti et al 2014 this finding is in accordance with the linear relationships with lai lcc rlwc vs tr or gs fig 14 nonetheless stomatal closure is one of the first signs of defence against water stress to avoid further water loss to maintain higher cell turgidity zlatev and yordanov 2004 dulai et al 2006 thereby reducing gs as well as tr under soil water deficit the decrease in gs and tr from flowering to pod formation stage can also be attributed to the enhanced mobilization of rubisco pate et al 1983 pandey et al 2001 also reported a decrease in gs and tr of chickpea from flowering to pod formation stage the adequate water supply at the initiation of the flowering period through providing irrigation not only increases the eta but also resulted in an increase in rlwc as well as an increase in lcc as compared to unirrigated treatments whereas application of irrigation only at the initiation of pod formation stage proved to be less effective as chickpea plants have already gone through an appreciable loss in turgor followed by aggravated ageing and senescence induced by soil water stress these effects were more pronounced under ct as compared to zt the result indicated that the application of one irrigation at the initiation of flowering stage if under zt proved enough for alleviating the harmful effect of soil water stress however application of two irrigations at the initiation of flowering and the initiation of pod formation stages if pf under zt though increased available soil water as well as seasonal eta can be considered as a wasteful use of water as it failed to enhance rlwc lcc and lai over if on the other hand under ct the application of two irrigations if pf was proved to be the best in terms of plant physiology as the exposed soil surface along with lower canopy coverage aggravated the root zone soil water depletion necessitating the use of two irrigations 4 5 yield and water productivity conventional tilage systems are comparatively more vulnerable to soil water stress resulting in lesser yield as compared to zt the undisturbed soil profile with standing stubbles under zt effectively conserved more soil water thereby resulting in a longer period of water availability ultimately producing higher seed yield as compared to ct bandyopadhyay et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 decreased rlwc lcc and lower canopy coverage due to soil water stress as all the parameters showed a significant positive correlation with both yield and wue manifested into a greater reduction of chickpea seed yield under ct higher seasonal eta seasonal crop water use and enhanced root water extraction under zt may also have contributed significantly towards the increased yield of chickpea as compared to ct these results were also affirmed by the significant positive relationship between seasonal eta and chickpea yield in the current study r2 0 80 p 0 001 fig 16 and indicated that a yield gain of 12 7 kg was obtained for every 1 mm increase in eta this relationship between yield and seasonal eta was also supported by several other researchers in different crops huang et al 2004 sarkar et al 2010 application of irrigation significantly increased chickpea yield under both ct and zt irrigation induced increase in chickpea yield was reported by several researchers with single irrigation munirathnam and sangita 2009 with two irrigations abraham et al 2010 pau 2011 or with three irrigations mansur et al 2010 the flowering and pod formation stages are identified as the water sensitive stages of chickpea turner et al 2001 nayyar et al 2005 however the amount and the timing of irrigation will depend upon the rainfall pattern of the region soil type evaporative demand crop duration etc zhang et al 2000 oweis et al 2004 in the current experiment the highest yield was obtained with two irrigation if pf under ct while under zt the yield obtained under if and if pf were at par application of two irrigation if pf under zt only increased seasonal eta as no significant difference was observed in other yield contributing factors rlwc lcc lai gs etc in comparison to if however under ct two irrigation was found to be necessary to maintain a sufficient level of available soil water for obtaining a higher yield of chickpea further the results also indicated that application of irrigation only at the initiation of pod formation stage ipf was not sufficient enough to achieve the irrigation induced yield advantage as early season stress during the initiation of flowering stage resulted in a significant decrease in photosynthesis rate and disrupts the metabolism of carbohydrates leading to a reduced export of assimilates to the sink organs ultimately resulting in enhanced flower abortion and decrement in seed yield liu et al 2004 further the effective soil water conservation under zt contributed significantly towards enhanced wp 11 5 kg ha 1mm 1 as compared to ct 9 3 kg ha 1mm 1 higher wp with the second crops in rice fallows with conservation tillage was reported by several researchers kar and kumar 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 nandi et al 2021 though higher yield was obtained with the application of two irrigations if pf under ct the decrement in wp as compared to if was due to a higher relative increase in seasonal eta in response to higher irrigation application as compared to yield while under zt though the yield recorded with if and if pf were statistically at par seasonal eta was recorded higher under if pf due to higher root zone available soil water ultimately resulting in lower wp as compared to if therefore zt if treatment combination can be considered as best in terms of both yield and wp this result was also affirmed by the pca study as zt if recorded a significantly higher principal component score in pc1 table 6 while under ct if pf was indicated to be the best treatment regarding enhancing the chickpea growth highest principal component score on pc1 among the treatments under ct the corresponding loadings of rlwc lcc tr seasonal eta by the above mentioned treatment enhanced the performance of chickpea the negative correlation between cwsi and proline content with all the other parameters including yield and wue certainly confirms the notion that they are well suited as soil water stress indicators depicting available soil water status 5 conclusion our study suggests that zt with standing rice stubbles by conserving soil water and reducing the soil water depletion rate significantly improved plant water status of chickpea and can be used as an effective strategy in alleviating the deleterious effects of terminal soil water stress in rice fallows moreover the study also indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation application to meet the crop water demand and the yield potential of chickpea under variable rainfall conditions application of one irrigation at the initiation of the flowering period under zt proved to be the best as it provided the highest yield 1984 kg ha 1 and wp 13 3 kg ha 1mm 1 substantiating the notion of effective water usage under the current water scarce scenario however under ct application of two irrigations at the initiation of flowering and pod formation stages are necessary to obtain a higher yield 1675 kg ha 1 though a decrement was observed in the case of wp 10 kg ha 1 mm 1 further the cwsi was proved to be an effective indicator of soil water stress and crop water status as it reflects the actual crop water demand based on canopy temperature based modelling and it can effectively be utilized in scheduling irrigation therefore from the standpoint of effective resource utilization and getting higher economic returns in terms of yield practicing zt along with the application of one supplemental irrigation at the initiation of the flowering stage of chickpea 50 mm in the rice fallows of lgp needs to be adopted authors

9639,in india chickpea cicer arietinum l is mostly cultivated in post rice residual soil water on marginal lands low crop productivity due to terminal water and heat stress during reproductive stages

cicer arietinum l is a cool season food legume and an important source of protein for millions of people in developing countries particularly in south asia who are largely vegetarian either by choice or because of economic reasons it is the major pulse crop of india grown in 10 56 mha with an annual production of 11 38 mt and average productivity of 1078 kg ha 1 goi government of india 2019 with the ever increasing population enhancement of the pulse production to meet the nutritional demand as well as curbing the protein malnutrition is the need of the hour kumar et al 2015 being the major pulse crop in india chickpea can play a vital role as it is not only important as a food legume for human consumption but also due to its higher yield potential it can contribute significantly towards the sustainability and profitability of the production systems amiri et al 2020 the majority of the chickpea growing area in india is confined within some states with marginal post rice residual water under rainfed conditions as rice chickpea cropping system and hence the overall crop productivity is far less as compared to the other developed countries kumar et al 2015 in recent years the rice fallow areas got an ample share of importance for the crop intensification programmes in south asia the rice fallow systems cover around 11 7 mha especially in the lower gangetic plains lgp expanded over the eastern states of the country saha et al 2020 these areas offer a great opportunity for pulse cultivation as a second crop and chickpea being one of the important pulse crops of the country with greater yield potential can be a suitable choice however the uncertainty of winter rainfall rapid depletion of available soil water and heat stress during the reproductive period result in forced maturity of the post rainy season crops with detrimental effects on the crop productivity in rice fallows ghosh et al 2016 moreover cultivation of long duration puddled transplanted rice 140 150 days delays the sowing of the subsequent crop and yield decline becomes inevitable due to further shortening of soil water availability period therefore there is an urgent need to establish a suitable crop and water management strategy to meet the potential yield gap of chickpea in these marginal soils recently there is a significant interest and emphasis on the shift from extreme tillage to conservation or zero tillage methods as a low cost production technology with a substantial effect on minimizing soil and crop residue disturbance evaporative loss of soil water as well as the energy needs erenstein and laxmi 2008 the establishment of crops in zero tillage may not only eliminate the problems associated with creating an adequate seedbed but also reduce the turnaround time through its ability to conserve soil water by minimizing the soil water depletion rate piggin et al 2015 the positive influence of minimum tillage on the pulse crops in the post rice soils has been reported by several researchers kar and kumar 2009 2019 moreover under conservation tillage systems retention of crop residues of the preceding crop plays a pivotal role in soil water conservation for the second crop through modification of the hydrothermal regime of the soil atmosphere interface and its comparative yield advantage has been reported in succeeding crops such as chickpea lathyrus lentil etc ghosh et al 2016 ramamoorthy et al 2017 kumar et al 2020 therefore adopting conservation tillage practice in post rice marginal soils for chickpea production can not only be a win win strategy to overcome the terminal drought induced yield reductions but also serve the purpose of sustainable intensification of the rice fallows though chickpea is generally cultivated as a rainfed crop grown on residual soil water shreds of evidence support that the application of supplemental irrigation resulted in significant yield increment with single irrigation munirathnam and sangita 2009 two irrigations abraham et al 2010 pau 2011 or three irrigations mansur et al 2010 throughout the growing season out of the several techniques of irrigation scheduling the application of irrigation based on crop phenological stage is quite effective in terms of technology transfer to the farmers field due to its ease of understanding among the various phenological stages of chickpea the flowering and pod formation stages are widely considered as water sensitive and application of irrigation at these stages is shown to increase above ground biomass as well as seed yield zhang et al 2000 oweis et al 2004 nayyar et al 2005 however the amount of irrigation will depend on the antecedent soil water rainfall pattern evaporative demand crop duration etc therefore a proper phenophase based irrigation management system can effectively cater down the yield gap of chickpea in these marginal post rice soils research evidence showed that soil water stress sets in when actual evapotranspiration eta falls below the potential evapotranspiration etp of a particular crop allen et al 1998 the degree of soil water stress also modifies the canopy architecture relative leaf water content rlwc leaf chlorophyll content lcc thereby affecting the cell turgor and crop growth rate nilsen and orcutt 1996 similarly the intensity of soil water stress significantly affects the stomatal opening and leaf water potential thereby decreasing transpiration rate stomatal conductance and the overall photosynthetic activity of the plants baronti et al 2014 moreover plants respond to soil water stress through the accumulation of certain osmolytes such as proline which results in lowering of the osmotic potential of the plant to maintain plant water status and other necessary physiological activities under water stress conditions sanders and arndt 2012 paudel et al 2016 therefore systematic monitoring of these plant physiological parameters will present a great opportunity in the elucidation of the soil water stress induced decrement in plant growth and productivity further the use of canopy temperature for estimation of stomatal closure and or transpiration rate has also been recognized long ago wiegand and namken 1966 idso et al 1977 jackson et al 1981 based on canopy temperature depression ctd and vapour pressure deficit vpd considering all the micrometeorological parameters influencing the canopy temperature the crop water stress index cwsi is defined as a non contact non destructive and reliable measure for appropriate approximation of crop water stress idso et al 1981 saha et al 1986 dejonge et al 2015 however a comprehensive report on quantification of growth stage wise soil water stress and its manifestation into various biochemical attributes in the elucidation of the water stress induced yield decrement in chickpea is scarce therefore a study to assess the interactive effect of different tillage and irrigation management induced alteration of soil water availability on temporal dynamics of soil water stress and its indication through various biochemical as well as canopy attributes will help in further strengthening the notion of yield water relationship based improvement of growth and water productivity of chickpea keeping this in mind in the current experiment it has been hypothesized that i adoption of zero tillage after puddled transplanted rice through modification of the soil hydrothermal properties will increase the effective soil water utilization period and can alleviate the negative effect of soil water stress on growth and productivity of chickpea ii application of phenophase wise supplemental irrigation through maintaining a higher plant water status can bridge the yield gap of chickpea and iii the interactive impact assessment of different tillage and irrigation management on plant biochemical and canopy attributes will help in designing an improved less intensive water efficient production system for chickpea in the post rice marginal soils of lgp to address these hypotheses an experiment was conducted in rice fallows of lgp to grow chickpea with combinations of different tillage and phenophase wise irrigation management with the following objectives i to assess the temporal distribution of soil water storage and field water balance of chickpea under different tillage and irrigation management ii to monitor and quantify crop water stress and its effect on yield and water productivity of chickpea under the above mentioned management systems and iii to assess the most effective treatment under different management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 details of the experimental site field trials were carried out during the post rainy seasons of 2017 18 and 2018 19 in the ab block seed farm bidhan

statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova was performed to determine the effects of tillage and irrigation management systems as factors and their interaction in a split plot design using genstat version 16 0 comparisons among the treatment means were performed by tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test p 0 05 the pca biplot and the correlation matrices were visualized by using the r programme version 3 6 1 3 results 3 1 root zone soil water storage the temporal distribution of root zone soil water storage from 0 to 400 mm soil layer for the entire growth period of chickpea during the two consecutive cropping seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 is presented in fig 2 during both cropping seasons at the time of sowing the root zone soil water storage was well above the θfc under zt while under ct it was 20 0 and 11 1 lower than θfc moreover the soil water storage in the root zone of chickpea decreased with the advancement of growth periods on average during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons the soil water depletion in the root zone of chickpea was 54 7 and 52 6 mm for ct and 74 3 and 67 7 mm for zt respectively within a time frame of 118 and 116 days of the crop growth period it was further revealed that conventionally tilled plots depleted 16 6 28 8 and 12 2 while zero tilled plots depleted 6 0 40 2 and 19 9 water from the root zone of chickpea during vegetative flowering and pod formation stages individually the readily available water raw was maintained up to the late vegetative stage under ct and initiation of the flowering stage under zt on average during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons zt retained 23 and 18 37 and 33 25 and 22 and 17 and 14 more soil water in the root zone of chickpea as compared to ct at sowing vegetative 4 39 das flowering 39 66 das and pod formation stages 66 94 das respectively fig 2a and b the effect of irrigation application on root zone soil water storage is evident from the periodic peak and trough movement of the otherwise progressively downward curve the sole effect of irrigation as well as the tillage irrigation interaction was found to be significant at both flowering and pod formation stages during both the cropping seasons application of growth stage wise irrigation not only increased root zone soil water but it also extended the water availability period delay in approaching towards θwp under both the tillage practices 3 2 soil water stress coefficient ks temporal variation in soil water stress was evaluated for both the cropping seasons 2017 18 and 2018 19 by measuring the water deficit faced by the crop under different tillage and irrigation management systems addressed by a stress co efficient term ks which is depicted in fig 3 the tillage management practices significantly alter the stress intensity faced by chickpea at the critical growth periods during both the cropping seasons under ct the crop fell under water stress from the late vegetative period 39 40 das onwards whereas under zt the crop fell under water stress from the initiation of the flowering period 56 das onwards during both years in the 2017 18 cropping season ct faced 57 and 74 soil water stress as compared to 18 and 44 under zt at flowering and pod formation stages respectively similarly during the 2018 19 cropping season zt faced only 7 and 40 soil water stress as compared to 40 and 66 under ct at these above mentioned periods further the degree of soil water stress faced by chickpea was lower under irrigated regimes as compared to unirrigated regimes under both the tillage practices during both years fig 3a and b the order of soil water stress among the irrigation treatments was i0 ipf if if pf at flowering stage and i0 if ipf if pf at pod formation stage under both ct and zt during the 2017 18 cropping season application of irrigation at the initiation of the flowering stage helped to decrease the intensity of soil water stress for if and if pf treatments as they faced 30 stress as compared to i0 and ipf treatments experiencing 84 stress under ct while under zt if and if pf treatments maintained their non stress condition ks 1 while i0 and ipf treatments were facing 36 stress with no irrigation application i0 exhausted all of its root zone available soil water by 76 das under ct and by 107 das under zt with only one irrigation at the initiation of the flowering stage if water was hardly available for evapotranspiration by 94 das under ct whereas zt faced only 50 stress during that time fig 3a irrigation at the initiation of the pod formation stage ipf reduced the degree of water stress from 95 to 70 for ct and from 65 to 39 for zt during 76 94 das on the other hand irrigation at the initiation of flowering and the initiation of the pod formation stage if pf maintained a very lesser degree of soil water stress compared to other treatments in the second year 2018 19 higher ks values were recorded as compared to the previous year 2017 18 crop with no irrigation i0 faced 100 water stress by 91 das under ct while under zt it faced 77 water stress at the time of harvesting irrigation at the initiation of the flowering stage if depleted half of its available soil water 50 water stress by 73das under ct and by 91das under zt again irrigation at the initiation of pod formation stage ipf showed a similar water stress pattern as of i0 up to 73das degree of water stress was 83 under ct and 43 under zt after which it regains its water availability 57 and 20 water stress by 91das under ct and zt respectively application of two irrigations both at the initiation of flowering and the initiation of pod formation stage if pf maintained the intensity of water stress at 51 under ct and 29 under zt at the end of the cropping period 3 3 actual evapotranspiration eta at critical growth stages the eta of chickpea at different critical growth stages as influenced by various tillage and irrigation management systems during the 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping season is presented in fig 4 the eta was observed maximum during the flowering period under different treatments in both the years interestingly the results also indicated that in both the cropping seasons eta recorded under ct was significantly p 0 001 higher 35 8 and 73 8 than zt in the vegetative period whereas zt showed higher eta as compared to ct during the flowering 24 4 and 33 1 and pod formation stages 36 9 and 23 5 respectively application of irrigation was also found to be significant p 0 001 in terms of eta as the sole effect of irrigation as well as tillage irrigation interaction at both flowering and pod formation stages were significant during both the years in general the number of applications of irrigation water at the critical growth stages significantly increased eta as compared to unirrigated treatments under both ct and zt notable results from the average data of 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons were that with no irrigation i0 zt recorded 47 5 mm eta during flowering and 21 4 mm eta during the pod formation stage however under ct it was 32 1 and 10 6 mm at the above mentioned growth stages again with the application of one irrigation at the initiation of the flowering period if zt recorded 11 3 mm higher eta during flowering and 14 0 mm higher eta during the pod formation stage as compared to ct further with the application of two irrigations if pf zt maintained higher eta during both flowering and pod formation stages when irrigation was applied at the initiation of pod formation ipf stage the eta values were 49 0 mm under ct and 56 7 mm under zt during pod formation stage 3 4 canopy temperature depression ctd and crop water stress index cwsi temporal variation of canopy temperature depression ctd and crop water stress index cwsi of chickpea under different tillage and irrigation treatments during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons are depicted in figs 5 and 6 respectively the data reveals that zt maintained a lower ctd value as compared to ct throughout the crop growth period during both years the ctd values at vegetative flowering and pod formation stages were 1 1 1 4 and 0 9 ºc lower under zt than ct during 2017 18 however they were 0 6 0 6 and 0 8 ºc lower during 2018 19 cropping season further with no irrigation i0 a positive canopy temperature depression was observed by 66 das and 73 das under ct and by 76 das and 91 das under zt during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons respectively the application of irrigation water further reduced the canopy temperature during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons the ctd values were 3 8 and 3 1 ºc for ct and 5 2 and 4 2 ºc for zt when they were irrigated at the initiation of flowering stage if when irrigated at the initiation of pod formation stage ipf the ctd values were 3 0 and 1 0 ºc for ct and 4 0 and 2 0 under zt for the two cropping seasons again a large temperature depression was observed when irrigated at both the initiation of flowering and initiation of pod formation stages if pf under both the tillage practices in each year of the study the daily cwsi decreased after an irrigation event and increased daily during the period between irrigation events fig 6a and b the amount of decrease and the rate of increase in the cwsi corresponded inversely with the amount of rainfall received and irrigation applied in chickpea in each study year the irrigation treatment that supplied the least amount of water i0 had the highest daily cwsi under both ct and zt systems the cwsi of well watered chickpea at if pf under zt fig 6a and b was close to zero for most of the growing period in the 2017 18 cropping season the daily cwsi of the ct treatment ranged between 0 29 and 1 24 for if 0 31 and 1 32 for ipf and 0 32 and 1 20 for if pf fig 6a on the other hand under zt treatment the cwsi ranged between 0 20 and 0 99 for if 0 33 and 1 06 for ipf and 0 15 and 0 88 for if pf fig 6a similarly in the 2018 19 cropping season the daily cwsi of the ct treatment ranged between 0 34 and 1 18 for if 0 49 and 1 30 for ipf and 0 32 and 1 15 for if pf fig 6b on the other hand under zt treatment the cwsi ranged between 0 17 and 0 95 for if 0 41 and 1 04 for ipf and 0 17 and 0 84 for if pf fig 6b fig 6a and b also depict that at vegetative flowering and pod formation stages under zt cwsi was 37 7 and 17 2 41 6 and 35 2 and 26 4 and 18 5 lower than ct during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons though the cwsi value ranges from 0 to 1 some of the values in the current experiment occasionally crossed the upper limit cwsi 1 especially at the later stages of crop growth 3 5 profile water change and seasonal evapotranspiration seasonal eta the profile water change from sowing to harvesting and seasonal crop water use or seasonal eta in chickpea under different tillage and irrigation management systems during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons are presented in table 3 the results revealed that on average zt recorded a 32 5 higher profile water change as compared to ct which is also reflected in the seasonal eta zt recorded 13 8 higher seasonal eta than ct the individual effect of tillage and irrigation on profile water change and seasonal eta was found to be significant p 0 001 during both the years whereas the interaction effect of tillage irrigation on profile water change and seasonal eta was significant only during 2017 18 cropping season during both the cropping seasons profile water change was recorded highest under i0 followed by if ipf and if pf on the contrary seasonal eta was recorded highest under if pf 175 5 mm followed by if 139 3 mm ipf 133 4 mm and i0 92 6 mm further zt recorded significantly higher seasonal eta than ct not only under rainfed condition 22 4 higher under zt than ct but also under the irrigated condition as under if ipf and if pf seasonal eta was 17 4 12 8 and 8 9 higher under zt as compared to ct 3 6 leaf area index lai across all the treatments lai increased with the advancement of the growth period on average the per cent increase of lai under zt as compared to ct was 30 3 22 1 and 29 2 at vegetative flowering and pod formation stages respectively fig 7 application of irrigation at the critical growth periods also influenced lai positively as higher lai was recorded under irrigated regimes as compared to unirrigated regimes under both ct and zt the per cent increase in lai under irrigated regime was 22 7 due to irrigation application at the initiation of the flowering stage whereas the increase was 13 6 due to application of irrigation at the initiation of pod formation stage as compared to the unirrigated regime i0 significantly higher lai was recorded for if pf as compared to other irrigation regimes under ct while under zt lai recorded for if and if pf irrigation regimes were statistically at par noticeably under ct i0 lai decreased from 2 0 at the flowering stage to 1 8 at the pod formation stage 3 7 relative leaf water content rlwc and proline content the pooled data of 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping season revealed that rlwc of chickpea under different tillage and irrigation management increased from vegetative to flowering period but decreased from flowering to the pod formation stage fig 8 whereas proline content increases with the advancement of the growth stages fig 9 at the vegetative period the effect of tillage was found to be non significant in terms of rlwc but for proline content the difference between tillage practices was significant at that period under zt rlwc was10 2 higher at flowering and 12 3 higher at the pod formation stage as compared to ct however proline content was found to be 60 3 and 32 2 higher under ct as compared to zt at flowering and pod formation stages respectively moreover the results also indicated that the application of irrigation at the critical growth stages of chickpea recorded significantly higher rlwc but lower proline content as compared to unirrigated regimes application of one irrigation at the initiation of the flowering period if under zt performed way better than the application of two irrigation both at the initiation of flowering and pod formation stages if pf under ct in terms of maintaining higher rlwc as well as lower proline content 3 8 leaf chlorophyll content lcc the effect of tillage irrigation and tillage irrigation interaction on the total leaf chlorophyll content lcc of chickpea mg g 1 fresh weight was found to be significant p 0 001 especially at flowering and pod formation stages during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons fig 10 the per cent increment of the lcc recorded under zt was 27 4 and 53 0 during 2017 18 and was 21 8 and 25 3 during the 2018 19 cropping season as compared to ct at flowering and pod formation stages respectively results also showed that the lcc increased significantly in response to irrigation application at the critical growth stages except for ct i0 moreover the lcc was found at par for if pf and if under zt whereas under ct it was significantly higher for if pf than if 3 9 transpiration rate tr and stomatal conductance gs irrespective of tillage and irrigation management practice tr and gs were recorded highest during the flowering period and then decreases subsequently table 4 from the pooled data of 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping season it is evident that significantly higher tr 2 6 3 2 and 2 0 mmol m 2 s 1 and gs 169 6 304 8 and 206 8 mmol m 2 s 1 were recorded under zt as compared to ct atall the growth stages of chickpea irrigation application at the critical growth stages of chickpea resulted in a significant increase in tr and gs as compared to unirrigated regimes under both ct and zt irrigation application at the initiation of flowering if proved to be better in terms of maintaining higher tr and gs as compared to irrigation application at the initiation of pod formation ipf under both ct and zt the treatment if pf with two irrigation applications recorded significantly higher tr and gs at both flowering and pod formation stages than other irrigation regimes under ct whereas the tr and gs recorded under if pf and if were statistically at par under zt 3 10 yield and water productivity wp the seed yield of chickpea ranged from 576 to 1975 kg ha 1 and 582 1984 kg ha 1 with an average yield of 1414 8 and 1441 4 kg ha 1 during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons respectively table 5 the range of wp was recorded from 7 6 to 13 7 kg ha 1mm 1 and 6 5 13 0 kg ha 1mm 1 with an average wp of 10 6 and 10 2 kg ha 1mm 1 during 2017 18 and 2018 19 cropping seasons irrespective of irrigation application zt improved the yield and wp of chickpea by 37 1 and 23 7 as compared to ct irrigation application at critical growth stages also significantly improved yield and wp of chickpea on average if if pf and ipf improved yield by 841 948 and 404 kg ha 1 as compared to i0 on the other hand if if pf improved wp by 32 3 and 11 8 as compared to i0 while no improvement of wp was recorded under ipf than i0 under ct the highest yield was recorded under if pf 1675 kg ha 1 followed by if 1458 kg ha 1 ipf 1106 kg ha 1 though the highest yield under ct was recorded for if pf wp was the highest in if 11 3 kg ha 1mm 1 whereas under zt no significant difference was found between if pf and if in terms of yield 1984 and 1981 kg ha 1 respectively while wp was significantly higher under if 13 3 kg ha 1mm 1 further ipf under ct significantly improved both yield and wp as compared to i0 while under zt it only improved yield as wp was higher under i0 as compared to ipf overall the treatment combination zt if produced the highest yield 1984 kg ha 1 and also obtained maximum wp 13 3 kg ha 1mm 1 3 11 principal component analysis the principal component analysis reduced the eight treatment combinations of tillage and irrigation to two orthogonal components pc1 and pc2 which all together explained 94 of the total variance within the variables fig 11 the pc1 explained 85 of the total variance and had a significant loading on each of the variables and the highest loading was observed on rlwc on the other hand pc2 explained 9 of the total variance and had the highest loading on seasonal eta the pca biplot showed the position of different variables and treatments in the orthogonal space defined by the two pcs the biplot distinctly represented the distribution of observations corresponding to each treatment and the resulting interaction between the two main components all the assessed variables showed a positive correlation with pc1 except proline content and cwsi by analysing pc1 there was a clear separation between treatments ct i0 and ct ipf on the left hand side and others on the right hand sides of the vertical line as presented in table 6 from the scores on the pc1 it can be interpreted that zt if resulted in better performance of chickpea than did the other treatments growth promoting action of zt treatments on chickpea was established by the pca 4 discussion 4 1 root zone soil water storage and soil water stress dynamic changes in the root zone soil water storage under different tillage and irrigation management modified the water availability pattern as well as the intensity of soil water stress at various critical growth periods of chickpea the soil profile managed with standing rice stubbles under zt resulted in a longer period of water availability during the crop growth period which may be attributed to higher initial water content in the root zone θfc lower evaporative depletion of soil water in the presence of standing rice stubbles along with the reduced rate of vertical soil water movement within the compacted puddled rice soil having low macro porosity saxena 2009 araya et al 2015 nandi et al 2021 on the other hand the tilled and porous structure of soil created by tillage operation not only hastened the root zone soil water depletion owing to the exposed soil surface but it also increases the soil water movement through modification of the pore geometry of the soil jin et al 2007 obia et al 2020 the benefits of zt in terms of soil water conservation under post rainy season pulse crops in igp were also reported by other researchers kar and kumar 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2018 saha et al 2020 further periodic recharging of the root zone with the application of irrigation at the critical growth stages of chickpea not only increased the soil water storage but also helped in modifying residence time of the water availability under both the tillage practices the initial rapid rate of soil water depletion from the disturbed and exposed soil surfaces under ct forced chickpea towards an early soil water stress condition ks 1 as compared to zt the downward progression of the ks values may also be attributed to the increased water depletion in the root zone due to evapotranspiration loss of water inducing water stress conditions bandyopadhyay et al 2018 higher water content in the root zone of chickpea under zt and its longer availability period could serve as a buffer for the dry spells during the crop growing season especially under rainfed conditions nandi et al 2021 irrigation application at the critical growth stages of chickpea significantly reduced the degree of soil water stress by increasing the water availability in the root zone complete exhaustion of the root zone soil water as indicated by a ks value approaching towards 0 during the later stages of crop growth substantiate the necessity of irrigation application at the critical growth stages especially under erratic rainfall condition to prevent the crop to fall under severe water stress condition these results were in line with turner et al 2007 who reported that severe soil water stress at the time of initiation of the reproductive phase could lead to the cessation of flowering ultimately resulting in yield decrement of chickpea though a higher root zone soil water storage as well as a lower degree of soil water stress was obtained with the combination of two irrigation applications if pf under zt application of only one irrigation at the initiation of flowering stage if also performed fairly well in terms of efficient utilization of soil water within the taw range and also in moderating soil water stress 4 2 field water balance and actual evapotranspiration eta the soil surface with standing crop stubble under zt created a barrier between the soil surface and the atmosphere causing lower evaporative loss of stored soil water during the initial stages of crop growth as compared to ct acharya and sharma 1994 and bandyopadhyay et al 2016 demonstrated that standing crop stubbles modify the hydro thermal regimes between the soil atmosphere interface which in turn mitigates the soil water stress however with the advancement of the crop growth period the establishment of a substantial amount of canopy cover increases the contribution of the transpiration component of eta due to higher root water extraction at the same time owing to canopy shading the contribution from the loss of soil water through evaporative flux decreases hence a favourable hydrothermal regime as well as higher biomass and lai under zt significantly increased the transpiration rate table 4 resulting in an overall increase in eta as compared to ct these results were also affirmed by higher root zone profile water change under zt as compared to ct in this study the higher availability of water in the root zone throughout the cropping season under zt facilitated a greater depletion of stored water through evapotranspiration however a lesser degree of tortuosity due to better continuity of pores in the undisturbed soil profile coupled with the deep crack formation in the previous puddled rice soils at the later stages of crop growth under zt may also have attributed towards higher profile water change kumar et al 2020 and nandi et al 2021 also reported that puddled rice soils under zero till management may be subjected to deep crack formation which has a major contribution towards increased soil water storage depletion under zt the application of the number of irrigation water induced surface wetness of the soil followed by higher root water extraction from the recharged soil profile significantly increased the eta as evidenced by higher seasonal eta under if pf irrigation regime compared to the unirrigated treatments the seasonal eta is assured mainly from a profile water change and effective rainfall under rainfed conditions while under irrigated conditions frequency of irrigation application plays a crucial role in determining the seasonal eta or actual crop water use in this study the variation of seasonal eta from 83 3 to 183 1 mm was attributed to not only the interaction effect of tillage and irrigation management practices but also the antecedent soil water content daily weather parameters size of the treatment plots canopy architecture of the variety used and its duration of growth different researchers rao and poonia 2004 panday et al 2008 patel et al 2009 etc reported seasonal crop water use of chickpea in the range of 110 343 mm in india under both rainfed and irrigated conditions after harvesting of long duration puddled transplanted rice under contrasting tillage and residue management practices 4 3 crop water stress and plant physiological response the canopy temperature is mainly regulated by transpiration as it cools the leaf surfaces by taking off the latent heat of vaporization a cooler canopy is generally associated with higher soil water status and consequently higher plant water uptake resulting in stomata being open thereby maintaining a higher transpiration rate chaturvedi et al 1999 the undisturbed soil profile under zt along with standing stubbles enhanced the crop water availability period which further manifested into higher transpiration and better shading effect owing to higher canopy coverage higher lai thereby maintaining a lower canopy temperature than the mean air temperature as compared to ct accordingly in the present study ctd showed a significant negative relationship with eta r2 0 68 p 0 001 fig 12 indicating that with every 10 mm increase in eta the mean difference between a canopy and air temperature is lowered by 0 92 ºc application of irrigation water at the critical growth stages significantly increased eta and canopy coverage resulting in cooler canopies by maintaining higher soil water status these results were also affirmed by saha et al 1986 showing that irrigated chickpea maintained a lower ctd throughout the crop growth period as compared to unirrigated chickpea no irrigation under both ct and zt within the crop growth period with positive ctd values indicated severe terminal soil water stress associated with stomatal closure and reduction in a transpirational cooling effect patel et al 2001 also reported a significant terminal soil water stress associated with positive ctd values in late shown pigeon pea higher soil water in the root zone throughout the crop growth period under zt helped the plants to keep up higher transpiration and a cooler canopy thereby retaining cwsi values significantly lower than ct the two major peaks found in the temporal changes of cwsi values in chickpea coincided with the initiation of flowering and the initiation of pod formation stages under both the tillage practices affirmed these two stages to be water sensitive water demanding lower cwsi values at the critical growth stages under zt than ct substantiate efficient water utilization and lower intensity of soil water stress under zt further periodic application of irrigation water at the critical growth stages significantly lowered the cwsi values alleviating the deleterious effect of soil water stress though cwsi values usually range between 0 no stress and 1 maximum stress some of the values in the current experiment crossed the upper value cwsi 1 at the later stages of crop growth it is well documented that cwsi values range between 0 and 1 only when the vpd range between 20 and 40 kpa and can exceed the upper value in locations with low vpd in the range of 11 15 kpa alderfasi and nielsen 2001 the humid climate in the experimental location with vpd ranging between 9 8 and 15 kpa at the later stages of crop growth 76 das onwards may have contributed towards this anomaly i e cwsi exceeding 1 gardner et al 1992 also pointed out that because of natural variability associated with field measurements an occasional cwsi value greater than 1 under extreme water stressed conditions may not be a cause of concern as it refers to a further reduction in transpiration due to complete stomatal closure and a decrease in lai similarly under the current experiment cwsi values greater than 1 were reported at 76 das only for the treatments experiencing severe water stress i0 and ipf under ct while at 94 das it was only for i0 treatment under both ct and zt posing no issues in its interpretability further cwsi values greater than 1 at 107 and 118 das were a result of senescence and crop maturity further in this study a significant negative linear relationship between cwsi and rlwc r2 0 81 p 0 001 fig 13 depicts that less than 67 rlwc is an indicator of plant water stress in chickpea 4 4 soil water stress and physiological response the rlwc is closely associated with cell turgor and is controlled by water availability jones 1990 lawlor and cornic 2002 lower rlwc values under ct is indicative of limited root water uptake under water stress condition as evidenced by the steep decrease of ks fig 3 which resulted in the loss of turgor and limited water availability for cell expansion subsequently suppressing plant growth and development this is confirmed by the significant positive relationship between rlwc and soil water storage indicating that with every 10 mm decrease in soil water storage rlwc decreased by 4 fig 15 a similar relationship between soil water deficit and rlwc was also reported by talukdar 2013 saha et al 2020 nandi et al 2021 with lentil again a significant negative relationship r2 0 7968 p 0 001 fig 15 between proline content and soil water storage in this study strengthens our hypothesis that proline accumulation is an indicator of soil water stress several researchers reported higher proline accumulation under water stress conditions in maize moussa and abdel aziz 2008 mulberry ramanjulu and sudhakar 2000 lentil saha et al 2020 and chickpea cevik et al 2019 the decrease in soil water storage as well as the decline in rlwc under ct resulted in lower lcc as compared to zt higher water availability under zt induced a higher root water uptake as well as higher translocation of nutrients giving rise to higher lai and lcc nandi et al 2021 ahmadi and siosemardeh 2005 observed that the increase in lcc with plant age was due to increased leaf area index a positive and significant correlation fig 14 between lcc and lai r2 0 95 p 0 001 and lcc and soil water storage r2 0 96 p 0 001 indicate that water is an integral part of leaf expansion as well as chlorophyll synthesis soil water stress reportedly enhances the degradation of synthesized chlorophyll as well as inhibits the synthesis of new chlorophyll pigments mathobo et al 2017 the increased plant water status as well as higher lai under zt also resulted in significantly higher tr and gs as compared to ct table 4 earlier studies snider et al 2014 baronti et al 2014 reported that stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were increased with an increase in available soil water status snider et al 2014 baronti et al 2014 this finding is in accordance with the linear relationships with lai lcc rlwc vs tr or gs fig 14 nonetheless stomatal closure is one of the first signs of defence against water stress to avoid further water loss to maintain higher cell turgidity zlatev and yordanov 2004 dulai et al 2006 thereby reducing gs as well as tr under soil water deficit the decrease in gs and tr from flowering to pod formation stage can also be attributed to the enhanced mobilization of rubisco pate et al 1983 pandey et al 2001 also reported a decrease in gs and tr of chickpea from flowering to pod formation stage the adequate water supply at the initiation of the flowering period through providing irrigation not only increases the eta but also resulted in an increase in rlwc as well as an increase in lcc as compared to unirrigated treatments whereas application of irrigation only at the initiation of pod formation stage proved to be less effective as chickpea plants have already gone through an appreciable loss in turgor followed by aggravated ageing and senescence induced by soil water stress these effects were more pronounced under ct as compared to zt the result indicated that the application of one irrigation at the initiation of flowering stage if under zt proved enough for alleviating the harmful effect of soil water stress however application of two irrigations at the initiation of flowering and the initiation of pod formation stages if pf under zt though increased available soil water as well as seasonal eta can be considered as a wasteful use of water as it failed to enhance rlwc lcc and lai over if on the other hand under ct the application of two irrigations if pf was proved to be the best in terms of plant physiology as the exposed soil surface along with lower canopy coverage aggravated the root zone soil water depletion necessitating the use of two irrigations 4 5 yield and water productivity conventional tilage systems are comparatively more vulnerable to soil water stress resulting in lesser yield as compared to zt the undisturbed soil profile with standing stubbles under zt effectively conserved more soil water thereby resulting in a longer period of water availability ultimately producing higher seed yield as compared to ct bandyopadhyay et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 decreased rlwc lcc and lower canopy coverage due to soil water stress as all the parameters showed a significant positive correlation with both yield and wue manifested into a greater reduction of chickpea seed yield under ct higher seasonal eta seasonal crop water use and enhanced root water extraction under zt may also have contributed significantly towards the increased yield of chickpea as compared to ct these results were also affirmed by the significant positive relationship between seasonal eta and chickpea yield in the current study r2 0 80 p 0 001 fig 16 and indicated that a yield gain of 12 7 kg was obtained for every 1 mm increase in eta this relationship between yield and seasonal eta was also supported by several other researchers in different crops huang et al 2004 sarkar et al 2010 application of irrigation significantly increased chickpea yield under both ct and zt irrigation induced increase in chickpea yield was reported by several researchers with single irrigation munirathnam and sangita 2009 with two irrigations abraham et al 2010 pau 2011 or with three irrigations mansur et al 2010 the flowering and pod formation stages are identified as the water sensitive stages of chickpea turner et al 2001 nayyar et al 2005 however the amount and the timing of irrigation will depend upon the rainfall pattern of the region soil type evaporative demand crop duration etc zhang et al 2000 oweis et al 2004 in the current experiment the highest yield was obtained with two irrigation if pf under ct while under zt the yield obtained under if and if pf were at par application of two irrigation if pf under zt only increased seasonal eta as no significant difference was observed in other yield contributing factors rlwc lcc lai gs etc in comparison to if however under ct two irrigation was found to be necessary to maintain a sufficient level of available soil water for obtaining a higher yield of chickpea further the results also indicated that application of irrigation only at the initiation of pod formation stage ipf was not sufficient enough to achieve the irrigation induced yield advantage as early season stress during the initiation of flowering stage resulted in a significant decrease in photosynthesis rate and disrupts the metabolism of carbohydrates leading to a reduced export of assimilates to the sink organs ultimately resulting in enhanced flower abortion and decrement in seed yield liu et al 2004 further the effective soil water conservation under zt contributed significantly towards enhanced wp 11 5 kg ha 1mm 1 as compared to ct 9 3 kg ha 1mm 1 higher wp with the second crops in rice fallows with conservation tillage was reported by several researchers kar and kumar 2009 bandyopadhyay et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 nandi et al 2021 though higher yield was obtained with the application of two irrigations if pf under ct the decrement in wp as compared to if was due to a higher relative increase in seasonal eta in response to higher irrigation application as compared to yield while under zt though the yield recorded with if and if pf were statistically at par seasonal eta was recorded higher under if pf due to higher root zone available soil water ultimately resulting in lower wp as compared to if therefore zt if treatment combination can be considered as best in terms of both yield and wp this result was also affirmed by the pca study as zt if recorded a significantly higher principal component score in pc1 table 6 while under ct if pf was indicated to be the best treatment regarding enhancing the chickpea growth highest principal component score on pc1 among the treatments under ct the corresponding loadings of rlwc lcc tr seasonal eta by the above mentioned treatment enhanced the performance of chickpea the negative correlation between cwsi and proline content with all the other parameters including yield and wue certainly confirms the notion that they are well suited as soil water stress indicators depicting available soil water status 5 conclusion our study suggests that zt with standing rice stubbles by conserving soil water and reducing the soil water depletion rate significantly improved plant water status of chickpea and can be used as an effective strategy in alleviating the deleterious effects of terminal soil water stress in rice fallows moreover the study also indicated the importance of supplemental irrigation application to meet the crop water demand and the yield potential of chickpea under variable rainfall conditions application of one irrigation at the initiation of the flowering period under zt proved to be the best as it provided the highest yield 1984 kg ha 1 and wp 13 3 kg ha 1mm 1 substantiating the notion of effective water usage under the current water scarce scenario however under ct application of two irrigations at the initiation of flowering and pod formation stages are necessary to obtain a higher yield 1675 kg ha 1 though a decrement was observed in the case of wp 10 kg ha 1 mm 1 further the cwsi was proved to be an effective indicator of soil water stress and crop water status as it reflects the actual crop water demand based on canopy temperature based modelling and it can effectively be utilized in scheduling irrigation therefore from the standpoint of effective resource utilization and getting higher economic returns in terms of yield practicing zt along with the application of one supplemental irrigation at the initiation of the flowering stage of chickpea 50 mm in the rice fallows of lgp needs to be adopted authors
