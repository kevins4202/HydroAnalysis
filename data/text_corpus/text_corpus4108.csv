20540,bionic robots usually move forward in water with the swinging or paddling propulsion amphibious robots generally use webbed feet to paddle forward thus the webbed foot is a key part to propel the body and numerously has multiple joints the flippers interact with water to generate propulsive forces in propulsion phase while the resistance is generated during the recovery phase therefore the research on hydrodynamics of the webbed foot contributes to reveal the mechanism of the interaction between the paddling webbed foot and water and improve the paddling ability at present the feet of amphibious robots mostly adopt non bending structure which have great resistance in the retracting stage at the same time the existing hydrodynamic model does not take into account the changes in the flow velocity caused by the paddling which results in the low performance of the bionic flippers and the inaccurate calculation of the hydrodynamic theory in addition at present there is no specific standard to measure the paddling ability of flippers so the paddling performance cannot be accurately evaluated in this paper the beaver is used as a bionic object and a platform of the beaver like bendable webbed foot was constructed through the analysis of the structure and motion trajectories of beaver s flexible webbed foot a hydrodynamic model of the beaver like bendable webbed foot was established then three parameters namely the paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor were proposed as indicators to quantify the paddling performance of beaver like webbed foot through the theoretical calculation and computational fluid dynamics simulation the results verify that the proposed hydrodynamic calculation model is more accurate compared with the existing methods in different paddling trajectories of the beaver like webbed foot under various flow velocities through hydrodynamic simulations of non bending and bendable webbed foot under different flow velocities it is found that the bendable webbed foot can effectively reduce the resistance of webbed foot in the recovery stage different trajectories and bending degrees of the webbed foot have different effects on the resistance of paddling the webbed foot s paddling performance is quantitatively analyzed and clearly evaluated by calculating the paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor under six trajectories of beaver like webbed foot it provides theoretical support for the trajectory planning of the webbed foot on this basis an improved motion trajectory is proposed by adding a pause process after the paddling propulsion stage of the beaver like webbed foot which can reduce the resistance generated by the water flow and improve the paddling performance the hydrodynamic modeling of the beaver like webbed foot and the study of the paddling characteristics under different flow velocities can provide a new method for the hydrodynamic research of underwater webbed bionic robots and offer a quantifiable standard for the analysis of the paddling performance of the webbed foot further promote the development of underwater bionic robot in hydrodynamic theory and motion performance study keywords beaver bendable webbed foot hydrodynamics paddling performance of beaver like webbed foot underwater robots 1 introduction in recent years the research of underwater robots has been rapidly developed and the hydrodynamic modeling of underwater robots is of great significance to the study of underwater robots motion and propulsion performance hu et al 2011 cui et al 2017 the current methods usually include theoretical calculations approximate estimations and numerical calculations huang and liu 2020 wang et al 2017 the theoretical calculation method contains the hess smith method which derives the spatial double discrete integral equation based on the potential flow theory and it can calculate the additional mass force when robots move in different watersheds approximate estimation method is a semi empirical formula derived from the results of a large number of simulation experiments and modified on the basis of the theoretical formula of the regular geometry numerical calculation method uses fluid simulation software to calculate and simulate the motion of underwater robots the advantage is that it can provide more detailed information of fluid fields including those are difficult to obtain in experiments such as lift drag and wake fields at present the research on hydrodynamics is commonly seen in the multi legged underwater robot jun et al 2011 chen et al 2018 webbed foot of birds and the process that fishes swing their bodies and tail fins li et al 2020 xiao et al 2014 the vortices are separated in the later stages of the movement which help organisms move forward in the water it is a way of propulsion based on lift force however amphibians often use resistance based propulsion methods for example turtles and crabs move forward by flapping roper et al 2011 squid and jellyfish move forward by jetting water richards and clemente 2013 the swimming process of bottlenose dolphins was analyzed and a hydromechanical model was used to calculate thrust power output coefficient of drag and propulsive efficiency the study indicated that bottlenose dolphins are well adapted for efficient high performance swimming but show no unusual hydrodynamic performance fish 1993 the frog uses flippers to swim and its instantaneous forces during propulsion in swimming was analyzed using an impulse momentum approach based on dpiv flow data nauwelaerts et al 2005 based on the cfd simulation results the aquatic frog can generate a propulsive efficiency 43 11 which is the ratio of thrust power work to the total mechanical work produced jizhuang et al 2017 the swimming of muskrats was studied and presented that thrust is mainly generated by alternating strokes of the hindfeet and the lengthening of the hindfeet increases the surface area of the foot to produce thrust more effectively fish 1984 the contribution of muskrat s tail to its propulsion efficiency in swimming was studied by filming the swimming process of the muskrat it indicated that the tail could generate a small amount of thrust while keeping the muskrat moving smoothly in the swimming process fish 1982 propulsion modes of mammalian swimming were analyzed paddling of the muskrat is a drag based swimming mode and the drag force is generated by the posterior sweep of the hind feet fish 1996 energy requirements of beavers were investigated when they are at different activities resting on land resting in water and swimming underwater the study presented that the beaver has good diving performance allers and culik 1997a with the webbed foot paddling it has good posture adjustment and ability to adapt to the complex water environment chen et al 2016 its swimming mainly depends on the bendable toes and different trajectories of the webbed foot however there is no research on the performance of webbed foot this article proposes a hypothesis that bendable webbed foot and reasonable paddling trajectories can greatly improve the webbed foot s paddling propulsion performance in a cycle in order to verify this hypothesis this study uses webbed foot as the research object to study the hydrodynamics and paddling performance of beaver like webbed foot as shown in fig 1 the beaver is an amphibious animal allers and culik 1997b it is good at swimming and can move underwater at high speed with multiple cycles and it also has the ability to walk on land beaver moves mainly with its legs feet and toes and the hind feet have webs as shown in fig 2 the webbed foot can reduce or increase the water facing area to change the water resistance by bending or stretching the toe joints during underwater motion thereby increasing the propulsion ability this paper establishes a hydrodynamic model based on the beaver s foot skeleton the angles and angular velocities of the foot joints in the beaver paddling are obtained through the video analysis van rodijnen 2017 wonderly 2019 four parts of webbed foot are divided according to the different attack angles and angular velocity during the paddling and the hydrodynamic model of each part is calculated through the hydrodynamic formula proposed in this paper then a more accurate hydrodynamic model is obtained with the accumulation of the four parts furthermore the underwater movement of webbed foot is simulated and analyzed based on the computational fluid dynamics li et al 2017 cfd finally the movement of the webbed foot prototype is captured by a high definition camera in the experiment and the variation of joint angles in multiple cycles is recorded and analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 paddling trajectories of the beaver beavers are mainly distributed in europe in china beavers are scarce and wildlife under first class state protection they are only distributed in the qinghe buergen river and ulungur river in the northeast of xinjiang province it is difficult to get an actual beaver and record its motion for studying its swimming trajectories therefore we analyzed its motion and extracted its swimming trajectories from the existing video two swimming modes are observed from videos of the beaver motion synchronous and alternate paddling of two feet and joint trajectories are obtained chen et al 2020 chen and jin 2019 as shown in fig 3 in the synchronous paddling mode the initial angle of the ankle joint in the swimming direction is 76 after 0 2 s of paddling it reaches the maximum position of the propulsion stage and its maximum limit angle is about 151 from the beginning of the paddling to the limit angle the maximum ankle speed reaches 490 deg s at this time the angle between the entire hind limb and the forward direction is 102 and the toe joint is kept at a small angle as shown in fig 4 there is a half period phase difference between the webbed feet in the alternate paddling mode one moves backward but the other moves forward the paddling motion includes a propulsion phase and a recovery phase during the propulsion process the angle of the ankle joint increases from 53 to 148 the toe joint angle remains at a relatively small angle and the webbed foot is in a stretched state after into the recovery phase the angle of the ankle joint gradually decreases and the angle of the toe joint increases rapidly as shown in fig 5 a video of the movement process of the beaver under a fixed lens clearly captures the movement of the beaver in the horizontal direction when it paddles underwater the ratio of the forward distance to the beaver s body length is used to obtain the forward distance and swimming speed relative to the body length observing the motion curve it is found that the forward distance of the beaver in a cycle is about half of the body length and the forward speed shows a decreasing trend the velocity is obtained by fitting the forward speed as follows 1 v t 1 4 sin 4 48 t 1 5 l e n g t h where length is the length of the beaver 2 2 definition of the motion trajectory of the beaver s webbed foot the paddling motion of the webbed foot has two processes the propulsion phase and the recovery phase as shown in fig 6 during the propulsion phase the force received by the webbed foot paddling is the propulsive force the webbed foot moves from the initial position 1 to the maximum position 7 the angular velocity of the webbed foot gradually increases and the toe joints stretch to the maximum state very quickly when the webbed foot is almost perpendicular to the swimming direction the velocity reaches the maximum value and then the velocity of the webbed foot gradually decreases when the webbed foot rotates to the maximum angle it starts the next stage in the recovery phase the force received from the webbed foot paddling is the fluid resistance compared with the first phase the webbed foot takes longer time to return to the initial state the toe joints are tightened to a minimum state in a very short period of time this approach minimizes the flow resistance of the webbed foot during the recovery process when the webbed foot returns to the initial state this stage ends and a new cycle of paddling is prepared according to the observation and trajectory extraction of the beaver motion the beaver paddling trajectories are obtained and on this basis the trajectories are improved to create various motion trajectories of the beaver like webbed foot which are defined as the single joint motion under the alternate paddling case 1 single joint motion under the synchronous paddling case 2 and bending compound motions under the alternate paddling case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 where case 6 is the improved motion on the basis of case 5 among them case 1 is the single joint motion trajectory obtained by fitting the discrete angles of the webbed foot in the paddling as shown in fig 4 case 2 is the single joint motion trajectory obtained by fitting the discrete angles in fig 3 case 3 4 and 5 are multi joint motion trajectories in which the bending angle of the toe joint sequentially increases on the basis of case 1 motion case 6 is an improved motion trajectory which is a multi joint motion trajectory obtained by adding a pause process at the end of the propulsion stage in case 5 the above trajectories of the ankle and toe joints are shown in fig 7 2 3 platform of the beaver like webbed foot the beaver s webbed foot structure is simplified as shown in fig 8 the toe joint is set to three degrees of freedom and the link mechanism is used to replace the beaver s complex foot structure and the toes are connected by thin films the size of the webbed foot platform is based on the measurement of the beaver s skeleton and its length width and other parameters are shown in table 1 2 4 paddling model of the beaver like bendable webbed foot with multiple joints in the paddling of the webbed foot the main hydrodynamic forces are lift resistance fig 9 defines the kinematic coordinate system and the lift resistance in the paddling movement of the webbed foot the webbed foot resistance is the force opposite to the direction of the beaver s movement along the x direction which is the propulsive force of the beaver s movement during the propulsion phase the lift is the force perpendicular to the movement direction and it implements the rise and dive of the beaver also affects the balance of the beaver s movement in water the force in the x direction is used as a parameter to measure the webbed foot s paddling performance 2 4 1 paddling force analysis of the beaver like webbed foot fig 10 shows the changes of the surrounding flow field and the force on the webbed foot during the webbed foot paddling the flow field is divided into incident flow area and static flow area the incident flow area is the zone where the water flow changes naturally and the flow velocity varies due to the forward movement of the beaver s paddling the static flow area is due to the blocking on the front flow of the webbed foot which makes the water velocity reduce to much less during the propulsion stage of the webbed foot paddling fig 10 b the front current impacts the webbed foot and creates fluid resistance blue arrows the webbed foot moves backward to compress the back water and form a low pressure area on the front side thereby generates the propulsion on the webbed foot red arrow one part of the water flow on the back side flows backwards and the other part flows from the bottom and sides of the webbed foot back to the front side these form a backflow zone the back flow is caused by the rotation of the webbed foot hereinafter referred to as induced flow fig 10 c and the induced flow will increase the fluid resistance of the webbed foot during the initial period of the recovery phase in the recovery phase fig 10 d the webbed foot moves forward and the front watershed is compressed by the webbed foot then the water flows through the two sides and downside of the webbed foot and goes back and forms a backflow zone on the back the webbed foot is mainly subject to the fluid resistance in this stage 2 4 2 fluid drag and propulsive force in the paddling of beaver like webbed foot as shown in fig 11 the fluid resistance is equal to the water force acting on the object in the same direction of the incoming flow under steady state according to the principle of fluid similarity it is mainly related to the drag coefficient frontal area and flow velocity the force generated by the incident flow is defined as the fluid resistance when the webbed foot paddles underwater when the webbed foot moves the force produced by compressing the rear side of the watershed is called as the paddling propulsion in the calculation the angles and postures of the object should be considered in this paper a theoretical model of the webbed foot paddling is proposed which calculates the fluid resistance and propulsion generated by the webbed foot paddling respectively it considers the force changes caused by the different motion postures of the multi joint webbed foot the force on the webbed foot is defined as healey et al 1995 fossen 1999 2 f f d r a g f l i f t f m o v e where f d r a g f l i f t are expressed as 3 f d r a g c d ρ a u w u w x ˆ 4 f l i f t c l ρ a u w u w y ˆ where c d and c l are the drag and lift coefficient ρ is the liquid density which is 1 0 10 3 k g m 3 and a s sin α s is the area of the webbed foot and α is the angle between the fluid and the webbed foot 5 u w v a u m v a u m 0 v a u m where v a is the inlet flow velocity and u m is the linear velocity of the webbed foot paddling expressed as u m i ω i r i ω i and r i are the rotational angular velocity and radius of each joint of the webbed foot propulsive force is defined as follows 6 f m o v e c d ρ a u m u m here the segmented integral is used to calculate the multi joint webbed foot paddling model fig 12 it can be more accurate to consider the changes in the hydrodynamic force caused by variations of the movement velocity in the simultaneous rotation of multiple joints taking a small horizontal strip in the webbed foot and its width is w thus 7 f d r a g 0 l c d ρ u w u w w d r x ˆ 8 f l i f t 0 l c l ρ u w u w w d r y ˆ 9 f m o v e 0 l c d ρ a u m u m d r among them c d c l are the dimensionless drag and lift coefficient antonelli and pascal 2003 which are determined according to the reynolds number r n of the translational and rotational planes r n can be expressed in laminar and turbulent layers as 10 r n ρ u d μ where d is the characteristic length in the direction of the flow velocity here is depicted as the width of the webbed foot and its maximum value is 0 186 m μ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid the calculations and experiments all use water as the medium the dynamic viscosity is taken as 1 01 10 3 p a s the density is taken as 1 10 3 k g m 3 the speed is less than 1 m s according to equation 10 if the reynolds number is less than 2 10 5 then the drag coefficient is 1 and the lift coefficient is 0 8 according to the difference in velocity and angle of attack the webbed foot is divided into four areas to calculate the hydrodynamic force see appendix 1 and each area is in the form of integrals the total lift drag and propulsion are as follows 11 f d r a g f d r a g 0 2 i 1 3 f d r a g w i 12 f l i f t f l i f t 0 2 i 1 3 f l i f t w i 13 f m o v e f m o v e 0 2 i 1 3 f m o v e w i the above method can be used to solve the hydrodynamic force of the webbed foot when it moves in water the calculation amount is small simple and convenient which can effectively solve the hydrodynamic calculation problem of the bendable webbed foot 2 5 paddling indicators of the beaver like webbed foot in order to measure the paddling performance of different webbed foot trajectories the paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor are proposed to describe the webbed foot s paddling performance under different flow velocities 2 5 1 paddling force factor in order to accurately quantify the paddling performance of the webbed foot under different inlet flow velocities the paddling force factor is defined as follows 14 η f t δ t f t δ t 100 where f t is the force on the webbed foot during the time t 0 to t 1 9s δ t is the time interval which is 0 005 s the above formula is used to quantify and compare the paddling performance of different motion trajectories of the webbed foot under different flow velocities 2 5 2 maximum flow velocity the maximum flow velocity is the maximum speed of the flow that the paddling webbed foot can resist the webbed foot cannot provide effective and stable periodic propulsion to propel the body forward when the flow velocity exceeds it the specific definition is that constructing two dimensional discrete point diagram with the flow velocity and the paddling force factor and use the fitting method to obtain the continuous curve function f v η and the maximum flow velocity is v i n calculated from f v i n η 0 5 2 5 3 compound paddling force factor the compound paddling force factor is a comprehensive index of the paddling force factor which is used to describe the comprehensive paddling ability of the webbed foot with different motion trajectories under variable flow velocities the compound paddling force on the basis of the f v η is defined as follows 15 η 0 1 f v η d v δ v this factor represents the comprehensive paddling performance of the webbed foot with a certain motion trajectory in the flow velocity varies from 0 to 1 m s 2 6 paddling simulations and experiments of the beaver like webbed foot 2 6 1 cfd simulations fluent ansys pit pa usa is used to calculate the hydrodynamic force of the webbed foot with different trajectories sliding mesh method and dynamic mesh technology are applied to simulate the movement of the webbed foot the mesh distribution of the simulation model is described in fig 13 the turbulence model adopts k ε realizable model the inlet is set as velocity inlet and the outlet is set as the pressure outlet the sliding grid defines the movement of the ankle joint of the webbed foot and the define cg motion macro is used in the dynamic mesh to define the bending movement of the toe joint in the simulation the inlet flow fields are variable flow fields and constant flow fields with the velocities 0 m s 0 25 m s 0 5 m s 0 75 m s 1 m s respectively and the variable flow field velocity u v a r is planned according to equation 1 and length 0 7 m thus the velocity of the variable flow field is 16 u v a r t 0 98 sin 4 48 t 1 5 2 6 2 experiments when the beaver swims in the water two types of movement are used synchronized paddling and alternate paddling the webbed foot provides propulsion for the beaver to move forward so it plays a crucial role in the beaver s movement this study tests the webbed foot movement in the synchronous and alternate paddling based on the double hind limb robot fig 14 shows the experimental pool webbed feet and the platform of the overall robot the experimental pool is a transparent cistern with the length width and height 2m 1m 1 2m in the experiment a high definition camera is used to capture the synchronous and alternate paddling of the webbed feet and the movements are analyzed to verify the ability of the bendable webbed foot 3 results and discussions 3 1 theoretical calculation and simulation results of paddling hydrodynamics of the beaver like webbed foot fig 15 shows the theoretical calculation and simulation results of the paddling hydrodynamics of the webbed foot under three trajectories case 1 case 3 and case 6 in the external flow field environment with inlet flow velocities 0 0 5 1 m s the existing hydrodynamic theory and hydrodynamic calculation method proposed in this paper are used to calculate the paddling hydrodynamic force of the webbed foot besides the motion is simulated and analyzed by comparing the theoretical and simulated results of the x component of the paddling hydrodynamic force of the webbed foot it can be found that 1 compared with the traditional hydrodynamic calculation method the theoretical values obtained by the hydrodynamic calculation method proposed in this paper is closer to the simulation results of the beaver like webbed foot that moves with different paddling trajectories and under diverse flow velocities 2 with the increase of the flow velocity the resistance on the beaver like webbed foot in the recovery phase of the paddling is greater 3 different flow velocities have little effect on the propulsive force received by the beaver like webbed foot during the propulsion stage 4 in the paddling of the beaver like webbed foot the resistance of the non bending webbed foot is significantly greater than that of the bendable webbed foot in the recovery phase at the maximum flow velocity the maximum resistance of the non bending webbed foot is about 130 n and the maximum resistance of the bendable webbed foot is less than 110 n 5 in the recovery phase of the paddling of the bendable webbed foot the simulation value of the resistance on the webbed foot with the paddling trajectory case 6 is less than that with case 3 when the flow velocity is 1 m s the maximum resistance of the webbed foot with case 6 is less than 70 n in the simulation while the maximum resistance with case 3 is about 110 n 3 2 cfd numerical simulation results 3 2 1 hydrodynamic analysis of non bending webbed foot at different constant flow velocities in an environment where the water flow velocities are 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 m s the non bending webbed foot swims with case 1 and case 2 trajectories through cfd numerical simulation the movement of the non bending webbed foot is simulated and analyzed fig 16 shows the horizontal and vertical forces of the webbed foot paddling with case 1 and case 2 trajectories at different flow velocities fig 16 a and b respectively represent the horizontal and vertical forces on the non bending webbed foot paddling with the case 1 trajectory among them each curve in fig 16 a is the force of the webbed foot at different flow velocities each curve reaches its maximum value at about 0 2 s 0 8 s and 1 4 s and reaches its minimum value at about 0 6 s 1 2 s and 1 85 s the force of the webbed foot in the positive direction of x is expressed as propulsion and the force in the negative direction is expressed as resistance as the flow velocity increasing the propulsion force on the webbed foot does not change much but the resistance gradually increases in fig 16 b the force of the webbed foot in the positive direction of y is expressed as an upward force and the force in the negative direction is expressed as a downward force with the increase of the flow velocity the upward force on the webbed foot gradually increases but the downward force changes little fig 16 c and d describe the horizontal and vertical forces when the webbed foot paddles in the case 2 trajectory the curve trend is similar to fig 16 a and b there is little difference in the propulsive force of the webbed foot with the trajectories case 1 and case 2 but the resistance in case 2 is obviously greater than that in the trajectory case 1 for example in the environment with the flow velocity 1 m s the maximum resistance of the webbed foot under the trajectory case 2 reaches 150 n and that under the case 1 is about 130 n the downward forces of the webbed foot under the trajectory of case 2 and case 1 have few differences but the upward force under the trajectory case 2 is much greater than that of case 1 for example in the environment of 1 m s flow velocity the maximum upward force of case 2 is 90 n while the maximum upward force of case 1 is only about 50 n thus it can be found that the resistance and upward forces of the webbed foot are greater in the synchronous paddling mode with the trajectory case 2 but two webbed feet are used to paddle simultaneously in the synchronous paddling therefore it can obtain greater propulsion than the alternate paddling which further explains why beavers usually use alternate paddling during roaming but usually use synchronous paddling in emergency situations as shown in fig 16 a and c it is worth noting that in the environment where exists an inlet flow the propulsive force generated by the paddling of the webbed foot in the first cycle is generally smaller than that in the subsequent cycles and the magnitude of the propulsive force is negatively correlated with the flow velocity the main reason is that during the initialization of the simulation process the entire flow field has a flow velocity then the back side of the webbed foot is flowing water that causes the propulsion generated by the webbed foot in the first period decreasing with the increase of the flow velocity and this velocity is reduced by the webbed foot blocking during the recovery phase of the webbed foot paddling and resulting in forming a static flow zone as shown in fig 10 b therefore the propulsion force generated by the webbed foot becomes larger in the subsequent paddling cycle and it has no correlation with the flow velocity as shown in fig 16 b and d the same phenomenon also occurs in the first cycle of the upward force generated by the webbed foot paddling the velocity contours of the flow field are shown in fig 26 see appendix 2 when the non bending webbed foot paddle along the trajectories case 1 and case 2 under the environment of flow velocity 0 25 m s and 0 75 m s 3 2 2 hydrodynamic analysis of bendable webbed foot under different constant flow velocities in the environment where the inlet flow velocities are 0 0 5 and 1 m s respectively the bendable webbed foot swims in case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 the cfd numerical simulation method is used to simulate and analyze the movement of the bendable webbed foot and the simulation results are compared with the force of the non bending webbed foot moving in case 1 the results are shown in fig 17 and through the comparison and analysis we can find 1 the maximum propulsive forces generated by the bendable webbed foot moving with the four trajectories case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 are basically the same as that produced by the non bending webbed foot moving with the case 1 trajectory which have few differences 2 the change of the flow velocity has little effect on the propulsion generated by the paddling of bendable and non bending webbed foot 3 the maximum resistance of bendable webbed foot paddling with case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 is less than that of the non bending webbed foot swimming with case 1 trajectory 4 with the increase of the bending amplitude of the bendable webbed foot in case 3 case 4 and case 5 the maximum resistance decreases but the maximum downward force appears to enhance 5 when the bendable webbed foot swims with the case 6 trajectory it can be seen from the data after the first cycle that it can effectively reduce the resistance in the recovery stage by adding a short stay in the later stage of the propulsion stage and the maximum force has basically no change compared with that generated in other motion trajectories 6 in addition the maximum value of the downward force generated by the case 6 motion trajectory is smaller compared with the downward forces generated by the three trajectories case 3 case 4 and case 5 thereby it reduces the vertical disturbances in the movement the velocity contours of the flow field are shown in fig 27 when the bendable webbed foot paddles in case 3 case 4 and case 5 motion trajectories in the water environment with the flow velocity 0 5 m s and the velocity contours of the flow field are shown in fig 28 when the bendable webbed foot moves along the trajectory case 6 and resists flow velocities 0 m s 0 5 m s and 1 m s 3 2 3 hydrodynamic analysis of webbed foot in variable flow velocity environment in the variable flow velocity environment the webbed foot moves along case 1 case 2 case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 trajectories the flow velocity is expressed as shown in equation 16 cfd numerical simulation is used to simulate the movement of the webbed foot and the hydrodynamic force is shown in fig 18 from the simulation results we can see 1 under the variable flow velocity the non bending webbed foot moves along the case 2 trajectory of synchronous paddling and the case 1 trajectory of alternate paddling and the bendable webbed foot uses case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 trajectories of the alternate paddling the maximum horizontal propulsion forces generated by above trajectories are nearly same although the maximum propulsion generated by case 1 case 2 case 3 case 4 and case 5 is little greater than that in case 6 at about time 1 4s and time 1 6 s the maximum propulsion generated by case 6 is more stable in the second and third motion period 2 the maximum resistance of the non bending webbed foot is the largest when the case 2 trajectory of synchronous paddling is used the next maximum resistance is that generated by the motion along case 1 the maximum resistance generated by the bendable webbed foot moving with trajectories case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 are smaller than that of the non bending webbed foot and those maximum resistance decreases one by one 3 under the variable flow velocity the non bending webbed foot which moves with the case 2 trajectory of synchronous paddling produces the largest hydrodynamic variation range in the vertical direction when the non bending webbed foot moves along the case 1 trajectory of alternate paddling and the bendable webbed foot use the case 3 case 4 and case 5 trajectories of the alternate paddling the variation range of the hydrodynamic force in the vertical direction is not much different and is significantly smaller than that of the non bending webbed foot in case 2 moreover the bendable webbed foot that uses case 6 of the alternate paddling produces the smallest vertical hydrodynamic force through the comparison it can be seen that the bendable webbed foot can effectively reduce the hydrodynamic force in the vertical direction during the paddling thereby decrease the vertical disturbance on the beaver like robot during the swimming the improved trajectory case 6 can significantly reduce the vertical component of the hydrodynamic force and decrease the vertical interference on the beaver like robot in the swimming the velocity contour of the flow field is shown in fig 29 a when the non bending webbed foot moves along the case 1 trajectory in the water environment with the variable flow velocity and the velocity contour of the flow field is shown in fig 29 b c when the bendable webbed foot paddles with case 3 and case 6 trajectories in variable flow velocity environment 3 3 paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor according to equation 14 the paddling force factor is calculated when the webbed foot moves along case 1 case 2 case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 in the environment with different constant flow velocities and variable flow velocity the results are shown in table 2 the first order curve relationship between paddling force factor and flow velocity is obtained by the fitting method as shown in fig 19 the maximum flow velocity is the corresponding flow velocity when the paddling force factor is 50 and further the compound paddling force factor is calculated by comparing the results in table 2 we can see 1 in the same constant flow velocity or variable flow velocity environment the paddling force factor is the smallest when the webbed foot moves along the trajectory case 2 and the next one is case 1 and the paddling force factor increases one by one when case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 are used 2 when the same motion trajectory is applied the paddling force factor gradually decreases with the increase of the constant flow velocity 3 the composite paddling force factor of case 6 is the largest reaching 61 25 and the maximum flow velocity is 0 78 m s the follows are the case 3 4 5 whose composite paddling force factors are 46 15 48 24 49 97 and the maximum flow velocity are 0 32 m s 0 34 m s 0 51 m s in contrast the composite paddling force factors of case 1 2 are relatively small which are only 39 6 and 35 93 and their maximum flow velocities are 0 2 m s and 0 15 m s the main reasons for the above results are 1 in the case 1 and case 2 trajectories the webbed foot moving with no bending withstands great fluid resistance in the recovery phase which reduces the paddling force factor and maximum flow velocity 2 in case 3 case 4 and case 5 the webbed foot bends with 3 degrees of freedom the bendable webbed foot can reduce the interacting area with water in the paddling thereby effectively decreasing the fluid resistance and increasing the paddling force factor 3 case 6 is a motion trajectory obtained by adding a pause process at the end of the propulsion phase on the basis of case 5 the purpose is to avoid the flow caused by the webbed foot moving backward this flow will increase the resistance for a period of time after the start of the recovery phase the improved webbed foot trajectory increases the paddling force factor to 58 39 in the variable flow environment 3 4 experiment results fig 20 and fig 21 respectively show the movement process of the webbed foot in the alternate and synchronous paddling modes in the alternate paddling two hind limbs propel the body through the alternate paddling in one movement cycle the two webbed feet alternately provide propulsion which can continuously propel the body and the movement process is relatively stable in the recovery phase the webbed feet bend to reduce the frontal area thereby to reduce the water flow resistance in the synchronous paddling the two hind limbs move synchronously to realize the forward movement of the body in one motion cycle the two webbed feet provide the propulsion at the same time and withstand the water resistance at the same time the propulsion is discontinuous and the process is unstable but the movement is explosive in the alternate paddling the propulsion is generated alternately by the two webbed feet thus the force on the robot is unbalanced in the horizontal plane and the body shakes left and right in the synchronous paddling the two webbed feet paddle water at the same time so the force on the robot is more uniform in the horizontal plane which avoids its shaking but this increases the force in the vertical direction which causes the robot to pitch in motion through the experiment of alternate and synchronous paddling the function of the bendable webbed foot in the motion of the beaver like robot is further verified and the problem of the body swing caused by the webbed foot paddling is found which provides a direction for the future research 4 conclusion in previous studies the webbed foot was simplified as a board ignoring the structural characteristics of natural animals in this study the effects of the flow velocity webbed foot bending and webbed foot paddling trajectories on the paddling performance of the beaver like webbed foot are analyzed and a theoretical model of webbed foot paddling hydrodynamics is proposed the bendable webbed foot is used to improve the paddling performance the study shows that the webbed foot bending can greatly reduce the resistance in the recovery phase in the theoretical calculation and simulations it not only enriches the model of biological webbed foot in nature but also fits the biology better at the same time it can be extended to study the force of other webbed objects in water on this basis three indicators paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor are defined to quantify the paddling performance of the beaver like webbed foot through theoretical calculations numerical calculations and experiments a comparative study of the paddling performance under different trajectories is carried out existing hydrodynamic formulas do not consider the changes in flow velocity caused by the webbed foot paddling the proposed paddling hydrodynamic model in this paper divides the flow field around the webbed foot into three parts the flow zone static flow zone and backflow zone through the simulation comparison it verifies that this model can effectively improve the accuracy of the hydrodynamic calculation of the webbed foot in the flow field it is found that the webbed foot can reduce the water facing area by bending thereby discovered that the fluid resistance is beneficial to improve the paddling performance and that reasonably avoiding and using the water flow arising from the webbed foot paddling can greatly improve the motion efficiency of the webbed foot these can be used as the planning criteria for the webbed foot movement of underwater robots in the swimming of underwater robot the leg structure is often used as the driving mechanism in amphibious robots the hydrodynamic model of multi joint webbed foot can more accurately calculate the hydrodynamics force of the bendable webbed foot and it can provide a theoretical basis for the hydrodynamic calculation of the bendable webbed foot robot further the three defined indicators paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor can be used as evaluation criteria for the paddling performance of underwater webbed foot robots in this study the paddling hydrodynamic modeling of the beaver like webbed foot and paddling characteristics under different flow velocities can effectively promote the development of the hydrodynamic theory of underwater webbed foot robots credit authorship contribution statement gang chen conceptualization methodology writing original draft

20540,bionic robots usually move forward in water with the swinging or paddling propulsion amphibious robots generally use webbed feet to paddle forward thus the webbed foot is a key part to propel the body and numerously has multiple joints the flippers interact with water to generate propulsive forces in propulsion phase while the resistance is generated during the recovery phase therefore the research on hydrodynamics of the webbed foot contributes to reveal the mechanism of the interaction between the paddling webbed foot and water and improve the paddling ability at present the feet of amphibious robots mostly adopt non bending structure which have great resistance in the retracting stage at the same time the existing hydrodynamic model does not take into account the changes in the flow velocity caused by the paddling which results in the low performance of the bionic flippers and the inaccurate calculation of the hydrodynamic theory in addition at present there is no specific standard to measure the paddling ability of flippers so the paddling performance cannot be accurately evaluated in this paper the beaver is used as a bionic object and a platform of the beaver like bendable webbed foot was constructed through the analysis of the structure and motion trajectories of beaver s flexible webbed foot a hydrodynamic model of the beaver like bendable webbed foot was established then three parameters namely the paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor were proposed as indicators to quantify the paddling performance of beaver like webbed foot through the theoretical calculation and computational fluid dynamics simulation the results verify that the proposed hydrodynamic calculation model is more accurate compared with the existing methods in different paddling trajectories of the beaver like webbed foot under various flow velocities through hydrodynamic simulations of non bending and bendable webbed foot under different flow velocities it is found that the bendable webbed foot can effectively reduce the resistance of webbed foot in the recovery stage different trajectories and bending degrees of the webbed foot have different effects on the resistance of paddling the webbed foot s paddling performance is quantitatively analyzed and clearly evaluated by calculating the paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor under six trajectories of beaver like webbed foot it provides theoretical support for the trajectory planning of the webbed foot on this basis an improved motion trajectory is proposed by adding a pause process after the paddling propulsion stage of the beaver like webbed foot which can reduce the resistance generated by the water flow and improve the paddling performance the hydrodynamic modeling of the beaver like webbed foot and the study of the paddling characteristics under different flow velocities can provide a new method for the hydrodynamic research of underwater webbed bionic robots and offer a quantifiable standard for the analysis of the paddling performance of the webbed foot further promote the development of underwater bionic robot in hydrodynamic theory and motion performance study keywords beaver bendable webbed foot hydrodynamics paddling performance of beaver like webbed foot underwater robots 1 introduction in recent years the research of underwater robots has been rapidly developed and the hydrodynamic modeling of underwater robots is of great significance to the study of underwater robots motion and propulsion performance hu et al 2011 cui et al 2017 the current methods usually include theoretical calculations approximate estimations and numerical calculations huang and liu 2020 wang et al 2017 the theoretical calculation method contains the hess smith method which derives the spatial double discrete integral equation based on the potential flow theory and it can calculate the additional mass force when robots move in different watersheds approximate estimation method is a semi empirical formula derived from the results of a large number of simulation experiments and modified on the basis of the theoretical formula of the regular geometry numerical calculation method uses fluid simulation software to calculate and simulate the motion of underwater robots the advantage is that it can provide more detailed information of fluid fields including those are difficult to obtain in experiments such as lift drag and wake fields at present the research on hydrodynamics is commonly seen in the multi legged underwater robot jun et al 2011 chen et al 2018 webbed foot of birds and the process that fishes swing their bodies and tail fins li et al 2020 xiao et al 2014 the vortices are separated in the later stages of the movement which help organisms move forward in the water it is a way of propulsion based on lift force however amphibians often use resistance based propulsion methods for example turtles and crabs move forward by flapping roper et al 2011 squid and jellyfish move forward by jetting water richards and clemente 2013 the swimming process of bottlenose dolphins was analyzed and a hydromechanical model was used to calculate thrust power output coefficient of drag and propulsive efficiency the study indicated that bottlenose dolphins are well adapted for efficient high performance swimming but show no unusual hydrodynamic performance fish 1993 the frog uses flippers to swim and its instantaneous forces during propulsion in swimming was analyzed using an impulse momentum approach based on dpiv flow data nauwelaerts et al 2005 based on the cfd simulation results the aquatic frog can generate a propulsive efficiency 43 11 which is the ratio of thrust power work to the total mechanical work produced jizhuang et al 2017 the swimming of muskrats was studied and presented that thrust is mainly generated by alternating strokes of the hindfeet and the lengthening of the hindfeet increases the surface area of the foot to produce thrust more effectively fish 1984 the contribution of muskrat s tail to its propulsion efficiency in swimming was studied by filming the swimming process of the muskrat it indicated that the tail could generate a small amount of thrust while keeping the muskrat moving smoothly in the swimming process fish 1982 propulsion modes of mammalian swimming were analyzed paddling of the muskrat is a drag based swimming mode and the drag force is generated by the posterior sweep of the hind feet fish 1996 energy requirements of beavers were investigated when they are at different activities resting on land resting in water and swimming underwater the study presented that the beaver has good diving performance allers and culik 1997a with the webbed foot paddling it has good posture adjustment and ability to adapt to the complex water environment chen et al 2016 its swimming mainly depends on the bendable toes and different trajectories of the webbed foot however there is no research on the performance of webbed foot this article proposes a hypothesis that bendable webbed foot and reasonable paddling trajectories can greatly improve the webbed foot s paddling propulsion performance in a cycle in order to verify this hypothesis this study uses webbed foot as the research object to study the hydrodynamics and paddling performance of beaver like webbed foot as shown in fig 1 the beaver is an amphibious animal allers and culik 1997b it is good at swimming and can move underwater at high speed with multiple cycles and it also has the ability to walk on land beaver moves mainly with its legs feet and toes and the hind feet have webs as shown in fig 2 the webbed foot can reduce or increase the water facing area to change the water resistance by bending or stretching the toe joints during underwater motion thereby increasing the propulsion ability this paper establishes a hydrodynamic model based on the beaver s foot skeleton the angles and angular velocities of the foot joints in the beaver paddling are obtained through the video analysis van rodijnen 2017 wonderly 2019 four parts of webbed foot are divided according to the different attack angles and angular velocity during the paddling and the hydrodynamic model of each part is calculated through the hydrodynamic formula proposed in this paper then a more accurate hydrodynamic model is obtained with the accumulation of the four parts furthermore the underwater movement of webbed foot is simulated and analyzed based on the computational fluid dynamics li et al 2017 cfd finally the movement of the webbed foot prototype is captured by a high definition camera in the experiment and the variation of joint angles in multiple cycles is recorded and analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 paddling trajectories of the beaver beavers are mainly distributed in europe in china beavers are scarce and wildlife under first class state protection they are only distributed in the qinghe buergen river and ulungur river in the northeast of xinjiang province it is difficult to get an actual beaver and record its motion for studying its swimming trajectories therefore we analyzed its motion and extracted its swimming trajectories from the existing video two swimming modes are observed from videos of the beaver motion synchronous and alternate paddling of two feet and joint trajectories are obtained chen et al 2020 chen and jin 2019 as shown in fig 3 in the synchronous paddling mode the initial angle of the ankle joint in the swimming direction is 76 after 0 2 s of paddling it reaches the maximum position of the propulsion stage and its maximum limit angle is about 151 from the beginning of the paddling to the limit angle the maximum ankle speed reaches 490 deg s at this time the angle between the entire hind limb and the forward direction is 102 and the toe joint is kept at a small angle as shown in fig 4 there is a half period phase difference between the webbed feet in the alternate paddling mode one moves backward but the other moves forward the paddling motion includes a propulsion phase and a recovery phase during the propulsion process the angle of the ankle joint increases from 53 to 148 the toe joint angle remains at a relatively small angle and the webbed foot is in a stretched state after into the recovery phase the angle of the ankle joint gradually decreases and the angle of the toe joint increases rapidly as shown in fig 5 a video of the movement process of the beaver under a fixed lens clearly captures the movement of the beaver in the horizontal direction when it paddles underwater the ratio of the forward distance to the beaver s body length is used to obtain the forward distance and swimming speed relative to the body length observing the motion curve it is found that the forward distance of the beaver in a cycle is about half of the body length and the forward speed shows a decreasing trend the velocity is obtained by fitting the forward speed as follows 1 v t 1 4 sin 4 48 t 1 5 l e n g t h where length is the length of the beaver 2 2 definition of the motion trajectory of the beaver s webbed foot the paddling motion of the webbed foot has two processes the propulsion phase and the recovery phase as shown in fig 6 during the propulsion phase the force received by the webbed foot paddling is the propulsive force the webbed foot moves from the initial position 1 to the maximum position 7 the angular velocity of the webbed foot gradually increases and the toe joints stretch to the maximum state very quickly when the webbed foot is almost perpendicular to the swimming direction the velocity reaches the maximum value and then the velocity of the webbed foot gradually decreases when the webbed foot rotates to the maximum angle it starts the next stage in the recovery phase the force received from the webbed foot paddling is the fluid resistance compared with the first phase the webbed foot takes longer time to return to the initial state the toe joints are tightened to a minimum state in a very short period of time this approach minimizes the flow resistance of the webbed foot during the recovery process when the webbed foot returns to the initial state this stage ends and a new cycle of paddling is prepared according to the observation and trajectory extraction of the beaver motion the beaver paddling trajectories are obtained and on this basis the trajectories are improved to create various motion trajectories of the beaver like webbed foot which are defined as the single joint motion under the alternate paddling case 1 single joint motion under the synchronous paddling case 2 and bending compound motions under the alternate paddling case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 where case 6 is the improved motion on the basis of case 5 among them case 1 is the single joint motion trajectory obtained by fitting the discrete angles of the webbed foot in the paddling as shown in fig 4 case 2 is the single joint motion trajectory obtained by fitting the discrete angles in fig 3 case 3 4 and 5 are multi joint motion trajectories in which the bending angle of the toe joint sequentially increases on the basis of case 1 motion case 6 is an improved motion trajectory which is a multi joint motion trajectory obtained by adding a pause process at the end of the propulsion stage in case 5 the above trajectories of the ankle and toe joints are shown in fig 7 2 3 platform of the beaver like webbed foot the beaver s webbed foot structure is simplified as shown in fig 8 the toe joint is set to three degrees of freedom and the link mechanism is used to replace the beaver s complex foot structure and the toes are connected by thin films the size of the webbed foot platform is based on the measurement of the beaver s skeleton and its length width and other parameters are shown in table 1 2 4 paddling model of the beaver like bendable webbed foot with multiple joints in the paddling of the webbed foot the main hydrodynamic forces are lift resistance fig 9 defines the kinematic coordinate system and the lift resistance in the paddling movement of the webbed foot the webbed foot resistance is the force opposite to the direction of the beaver s movement along the x direction which is the propulsive force of the beaver s movement during the propulsion phase the lift is the force perpendicular to the movement direction and it implements the rise and dive of the beaver also affects the balance of the beaver s movement in water the force in the x direction is used as a parameter to measure the webbed foot s paddling performance 2 4 1 paddling force analysis of the beaver like webbed foot fig 10 shows the changes of the surrounding flow field and the force on the webbed foot during the webbed foot paddling the flow field is divided into incident flow area and static flow area the incident flow area is the zone where the water flow changes naturally and the flow velocity varies due to the forward movement of the beaver s paddling the static flow area is due to the blocking on the front flow of the webbed foot which makes the water velocity reduce to much less during the propulsion stage of the webbed foot paddling fig 10 b the front current impacts the webbed foot and creates fluid resistance blue arrows the webbed foot moves backward to compress the back water and form a low pressure area on the front side thereby generates the propulsion on the webbed foot red arrow one part of the water flow on the back side flows backwards and the other part flows from the bottom and sides of the webbed foot back to the front side these form a backflow zone the back flow is caused by the rotation of the webbed foot hereinafter referred to as induced flow fig 10 c and the induced flow will increase the fluid resistance of the webbed foot during the initial period of the recovery phase in the recovery phase fig 10 d the webbed foot moves forward and the front watershed is compressed by the webbed foot then the water flows through the two sides and downside of the webbed foot and goes back and forms a backflow zone on the back the webbed foot is mainly subject to the fluid resistance in this stage 2 4 2 fluid drag and propulsive force in the paddling of beaver like webbed foot as shown in fig 11 the fluid resistance is equal to the water force acting on the object in the same direction of the incoming flow under steady state according to the principle of fluid similarity it is mainly related to the drag coefficient frontal area and flow velocity the force generated by the incident flow is defined as the fluid resistance when the webbed foot paddles underwater when the webbed foot moves the force produced by compressing the rear side of the watershed is called as the paddling propulsion in the calculation the angles and postures of the object should be considered in this paper a theoretical model of the webbed foot paddling is proposed which calculates the fluid resistance and propulsion generated by the webbed foot paddling respectively it considers the force changes caused by the different motion postures of the multi joint webbed foot the force on the webbed foot is defined as healey et al 1995 fossen 1999 2 f

propulsive force is defined as follows 6 f m o v e c d ρ a u m u m here the segmented integral is used to calculate the multi joint webbed foot paddling model fig 12 it can be more accurate to consider the changes in the hydrodynamic force caused by variations of the movement velocity in the simultaneous rotation of multiple joints taking a small horizontal strip in the webbed foot and its

antonelli and pascal 2003 which are determined according to the reynolds number r n of the translational and rotational planes r n can be expressed in laminar and turbulent layers as 10 r n ρ u d μ where d is the characteristic length in the direction of the flow velocity here is depicted as the width of the webbed foot and its maximum value is 0 186 m μ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid the calculations and experiments all use water as the medium the dynamic viscosity is taken as 1 01 10 3 p a s the density is taken as 1 10 3 k g m 3 the speed is less than 1 m s according to equation 10 if the reynolds number is less than 2 10 5 then the drag coefficient is 1 and the lift coefficient is 0 8 according to the difference in velocity and angle of attack the webbed foot is divided into four areas to calculate the hydrodynamic force see appendix 1 and each area is in the form of integrals the total lift drag and propulsion are as follows 11 f d r a g f d r a g 0 2 i 1 3 f d r a g w i 12 f l i f t f l i f t 0 2 i 1 3 f l i f t w i 13 f m o v e f m o v e 0 2 i 1 3 f m o v e w i the above method can be used to solve the hydrodynamic force of the webbed foot when it moves in water the calculation amount is small simple and convenient which can effectively solve the hydrodynamic calculation problem of the bendable webbed foot 2 5 paddling indicators of the beaver like webbed foot in order to measure the paddling performance of different webbed foot trajectories the paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor are proposed to describe the webbed foot s paddling performance under different flow velocities 2 5 1 paddling force factor in order to accurately quantify the paddling performance of the webbed foot under different inlet flow velocities the paddling force factor is defined as follows 14 η f t δ t f t δ t 100 where f t is the force on the webbed foot during the time t 0 to t 1 9s δ t is the time interval which is 0 005 s the above formula is used to quantify and compare the paddling performance of different motion trajectories of the webbed foot under different flow velocities 2 5 2 maximum flow velocity the maximum flow velocity is the maximum speed of the flow that the paddling webbed foot can resist the webbed foot cannot provide effective and stable periodic propulsion to propel the body forward when the flow velocity exceeds it the specific definition is that constructing two dimensional discrete point diagram with the flow velocity and the paddling force factor and use the fitting method to obtain the continuous curve function f v η and the maximum flow velocity is v i n calculated from f v i n η 0 5 2 5 3 compound paddling force factor the compound paddling force factor is a comprehensive index of the paddling force factor which is used to describe the comprehensive paddling ability of the webbed foot with different motion trajectories under variable flow velocities the compound paddling force on the basis of the f v η is defined as follows 15 η 0 1 f v η d v δ v this factor represents the comprehensive paddling performance of the webbed foot with a certain motion trajectory in the flow velocity varies from 0 to 1 m s 2 6 paddling simulations and experiments of the beaver like webbed foot 2 6 1 cfd simulations fluent ansys pit pa usa is used to calculate the hydrodynamic force of the webbed foot with different trajectories sliding mesh method and dynamic mesh technology are applied to simulate the movement of the webbed foot the mesh distribution of the simulation model is described in fig 13 the turbulence model adopts k ε realizable model the inlet is set as velocity inlet and the outlet is set as the pressure outlet the sliding grid defines the movement of the ankle joint of the webbed foot and the define cg motion macro is used in the dynamic mesh to define the bending movement of the toe joint in the simulation the inlet flow fields are variable flow fields and constant flow fields with the velocities 0 m s 0 25 m s 0 5 m s 0 75 m s 1 m s respectively and the variable flow field velocity u v a r is planned according to equation 1 and length 0 7 m thus the velocity of the variable flow field is 16 u v a r t 0 98 sin 4 48 t 1 5 2 6 2 experiments when the beaver swims in the water two types of movement are used synchronized paddling and alternate paddling the webbed foot provides propulsion for the beaver to move forward so it plays a crucial role in the beaver s movement this study tests the webbed foot movement in the synchronous and alternate

and height 2m 1m 1 2m in the experiment a high definition camera is used to capture the synchronous and alternate paddling of the webbed feet and the movements are analyzed to verify the ability of the bendable webbed foot 3 results and discussions 3 1 theoretical calculation and simulation results of paddling hydrodynamics of the beaver like webbed foot fig 15 shows the theoretical calculation and simulation results of the paddling hydrodynamics of the webbed foot under three trajectories case 1 case 3 and case 6 in the external flow field environment with inlet flow velocities 0 0 5 1 m s the existing hydrodynamic theory and hydrodynamic calculation method proposed in this paper are used to calculate the paddling hydrodynamic force of the webbed foot besides the motion is simulated and analyzed by comparing the theoretical and simulated results of the x component of the paddling hydrodynamic force of the webbed foot it can be found that 1 compared with the traditional hydrodynamic calculation method the theoretical values obtained by the hydrodynamic calculation method proposed in this paper is closer to the simulation results of the beaver like webbed foot that moves with different paddling trajectories and under diverse flow velocities 2 with the increase of the flow velocity the resistance on the beaver like webbed foot in the recovery phase of the paddling is greater 3 different flow velocities have little effect on the propulsive force received by the beaver like webbed foot during the propulsion stage 4 in the paddling of the beaver like webbed foot the resistance of the non bending webbed foot is significantly greater than that of the bendable webbed foot in the recovery phase at the maximum flow velocity the maximum resistance of the non bending webbed foot is about 130 n and the maximum resistance of the bendable webbed foot is less than 110 n 5 in the recovery phase of the paddling of the bendable webbed foot the simulation value of the resistance on the webbed foot with the paddling trajectory case 6 is less than that with case 3 when the flow velocity is 1 m s the maximum resistance of the webbed foot with case 6 is less than 70 n in the simulation while the maximum resistance with case 3 is about 110 n 3 2 cfd numerical simulation results 3 2 1 hydrodynamic analysis of non bending webbed foot at different constant flow velocities in an environment where the water flow velocities are 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 m s the non bending webbed foot swims with case 1 and case 2 trajectories through cfd numerical simulation the movement of the non bending webbed foot is simulated and analyzed fig 16 shows the horizontal and vertical forces of the webbed foot paddling with case 1 and case 2 trajectories at different flow

the webbed foot at different flow velocities each curve reaches its maximum value at about 0 2 s 0 8 s and 1 4 s and reaches its minimum value at about 0 6 s 1 2 s and 1 85 s the force of the webbed foot in the positive direction of x is expressed as propulsion and the force in the negative direction is expressed as resistance as the flow velocity increasing the propulsion force on the webbed foot does not change much but the resistance gradually increases in fig 16 b the force of the webbed foot in the positive direction of y is expressed as an upward force and the force in the negative direction is expressed as a downward force with the increase of the flow velocity the upward force on the webbed foot gradually increases but the downward force changes little fig 16 c and d describe the horizontal and vertical forces when the webbed foot paddles in the case 2 trajectory the curve trend is similar to fig 16 a and b there is little difference in the propulsive force of the webbed foot with the trajectories case 1 and case 2 but the resistance in case 2 is obviously greater than that in the trajectory case 1 for example in the environment with the flow velocity 1 m s the maximum resistance of the webbed foot under the trajectory case 2 reaches 150 n and that under the case 1 is about 130 n the downward forces of the webbed foot under the trajectory of case 2 and case 1 have few differences but the upward force under the trajectory case 2 is much greater than that of case 1 for example in the environment of 1 m s flow velocity the maximum upward force of case 2 is 90 n while the maximum upward force of case 1 is only about 50 n thus it can be found that the resistance and upward forces of the webbed foot are greater in the synchronous paddling mode with the trajectory case 2 but two webbed feet are used to paddle simultaneously in the synchronous paddling therefore it can obtain greater propulsion than the alternate paddling which further explains why beavers usually use alternate paddling during roaming but usually use synchronous paddling in emergency situations as shown in fig 16 a and c it is worth noting that in the environment where exists an inlet flow the propulsive force generated by the paddling of the webbed foot in the first cycle is generally smaller than that in the subsequent cycles and the magnitude of the propulsive force is negatively correlated with the flow velocity the main reason is that during the initialization of the simulation process the entire flow field has a flow velocity then the back side of the webbed foot is flowing water that causes the propulsion generated by the webbed foot in the first period decreasing with the increase of the flow velocity and this velocity is reduced by the webbed foot blocking during the recovery phase of the webbed foot paddling and resulting in forming a static flow zone as shown in fig 10 b therefore the propulsion force generated by the webbed foot becomes larger in the subsequent paddling cycle and it has no correlation with the flow velocity as shown in fig 16 b and d the same phenomenon also occurs in the first cycle of the upward force generated by the webbed foot paddling the velocity contours of the flow field are shown in fig 26 see appendix 2 when the non bending webbed foot paddle along the trajectories case 1 and case 2 under the environment of flow velocity 0 25 m s and 0 75 m s 3 2 2 hydrodynamic analysis of bendable webbed foot under different constant flow velocities in the environment where the inlet flow velocities are 0 0 5 and 1 m s respectively the bendable webbed foot swims in case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 the cfd numerical simulation method is used to simulate and analyze the movement of the bendable webbed foot and the simulation results are compared with the force of the non bending webbed foot moving in case 1 the results are shown in fig 17 and through the comparison and analysis we can find 1 the maximum propulsive forces generated by the bendable webbed foot moving with the four trajectories case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 are basically the same as that produced by the non bending webbed foot moving with the case 1 trajectory which have few differences 2 the change of the flow velocity has little effect on the propulsion generated by the paddling of bendable and non bending webbed foot 3 the maximum resistance of bendable webbed foot paddling with case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 is less than that of the non bending webbed foot swimming with case 1 trajectory 4 with the increase of the bending amplitude of the bendable webbed foot in case 3 case 4 and case 5 the maximum resistance decreases but the maximum downward force appears to enhance 5 when the bendable webbed foot swims with the case 6 trajectory it can be seen from the data after the first cycle that it can effectively reduce the resistance in the recovery stage by adding a short stay in the later stage of the propulsion stage and the maximum force has basically no change compared with that generated in other motion trajectories 6 in addition the maximum value of the downward force generated by the case 6 motion trajectory is smaller compared with the downward forces generated by the three trajectories case 3 case 4 and case 5 thereby it reduces the vertical disturbances in the movement the velocity contours of the flow field are shown in fig 27 when the bendable webbed foot paddles in case 3 case 4 and case 5 motion trajectories in the water environment with the flow velocity 0 5 m s and the velocity contours of the flow field are shown in fig 28 when the bendable webbed foot moves along the trajectory case 6 and resists flow velocities 0 m s 0 5 m s and 1 m s 3 2 3 hydrodynamic analysis of webbed foot in variable flow velocity environment in the variable flow velocity environment the webbed foot moves along case 1 case 2 case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 trajectories the flow velocity is expressed as shown in equation 16 cfd numerical simulation is used to simulate the movement of the webbed foot and the hydrodynamic force is shown in fig 18 from the simulation results we can see 1 under the variable flow velocity the non bending webbed foot moves along the case 2 trajectory of synchronous paddling and the case 1 trajectory of alternate paddling and the bendable webbed foot uses case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 trajectories of the alternate paddling the maximum horizontal propulsion forces generated by above trajectories are nearly same although the maximum propulsion generated by case 1 case 2 case 3 case 4 and case 5 is little greater than that in case 6 at about time 1 4s and time 1 6 s the maximum propulsion generated by case 6 is more stable in the second and third motion period 2 the maximum resistance of the non bending webbed foot is the largest when the case 2 trajectory of synchronous paddling is used the next maximum resistance is that generated by the motion along case 1 the maximum resistance generated by the bendable webbed foot moving with trajectories case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 are smaller than that of the non bending webbed foot and those maximum resistance decreases one by one 3 under the variable flow velocity the non bending webbed foot which moves with the case 2 trajectory of synchronous paddling produces the largest hydrodynamic variation range in the vertical direction when the non bending webbed foot moves along the case 1 trajectory of alternate paddling and the bendable webbed foot use the case 3 case 4 and case 5 trajectories of the alternate paddling the variation range of the hydrodynamic force in the vertical direction is not much different and is significantly smaller than that of the non bending webbed foot in case 2 moreover the bendable webbed foot that uses case 6 of the alternate paddling produces the smallest vertical hydrodynamic force through the comparison it can be seen that the bendable webbed foot can effectively reduce the hydrodynamic force in the vertical direction during the paddling thereby decrease the vertical disturbance on the beaver like robot during the swimming the improved trajectory case 6 can significantly reduce the vertical component of the hydrodynamic force and decrease the vertical interference on the beaver like robot in the swimming the velocity contour of the flow field is shown in fig 29 a when the non bending webbed foot moves along the case 1 trajectory in the water environment with the variable flow velocity and the velocity contour of the flow field is shown in fig 29 b c when the bendable webbed foot paddles with case 3 and case 6 trajectories in variable flow velocity environment 3 3 paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor according to equation 14 the paddling force factor is calculated when the webbed foot moves along case 1 case 2 case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 in the environment with different constant flow velocities and variable flow velocity the results are shown in table 2 the first order curve relationship between paddling force factor and flow velocity is obtained by the fitting method as shown in fig 19 the maximum flow velocity is the corresponding flow velocity when the paddling force factor is 50 and further the compound paddling force factor is calculated by comparing the results in table 2 we can see 1 in the same constant flow velocity or variable flow velocity environment the paddling force factor is the smallest when the webbed foot moves along the trajectory case 2 and the next one is case 1 and the paddling force factor increases one by one when case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 are used 2 when the same motion trajectory is applied the paddling force factor gradually decreases with the increase of the constant flow velocity 3 the composite paddling force factor of case 6 is the largest reaching 61 25 and the maximum flow velocity is 0 78 m s the follows are the case 3 4 5 whose composite paddling force factors are 46 15 48 24 49 97 and the maximum flow velocity are 0 32 m s 0 34 m s 0 51 m s in contrast the composite paddling force factors of case 1 2 are relatively small which are only 39 6 and 35 93 and their maximum flow velocities are 0 2 m s and 0 15 m s the main reasons for the above results are 1 in the case 1 and case 2 trajectories the webbed foot moving with no bending withstands great fluid resistance in the recovery phase which reduces the paddling force factor and maximum flow velocity 2 in case 3 case 4 and case 5 the webbed foot bends with 3 degrees of freedom the bendable webbed foot can reduce the interacting area with water in the paddling thereby effectively decreasing the fluid resistance and increasing the paddling force factor 3 case 6 is a motion trajectory obtained by adding a pause process at the end of the propulsion phase on the basis of case 5 the purpose is to avoid the flow caused by the webbed foot moving backward this flow will increase the resistance for a period of time after the start of the recovery phase the improved webbed foot trajectory increases the paddling force factor to 58 39 in the variable flow environment 3 4 experiment results fig 20 and fig 21 respectively show the movement process of the webbed foot in the alternate and synchronous paddling modes in the alternate paddling two hind limbs propel the body through the alternate paddling in one movement cycle the two webbed feet alternately provide propulsion which can continuously propel the body and the movement process is relatively stable in the recovery phase the webbed feet bend to reduce the frontal area thereby to reduce the water flow resistance in the synchronous paddling the two hind limbs move synchronously to realize the forward movement of the body in one motion cycle the two webbed feet provide the propulsion at the same time and withstand the water resistance at the same time the propulsion is discontinuous and the process is unstable but the movement is explosive in the alternate paddling the propulsion is generated alternately by the two webbed feet thus the force on the robot is unbalanced in the horizontal plane and the body shakes left and right in the synchronous paddling the two webbed feet paddle water at the same time so the force on the robot is more uniform in the horizontal plane which avoids its shaking but this increases the force in the vertical direction which causes the robot to pitch in motion through the experiment of alternate and synchronous paddling the function of the bendable webbed foot in the motion of the beaver like robot is further verified and the problem of the body swing caused by the webbed foot paddling is found which provides a direction for the future research 4 conclusion in previous studies the webbed foot was simplified as a board ignoring the structural characteristics of natural animals in this study the effects of the flow velocity webbed foot bending and webbed foot paddling trajectories on the paddling performance of the beaver like webbed foot are analyzed and a theoretical model of webbed foot paddling hydrodynamics is proposed the bendable webbed foot is used to improve the paddling performance the study shows that the webbed foot bending can greatly reduce the resistance in the recovery phase in the theoretical calculation and simulations it not only enriches the model of biological webbed foot in nature but also fits the biology better at the same time it can be extended to study the force of other webbed objects in water on this basis three indicators paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor are defined to quantify the paddling performance of the beaver like webbed foot through theoretical calculations numerical calculations and experiments a comparative study of the paddling performance under different trajectories is carried out existing hydrodynamic formulas do not consider the changes in flow velocity caused by the webbed foot paddling the proposed paddling hydrodynamic model in this paper divides the flow field around the webbed foot into three parts the flow zone static flow zone and backflow zone through the simulation comparison it verifies that this model can effectively improve the accuracy of the hydrodynamic calculation of the webbed foot in the flow field it is found that the webbed foot can reduce the water facing area by bending thereby discovered that the fluid resistance is beneficial to improve the paddling performance and that reasonably avoiding and using the water flow arising from the webbed foot paddling can greatly improve the motion efficiency of the webbed foot these can be used as the planning criteria for the webbed foot movement of underwater robots in the swimming of underwater robot the leg structure is often used as the driving mechanism in amphibious robots the hydrodynamic model of multi joint webbed foot can more accurately calculate the hydrodynamics force of the bendable webbed foot and it can provide a theoretical basis for the hydrodynamic calculation of the bendable webbed foot robot further the three defined indicators paddling force factor maximum flow velocity and compound paddling force factor can be used as evaluation criteria for the paddling performance of underwater webbed foot robots in this study the paddling hydrodynamic modeling of the beaver like webbed foot and paddling characteristics under different flow velocities can effectively promote the development of the hydrodynamic theory of underwater webbed foot robots credit authorship contribution statement gang chen conceptualization methodology writing original draft

20541,autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are exposed to several internal or external forces or moments causing roll instabilities the coupled nonlinear dynamics of an auv requires designing and utilizing an appropriate roll control system to operate well in various missions in this paper the roll dynamics and control enhancement of a remus auv is studied using a coupled fins propulsors cfp system by developing a six degrees of freedom 6dof simulator the results show that 1 the roll angle deflections usually have adverse effects on coupled dynamics of the auv in both open loop and closed loop systems 2 in large roll angle deflections the cfp system show a proper selection of 30 crp contra rotating propellers and 70 fdf four decoupled fins 49 sf stern fins and 31 rf rudder fins can better control the roll dynamics by reducing the oscillations 3 for φ d 18 the fdf crp and cfp for 18 φ d 60 the fdf and cfp and for 60 φ d 70 the cfp system could produce the adequate roll control forces and moments 4 a limited desired roll angle can be achieved at a given forward speed the maximum value is φ d 70 for u d 4 m s graphical abstract image 1 keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv roll control enhancement 6dof dynamics coupled fins propulsors cfp control system simulator 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are untethered unmanned self propelled underwater vehicles lei 2020 sahoo et al 2019 a classical auv contains a propeller for its propulsion two coupled horizontal fins elevators for depth control and two coupled vertical fins rudders for heading angle control an et al 2020 prestero 2001 however various shapes thrusters fin arrangements equipment and manipulators have been developed or are currently under development for auvs jain et al 2015 manzanilla et al 2018 sahoo et al 2019 auvs are shaped from standard rigid cylindrical or spherical bodies to advanced fish like or torpedo shaped bodies abbaspoor and ebrahimi 2015 braginsky et al 2020 ebrahimi and abbaspour 2015 2016 kim et al 2018 scaradozzi et al 2017 ebrahimi and abbaspoor 2016 the auv s propulsion system is ranged from the standard single or multiple propeller driven or water jet systems in the coaxial arrangement such as counter rotating propellers crp or different layouts of vectorial fixed thrusters vft or vectorial reconfigurable thrusters vrt to biomimetic or bioinspired undulation mechanisms bum abbaspour and ebrahimi 2015 allotta et al 2015 ebrahimi et al 2020 ebrahimi and abbaspour 2016 fagundes gasparoto et al 2021 pugi et al 2018 sahoo et al 2019 vega et al 2015 various types of auvs are used in the oceanography and ocean engineering applications such as survey marine platforms seafloor mapping or bathymetry seafloor or water column sampling or maintenance or repair of offshore facilities hai et al 2019 li and lee 2005 tran et al 2021 thus a robust agile control system is necessary for an auv in the complex marine environment to prevail over the undesirable disturbances or reach the desired states kinaci et al 2020 lei 2020 xu et al 2020 an auv may be subjected to several induced internal or external forces or moments such as moving internal weights propeller torques collisions and maneuvering ebrahimi et al 2020 hong and chitre 2015 kaya et al 2020 lei 2020 the forces and moments can lead to oscillatory or rotational rolling instabilities due to a small x axis moment of inertia low rolling drag and low restoring forces compared to other degrees of freedom dofs ebrahimi et al 2020 herlambang et al 2017 lei 2020 the roll instabilities can adversely affect the performance of auv disrupt its missions or cause its damage or crash by collisions therefore utilizing a proper roll control system is crucial for auv s operations including low speed maneuvers or high speed forward motions ebrahimi et al 2020 herlambang et al 2017 the roll instabilities of auvs can also be classified into static and dynamic instabilities da silva costa et al 2017 fossen 2011 static instabilities may often originate from the internal or external arrangement of vehicle equipment or asymmetries in hull shape or equipment installations amundsen 2017 sverdrup thygeson et al 2018 dynamic instabilities can be originated from the biased or unbalanced reaction torques in different propulsion systems ebrahimi et al 2020 fagundes gasparoto et al 2021 pugi et al 2018 vega et al 2015 it should be noted that the rotation of a single propeller as the auv s propulsion system causes the generation of a reaction torque which produces a biased roll angle related to the propeller s revolution speed rpm da silva costa et al 2017 ebrahimi et al 2020 fossen 2011 prestero 2001 the static stability or metacentric stability of marine vehicles can be achieved by restoring forces and moments related to the distances between the vehicle s buoyancy gravity and metacentric centers fossen 2011 for a submerged vessel such as auvs the metacentric center matches the buoyancy center restricting possible restoring moments fossen 2011 however the dynamic stability can be achieved by some internal weight variation or external actuator based mechanisms ibarz et al 2003 li 2016 for some low speed maneuverings the internal weight mechanisms iwms hong and chitre 2015 or lateral horizontal actuators lhas zhigang et al 2011 are usually employed as roll control systems however iwms or lhas cannot perform appropriately in high speed maneuvers hong and chitre 2015 petrich and stilwell 2011 ziaeefard et al 2018 implementing advanced propulsion systems such as crp vft or vrt can provide both self balancing of roll instabilities originated from reaction torques and producing desired roll angles the crp systems consist of a pair of opposite rotating coaxial propellers with the advantages of high efficiency under high loads and high maximum thrust power for a given diameter brizzolara et al 2012 ebrahimi et al 2020 the bums often utilize flexible bodies highly complicated mechanisms and advanced coupled nonlinear control systems and are currently under research and development scaradozzi et al 2017 the vft and vrt systems are usually layouts in the array forms of two three four or even more pivoted thrusters designed and customized through operating and mission characteristics fagundes gasparoto et al 2021 pugi et al 2018 although the vft and vrt systems have advantages such as high maneuvering and hovering capabilities and are less complex than bum systems they need more energy costs and excessive equipment and are more complex than the crp systems a few researchers in the literature have focused on the systematic evaluation of auvs roll dynamics and control enhancement ebrahimi et al 2020 hong and chitre 2015 single propelled auvs and mutually coupled fins such as the remus vehicle are usually underactuated and often suffer from roll instabilities li et al 2018 by adding a coaxial propeller crp system roll instabilities can be controlled up to a certain angle ebrahimi et al 2020 by decoupling the mutually coupled fins dfd system and combining it with crp cfp system the system becomes overactuated with a capability of controlling more considerable roll instabilities therefore the systematic evaluation of these systems is helpful in the design of an auv and its control system and choosing proper actuators and the roll control system in this paper enhancing the roll dynamics and control of an auv is studied through a systematic evaluation of fdf crp and cfp roll control systems ranges of the forward speed roll angle and contribution of the proposed roll control systems are evaluated pid controllers are implemented due to their less complexity and the wide range of applications in practice fossen 2011 the fdf system does not impose additional fins or actuators on auv and is created only by decoupling the elevators and rudders the crp system can be obtained through a minimum change in propulsion system while can exploit its self stabilization capability the cfp system can exploit both advantages of fdf and crp systems while a more significant resultant roll moment can also be provided the cfp system is proposed to cover low to high speeds impose negligible impacts on the control of pitch and yaw motions damp the undesirable roll angles and reach the desired roll angle for particular maneuverings in the complex marine environment or among offshore facilities the simulation software is developed composing from the dynamic and control blocks the correlation between the simulations and experiments in the developed simulation software is established through an experimentally verified benchmark remus auv whose coefficients and formulations have been experimentally studied and verified by prestero 2001 and several other researchers allen et al 1997a 2000 1997a kim 2015 phaneuf 2004 the geometry of the auv the definition of the reference frames and formulations are presented first the open loop roll dynamics is evaluated next by developing a dynamics simulator it is followed by developing the control system simulator and evaluations of using the cfp roll control system 2 materials and methods the simulation and controller models are described in this section the simulation or maneuvering model describes a 6dof system to simulate the coupled motions in the time domain while the controller model is a reduced order model for the motion control system fossen 2011 the vehicle dynamics external forces due to interactions with the environment and propulsion terms are included in the simulation model the controller model utilizes multiple proportional integral derivative pid controllers for a multi target control system a vectorial notation is used to derive the simulation and controller models formulations presented in the following sections 2 1 geometry remote environmental monitoring units or remus vehicles are low cost torpedo shaped autonomous underwater vehicles auvs designed by the oceanographic systems lab remus vehicles often use a propeller and four mutually coupled fins for steering and diving allen et al 1997b prestero 2001 the remus can be configured to include a wide variety of standard sensors and system options to meet unique autonomous mission requirements fig 1 and table 1 represent the remus s geometry and geometric parameters 2 2 reference frames defining the two main reference frames inertial earth fixed ief n x n y n z n with origin o n and non inertial body fixed nbf b x b y b z b with origin o b are generally the first step in formulating an auv motion in 6dof fig 2 fossen 2011 the relationships between the ief and nbf describe the position p and orientation θ of the vehicle eq 1 nbf conventionally expresses the linear v and angular ω velocities of the vehicle eq 2 the origin o b is usually placed at the center of buoyancy cof due to the rigid body s constant hull volume during the operations the nbf s coordinate plane axes x b y b and z b are the same as the auv s principal axes of inertia the state variables are chosen as 1 η p θ x y z φ θ ψ t 2 ν v ω u v w p q r t

reference frame s origin in a point other than the center of gravity cog the equations of motions can be rearranged as eq 11 due to the dependency of the external forces to acceleration velocity and position vectors 11 m v c v v d v v g η τ where τ is an independent part of force vector from the acceleration velocity and position vectors m is the total mass matrix m a is the added mass matrix originated from the inertia of the surrounding fluid c ν r is the total coriolis and centripetal matrix c a is the total coriolis and centripetal matrix of the added mass created from the rotation of b with respect to n d is the total damping matrix primarily from viscous terms skin friction and lift drag for auvs d lift is the lift matrix d nl is the nonlinear damping matrix and g η is the restoring matrix due to the hydrostatic forces the first three equations in eq 11 are called the translational motion elements and the last three equations are called the rotational motion elements

in the water are propulsors and fins there are two mutually coupled moving rudder fins two mutually coupled stern fins and a single propeller in a typical remus auv however in this paper the four mutually coupled fins system is assumed to be decoupled and form a four decoupled fins fdf system through the fdf system the undesired roll angle produced by an individual propeller or other external disturbances can be removed by counter rotation of each mutually coaxial fins elevators or rudders or by a combination of both mutually coaxial fins elevators and rudders the counter rotation of mutually coaxial fins can also produce desired roll angles for particular maneuvering missions the control system consists of four subsystems a forward speed controller a depth controller a heading angle controller and a roll angle controller the control laws are obtained based on pid controllers and the desired states prescribing the control targets and the measured or estimated feedback states the control system is thus a multi input multi output mimo structure with five inputs n propeller s revolution speed δ s l left stern fin or elevator angle δ s r right stern fin or elevator angle δ r u up rudder angle and δ r d the down rudder angle and four desired control outputs z depth φ roll angle ψ heading angle and u forward speed the saturation functions are implemented for the actuator inputs and the low pass filters are also added after the saturation functions to improve actuator treatments the angular boundaries of stern and rudder fins are limited between 20 20 degrees 2 6 1 the forward speed controller due to the dominance of drag and added mass in the surge hydrodynamic forces and the dependence of thrust forces to only the propeller parameters the surge equation can be decoupled from the other dofs in the system of equations of motion fossen 2011 the thrust force x p r o p is modeled by a linear function of control input u c 17 x p r o p x d u c where x d is the constant propulsion coefficient a pid controller is defined to control the forward speed of the vehicle by the propeller s revolution speed as 18 u c s e u s k p u k d u s k i u s 19 e u u d u u c k p u e u k d u e u k i u e u d t where e u is the error function obtained from the difference between the desired and the current forward speeds a series of simulations are also carried out to determine the suitable choice of pid controllers coefficients k p k d and k i 2 6 2 the depth controller the stern fins are usually used for depth control in auvs by varying the pitch angle to force the vehicle to rise or dive into the desired depth the input control variables are the deflection angles of the stern fins δ s l and δ s r rotating in the same direction in the nbf coordinate system in other words the resultant depth controller command is obtained from the sum of the stern fins angles in the designation of depth controller a four state model w t q t θ t and z t is used with the simplifying assumption of equilibrium condition with the constant forward speed of the vehicle the designed depth controller is a cascading controller consisting of a pid inner loop for controlling the pitch angle θ and a pid outer loop for controlling the depth z the inner loop pitch loop 20 e θ θ d θ 21 δ s s e θ s k p θ k d θ s k i θ s 22 δ s k p θ e θ k d θ e θ k i θ e θ d t the outer loop

state model consisting of the yaw angle rate r and yaw angle ψ the control variable is the deflection of rudder angles δ r u and δ r d rotating in the same direction in the nbf coordinate system in other words the resultant heading angle controller command is obtained from the sum of the rudders angles a pid controller is designed to control the yaw or heading angle ψ as 26 e ψ ψ d ψ 27 δ r s e ψ s k p ψ k d ψ s k i ψ s 28 δ r k p ψ e ψ k d ψ e ψ k i ψ e ψ d t 2 6 4 the roll angle controller the coupled fins propulsors cfp roll control system is used to roll angle control the cfp is formed by coupling the four decoupled fins fdf and contra rotating propellers crp roll control systems the mutually coupled stern fins elevators or mutually coupled rudder fins are decoupled in the fdf system and the coaxial fins have counter rotation motions to produce the rolling moment s the contra rotating propellers crp roll control system produces the rolling moments by a difference between the two counter rotating propellers revolution speeds theoretically the rolling moment can be created with no impact on the yaw or pitch moments generated to depth or heading angles when the resultant commands of depth or yaw angle controllers are preserved three pid controllers for crp fdf and cfp systems can be designed to the roll angle control by the fdf system as 29 e φ φ d φ 30 f o r crp δ n

speeds and stern and rudder fins angles are respectively obtained for the three designed roll angle controllers as 33 n 1 n δ n n 2 n δ n 34 δ δ r s δ δ r δ δ s 35 δ δ r u δ r δ δ r δ δ r d δ r δ δ r

desired forward speed in the third roll angle controller the δ δ r and δ δ s can be the arbitrary complementary fractions of δ δ r s a good idea for the better maintenance of the fins is implementing the third roll angle controller with the same fractions i e δ δ s δ δ r 2 7 simulator modules in this work the matlab simulink was used to develop the simulator matlab 2016 the simulator consists of two input blocks open loop and closed loop an actuator dynamics block a control system and a dynamic model block represented in the simulation diagram fig 3 the inputs are modified and matched to real operational conditions actuator limits constraints and saturation in the actuator dynamics block the proper actuators inputs to approach the user s desired states are produced in the control system block section 2 6 the 6dof equations of motion are modeled in the dynamic model block section 2 5 the detailed procedures and formulations to develop the simulator can be found in references fossen 2011 osborn 2016 prestero 2001 the auto solver option is enabled in matlab simulink to select an appropriate solver through the simulation time between different ordinary differential equation ode solvers such as runge kutta heun bogacki shampine euler methods and dormand prince matlab 2016 the vrml toolbox is also utilized to link the simulink models and matlab algorithms for 3d graphics of auv 3 results and discussions in this section the vehicle dynamics are first evaluated focusing on the effects of a single propeller propulsion system s roll instability in remus it is followed by evaluating the designed fdf controller to enhance auv s roll angle control 3 1 the open loop dynamics the open loop dynamics can be examined through various simulation tests however because the focus is on enhancing auv s roll dynamics the roll instabilities due to the single propeller propulsion system are investigated the propeller revolution speed is changed from 0 to 1000 rpm with steps of 100 rpm resulting in the forward speed change from 0 to about 5 2 m s fig 4 shows the time series of the four desired control states u ψ z and φ the approximate steady values of the forward speed u depth z rate of depth change z roll angle φ rate of change of roll angle φ and rate of change of heading angle ψ for different propeller revolution speeds are illustrated in fig 5 the vehicle paths are also illustrated in fig 6 for the corresponding open loop tests open loop tests show the increase in the yaw angle and depth due to the growing rolling bias as the propeller s torque is increased the hull s positive reserve buoyancy and its asymmetry in the lateral yz plane cause trimming oscillations forward speed fluctuations and spiral rising or surfacing or diving paths through the open loop motions the higher propeller speeds produce lower oscillations higher forward speeds and more progress in the spiral path also linear increases in u z and ψ and a quadratic increase in φ is observed by a gradual increase in the propeller revolution speed the roll angle φ varies from 0 to 28 for the appointed tests due to the coupled dynamics of auv other states such as z and ψ are also influenced whereby the spiral paths are created fig 6 3 2 the closed loop dynamics and control several simulation tests are designed to examine the auv s closed loop system due to our focus on enhancing the roll dynamics the designed roll angle controllers are first evaluated based on the percentage of fdf and crp participation in the cfp roll control system test 1 fig 7 the cfp control system evaluation is followed by the closed loop time series of input parameters outputs state and trajectory paths at different forward speeds test 2 fig 8 different desired roll angles test 3 fig 9 different stern and rudder fins participations test 4 fig 10 the desired values of the forward speed u d roll angle φ d heading angle ψ d and depth z d are presented in table 2 the results contain the time series of input parameters n 1 n 2 δ s l δ s r δ r u δ r d output states x y z φ θ ψ u v w p q r and the vehicle paths the initial values of all inputs and outputs have been set to zero the time averaged roll angle φ t a versus the desired forward speed u d test 5 fig 11 and the desired roll angle φ d test 6 fig 12 for different fdf and crp participation in the cfp roll control system are also investigated next the results show that using a fraction of 30 crp and 70 fdf roll control actuators in the cfp roll control system causes less oscillation fig 7 therefore this controller is used as a roll controller for the subsequent tests presented in table 2 to evaluate the roll control enhancement the fins incident flow on auv s fins or propulsors provides the required control forces and moments therefore the control system actuators can produce smaller control forces and moments in lower forward speeds the fluctuations that occurred for roll angle and other state parameters in fig 8 in lower speeds are due to the generated control forces and moments fig 8 also shows that the produced control forces in u d 1 m s and u d 2 m s are not adequate to produce the control forces to reach the desired roll angle φ d 50 the fluctuations can also be observed in the time series plots of input and trajectory paths in fig 8 also large oscillations can be observed for u d 3 m s therefore a limited amount of desired roll angle can be achieved at a given speed and the auv s control system is unable to provide more roll control forces to reach larger desired roll angles as shown in fig 10 at a speed of u d 5 m s up to a roll angle of φ d 60 is reached while oscillations increase in roll angles more than φ d 50 fig 10 shows that the fins participation fraction of 49 stern fins sf and 31 rudder fins rf in the 30 crp and 70 fdf control system exhibit fewer oscillations in input parameters and output states plots fig 12 shows that at smaller roll angles φ d 18 either the fdf system the crp system or the cfp system can adequately control the roll angle at intermediate roll angles 18 φ d 60 either the fdf system or the cfp system is needed to produce sufficient roll control forces at larger roll angles φ d 60 the cfp system is required to produce adequate roll control forces and moments it is also observed that the fluctuations at higher roll angles φ d 70 deviate the timed averaged roll angle from the desired roll angle even with the cfp system while lower deflections are generated by the 30 fdf and 70 crp system fig 12 compares the time averaged roll angles for different cfp roll control systems versus various forward speeds as can be seen the upper limit of the 100 cpr roll control system is φ d 18 while the dfd and cfp control systems can reach the desired roll angle up to φ d 70 for u d 4 m s the 100 crp roll control system can support up to φ d 1 for u d 1 m s φ d 3 for u d 2 m s φ d 6 for u d 3 m s φ d 12 for u d 4 m s and φ d 18 for u d 5 m s the 100 fdf roll control system can cover up to φ d 8 for u d 1 m s φ d 30 for u d 2 m s φ d 49 for u d 3 m s and φ d 62 for u d 4 m s however the cfp roll control systems can cover up to φ d 9 for u d 1 m s φ d 33 for u d 2 m s φ d 49 for u d 3 m s and φ d 75 for u d 4 m s 4 conclusion in this paper enhancing the auv s roll dynamics was studied using the coupled fins propulsors cfp roll control system a comparison between the contra rotating propellers crp four decoupled fins fdf and three various cfp roll control systems was also accomplished from the results it is concluded that 1 the roll angle deflections produced by different internal and external forces and moments such as moving internal weights propeller torques maneuvering and collisions can significantly influence other degrees of freedom due to their coupled dynamics 2 in the open loop system due to the hull s positive reserve buoyancy and its asymmetry in the lateral yz plane the higher propeller speeds lead to lower oscillations and higher forward speeds more depths larger deflected roll angles and more progress in the spiral paths 3 in the closed loop system one pair of fins alone can adequately control the roll angle in an appropriate range of desired roll angles especially the stern fins cause fewer oscillations in other dofs 4 using a fraction of 30 crp and 70 fdf roll control actuators and the fins participation fraction of 49 stern fins sf and 31 rudder fins rf in the cfp systems caused less oscillation in the closed loop system 5 a limited amount of desired roll angle could be achieved at a given speed e g at a speed of u d 5 m s up to a roll angle of φ d 60 while oscillations increase in roll angles more than φ d 50 6 at smaller roll angles φ d 18 all of the fdf crp and cfp systems at intermediate roll angles 18 φ d 60 both fdf and cfp systems and at larger roll angles φ d 60 only the cfp system could produce the adequate roll control forces and moments while the fluctuations at higher roll angles φ d 70 deviated the timed averaged roll angle 7 the upper limit of the 100 cpr roll control system is φ d 18 while the dfd and cfp control systems could reach the desired roll angle up to φ d 70 for u d 4 m s formatting of funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors credit authorship

20541,autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are exposed to several internal or external forces or moments causing roll instabilities the coupled nonlinear dynamics of an auv requires designing and utilizing an appropriate roll control system to operate well in various missions in this paper the roll dynamics and control enhancement of a remus auv is studied using a coupled fins propulsors cfp system by developing a six degrees of freedom 6dof simulator the results show that 1 the roll angle deflections usually have adverse effects on coupled dynamics of the auv in both open loop and closed loop systems 2 in large roll angle deflections the cfp system show a proper selection of 30 crp contra rotating propellers and 70 fdf four decoupled fins 49 sf stern fins and 31 rf rudder fins can better control the roll dynamics by reducing the oscillations 3 for φ d 18 the fdf crp and cfp for 18 φ d 60 the fdf and cfp and for 60 φ d 70 the cfp system could produce the adequate roll control forces and moments 4 a limited desired roll angle can be achieved at a given forward speed the maximum value is φ d 70 for u d 4 m s graphical abstract image 1 keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv roll control enhancement 6dof dynamics coupled fins propulsors cfp control system simulator 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are untethered unmanned self propelled underwater vehicles lei 2020 sahoo et al 2019 a classical auv contains a propeller for its propulsion two coupled horizontal fins elevators for depth control and two coupled vertical fins rudders for heading angle control an et al 2020 prestero 2001 however various shapes thrusters fin arrangements equipment and manipulators have been developed or are currently under development for auvs jain et al 2015 manzanilla et al 2018 sahoo et al 2019 auvs are shaped from standard rigid cylindrical or spherical bodies to advanced fish like or torpedo shaped bodies abbaspoor and ebrahimi 2015 braginsky et al 2020 ebrahimi and abbaspour 2015 2016 kim et al 2018 scaradozzi et al 2017 ebrahimi and abbaspoor 2016 the auv s propulsion system is ranged from the standard single or multiple propeller driven or water jet systems in the coaxial arrangement such as counter rotating propellers crp or different layouts of vectorial fixed thrusters vft or vectorial reconfigurable thrusters vrt to biomimetic or bioinspired undulation mechanisms bum abbaspour and ebrahimi 2015 allotta et al 2015 ebrahimi et al 2020 ebrahimi and abbaspour 2016 fagundes gasparoto et al 2021 pugi et al 2018 sahoo et al 2019 vega et al 2015 various types of auvs are used in the oceanography and ocean engineering applications such as survey marine platforms seafloor mapping or bathymetry seafloor or water column sampling or maintenance or repair of offshore facilities hai et al 2019 li and lee 2005 tran et al 2021 thus a robust agile control system is necessary for an auv in the complex marine environment to prevail over the undesirable disturbances or reach the desired states kinaci et al 2020 lei 2020 xu et al 2020 an auv may be subjected to several induced internal or external forces or moments such as moving internal weights propeller torques collisions and maneuvering ebrahimi et al 2020 hong and chitre 2015 kaya et al 2020 lei 2020 the forces and moments can lead to oscillatory or rotational rolling instabilities due to a small x axis moment of inertia low rolling drag and low restoring forces compared to other degrees of freedom dofs ebrahimi et al 2020 herlambang et al 2017 lei 2020 the roll instabilities can adversely affect the performance of auv disrupt its missions or cause its damage or crash by collisions therefore utilizing a proper roll control system is crucial for auv s operations including low speed maneuvers or high speed forward motions ebrahimi et al 2020 herlambang et al 2017 the roll instabilities of auvs can also be classified into static and dynamic instabilities da silva costa et al 2017 fossen 2011 static instabilities may often originate from the internal or external arrangement of vehicle equipment or asymmetries in hull shape or equipment installations amundsen 2017 sverdrup thygeson et al 2018 dynamic instabilities can be originated from the biased or unbalanced reaction torques in different propulsion systems ebrahimi et al 2020 fagundes gasparoto et al 2021 pugi et al 2018 vega et al 2015 it should be noted that the rotation of a single propeller as the auv s propulsion system causes the generation of a reaction torque which produces a biased roll angle related to the propeller s revolution speed rpm da silva costa et al 2017 ebrahimi et al 2020 fossen 2011 prestero 2001 the static stability or metacentric stability of marine vehicles can be achieved by restoring forces and moments related to the distances between the vehicle s buoyancy gravity and metacentric centers fossen 2011 for a submerged vessel such as auvs the metacentric center matches the buoyancy center restricting possible restoring moments fossen 2011 however the dynamic stability can be achieved by some internal weight variation or external actuator based mechanisms ibarz et al 2003 li 2016 for some low speed maneuverings the internal weight mechanisms iwms hong and chitre 2015 or lateral horizontal actuators lhas zhigang et al 2011 are usually employed as roll control systems however iwms or lhas cannot perform appropriately in high speed maneuvers hong and chitre 2015 petrich and stilwell 2011 ziaeefard et al 2018 implementing advanced propulsion systems such as crp vft or vrt can provide both self balancing of roll instabilities originated from reaction torques and producing desired roll angles the crp systems consist of a pair of opposite rotating coaxial propellers with the advantages of high efficiency under high loads and high maximum thrust power for a given diameter brizzolara et al 2012 ebrahimi et al 2020 the bums often utilize flexible bodies highly complicated mechanisms and advanced coupled nonlinear control systems and are currently under research and development scaradozzi et al 2017 the vft and vrt systems are usually layouts in the array forms of two three four or even more pivoted thrusters designed and customized through operating and mission characteristics fagundes gasparoto et al 2021 pugi et al 2018 although the vft and vrt systems have advantages such as high maneuvering and hovering capabilities and are less complex than bum systems they need more energy costs and excessive equipment and are more complex than the crp systems a few researchers in the literature have focused on the systematic evaluation of auvs roll dynamics and control enhancement ebrahimi et al 2020 hong and chitre 2015 single propelled auvs and mutually coupled fins such as the remus vehicle are usually underactuated and often suffer from roll instabilities li et al 2018 by adding a coaxial propeller crp system roll instabilities can be controlled up to a certain angle ebrahimi et al 2020 by decoupling the mutually coupled fins dfd system and combining it with crp cfp system the system becomes overactuated with a capability of controlling more considerable roll instabilities therefore the systematic evaluation of these systems is helpful in the design of an auv and its control system and choosing proper actuators and the roll control system in this paper enhancing the roll dynamics and control of an auv is studied through a systematic evaluation of fdf crp and cfp roll control systems ranges of the forward speed roll angle and contribution of the proposed roll control systems are evaluated pid controllers are implemented due to their less complexity and the wide range of applications in practice fossen 2011 the fdf system does not impose additional fins or actuators on auv and is created only by decoupling the elevators and rudders the crp system can be obtained through a minimum change in propulsion system while can exploit its self stabilization capability the cfp system can exploit both advantages of fdf and crp systems while a more significant resultant roll moment can also be provided the cfp system is proposed to cover low to high speeds impose negligible impacts on the control of pitch and yaw motions damp the undesirable roll angles and reach the desired roll angle for particular maneuverings in the complex marine environment or among offshore facilities the simulation software is developed composing from the dynamic and control blocks the correlation between the simulations and experiments in the developed simulation software is established through an experimentally verified benchmark remus auv whose coefficients and formulations have been experimentally studied and verified by prestero 2001 and several other researchers allen et al 1997a 2000 1997a kim 2015 phaneuf 2004 the geometry of the auv the definition of the reference frames and formulations are presented first the open loop roll dynamics is evaluated next by developing a dynamics simulator it is followed by developing the control system simulator and evaluations of using the cfp roll control system 2 materials and methods the simulation and controller models are described in this section the simulation or maneuvering model describes a 6dof system to simulate the coupled motions in the time domain while the controller model is a reduced order model for the motion control system fossen 2011 the vehicle dynamics external forces due to interactions with the environment and propulsion terms are included in the simulation model the controller model utilizes multiple proportional integral derivative pid controllers for a multi target control system a vectorial notation is used to derive the simulation and controller models formulations presented in the following sections 2 1 geometry remote environmental monitoring units or remus vehicles are low cost torpedo shaped autonomous underwater vehicles auvs designed by the oceanographic systems lab remus vehicles often use a propeller and four mutually coupled fins for steering and diving allen et

with origin o b are generally the first step in formulating an auv motion in 6dof fig 2 fossen 2011 the relationships between the ief and nbf describe the position p and orientation θ of the vehicle eq 1 nbf conventionally expresses the linear v and angular ω velocities of the vehicle eq 2 the origin o b is usually placed at the center of buoyancy cof due to the rigid body s constant hull volume during the operations the nbf s coordinate plane axes x b y b and z b are the same as the auv s principal axes of inertia the state variables are chosen as 1 η p θ x y z φ θ ψ t 2 ν v ω u v w p q r t where x y and z are position vector elements roll ϕ pitch θ and yaw ψ terms are the euler angles u v and w are the translational velocities and p q and r are the rotational velocities the detailed

the equations of motion of an auv the essential external forces and moments are defined as a generalized force vector τ rb composing from four multi dof elements such as hydrostatic τ hs hydrodynamic τ hd environmental τ e and control τ c forces and moments 8 τ rb f t x y z k m n t 9 τ rb τ hs τ hd τ e τ c 2 5 equations of motion a vectorial form in the nbf is defined to express the nonlinear 6dof rigid body equations of motion as 10 m rb v c rb v v τ rb where m rb is the rigid body inertia matrix and c rb v is a matrix of rigid body coriolis and centripetal forces created by defining the reference frame s origin in a point other than the center of gravity cog the equations of motions can be rearranged as eq 11 due to the dependency of the external forces to acceleration velocity and position vectors 11 m v c v v d v v g η τ where τ is an independent part of force vector from the acceleration velocity and position vectors m is the total mass matrix m a is the added mass matrix originated from the inertia of the surrounding fluid c ν r is the total coriolis and centripetal matrix c a is the total coriolis and centripetal matrix of the added mass created from the rotation of b with respect to n d is the total damping matrix primarily from viscous terms skin friction and lift drag for auvs d lift is the lift matrix d nl is the nonlinear damping matrix and g η is the restoring matrix due to the hydrostatic forces the first three equations in eq 11 are called the translational motion elements and the last three equations are called the rotational motion elements

in the water are propulsors and fins there are two mutually coupled moving rudder fins two mutually coupled stern fins and a single propeller in a typical remus auv however in this paper the four mutually coupled fins system is assumed to be decoupled and form a four decoupled fins fdf system through the fdf system the undesired roll angle produced by an individual propeller or other external disturbances can be removed by counter rotation of each mutually coaxial fins elevators or rudders or by a combination of both mutually coaxial fins elevators and rudders the counter rotation of mutually coaxial fins can also produce desired roll angles for particular maneuvering missions the control system consists of four subsystems a forward speed controller a depth controller a heading angle controller and a roll angle controller the control laws are obtained based on pid controllers and the desired states prescribing the control targets and the measured or estimated feedback states the control system is thus a multi input multi output mimo structure with five inputs n propeller s revolution speed δ s l left stern fin or elevator angle δ s r right stern fin or elevator angle δ r

inputs and the low pass filters are also added after the saturation functions to improve actuator treatments the angular boundaries of stern and rudder fins are limited between 20 20 degrees 2 6 1 the forward speed controller due to the dominance of drag and added mass in the surge hydrodynamic forces and the dependence of thrust forces to only the propeller parameters the surge equation can be decoupled from the other dofs in the system of equations of motion fossen 2011 the thrust force x p r o p is modeled by a linear function of control input u c 17 x p r o p x d u c where x d is the constant propulsion coefficient a pid controller is defined to control the forward speed of the vehicle by the propeller s revolution speed as 18 u c s e u s k p u k d u s k i u s 19 e u u d u u c k p u e u k d u e u k i u e u d t where e u is the error function obtained from the difference between the desired and the current forward speeds a series of simulations are also carried out to determine the suitable choice of pid controllers coefficients k p k d and k i 2 6 2 the depth controller the stern fins are usually used for depth control in auvs by varying the pitch angle to force the vehicle to rise or dive into the desired depth the input control variables are the deflection angles of the stern fins δ s l and δ s r rotating in the same direction in the nbf coordinate system in other words the resultant depth controller command is obtained from the sum of the stern fins angles in the designation of depth controller a four state model w t q t θ t and z t is used with the simplifying assumption of equilibrium condition with the constant forward speed of the vehicle the designed depth controller is a cascading controller consisting of a pid inner loop for controlling

state model consisting of the yaw angle rate r and yaw angle ψ the control variable is the deflection of rudder angles δ r u and δ r d rotating in the same direction in the nbf coordinate system in other words the resultant heading angle controller command is obtained from the sum of the rudders angles a pid controller is designed to control the yaw or heading angle ψ as 26 e ψ ψ d ψ 27 δ r s e

by coupling the four decoupled fins fdf and contra rotating propellers crp roll control systems the mutually coupled stern fins elevators or mutually coupled rudder fins are decoupled in the fdf system and the coaxial fins have counter rotation motions to produce the rolling moment s the contra rotating propellers crp roll control system produces the rolling moments by a difference between the two counter rotating propellers revolution speeds theoretically the rolling moment can be created with no impact on the yaw or pitch moments generated to depth or heading angles when the resultant commands of depth or yaw angle controllers are preserved three pid controllers for crp fdf and cfp systems can be designed to the roll angle control by the fdf system as 29 e φ φ d φ 30 f o r crp δ n

desired forward speed in the third roll angle controller the δ δ r and δ δ s can be the arbitrary complementary fractions of δ δ r s a good idea for the better maintenance of the fins is implementing the third roll angle controller with the same fractions i e δ δ s δ δ r 2 7 simulator modules in this work the matlab simulink was used to develop the simulator matlab 2016 the simulator consists of two input blocks open loop and closed loop an actuator dynamics block a control system and a dynamic model block represented in the simulation diagram fig 3 the inputs are modified and matched to real operational conditions actuator limits constraints and saturation in the actuator dynamics block the proper actuators inputs to approach the user s desired states are produced in the control system block section 2 6 the 6dof equations of motion are modeled in the dynamic model block section 2 5 the detailed procedures and formulations to develop the simulator can be found in references fossen 2011 osborn 2016 prestero 2001 the auto solver option is enabled in matlab simulink to select an appropriate solver through the simulation time between different ordinary differential equation ode solvers such as runge kutta heun bogacki shampine euler methods and dormand prince matlab 2016 the vrml toolbox is also utilized to link the simulink models and matlab algorithms for 3d graphics of auv 3 results and discussions in this section the vehicle dynamics are first evaluated focusing on the effects of a single propeller propulsion system s roll instability in remus it is followed by evaluating the designed fdf controller to enhance auv s roll angle control 3 1 the open loop dynamics the open loop dynamics can be examined through various simulation tests however because the focus is on enhancing auv s roll dynamics the roll instabilities due to the single propeller propulsion system are investigated the propeller revolution speed is changed from 0 to 1000 rpm with steps of 100 rpm resulting in the forward speed change from 0 to about 5 2 m s fig 4 shows the time series of the four desired control states u ψ z and φ the approximate steady values of the forward speed u depth z rate of depth change z roll angle φ rate of change of roll angle φ and rate of change of heading angle ψ for different propeller revolution speeds are illustrated in fig 5 the vehicle paths are also illustrated in fig 6 for the corresponding open loop tests open loop tests show the increase in the yaw angle and depth due to the growing rolling bias as the propeller s torque is increased the hull s positive reserve buoyancy and its asymmetry in the lateral yz plane cause trimming oscillations forward speed fluctuations and spiral rising or surfacing or diving paths through the open loop motions the higher propeller speeds produce lower oscillations higher forward speeds and more progress in the spiral path also linear increases in u z and ψ and a quadratic increase in φ is observed by a gradual increase in the propeller revolution speed the roll angle φ varies from 0 to 28 for the appointed tests due to the coupled dynamics of auv other states such as z and ψ are also influenced whereby the spiral paths are created fig 6 3 2 the closed loop dynamics and control several simulation tests are designed to examine the auv s closed loop system due to our focus on enhancing the roll dynamics the designed roll angle controllers are first evaluated based on the percentage of fdf and crp participation in the cfp roll control system test 1 fig 7 the cfp control system evaluation is followed by the closed loop time series of input parameters outputs state and trajectory paths at different forward speeds test 2 fig 8 different desired roll angles test 3 fig 9 different stern and rudder fins participations test 4 fig 10 the desired values of the forward speed u d roll angle φ d heading angle ψ d and depth z d are presented in table 2 the results contain the time series of input parameters n 1 n 2 δ s l δ s r δ r u δ r d output states x y z φ θ ψ u v w p q r and the vehicle paths the initial values of all inputs and outputs have been set to zero the time averaged roll angle φ t a versus the desired forward speed u d test 5 fig 11 and the desired roll angle φ d test 6 fig 12 for different fdf and crp participation in the cfp roll control system are also investigated next the results show that using a fraction of 30 crp and 70 fdf roll control actuators in the cfp roll control system causes less oscillation fig 7 therefore this controller is used as a roll controller for the subsequent tests presented in table 2 to evaluate the roll control enhancement the fins incident flow on auv s fins or propulsors provides the required control forces and moments therefore the control system actuators can produce smaller control forces and moments in lower forward speeds the fluctuations that occurred for roll angle and other state parameters in fig 8 in lower speeds are due to the generated control forces and moments fig 8 also shows that the produced control forces in u d 1 m s and u d 2 m s are not adequate to produce the control forces to reach the desired roll angle φ d 50 the fluctuations can also be observed in the time series plots of input and trajectory paths in fig 8 also large oscillations can be observed for u d 3 m s therefore a limited amount of desired roll angle can be achieved at a given speed and the auv s control system is unable to provide more roll control forces to reach larger desired roll angles as shown in fig 10 at a speed of u d 5 m s up to a roll angle of φ d 60 is reached while oscillations increase in roll angles more than φ d 50 fig 10 shows that the fins participation fraction of 49 stern fins sf and 31 rudder fins rf in the 30 crp and 70 fdf control system exhibit fewer oscillations in input parameters and output states plots fig 12 shows that at smaller roll angles φ d 18 either the fdf system the crp system or the cfp system can adequately control the roll angle at intermediate roll angles 18 φ d 60 either the fdf system or the cfp system is needed to produce sufficient roll control forces at larger roll angles φ d 60 the cfp system is required to produce adequate roll control forces and moments it is also observed that the fluctuations at higher roll angles φ d 70 deviate the timed averaged roll angle from the desired roll angle even with the cfp system while lower deflections are generated by the 30 fdf and 70 crp system fig 12 compares the time averaged roll angles for different cfp roll control systems versus various forward speeds as can be seen the upper limit of the 100 cpr roll control system is φ d 18 while the dfd and cfp control systems can reach the desired roll angle up to φ d 70 for u d 4 m s the 100 crp roll control system can support up to φ d 1 for u d 1 m s φ d 3 for u d 2 m s φ d 6 for u d 3 m s φ d 12 for u d 4 m s and φ d 18 for u d 5 m s the 100 fdf roll control system can cover up to φ d 8 for u d 1 m s φ d 30 for u d 2 m s φ d 49 for u d 3 m s and φ d 62 for u d 4 m s however the cfp roll control systems can cover up to φ d 9 for u d 1 m s φ d 33 for u d 2 m s φ d 49 for u d 3 m s and φ d 75 for u d 4 m s 4 conclusion in this paper enhancing the auv s roll dynamics was studied using the coupled fins propulsors cfp roll control system a comparison between the contra rotating propellers crp four decoupled fins fdf and three various cfp roll control systems was also accomplished from the results it is concluded that 1 the roll angle deflections produced by different internal and external forces and moments such as moving internal weights propeller torques maneuvering and collisions can significantly influence other degrees of freedom due to their coupled dynamics 2 in the open loop system due to the hull s positive reserve buoyancy and its asymmetry in the lateral yz plane the higher propeller speeds lead to lower oscillations and higher forward speeds more depths larger deflected roll angles and more progress in the spiral paths 3 in the closed loop system one pair of fins alone can adequately control the roll angle in an appropriate range of desired roll angles especially the stern fins cause fewer oscillations in other dofs 4 using a fraction of 30 crp and 70 fdf roll control actuators and the fins participation fraction of 49 stern fins sf and 31 rudder fins rf in the cfp systems caused less oscillation in the closed loop system 5 a limited amount of desired roll angle could be achieved at a given speed e g at a speed of u d 5 m s up to a roll angle of φ d 60 while oscillations increase in roll angles more than φ d 50 6 at smaller roll angles φ d 18 all of the fdf crp and cfp systems at intermediate roll angles 18 φ d 60 both fdf and cfp systems and at larger roll angles φ d 60 only the cfp system could produce the adequate roll control forces and moments while the fluctuations at higher roll angles φ d 70 deviated the timed averaged roll angle 7 the upper limit of the 100 cpr roll control system is φ d 18 while the dfd and cfp control systems could reach the desired roll angle up to φ d 70 for u d 4 m s formatting of funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors credit authorship

20542,increasing demand for versatile and long endurance autonomous underwater vehicles puts significant design pressure on all aspects of auv design and operation including that of the propulsive system the present study discusses testing of a thruster unit and several propellers developed to propel a hybrid glider flight style underwater vehicle due to the auv being required to operate at largely different speeds and thrust levels between the two configurations the propulsive subsystem needs to be capable of remaining efficient and effective across a wide range of operating conditions thus the current results focus on quantifying all of the factors affecting the drive train ranging from open water performance of the propeller up to electro mechanical efficiency of the magnetic coupling and geared electric motor it is shown that depending on the required operating point total efficiency of the vehicle is primarily affected by non linear low reynolds number effects sudden drop of gearbox efficiency at low revolutions and applied torques as well as blade deformation aside of the baseline propeller efficiency keywords auv hydrodynamics propulsion 1 introduction underwater gliders are autonomous underwater vehicles auv that rely on using a buoyancy engine in order to ascend or descend through the water column by adjusting their pitch they can utilise this vertical motion in order to develop forward thrust from their hydrofoils this propulsion method allows them to undertake long endurance missions often many weeks long graver 2005 rudnick et al 2004 eriksen 2003 however their mode of locomotion renders their speed and rate of ascent susceptible to currents water density variations and hull compressibility this adversely affects their ability to perform measurements at a particular location as well as increases uncertainty errors associated with dead reckoning and localisation of the vehicle between gps fixes obtained at the surface furthermore being reliant on the buoyancy engine alone limits the types of missions gliders are able to perform for this reason several vehicles in use today employ small thruster units intended to provide an additional means of propulsion however they are used mostly for overcoming currents and maintaining steady rates of ascent or descent rather than to provide the ability to operate the vehicle as a conventional auv claus et al 2010 chen et al 2016 isa et al 2014 thrusters used on rovs or conventional auvs typically need to be operated over a wide range of conditions and inflow angles making even omni directional performance an important aspect of the design kim and chung 2006 allotta et al 2015 pugi et al 2018 present work discusses the design manufacture and testing of a thruster unit designed to provide secondary means of propelling the bridges http www bridges h2020 eu deep explorer underwater glider as well as allowing it to operate as a conventional flight style auv such a configuration of the vehicle is expected to enable a much wider operational envelope than either contemporary underwater gliders or propeller driven auvs design of the thruster had to balance several often conflicting requirements such as minimisation of drag while gliding efficient operation at very low thrust levels when assisting the glider being able to deliver sufficient power to propel the vehicle when it is to operate as a conventional auv as well as flexibility in matching power output to variable configurations and drag of the glider compared to ships the designed propellers are characterised by relatively low loading and small blade area ratio bar making them more akin to airborne drone propellers this is caused by relatively high rpm of the electric motors compared to diesel engines which poses practical limits on maximum blade area ratio due to maximum power output of the prime mover the necessity to operate in a wake field at much lower advance speeds and in a different medium cause the operational envelopes of the present and airborne propellers to differ significantly furthermore the required rpm and torque levels necessitate the use of a gearbox in the auv drive train introducing an additional efficiency term that needs to be understood and optimised for an efficient design developing a detailed understanding of the aforementioned effects and using that knowledge for the design of an effective propulsor is the key focus of the present study this is done through quantification of the motor gearbox efficiency towing tank experiments involving of a series of 3d printed propellers designed to deliver various levels of thrust and basic measurements of blade deformation under load 2 propulsion unit design 2 1 design requirements the designed propeller was required to deliver approximately 20 n of thrust which had been estimated based on wind tunnel measurements lidtke et al 2018 and numerical predictions lidtke et al 2017 the nominal wake fraction was estimated using cfd and yielded average nominal inflow speeds of 0 13 and 0 44 m s 1 for vehicle speeds of 0 3 and 1 0 m s 1 respectively these correspond to cruise and sprint conditions with the former also being representative of glide assist operation mode of the propeller large difference between the cruise and sprint conditions implied an equally wide range of thrust requirements and operating points thus while the key design point was taken to be the sprint condition in order to ensure the vehicle will be able to reach its desired speed consideration also had to be taken of the thrust developed at lower velocities the design was also further complicated by a maximum electrical power requirement of 10 w e at the cruise condition evaluating the degree to which this specification has been met necessitated careful accounting for the different flow conditions expected at that vehicle speed furthermore the interplay of hydrodynamic and electro mechanical efficiencies had to be taken into consideration to guarantee the endurance target of the vehicle would be met 2 2 propeller design naca 66 mod profile was selected for the propeller blades offsets of which are shown in fig 1 this blade profile is widely used on marine propellers due to its favourable cavitation avoidance and structural characteristics carlton 2012 while the former is not of concern here due to the vehicle typically operating at high static pressures the relatively thick trailing edge and large cross sectional area of the foil were deemed favourable due to the intention to manufacture the propeller blades using 3d printing preliminary design of the propeller was carried out using blade element momentum theory bemt molland et al 2011 due to its inexpensive nature a wide range of solutions could be evaluated while considering the effects of diameter pitch chord camber and number of blades hydrodynamic performance of each propeller was also assessed in conjunction with structural characteristics to ensure the designs could be feasibly manufactured following several design iterations using the numerical tools a target design was proposed with key parameters as depicted in fig 2 and table 1 a design pitch value of 0 35 was also selected however it was recognised that the used numerical tools might be prone to substantial prediction errors stemming from the difficulty of accurately accounting for the effects of laminar turbulent transition as a function of blade reynolds number surface roughness and onset turbulence levels it was also sought to measure performance of a range of propellers in order to provide a suite of choices for the vehicle operating with different payload configurations therefore a range of designs with the same other design parameters and constant pitch distributions but varying nominal pitch values were designed with p d of 0 25 0 35 0 45 0 55 and 0 60 this was done to evaluate the effect of changing angle of attack of the blade which was expected to have the most significant effect on the performance of the propeller in the expected operating regimes a rendering of one of the blade geometries is depicted in fig 3 a characteristic feature of the current design is its ability to unfold using rotational inertia and hydrodynamic moment developed by the tip of the blade this is facilitated by the root of the blade being mounted on a pin that allows free rotation and stopping elements on the hub which restrict the range of motion this should allow the propeller to exert a minimum drag augment on the vehicle when it is gliding but give it the ability to deploy the propeller with the rotational action of the shaft alone in order to allow the blade to develop a sufficient moment around the root relatively large pitch values and consequently angles of attack had to be adopted near the tip this is expected to reduce the efficiency of the blade but is a necessary sacrifice to meet the functional requirements without employing complex and potentially less reliable mechanical unfolding systems the unfolding ability was further enhanced by placing the pivot axis at an angle to the horizontal plane thereby increasing the pitch of the entire blade when folded selective laser sintering sls 3d printing using nylon 12 has been selected for making the blades this process has been successfully used on underwater vehicles before and offers a cost effective and flexible solution for manufacturing of complex shapes to improve surface finish of the manufactured blades and provide additional protection against moisture absorption the finished prints may also polished and dyed with little added cost or complexity the selected material is however characterised by lower strength and stiffness than for instance composite materials which are often used on aircraft propellers of similar size brandt and selig 2011 thus it has been found necessary to keep the minimum trailing edge thickness of at least 0 6 mm at the tip of the blade and 1 0 mm at the root in order to ensure satisfactory print quality and level of detail of the finished print furthermore the minimum blade thickness of 1 5 mm has been adopted to meet structural requirements these have been assessed using finite element analysis by prescribing a uniform pressure of 200 kg m 2 in the thrust direction which is an equivalent of load of approximately 100 n or five times the design thrust of the propeller the design was considered to meet the structural requirements if the maximum stress did not exceed 35 mpa which is the tensile strength of the material used a second criterion was also considered whereby an equivalent of design thrust was applied to the blade and it was ensured that the maximum stress does not exceed 10 mpa to avoid creep failure structural analysis results were also used to determine maximum deflection of the blade which for the extreme load case was estimated to reach up to 12 mm for some of the blade designs to compensate for this and protect against the blades impacting the upstream part of the vehicle a linear rake distribution was applied to the propeller this ensured that as long as the load on the blades remains within structurally feasible limits sufficient clearance will exist between the face of the propeller and the appendages it has been reported that accurate predictions of flow past flexible wings and propellers can be made by carrying out fluid structure interaction simulations which solve for both structural response and fluid loading simultaneously giovannetti et al 2016 2018 maljaars et al 2018 however such simulations were beyond the scope of the current investigation and would also require reliable validation data for rotating geometries which have proven difficult to obtain thus it was aimed to rely on the experimental results to quantify the effect of the blade deformation on performance 2 3 thruster design the thruster unit has been designed to operate safely at depths up to 6000 m to simplify installation and maintenance an early decision was taken to house the thruster in an air filled pressure vessel thus eliminating the need for additional oil compensator units this pressure vessel was manufactured from titanium grade 5 and pressure tested at the national oceanography centre the housing comprises of three segments housing the electronics the motorgearbox system and the internal part of the radial magnetic coupling as shown in fig 4 o ring seals are used between each cement of the housing but in practice only one of them needs to be opened for servicing due to all of the electronics being housed on a single easily detachable internal frame the use of a magnetic coupling transferring motor torque through the titanium housing eliminates the need for a shaft seal greatly increasing reliability the outer magnetic coupling runs in sea water with magnet units bonded into a titanium outer mandrel before being sealed within a cast polyurethane encapsulant also contained within the polyurethane is a steel keeper ring which by redirecting magnetic flux within the coupling increases the available torque transfer by around 40 for a given magnet set the complete outer coupling is mounted on ceramic water lubricated bearings and attached directly to the propeller assembly the chosen radial arrangement allows for a shorter design pugi et al 2018 than an axial one which was a major consideration from the point of view of the internal arrangement of the bridges glider it also allows the gap between the two sets of magnets to be minimised improving the torque capabilities of the coupling for the same number of magnets used allotta et al 2015 the thruster unit is designed to operate at a maximum output of 100 w with supply voltage of up to 60 v and maximum rpm of 1000 thanks to the use of a two stage 10 1 gearbox this makes it oversized for the needs of the current vehicle but should make it capable of coping with the subsequent incarnations of the auv with inevitably larger amounts of payloads and drag given its wide operating range the thruster could also be fitted to other vehicles reducing development costs and improving interoperability and maintainability to further improve the latter functionality the thruster has been designed to provide an easy attachment and detachment of the hub and blades with basic hand tools fast replacement of electronics with only a single seal having to be re done and straightforward mounting and removal from the vehicle by using external clamps the integrated electronics are designed to be controlled through the rs 232 serial protocol compatible with many contemporary underwater vehicle platforms adding to the interoperability of the thruster to improve in service reliability of the unit it has been designed to provide a high heat rejection rate from the transistors and other key electronic components the robustness of the thruster was also verified through endurance tests carried out in an environmental chamber at correct pressure and temperature corresponding to the ocean bottom conditions 3 methodology 3 1 test matrix three main sets of tests have been carried out on the thruster in order to quantify its performance in realistic design conditions 1 brake tests involved applying a known torque to the propeller shaft and measuring the power consumption over a range of rpm the results were used to estimate the net efficiency of the motor gearbox system as well as to validate the design of the magnetic coupling 2 bollard pull tests the thruster unit was held still and fixed rpm demands were sent to it thrust developed by each of the tested propellers total power consumption and blade tip deflection were measured 3 tests at speed power consumption and developed thrust were measured for each propeller at sprint and cruise speed equivalents for a range of rpm tare measurements with no propeller were also acquired to correct the data for each category of tests rpm values up to the maximum of 1000 were used except in cases where the resultant power output would exceed maximum output of the thruster there the maximum possible rpm was typically in the range between 900 and 1000 the presently tested propulsion unit was designed to work in ahead direction only moreover due to the propeller having the passive folding capability it could not be rotated in reverse with the vehicle moving ahead without folding consequently two forward advance speeds were chosen for the towed tests 0 13 and 0 44 m s these were aimed to replicate the mean nominal inflow speeds at cruise and sprint speeds of 0 25 and 1 00 m s at each speed measurements were carried out over a range of rpm starting from high loading and extending to slightly negative thrust coefficient regime wake fraction relating the two speeds was predicted using numerical simulations discussed by lidtke et al 2017 in reality the advance speed seen by the propeller at the cruise condition is expected to be 0 11 m s but it was not possible to achieve this value during the tests due to the limitations of the towing tank carriage system hence the nearest possible value was opted for in service this would translate to a vehicle speed of approximately 0 3 m s or 0 05 m s above target cruise velocity 3 2 experimental apparatus the present experiments were carried out at the southampton solent university towing tank this facility is 60 m long 3 7 m wide and 1 8 m deep these dimensions suffice for it to be used for sailing yacht and fast planing craft testing and were more than sufficient to carry out the current propeller tests without significant blockage effects the thruster unit was mounted in a hydrodynamic fairing made of acrylic and 3d printed elements the fairing was then connected to a 40 40 mm cross section rexroth beam at its upper end the beam was connected to a two component dynamometer placed on the towing tank carriage to minimise its resistance the vertical beam was also placed in a foam and plywood fairing in the final configuration the shaft axis of the propeller was placed 433 mm or 1 7 propeller diameters below the water surface this is greater than used for canonical propeller tests sva hydrodynamic solutions 2015 and hence was considered sufficient to minimise free surface interactions propellers were tested in a forward looking configuration as reliably emulating the full scale inflow conditions they would see in the wake of the vehicle was not feasible within the scope of the investigation it was therefore decided to focus on achieving the correct mean nominal inflow speed and reynolds number with clean undisturbed inflow conditions the neglected effect of thrust deduction i e change of hull resistance due to propeller suction was expected to be low due to the relatively low loading and associated pressure drop induced by the propeller the final test assembly is depicted in fig 5 the dynamometer used allowed the net axial and side forces acting on the test assembly to be measured the side force was only used to confirm accurate alignment of the thruster while the axial force included both the useful thrust of the propeller and the drag of the assembly voltage and current supply to the unit were also measured to estimate the consumed power while it would have been beneficial to also measure the propeller torque directly this could not be feasibly achieved while also testing the actual thruster unit without substantial modifications that were out of the scope of the current experimental campaign force data was non dimensionalised using a standard notation whereby the non dimensional speed or advance coefficient was computed as 1 j v a n d given the nominal inflow speed v a revolutions per second n and propeller diameter d the propeller thrust coefficient could then be computed using 2 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 1 where ρ was computed as a function of the measured tank temperature following the standard ittc values ittc 2011 this yielded density of 999 024 kg m 3 and kinematic viscosity of 1 125 10 6 m 2 s at 15 5 degrees centigrade although the propeller torque could not be directly measured the power consumed by the thruster and its rpm were as the motor gearbox efficiency was measured during the brake tests for a known rpm and absorbed power the motor performance curves could be interpolated to back calculate the torque delivered to the propeller the resulting value could be non dimensionalised 3 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 1 and open water efficiency computed 4 η 0 j k t 2 π k q it has been found that for lower speeds and rpm values this procedure was not accurate enough to yield reliable results due to the minimum resolution of the current transducer used however at higher revolutions the propeller torque and thruster power consumption were sufficiently high to be measured accurately yielding repeatable and consistent efficiency figures in order to measure the tip deflections of the propellers an underwater camera was mounted at the same depth as the shaft with the field of view overlooking the propeller plane its imagery was calibrated by placing a know size target where the propeller blades would be and computing a transfer function between the image pixels and distance by knowing the initial unloaded position of the blades tip deflection could be computed as shown in fig 6 with a more sophisticated set up it could be possible to carry out more precise measurements including full field deformation and blade twist banks et al 2015 however the present apparatus could only be reliably used to measure average deflections of the tip of the propeller as its estimated resolution was of the order of 0 2 mm resulting in approximately 3 5 pixels at the finest parts of the blade close to the tip which was insufficient to deduce more information furthermore the set up could only be used reliably in the bollard pull condition 3 3 data acquisition and processing in order to measure the forces deflection of the dynamometer was acquired using lvdt transducers which translate a linear displacement into a voltage signal that was recorded at a rate of 100 hz in order to obtain average signals data was windowed based on the moving average and standard deviation in order to select steady acquisition periods for most runs these lasted approximately 30 s with longer runs recorded deliberately for towed tests at the lower investigated speed this helped to improve signal to noise ratio and led to more reliable results only average power consumption of the thruster was recorded for each run using precision voltage and current meters in order to differentiate between the thrust of the propeller and drag of the test fairing tare drag measurements were carried out and their results were subtracted from the total acquired force to ensure the validity of the correction applied in this way each measurement was repeated three times to minimise the likelihood of non systematic errors tip deflection were computed using the open source kinovea software by tracking the position of the tip as it passed the measurement region for each rpm images acquired at 20 fps over a period of 10 s were processed and an average figure was computed 3 4 self propulsion estimation the measured open water propeller characteristics were compared against resistance data of the bridges glider auv reported in lidtke et al 2018 in order to determine the self propelled power and rpm this was done by assuming a given speed of the vehicle and computing thrust of the propeller for different rpm at that condition having accounted for the wake fraction w t modifying the inflow to the propeller this was determined using pitot tube measurements carried out alongside the force measurements and numerical simulations from lidtke et al 2017 an intersection point was then found at which thrust was equal to the resistance of the vehicle due to the fact that simulations with a propeller model were not carried out the effect of the action of the propeller on the resistance was neglected thus assuming thrust deduction of t 0 a safety margin of 50 was also applied to the thrust to account for possible uncertainty in the predicted resistance and propeller performance this was determined based on typical auv service data rudnick et al 2004 eriksen et al 2001 graver 2005 phillips et al 2010 thus the total propulsive efficiency could be estimated as 5 η t η 0 η h η r η m where η h 1 t 1 w t is the hull efficiency η r is the relative rotative efficiency assumed to be 1 due to low loading and small blade area ratio of the current propeller and η m is the motor gearbox efficiency 4 results 4 1 motor gearbox performance fig 7 presents the results obtained from the brake tests on the thruster it depicts the power delivered by the motor subject to constant torque across a range of rpm as well as its efficiency computed as a ratio of the useful power p o u t and absorbed electrical power p e 6 η m p o u t p e 2 π q n u s u p i s u p in the above u s u p is the supply voltage and i s u p is the current drawn from the power source tests were carried out at supply voltage level of 54 v measured data show that the variation in power follows the expected linear trend as judged from the relative fit quality of the linear regression curves this indicates that if the consumed electrical power and rpm may be accurately measured during the propeller tests the obtained motor performance can be used to calculate the torque developed by the propeller the results also show that the efficiency of the motor gearbox combination plummets as the applied torques become low mainly due to mechanical losses in the two stage gearbox overcoming the useful load furthermore at higher rpm the efficiency of the motor increases for the same torque and the performance curve is much flatter than when operating at lower revolutions per second highlighting the advantage of running the thruster close to its design power and rpm 4 2 bollard pull results of the bollard pull tests are depicted in fig 8 based on the basic propeller theory described by eqs 2 and 3 the thrust and power curves were expected to follow a quadratic and cubic trend with the shaft rate respectively however in both cases a deviation from this trend is observed at high revolutions as visible from comparing the measured data to linear trend lines fitted to the values obtained at lower rpm this deviation from the expected trend appears more pronounced for the propellers characterised by lower p d which produce less thrust but can reach higher rpm without the thruster reaching its maximum power it was suspected that the root cause of this was deformation of the propeller blades as loading is increased which prompted the deflection measurements presented in section 4 4 4 3 propeller performance at speed from the point of view of allowing an auv achieve self propulsion at the correct design speed the most critical information is the thrust developed by the propeller this information is presented in fig 9 for speeds corresponding to the cruise and sprint conditions data reveal an overall satisfactory repeatability obtained during repeat tests carried out over several measurement series one observation to the contrary are outliers seen at the lowest recorded j values for the tests corresponding to the sprint condition during those measurement runs the thruster reached its maximum power and likely could not achieve the desired rpm leading to a drop in thrust these points were therefore ignored when fitting the trend lines results indicate that as the advance speed increases the advance coefficient at which zero thrust is produced also goes up increasing the effective range of operation of the propeller increasing the speed also causes the thrust curves to deviate from a linear trend however for a fixed speed propeller theory would suggest a linear change of k t with j as seen in eqs 1 and 2 a rapid change in variation of thrust was also measured for the propeller with the highest pitch at lower speed changing the advance speed from 0 44 to 0 13 m s leads to a proportional reduction in propeller rpm for equivalent j values since the velocity seen by a blade section at non dimensional radial ordinate x may be written as 7 v r e f v a 2 2 π x r n 2 if propeller induced velocities are neglected to a first approximation it is expected that the local reynolds number experienced by it will also change this is explored in fig 11 which depicts local reynolds number for the tested propellers at x r of 0 7 or the location of nominal blade pitch this shows that between the two tested conditions re takes values of the order of 50 000 and 100 000 which corresponds to typical values at which laminar turbulent transition is observed selig et al 1995 this range of reynolds numbers has also been reported to cause significant performance variations in model scale ship propellers heinke et al 2019 li et al 2019 in order to better visualise the effect of changing reynolds number on the propellers thrust coefficient values of all for the investigated conditions are plotted simultaneously in fig 10 doing so shows that for the same propeller drastic changes are observed in the measured forward thrust between the two speed regimes j range for which positive thrust has been measured is extended by approximately 30 for all of the p d values when re is increased at lower speeds however the produced thrust is lower at the higher speed of advance thrust curves also show a steeper gradient as the propellers approach near bollard pull conditions due to very low torques developed by the propeller at the slower advance speed seen in fig 13 the resultant power consumption of the thruster did not differ significantly from the tare values measured with the hub spinning without the blades consequently efficiency of the propeller could not be accurately measured in this condition aside from data points close to the bollard pull condition for which relatively high torques were developed by the propellers at the higher speed however relatively repeatable results were obtained as seen in fig 14 the only deficiency in the latter data are the outliers appearing after the propeller had stalled these are however relatively unimportant from the point of view of vehicle propulsion in order to allow self propelled analysis at the lower advanced speeds regressed torque coefficient data obtained at the sprint condition was scaled by assuming most of the changes to k q would be related to the drag variation of the chosen blade section with reynolds number for the highest pitched propeller the relative change estimated based on the data obtained at low j values indicated a relative increase of k q of 32 and 55 for the lowest pitch with an approximately linear variation over tested p d values this is qualitatively consistent with xfoil see drela 1989 2d section data estimates seen in fig 12 which indicate a change in c d between 5 and 20 depending on the angle of attack discrepancy between the measured and expected values may be explained by inaccuracies in capturing transition effects using xfoil and presence of three dimensional effects despite the need to apply the afore mentioned assumptions the collected data indicate that as expected from propeller theory increasing the p d ratio leads to an increased efficiency and a wider range of viable j values however beyond p d 0 45 the observed increases are relatively small the maximum efficiency values predicted at the lower advance speed are also considerably lower 4 4 blade tip deflection in bollard pull fig 15 presents propeller tip deflections measured in bollard pull conditions data show that at low revolutions the amount of blade bending is relatively small compared to the propeller diameter reaching only 2 at rpm of 400 however beyond that point all of the tested blades show a sharp increase in the amount of bending reaching between 6 and 10 of diameter at highest rpm a trend is also seen whereby the higher the pitch of the propeller the more it deflects a relevant observation is also that albeit the measurement method used is relatively simple the variability of data is smaller than the trends observed in the results 4 5 predicted self propelled performance a final set of data is depicted in figs 16 and 17 which present self propelled operating points for the bridges auv predicted using the measured propeller performance curves and resistance data discussed in lidtke et al 2018 at the sprint condition the motor gearbox efficiency term is seen to be by up to 12 higher for the lower pitched propellers due to the self propelled rpm being higher this effect is offset by the propellers with higher p d exhibiting higher hydrodynamic efficiencies although this only occurs for pitch diameter ratios up to 0 45 at the cruise condition motor efficiency is by far the lowest component of total efficiency ranging between 10 and 20 and decreases with p d because of the associated decrease in rpm at self propulsion nevertheless the increase in propeller open water efficiency associated with higher pitch is also seen at this speed and offsets the small relative drop motor efficiency leading to the propellers with higher p d requiring less power at self propulsion however due to the dominant effect of the motor gearbox efficiency term at the lower speed the maximum net efficiency of the propulsive subsystem has been predicted to be only 7 compared to 38 at the design condition figures of total delivered electrical power also reveal that at the cruise condition a distinct optimum exists at p d of 0 45 at the higher speed this is not visible but that might be due to the relatively coarse offsets of the independent variable 5 discussion hydrodynamic efficiency of the tested propellers has been shown to vary significantly across the reynolds number regime spanning the expected operational profile of the bridges vehicle at lower advance speeds the blades were measured to produce more torque and less thrust which is consistent with the expectations derived from 2d foil section performance furthermore at lower advance speeds the propellers were observed to undergo stall at advance coefficients approximately 15 to 20 lower than at the investigated sprint condition this may be attributed to the presence of a dead zone in the lift coefficient curve around small angles of attack at low reynolds numbers these trends are also consistent with data reported by brandt and selig 2011 for aerial vehicle propellers tested in air at similar reynolds numbers the tested propellers were designed using blade element momentum theory bemt which is built upon integration of 2d section performance along the blade and thus should account for low re behaviour however the experimental results indicated that the propellers with lower p d suffered more loss of thrust at lower speeds than the initial analysis had indicated leading to worse overall efficiency the net propulsive efficiency has also been significantly affected by the variability of the combined motor gearbox efficiency with rpm and applied torque this has been shown to dominate the self propulsion efficiency at lower speeds favouring higher propeller revolutions above a minimum torque threshold in general this contradicts with the hydrodynamic requirements which push the propeller towards lower revolutions and higher pitch but this is also further affected by the non linear variations induced by the reynolds number blade deflection has also been shown to reduce thrust developed by the propellers as the advance coefficient is reduced this is tied to the loading on the blade and therefore becomes more significant at higher revolutions and advance speed when the net force developed by the propeller becomes higher similar trends were reported in the work by pawar and brizzolara 2019 who studied performance of a 3d printed conventional propeller in the case of the current propellers a critical rpm value of 500 has been identified in both thrust data and measured tip deflections as close to the optimum efficiency point propellers operate at relatively low load factors this phenomenon does not appear to affect the self propelled operating point significantly but might play a role in off design conditions or on vehicles such as hover type auv s or rov whose thrusters operate in near bollard pull conditions most of the time 6 conclusions presented results have shown that the final performance of the investigated thruster unit fitted with propellers of various pitch diameter ratios varies significantly with changing reynolds number thrust induced blade deformation and motor gearbox efficiency dependent on the chosen operating point it has been shown that the electromechanical efficiency may drop as low as 10 at slow advance speeds and at correspondingly low propeller revolutions and torque levels this loss of performance at low speed is further exacerbated by the decrease in hydrodynamic efficiency induced by the low reynolds number effects such as increased section drag coefficient and lower lift curve slope at low angles of attack thus all of the aforementioned factors have severe implications on the interplay of hydrodynamic and electro mechanical efficiencies governing the net propulsive efficiency nevertheless results have confirmed that despite a very wide operational profile required of the designed propulsor the same fixed pitch propeller may be used to actuate the vehicle in the design configuration while using less than 10 and 100 w e at cruise and sprint conditions respectively the ultimate validation of the thruster was achieved during the field trials of the bridges glider during which both the speed and power consumption requirements have been met moreover an upscaled version of the unit with a 600 w power rating is now also being deployed on the new a2kui under ice auv the experiments have also indicated that the adopted selective laser sintering sls 3d printing method allows for robust propeller blades to be rapidly manufactured this could be leveraged to quickly replace broken components at sea and even to adjust the propeller pitch depending on particular vehicle configuration if for instance much higher drag is expected due to the fitting of additional external payloads furthermore the measurements have indicated that hydro elasticity plays a significant role in governing performance of propellers manufactured using the selected method in the present study this phenomenon was treated as a constraint to be overcome however future applications could investigate harnessing blade deformation to better control performance of the propeller across different operating regimes for instance by exploiting bend twist coupling to passively adjust the pitch of the propeller to the current thruster set point consequently improving overall propulsive efficiency of the entire vehicle

20542,increasing demand for versatile and long endurance autonomous underwater vehicles puts significant design pressure on all aspects of auv design and operation including that of the propulsive system the present study discusses testing of a thruster unit and several propellers developed to propel a hybrid glider flight style underwater vehicle due to the auv being required to operate at largely different speeds and thrust levels between the two configurations the propulsive subsystem needs to be capable of remaining efficient and effective across a wide range of operating conditions thus the current results focus on quantifying all of the factors affecting the drive train ranging from open water performance of the propeller up to electro mechanical efficiency of the magnetic coupling and geared electric motor it is shown that depending on the required operating point total efficiency of the vehicle is primarily affected by non linear low reynolds number effects sudden drop of gearbox efficiency at low revolutions and applied torques as well as blade deformation aside of the baseline propeller efficiency keywords auv hydrodynamics propulsion 1 introduction underwater gliders are autonomous underwater vehicles auv that rely on using a buoyancy engine in order to ascend or descend through the water column by adjusting their pitch they can utilise this vertical motion in order to develop forward thrust from their hydrofoils this propulsion method allows them to undertake long endurance missions often many weeks long graver 2005 rudnick et al 2004 eriksen 2003 however their mode of locomotion renders their speed and rate of ascent susceptible to currents water density variations and hull compressibility this adversely affects their ability to perform measurements at a particular location as well as increases uncertainty errors associated with dead reckoning and localisation of the vehicle between gps fixes obtained at the surface furthermore being reliant on the buoyancy engine alone limits the types of missions gliders are able to perform for this reason several vehicles in use today employ small thruster units intended to provide an additional means of propulsion however they are used mostly for overcoming currents and maintaining steady rates of ascent or descent rather than to provide the ability to operate the vehicle as a conventional auv claus et al 2010 chen et al 2016 isa et al 2014 thrusters used on rovs or conventional auvs typically need to be operated over a wide range of conditions and inflow angles making even omni directional performance an important aspect of the design kim and chung 2006 allotta et al 2015 pugi et al 2018 present work discusses the design manufacture and testing of a thruster unit designed to provide secondary means of propelling the bridges http www bridges h2020 eu deep explorer underwater glider as well as allowing it to operate as a conventional flight style auv such a configuration of the vehicle is expected to enable a much wider operational envelope than either contemporary underwater gliders or propeller driven auvs design of the thruster had to balance several often conflicting requirements such as minimisation of drag while gliding efficient operation at very low thrust levels when assisting the glider being able to deliver sufficient power to propel the vehicle when it is to operate as a conventional auv as well as flexibility in matching power output to variable configurations and drag of the glider compared to ships the designed propellers are characterised by relatively low loading and small blade area ratio bar making them more akin to airborne drone propellers this is caused by relatively high rpm of the electric motors compared to diesel engines which poses practical limits on maximum blade area ratio due to maximum power output of the prime mover the necessity to operate in a wake field at much lower advance speeds and in a different medium cause the operational envelopes of the present and airborne propellers to differ significantly furthermore the required rpm and torque levels necessitate the use of a gearbox in the auv drive train introducing an additional efficiency term that needs to be understood and optimised for an efficient design developing a detailed understanding of the aforementioned effects and using that knowledge for the design of an effective propulsor is the key focus of the present study this is done through quantification of the motor gearbox efficiency towing tank experiments involving of a series of 3d printed propellers designed to deliver various levels of thrust and basic measurements of blade deformation under load 2 propulsion unit design 2 1 design requirements the designed propeller was required to deliver approximately 20 n of thrust which had been estimated based on wind tunnel measurements lidtke et al 2018 and numerical predictions lidtke et al 2017 the nominal wake fraction was estimated using cfd and yielded average nominal inflow speeds of 0 13 and 0 44 m s 1 for vehicle speeds of 0 3 and 1 0 m s 1 respectively these correspond to cruise and sprint conditions with the former also being representative of glide assist operation mode of the propeller large difference between the cruise and sprint conditions implied an equally wide range of thrust requirements and operating points thus while the key design point was taken to be the sprint condition in order to ensure the vehicle will be able to reach its desired speed consideration also had to be taken of the thrust developed at lower velocities the design was also further complicated by a maximum electrical power requirement of 10 w e at the cruise condition evaluating the degree to which this specification has been met necessitated careful accounting for the different flow conditions expected at that vehicle speed furthermore the interplay of hydrodynamic and electro mechanical efficiencies had to be taken into consideration to guarantee the endurance target of the vehicle would be met 2 2 propeller design naca 66 mod profile was selected for the propeller blades offsets of which are shown in fig 1 this blade profile is widely used on marine propellers due to its favourable cavitation avoidance and structural characteristics carlton 2012 while the former is not of concern here due to the vehicle typically operating at high static pressures the relatively thick trailing edge and large cross sectional area of the foil were deemed favourable due to the intention to manufacture the propeller blades using 3d printing preliminary design of the propeller was carried out using blade element momentum theory bemt molland et al 2011 due to its inexpensive nature a wide range of solutions could be evaluated while considering the effects of diameter pitch chord camber and number of blades hydrodynamic performance of each propeller was also assessed in conjunction with structural characteristics to ensure the designs could be feasibly manufactured following several design iterations using the numerical tools a target design was proposed with key parameters as depicted in fig 2 and table 1 a design pitch value of 0 35 was also selected however it was recognised that the used numerical tools might be prone to substantial prediction errors stemming from the difficulty of accurately accounting for the effects of laminar turbulent transition as a function of blade reynolds number surface roughness and onset turbulence levels it was also sought to measure performance of a range of propellers in order to provide a suite of choices for the vehicle operating with different payload configurations therefore a range of designs with the same other design parameters and constant pitch distributions but varying nominal pitch values were designed with p d of 0 25 0 35 0 45 0 55 and 0 60 this was done to evaluate the effect of changing angle of attack of the blade which was expected to have the most significant effect on the performance of the propeller in the expected operating regimes a rendering of one of the blade geometries is depicted in fig 3 a characteristic feature of the current design is its ability to unfold using rotational inertia and hydrodynamic moment developed by the tip of the blade this is facilitated by the root of the blade being mounted on a pin that allows free rotation and stopping elements on the hub which restrict the range of motion this should allow the propeller to exert a minimum drag augment on the vehicle when it is gliding but give it the ability to deploy the propeller with the rotational action of the shaft alone in order to allow the blade to develop a sufficient moment around the root relatively large pitch values and consequently angles of attack had to be adopted near the tip this is expected to reduce the efficiency of the blade but is a necessary sacrifice to meet the functional requirements without employing complex and potentially less reliable mechanical unfolding systems the unfolding ability was further enhanced by placing the pivot axis at an angle to the horizontal plane thereby increasing the pitch of the entire blade when folded selective laser sintering sls 3d printing using nylon 12 has been selected for making the blades this process has been successfully used on underwater vehicles before and offers a cost effective and flexible solution for manufacturing of complex shapes to improve surface finish of the manufactured blades and provide additional protection against moisture absorption the finished prints may also polished and dyed with little added cost or complexity the selected material is however characterised by lower strength and stiffness than for instance composite materials which are often used on aircraft propellers of similar size brandt and selig 2011 thus it has been found necessary to keep the minimum trailing edge thickness of at least 0 6 mm at the tip of the blade and 1 0 mm at the root in order to ensure satisfactory print quality and level of detail of the finished print furthermore the minimum blade thickness of 1 5 mm has been adopted to meet structural requirements these have been assessed using finite element analysis by prescribing a uniform pressure of 200 kg m 2 in the thrust direction which is an equivalent of load of approximately 100 n or five times the design thrust of the propeller the design was considered to meet the structural requirements if the maximum stress did not exceed 35 mpa which is the tensile strength of the material used a second criterion was also considered whereby an equivalent of design thrust was applied to the blade and it was ensured that the maximum stress does not exceed 10 mpa to avoid creep failure structural analysis results were also used to determine maximum deflection of the blade which for the extreme load case was estimated to reach up to 12 mm for some of the blade designs to compensate for this and protect against the blades impacting the upstream part of the vehicle a linear rake distribution was applied to the propeller this ensured that as long as the load on the blades remains within structurally feasible limits sufficient clearance will exist between the face of the propeller and the appendages it has been reported that accurate predictions of flow past flexible wings and propellers can be made by carrying out fluid structure interaction simulations which solve for both structural response and fluid loading simultaneously giovannetti et al 2016 2018 maljaars et al 2018 however such simulations were beyond the scope of the current investigation and would also require reliable validation data for rotating geometries which have proven difficult to obtain thus it was aimed to rely on the experimental results to quantify the effect of the blade deformation on performance 2 3 thruster design the thruster unit has been designed to operate safely at depths up to 6000 m to simplify installation and maintenance an early decision was taken to house the thruster in an air filled pressure vessel thus eliminating the need for additional oil compensator units this pressure vessel was manufactured from titanium grade 5 and pressure tested at the national oceanography centre the housing comprises of three segments housing the electronics the motorgearbox system and the internal part of the radial magnetic coupling as shown in fig 4 o ring seals are used between each cement of the housing but in practice only one of them needs to be opened for servicing due to all of the electronics being housed on a single easily detachable internal frame the use of a magnetic coupling transferring motor torque through the titanium housing eliminates the need for a shaft seal greatly increasing reliability the outer magnetic coupling runs in sea water with magnet units bonded into a titanium outer mandrel before being sealed within a cast polyurethane encapsulant also contained within the polyurethane is a steel keeper ring which by redirecting magnetic flux within the coupling increases the available torque transfer by around 40 for a given magnet set the complete outer coupling is mounted on ceramic water lubricated bearings and attached directly to the propeller assembly the chosen radial arrangement allows for a shorter design pugi et al 2018 than an axial one which was a major consideration from the point of view of the internal arrangement of the bridges glider it also allows the gap between the two sets of magnets to be minimised improving the torque capabilities of the coupling for the same number of magnets used allotta et al 2015 the thruster unit is designed to operate at a maximum output of 100 w with supply voltage of up to 60 v and maximum rpm of 1000 thanks to the use of a two stage 10 1 gearbox this makes it oversized for the needs of the current vehicle but should make it capable of coping with the subsequent incarnations of the auv with inevitably larger amounts of payloads and drag given its wide operating range the thruster could also be fitted to other vehicles reducing development costs and improving interoperability and maintainability to further improve the latter functionality the thruster has been designed to provide an easy attachment and detachment of the hub and blades with basic hand tools fast replacement of electronics with only a single seal having to be re done and straightforward mounting and removal from the vehicle by using external clamps the integrated electronics are designed to be controlled through the rs 232 serial protocol compatible with many contemporary underwater vehicle platforms adding to the interoperability of the thruster to improve in service reliability of the unit it has been designed to provide a high heat rejection rate from the transistors and other key electronic components the robustness of the thruster was also verified through endurance tests carried out in an environmental chamber at correct pressure and temperature corresponding to the ocean bottom conditions 3 methodology 3 1 test matrix three main sets of tests have been carried out on the thruster in order to quantify its performance in realistic design conditions 1 brake tests involved applying a known torque to the propeller shaft and measuring the power consumption over a range of rpm the results were used to estimate the net efficiency of the motor gearbox system as well as to validate the design of the magnetic coupling 2 bollard pull tests the thruster unit was held still and fixed rpm demands were sent to it thrust developed by each of the tested propellers total power consumption and blade tip deflection were measured 3 tests at speed power consumption and developed thrust were measured for each propeller at sprint and cruise speed equivalents for a range of rpm tare measurements with no propeller were also acquired to correct the data for each category of tests rpm values up to the maximum of 1000 were used except in cases where the resultant power output would exceed maximum output of the thruster there the maximum possible rpm was typically in the range between 900 and 1000 the presently tested propulsion unit was designed to work in ahead direction only moreover due to the propeller having the passive folding capability it could not be rotated in reverse with the vehicle moving ahead without folding consequently two forward advance speeds were chosen for the towed tests 0 13 and 0 44 m s these were aimed to replicate the mean nominal inflow speeds at cruise and sprint speeds of 0 25 and 1 00 m s at each speed measurements were carried out over a range of rpm starting from high loading and extending to slightly negative thrust coefficient regime wake fraction relating the two speeds was predicted using numerical simulations discussed by lidtke et al 2017 in reality the advance speed seen by the propeller at the cruise condition is expected to be 0 11 m s but it was not possible to achieve this value during the tests due to the limitations of the towing tank carriage system hence the nearest possible value was opted for in service this would translate to a vehicle speed of approximately 0 3 m s or 0 05 m s above target cruise velocity 3 2 experimental apparatus the present experiments were carried out at the southampton solent university towing tank this facility is 60 m long 3 7 m wide and 1 8 m deep these dimensions suffice for it to be used for sailing yacht and fast planing craft testing and were more than sufficient to carry out the current propeller tests without significant blockage effects the thruster unit was mounted in a hydrodynamic fairing made of acrylic and 3d printed elements the fairing was then connected to a 40 40 mm cross section rexroth beam at its upper end the beam was connected to a two component dynamometer placed on the towing tank carriage to minimise its resistance the vertical beam was also placed in a foam and plywood fairing in the final configuration the shaft axis of the propeller was placed 433 mm or 1 7 propeller diameters below the water surface this is greater than used for canonical propeller tests sva hydrodynamic solutions 2015 and hence was considered sufficient to minimise free surface interactions propellers were tested in a forward looking configuration as reliably emulating the full scale inflow conditions they would see in the wake of the vehicle was not feasible within the scope of the investigation it was therefore decided to focus on achieving the correct mean nominal inflow speed and reynolds number with clean undisturbed inflow conditions the neglected effect of thrust deduction i e change of hull resistance due to propeller suction was expected to be low due to the relatively low loading and associated pressure drop induced by the propeller the final test assembly is depicted in fig 5 the dynamometer used allowed the net axial and side forces acting on the test assembly to be measured the side force was only used to confirm accurate alignment of the thruster while the axial force included both the useful thrust of the propeller and the drag of the assembly voltage and current supply to the unit were also measured to estimate the consumed power while it would have been beneficial to also measure the propeller torque directly this could not be feasibly achieved while also testing the actual thruster unit without substantial modifications that were out of the scope of the current experimental campaign force data was non dimensionalised using a standard notation whereby the non dimensional speed or advance coefficient was computed as 1 j v a n d given the nominal inflow speed v a revolutions per second n and propeller diameter d the propeller thrust coefficient could then be computed using 2 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 1 where ρ was computed as a function of the measured tank temperature following the standard ittc values ittc 2011 this yielded density of 999 024 kg m 3 and kinematic viscosity of 1 125 10 6 m 2 s at 15 5 degrees centigrade although the propeller torque could not be directly measured the power consumed by the thruster and its rpm were as the motor gearbox efficiency was measured during the brake tests for a known rpm and absorbed power the motor performance curves could be interpolated to back calculate the torque delivered to the propeller the resulting value could be non dimensionalised 3 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 1 and open water efficiency computed 4 η 0 j k t 2 π k q it has been found that for lower speeds and rpm values this procedure was not accurate enough to yield reliable results due to the minimum resolution of the current transducer used however at higher revolutions the propeller torque and thruster power consumption were sufficiently high to be measured accurately yielding repeatable and consistent efficiency figures in order to measure the tip deflections of the propellers an underwater camera was mounted at the same depth as the shaft with the field of view overlooking the propeller plane its imagery was calibrated by placing a know size target where the propeller blades would be and computing a transfer function between the image pixels and distance by knowing the initial unloaded position of the blades tip deflection could be computed as shown in fig 6 with a more sophisticated set up it could be possible to carry out more precise measurements including full field deformation and blade twist banks et al 2015 however the present apparatus could only be reliably used to measure average deflections of the tip of the propeller as its estimated resolution was of the order of 0 2 mm resulting in approximately 3 5 pixels at the finest parts of the blade close to the tip which was insufficient to deduce more information furthermore the set up could only be used reliably in the bollard pull condition 3 3 data acquisition and processing in order to measure the forces deflection of the dynamometer was acquired using lvdt transducers which translate a linear displacement into a voltage signal that was recorded at a rate of 100 hz in order to obtain average signals data was windowed based on the moving average and standard deviation in order to select steady acquisition periods for most runs these lasted approximately 30 s with longer runs recorded deliberately for towed tests at the lower investigated speed this helped to improve signal to noise ratio and led to more reliable results only average power consumption of the thruster was recorded for each run using precision voltage and current meters in order to differentiate between the thrust of the propeller and drag of the test fairing tare drag measurements were carried out and their results were subtracted from the total acquired force to ensure the validity of the correction applied in this way each measurement was repeated three times to minimise the likelihood of non systematic errors tip deflection were computed using the open source kinovea software by tracking the position of the tip as it passed the measurement region for each rpm images acquired at 20 fps over a period of 10 s were processed and an average figure was computed 3 4 self propulsion estimation the measured open water propeller characteristics were compared against resistance data of the bridges glider auv reported in lidtke et al 2018 in order to determine the self propelled power and rpm this was done by assuming a given speed of the vehicle and computing thrust of the propeller for different rpm at that condition having accounted for the wake fraction w t modifying the inflow to the propeller this was determined using pitot tube measurements carried out alongside the force measurements and numerical simulations from lidtke et al 2017 an intersection point was then found at which thrust was equal to the resistance of the vehicle due to the fact that simulations with a propeller model were not carried out the effect of the action of the propeller on the resistance was neglected thus assuming thrust deduction of t 0 a safety margin of 50 was also applied to the thrust to account for possible uncertainty in the predicted resistance and propeller performance this was determined based on typical auv service data rudnick et al 2004 eriksen et al 2001 graver 2005 phillips et al 2010 thus the total propulsive efficiency could be estimated as 5 η t η 0 η h η r η m where η h 1 t 1 w t is the hull efficiency η r is the relative rotative efficiency assumed to be 1 due to low loading and small blade area ratio of the current propeller and η m is the motor gearbox efficiency 4 results 4 1 motor gearbox performance fig 7 presents the results obtained from the brake tests on the thruster it depicts the power delivered by the motor subject to constant torque across a range of rpm as well as its efficiency computed as a ratio of the useful power p o u t and absorbed electrical power p e 6 η m p o u t p e 2 π q n u s u p i s u p in the above u s u p is the supply voltage and i s u p is the current drawn from the power source tests were carried out at supply voltage level of 54 v measured data show that the variation in power follows the expected linear trend as judged from the relative fit quality of the linear regression curves this indicates that if the consumed electrical power and rpm may be accurately measured during the propeller tests the obtained motor performance can be used to calculate the torque developed by the propeller the results also show that the efficiency of the motor gearbox combination plummets as the applied torques become low mainly due to mechanical losses in the two stage gearbox overcoming the useful load furthermore at higher rpm the efficiency of the motor increases for the same torque and the performance curve is much flatter than when operating at lower revolutions per second highlighting the advantage of running the thruster close to its design power and rpm 4 2 bollard pull results of the bollard pull tests are depicted in fig 8 based on the basic propeller theory described by eqs 2 and 3 the thrust and power curves were expected to follow a quadratic and cubic trend with the shaft rate respectively however in both cases a deviation from this trend is observed at high revolutions as visible from comparing the measured data to linear trend lines fitted to the values obtained at lower rpm this deviation from the expected trend appears more pronounced for the propellers characterised by lower p d which produce less thrust but can reach higher rpm without the thruster reaching its maximum power it was suspected that the root cause of this was deformation of the propeller blades as loading is increased which prompted the deflection measurements presented in section 4 4 4 3 propeller performance at speed from the point of view of allowing an auv achieve self propulsion at the correct design speed the most critical information is the thrust developed by the propeller this information is presented in fig 9 for speeds corresponding to the cruise and sprint conditions data reveal an overall satisfactory repeatability obtained during repeat tests carried out over several measurement series one observation to the contrary are outliers seen at the lowest recorded j values for the tests corresponding to the sprint condition during those measurement runs the thruster reached its maximum power and likely could not achieve the desired rpm leading to a drop in thrust these points were therefore ignored when fitting the trend lines results indicate that as the advance speed increases the advance coefficient at which zero thrust is produced also goes up increasing the effective range of operation of the propeller increasing the speed also causes the thrust curves to deviate from a linear trend however for a fixed speed propeller theory would suggest a linear change of k t with j as seen in eqs 1 and 2 a rapid change in variation of thrust was also measured for the propeller with the highest pitch at lower speed changing the advance speed from 0 44 to 0 13 m s leads to a proportional reduction in propeller rpm for equivalent j values since the velocity seen by a blade section at non dimensional radial ordinate x may be written as 7 v r e f v a 2 2 π x r n 2 if propeller induced velocities are neglected to a first approximation it is expected that the local reynolds number experienced by it will also change this is explored in fig 11 which depicts local reynolds number for the tested propellers at x r of 0 7 or the location of nominal blade pitch this shows that between the two tested conditions re takes values of the order of 50 000 and 100 000 which corresponds to typical values at which laminar turbulent transition is observed selig et al 1995 this range of reynolds numbers has also been reported to cause significant performance variations in model scale ship propellers heinke et al 2019 li et al 2019 in order to better visualise the effect of changing reynolds number on the propellers thrust coefficient values of all for the investigated conditions are plotted simultaneously in fig 10 doing so shows that for the same propeller drastic changes are observed in the measured forward thrust between the two speed regimes j range for which positive thrust has been measured is extended by approximately 30 for all of the p d values when re is increased at lower speeds however the produced thrust is lower at the higher speed of advance thrust curves also show a steeper gradient as the propellers approach near bollard pull conditions due to very low torques developed by the propeller at the slower advance speed seen in fig 13 the resultant power consumption of the thruster did not differ significantly from the tare values measured with the hub spinning without the blades consequently efficiency of the propeller could not be accurately measured in this condition aside from data points close to the bollard pull condition for which relatively high torques were developed by the propellers at the higher speed however relatively repeatable results were obtained as seen in fig 14 the only deficiency in the latter data are the outliers appearing after the propeller had stalled these are however relatively unimportant from the point of view of vehicle propulsion in order to allow self propelled analysis at the lower advanced speeds regressed torque coefficient data obtained at the sprint condition was scaled by assuming most of the changes to k q would be related to the drag variation of the chosen blade section with reynolds number for the highest pitched propeller the relative change estimated based on the data obtained at low j values indicated a relative increase of k q of 32 and 55 for the lowest pitch with an approximately linear variation over tested p d values this is qualitatively consistent with xfoil see drela 1989 2d section data estimates seen in fig 12 which indicate a change in c d between 5 and 20 depending on the angle of attack discrepancy between the measured and expected values may be explained by inaccuracies in capturing transition effects using xfoil and presence of three dimensional effects despite the need to apply the afore mentioned assumptions the collected data indicate that as expected from propeller theory increasing the p d ratio leads to an increased efficiency and a wider range of viable j values however beyond p d 0 45 the observed increases are relatively small the maximum efficiency values predicted at the lower advance speed are also considerably lower 4 4 blade tip deflection in bollard pull fig 15 presents propeller tip deflections measured in bollard pull conditions data show that at low revolutions the amount of blade bending is relatively small compared to the propeller diameter reaching only 2 at rpm of 400 however beyond that point all of the tested blades show a sharp increase in the amount of bending reaching between 6 and 10 of diameter at highest rpm a trend is also seen whereby the higher the pitch of the propeller the more it deflects a relevant observation is also that albeit the measurement method used is relatively simple the variability of data is smaller than the trends observed in the results 4 5 predicted self propelled performance a final set of data is depicted in figs 16 and 17 which present self propelled operating points for the bridges auv predicted using the measured propeller performance curves and resistance data discussed in lidtke et al 2018 at the sprint condition the motor gearbox efficiency term is seen to be by up to 12 higher for the lower pitched propellers due to the self propelled rpm being higher this effect is offset by the propellers with higher p d exhibiting higher hydrodynamic efficiencies although this only occurs for pitch diameter ratios up to 0 45 at the cruise condition motor efficiency is by far the lowest component of total efficiency ranging between 10 and 20 and decreases with p d because of the associated decrease in rpm at self propulsion nevertheless the increase in propeller open water efficiency associated with higher pitch is also seen at this speed and offsets the small relative drop motor efficiency leading to the propellers with higher p d requiring less power at self propulsion however due to the dominant effect of the motor gearbox efficiency term at the lower speed the maximum net efficiency of the propulsive subsystem has been predicted to be only 7 compared to 38 at the design condition figures of total delivered electrical power also reveal that at the cruise condition a distinct optimum exists at p d of 0 45 at the higher speed this is not visible but that might be due to the relatively coarse offsets of the independent variable 5 discussion hydrodynamic efficiency of the tested propellers has been shown to vary significantly across the reynolds number regime spanning the expected operational profile of the bridges vehicle at lower advance speeds the blades were measured to produce more torque and less thrust which is consistent with the expectations derived from 2d foil section performance furthermore at lower advance speeds the propellers were observed to undergo stall at advance coefficients approximately 15 to 20 lower than at the investigated sprint condition this may be attributed to the presence of a dead zone in the lift coefficient curve around small angles of attack at low reynolds numbers these trends are also consistent with data reported by brandt and selig 2011 for aerial vehicle propellers tested in air at similar reynolds numbers the tested propellers were designed using blade element momentum theory bemt which is built upon integration of 2d section performance along the blade and thus should account for low re behaviour however the experimental results indicated that the propellers with lower p d suffered more loss of thrust at lower speeds than the initial analysis had indicated leading to worse overall efficiency the net propulsive efficiency has also been significantly affected by the variability of the combined motor gearbox efficiency with rpm and applied torque this has been shown to dominate the self propulsion efficiency at lower speeds favouring higher propeller revolutions above a minimum torque threshold in general this contradicts with the hydrodynamic requirements which push the propeller towards lower revolutions and higher pitch but this is also further affected by the non linear variations induced by the reynolds number blade deflection has also been shown to reduce thrust developed by the propellers as the advance coefficient is reduced this is tied to the loading on the blade and therefore becomes more significant at higher revolutions and advance speed when the net force developed by the propeller becomes higher similar trends were reported in the work by pawar and brizzolara 2019 who studied performance of a 3d printed conventional propeller in the case of the current propellers a critical rpm value of 500 has been identified in both thrust data and measured tip deflections as close to the optimum efficiency point propellers operate at relatively low load factors this phenomenon does not appear to affect the self propelled operating point significantly but might play a role in off design conditions or on vehicles such as hover type auv s or rov whose thrusters operate in near bollard pull conditions most of the time 6 conclusions presented results have shown that the final performance of the investigated thruster unit fitted with propellers of various pitch diameter ratios varies significantly with changing reynolds number thrust induced blade deformation and motor gearbox efficiency dependent on the chosen operating point it has been shown that the electromechanical efficiency may drop as low as 10 at slow advance speeds and at correspondingly low propeller revolutions and torque levels this loss of performance at low speed is further exacerbated by the decrease in hydrodynamic efficiency induced by the low reynolds number effects such as increased section drag coefficient and lower lift curve slope at low angles of attack thus all of the aforementioned factors have severe implications on the interplay of hydrodynamic and electro mechanical efficiencies governing the net propulsive efficiency nevertheless results have confirmed that despite a very wide operational profile required of the designed propulsor the same fixed pitch propeller may be used to actuate the vehicle in the design configuration while using less than 10 and 100 w e at cruise and sprint conditions respectively the ultimate validation of the thruster was achieved during the field trials of the bridges glider during which both the speed and power consumption requirements have been met moreover an upscaled version of the unit with a 600 w power rating is now also being deployed on the new a2kui under ice auv the experiments have also indicated that the adopted selective laser sintering sls 3d printing method allows for robust propeller blades to be rapidly manufactured this could be leveraged to quickly replace broken components at sea and even to adjust the propeller pitch depending on particular vehicle configuration if for instance much higher drag is expected due to the fitting of additional external payloads furthermore the measurements have indicated that hydro elasticity plays a significant role in governing performance of propellers manufactured using the selected method in the present study this phenomenon was treated as a constraint to be overcome however future applications could investigate harnessing blade deformation to better control performance of the propeller across different operating regimes for instance by exploiting bend twist coupling to passively adjust the pitch of the propeller to the current thruster set point consequently improving overall propulsive efficiency of the entire vehicle

20543,horizontal and vertical impact forces on a coastal bridge deck with girders due to asymmetric and nonlinear wave loads induced by the action of focused wave groups have been investigated using open source cfd model reef3d an extensive parametric study was conducted to investigate the variation of horizontal and vertical impact forces induced on bridge deck by steep focused waves results indicate that with increasing wave heights while the horizontal positive force increases the peak vertical uplift and downward forces decrease longer wave periods impart higher peak vertical uplift forces and horizontal positive forces the bridge deck location at still water level submerged and partially submerged cases are considered for the numerical study and the results are compared with the design formulae of american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto for both submerged and partially submerged scenarios aashto formulae were found to highly overestimate the peak horizontal impact forces for lower wave heights and they were found to give better results for higher wave heights in case of peak vertical impact forces aashto formulae highly underestimate for lower wave heights and moderately capture the peak vertical impact force at higher wave heights and airgaps keywords focused waves impact force coastal bridge deck cfd reef3d aashto formulae 1 introduction coastal bridge decks are subjected to wave impacts with the occurrence of extreme events like storm surges and tsunamis as the occurrence of these events have become more frequent due to climate change the impact forces on coastal bridges and its effects need in depth investigation the storm surge along with the waves are large enough to severely impact the bridge decks the damage of bridge decks affects transport hindering the rescue and relief operations during emergency large number of bridge damage cases are reported during the last decade due to the occurrence of tsunamis indian ocean tsunami 2004 great east japan tsunami 2011 and palu tsunami 2018 and storm surges katrina 2005 wilma and rita 2005 ika 2008 irma 2017 and michael 2018 which incur high repair expenses the wave impact on bridge decks induce both horizontal and vertical forces which include the forces due to buoyancy inertia drag and slamming for girder bridges the air entrapment between girders during the air water interaction also contribute to the impact forces experimental and numerical studies have been widely carried out to study the impact forces acting on the bridge decks these studies identified different structural and hydrodynamic parameters affecting the deck stability laboratory studies have been conducted in the early stage to analyse the impact forces acting on deck french 1969 performed experimental study on an elevated flat deck subjected to solitary wave impact and computed the varying impact pressures on the deck a similar study by suchithra and koola 1995 on a horizontal slab estimated the effect of air entrapment on wave slamming experiments were also performed on coastal bridge deck with girders hayatdavoodi et al 2014 guo et al 2015 and large scale testing of coastal bridges were executed by cuomo et al 2009 and bradner et al 2011 studies were executed on submerged decks hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 ertekin and hayatdavoodi 2015 fang et al 2018 and elevated decks with varying wave heights wave periods at different water depths the hydrodynamic forces due to real life tsunami loads on highway bridges are numerically investigated by qu et al 2019 using a coupled modelling system tsunami loads impinging on bridge superstructures are also numerically estimated by mesh free method like sph sarfaraz et al 2017 with the advancement of computational fluid dynamics cfd large scale numerical studies were also performed using commercial software packages ansys and star ccm and open source cfd models openfoam and reef3d using different numerical methods numerical modelling helps to investigate various complex aspects such as air entrapment effect of girders and airgap on the horizontal and vertical impact forces to reduce the air entrapment and the impact forces on bridge decks many studies have investigated the effect of air vents in reducing the vertical impact force azadbakht and yim 2016 seiffert et al 2015 qu et al 2017 different design formulae have been developed for regular and solitary waves to predict the impact force on bridges douglass et al 2006 mcpherson 2008 meng 2008 aashto 2008 the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto provides a set of equations to calculate the maximum vertical and horizontal forces during storm conditions these equations of aashto are compared with the maximum forces obtained using solitary and regular waves hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 azadbakht and yim 2016 a review conducted by hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2016 provided a detailed revision of all the theoretical formulations and investigations on the impact forces and air entrapment effect the extreme wave impact on bridge decks were studied by choosing representative events like tsunami and storm surge besides the extreme events due to weather conditions steep waves called freak or rouge waves usually dominant in deep water are also observed in shallow waters which are highly nonlinear various studies have been executed with solitary cnoidal waves seiffert et al 2014 hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 xu and cai 2017 hayatdavoodi et al 2019 qu et al 2020 and regular stokes waves cuomo et al 2009 azadbakht and yim 2016 however these waves do not represent the random sea state effectively solitary waves were used to model the long period tsunami waves but it is independent of the wave period and without the trough which is usually present in wave measurements during storm surges the regular waves fail to capture the random sea state during an extreme event in addition strong wind during storm surges escalates the wave height on top of surge and swell considering the above facts if an irregular wave train is used for the design approach it requires a lot of computational time and efforts a design approach using focused wave groups can thus be an alternative to the existing long duration irregular wave method this is of great benefit as the numerical or experimental tests can have good repeatability and the wave structure interaction can be modelled better focused wave groups have been successfully used in offshore for representing freak or rogue waves tromans et al 1991 ning et al 2008 but its applicability in shallow water to study the wave impact on coastal structures is limited this is because it is validated for intermediate and deep water where linear frequency dispersion is dominant and extreme wave profile is consistent the advantage of newwave is that the extreme wave profile is related to the properties of the sea state declared by significant wave height and peak wave period whittaker et al 2016 established the validity of the newwave generation in shallow water by comparing the second order corrected newwave profile with field measurements from buoy data recorded in the southwest of the uk the validation was done for the pre breaking waves during an extreme event and the comparison shows the ability of newwave to approximate the average shape of extreme wave profile the second order component in the newwave was given using stokes approximation ning et al 2008 for capturing the nonlinearity of steep waves sriram et al 2015 generated focused waves using linear and second order correction using schäffer 1996 and showed their applicability from deep to intermediate water depths the focused wave groups are generated in the coastal zone to capture run up overtopping hunt raby et al 2011 orszaghova et al 2014 whittaker et al 2018 and also to study the impact force on monopile ghadirian et al 2016 schløer et al 2017 focused wave group can thus be a preferred alternative to regular and irregular wave descriptions when structural reliability is the most important issue for the design approach this shows the scope of using extreme wave profile for the study of wave impact on coastal bridge deck the main objective of the present paper is to analyse the extreme wave impact on coastal bridge deck by the action of focused waves the effect of various parameters like peak wave period water depth and phase focusing on the generated focused wave profile and its impact on the bridge deck at different submergence depths are analysed the present paper generates the focused wave using newwave technique and its properties are analysed based on the maximum crest and trough heights at different water depths the nonlinearity induced by the steep focused wave and how it magnifies the wave structure interaction is analysed by comparing the impact forces at different wave heights the focused waves are generated with different phases i e crest and trough focused and its impact on the coastal bridge deck are analysed at different airgaps further the variability of extreme wave profile with the change in wave periods are also investigated and the variation of impact forces is estimated at different airgaps the impact forces obtained numerically are further compared to the design formulae of aashto the comparison of aashto results with regular wave cases was already done hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 azadbakht and yim 2016 and the present paper aims to see the performance of design formulations for the focused wave cases 2 numerical model 2 1 theory in this paper the focused wave impact on the coastal bridges with girders is investigated numerically using the open source cfd model reef3d bihs et al 2016 the numerical model solves the fluid flow problem using the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations eq 2 along with the continuity equation eq 1 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x j v v t u i x j u j x i g i where ρ is fluid density ν is kinematic viscosity ν t is eddy viscosity u is velocity averaged over time t p is the pressure and g is acceleration due to gravity turbulence is modelled using the k ω model with two transport equations the k ω model is a widely used empirical model and prominent alternative to the k ε model it is an empirical model based on transport equations for the kinetic energy and the turbulence frequency ω ε k the k ω turbulence model is generally used in cfd based numerical wave tanks in current literature such as lara et al 2012 higeura et al 2013 jacobsen et al 2011 investigated the difference between k ω and k ε turbulence models for breaking waves in their cfd model but reported there were no major differences hence this aspect is not investigated in this paper the definition of the eddy viscosity in the k ω model is ν t k ω and in the k ε model ν t c μ k 2 ε the quadratic term in the calculation of the eddy viscosity in the k ε model compared to the linear relationship in the k ω model is advantageous for numerical modelling aiding in stability in the simulation the numerical model reef3d used in this study has been widely validated using the k ω model by bihs et al 2016 the transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and the specific turbulent dissipation rate ω are given as 3 k t u j k x j x j v v t x j k x j p k β k k ω 4 ω t u j ω x j x j v v t σ w ω x j ω k a p k β ω 2 where p k is the production rate and closure coefficients are σk 2 σw 2 βk 9 100 β 3 40 and α 5 9 the kinematic viscosity contains the turbulent viscosity which is calculated from turbulent properties using the boussinesq approximation the density and kinematic viscosity have to be distinguished in two phases air and water following brackbill et al 1992 the differential equations representing the fluid flow is solved by discretizing the convective and time dependent terms the convective terms in the rans equation are discretized using fifth order weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme the time discretization is done using total variance diminishing tvd third order runge kutta explicit scheme the cfl courant frederick lew condition is used to maintain adequate time step and stability in explicit methods the projection method proposed by chorin 1968 is used to solve the pressure term in the navier stokes equation the staggered grid arrangement is implemented in the numerical model to achieve a strong pressure velocity coupling the level set method is employed in reef3d to model the free surface between the two phases considered in the present study phase 1 and 2 represent water and air respectively with an interface between the two layers fig 1 where the values are given as in eq 5 the interface thickness is given as 1 8 times the least mesh size a signed distance function called level set function captures the interface the interface movement is characterized by the convection of the level set function the motion of the free surface is captured by solving the linear advection equation with the fluid velocities convecting φ x t the property of the function is such that φ x t 0 at the interface first the level set function is defined based on the velocity magnitude u and is given as 5 φ x φ x u 1 0 φ x u 1 0 0 u 1 0 the level set function is maintained for moving interface by redistributing it at each time step for which partial differential equation pde based reinitialization technique is adopted the total wave force on the structure is computed by integrating the pressure p and the normal component of stress tensor τ over the surface ω of the structure eq 5 the integrated force is calculated at each time step for the individual cell surfaces which again depends on the cfl number and maximum velocity in the computational domain the equation used for computing the force is given as 6 f ω n p n τ d ω 2 2 focused wave generation the concept of the focused wave tromans et al 1991 ning et al 2008 was first developed for deep water to generate extreme waves from a specified frequency spectrum by superimposing several relatively small waves to form one focused extreme wave at a specified location and time this concept is then validated for intermediate water taylor and williams 2004 moideen et al 2020 and shallow water abroug et al 2020 whittaker et al 2016 in the present study focused waves are generated by superposing second order irregular waves schäffer 1996 the focused wave profile comprises both random and deterministic components representing the sea state the surface elevation is given by 7 η x t i 1 n a i cos k i x ω i t ϕ i the cosine term is set equal to one cos k i x ω i t ϕ i 1 so that at the focusing location and time ϕ i k i x t ω i t t substituting this value in equation 7 the surface elevation becomes 8 η 0 t i 1 n a i cos k i x t ω i t t t the amplitude of each wave component a i of frequency f i is defined as a i a s f i δ f i 1 n s f i δ f where 9 a 2 m o ln n the horizontal and vertical velocities of first order is given as follows 10 u u 1 i 1 n a i g k i ω i cosh k i z d cosh k i d cos k i x x 0 ω i t t 0 11 w w 1 i 1 n a i g k i ω i sinh k i z d cosh k i d sin k i x x 0 ω i t t 0 where z is the vertical coordinate measured upwards from the mean water level η is the instantaneous free surface elevation m o is the zeroth moment of input spectrum g is the gravitational acceleration d is the water depth k is the wave number s f i is the spectral density f is the frequency and ω is the angular frequency depending on the number of wave components n 25 the wave dispersion equation is valid and gives the relation between angular frequency and wave length a is the target theoretical linear wave amplitude of the focused wave x f and t f are the focusing location and time respectively where all the wave components in the non linear wave group is focused the phase angle ϕ is used for focusing the wave groups at the prescribed location and time resulting in crest focused wave ϕ 0 and trough focused wave ϕ π u and w represent the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively the subscript 1 denotes linear contributions of the above parameters the total wave elevation and velocity components u w in the new wave is obtained by superposing the linear and second order components as given below 12 η η 1 η 2 u u 1 u 2 w w 1 w 2 where η 1 u 1 and w 1 are the linear wave elevation and velocities respectively and η 2 u 2 and w 2 correspond to the second order wave elevation and velocities respectively 3 mesh sensitivity study and validation 3 1 numerical wave tank numerical wave tank nwt is modelled using reef3d providing suitable boundary conditions as shown in fig 1 for 2d cases minimum mesh size is considered as the width of the nwt the bottom of the tank is specified with wall boundary condition bc1 velocity inlet bc2 is used for wave generation and bc3 represents a symmetry plane for 2d nwt active wave absorption method is used for preventing reflected waves from affecting the wave generation in this method velocity of the waves are absorbed at the outlet or the reflected waves from the rear boundary are prescribed with the opposite sign to nullify them different types of wave generation and reflection analysis for different wave types using reef3d were conducted by miquel et al 2018 the active wave absorption boundary condition is implemented as follows assuming shallow water conditions within airy wave theory for 2d waves 13 u t g d ζ t 14 ζ t η t d where η t is the free surface elevation and d is the water depth the numerical wave tank is separated into two zones the wave generation zone and working zone fig 1 the length of wave generation zone and total nwt are considered as twice and five times the focused wave length respectively the waves are generated by focusing the irregular waves n 25 at a specific location x f and time t f the wave focusing location is given as one wave length from the wave generation zone courant number of 0 1 is chosen throughout the simulation the time step is not constant it varies depending on the maximum value of velocity in the computational domain the structure is located at different submergence levels or airgaps in the present paper airgap s is defined as the distance measured from the swl to top of the deck which is negative if the deck is submerged in water fig 1 3 2 model validation for wave and deck with girders interaction in the present study experiments conducted by seiffert et al 2014 and hayatdavoodi et al 2014 are considered as benchmark simulations for the validation of the numerical model seiffert et al 2014 and hayatdavoodi et al 2014 investigated the solitary wave loading on flat deck and deck with girders respectively with a model scale of 1 35 fig 2 representing coastal bridge structures and were tested in a wave flume located at the university of hawaii s hydraulics laboratory of the civil and environmental engineering department the impact force on flat deck was already validated using reef3d by moideen et al 2019 and impact force on deck with girders is considered for validation in the present section the experimental wave flume of 9 14 m length 0 152 m width and 0 39 m height are used for the 2d analysis seiffert et al 2014 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 a wave gauge was placed at a distance x 2 62 m from the wave maker to measure the wave elevation seiffert et al 2014 and the deck with girders hayatdavoodi et al 2014 is placed to quantify the impact forces the experiment hayatdavoodi et al 2014 was performed for different water depths with different submergence levels and wave heights the present study considers a scenario where a deck with six girders is located at the swl with zero submergence the solitary wave amplitude h 0 03431 to water depth d 0 114 m ratio of 0 301 is used to validate the numerical model a mesh sensitivity analysis is carried out first with different mesh sizes δx 0 025 0 01 and 0 005 m using a third order solitary wave with amplitude h 0 03 m the comparison between the numerical and theoretical wave height at x 4 m for different mesh sizes δx 0 025 0 01 and 0 005 m gives relative errors of 2 0 25 and 0 08 respectively fig 3 i this shows that the wave profile is captured with good accuracy using δx 0 01 and 0 005 m but a finer mesh size of δx 0 005 m is chosen for capturing the impact forces as the experimental tank considered is scaled to 1 35 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 with such small scaling the bridge deck has dimension less than 0 01 thus choosing mesh size of 0 005 m will be better in capturing the wave structure interaction the experimental condition considered for validation is simulated using the selected mesh size in the numerical wave tank the wave elevation measured at a wave probe location x 2 62 m in the experiment is compared with the numerical results from zone 1 fig 3 ii shows the comparison of numerical wave elevation profile with the experimental results of seiffert et al 2014 it can be seen that the wave profile is captured well by the numerical model the deck with six girders is then located at the distance x 2 62 m and the impact forces are computed at an airgap s 0 time series of the vertical and horizontal wave impact forces on the deck are then obtained by integrating the pressure acting on the structure at each time step the comparison of horizontal and vertical force time series with the experimental results is shown in fig 3 the horizontal fig 4 ii and vertical fig 4 i force peaks are captured well and the phase of the force time history also shows good match with the experimental results this demonstrates that the model can be further used for the investigation of wave impact on coastal bridge decks the numerical simulations were transacted with the k ω turbulence model where the impact force validation is done for deck located at swl the turbulence effects are more pronounced when the structure is placed above the swl and when the h d ratio is higher this is because the wave breaks on the deck when it is placed above the swl thus there will be differences in the impact forces especially in the peak horizontal impact force to demonstrate the effects with and without turbulence model three cases are simulated first case 1 with the deck placed at swl and h d 0 3 second case 2 when the deck is at an airgap s of 0 1384 m measured from the swl to top of the deck h d 0 3 and third case with airgap of 0 1384 m and h d 0 4 the horizontal impact forces for all three cases are compared with and without turbulence effects fig 5 shows the comparison of horizontal impact force with and without turbulence model for the three cases considered for cases 1 and 2 fig 5 i and ii the numerical simulations are compared with the experimental results of hayatdavoodi et al 2014 whereas for the case 3 fig 5 iii experimental results are not available for comparison the numerical simulations without turbulence model for the cases 1 2 and 3 overestimate the horizontal peak impact force by 0 9 9 and 26 respectively the results show that for steep and non linear focused waves with larger crest height and for decks located above swl the inclusion of turbulence model provides better results the results considered are for the first wave impact on deck and there is no sufficient time for the turbulence instability to build up larsen and fuhrman 2018 the force history for the two cases submerged and elevated shows good comparison the numerical model is further used for comparing the peak uplift and horizontal forces for varying airgaps s d 0 17 0 21 and 0 41 and wave heights h d 0 093 0 192 0 301 0 405 and 0 525 at a water depth d 0 114 m the results fig 6 state that the peak impact forces are well captured in comparison to the experimental results hayatdavoodi et al 2014 and the numerical model can be used successfully for further investigations 3 3 model validation for focused wave generation the present study considers highly non linear steep focused waves the focused wave generation and propagation using the numerical model reef3d is validated with the experimental results of ning et al 2009 the steepest focused wave case 4 of ning et al 2009 is considered for validation bihs et al 2017 has already validated the numerical model reef3d for lower steep waves case1 and case 2 of ning et al 2009 the amplitude of 0 10301 m with a wave period of 1 25 s as adopted in the experiment is considered in the numerical study this focused wave has a wave length of 2 18 m at a water depth of 0 5 m the focused wave is generated in a 15 m long 2d numerical wave tank at a focusing location of 7 m the focusing location is chosen different from the experimental case so the numerical results are moved in time to match the experimental results the focused wave is generated with different mesh sizes δx 0 05 0 025 0 01 and 0 005 m fig 7 shows the wave elevation comparison of the numerical results with the experimental results of ning et al 2009 using different mesh sizes mesh sizes of 0 01 m and 0 005 m capture the peak elevation with better accuracy whereas δx of 0 025 m and 0 05 m fail to capture the peak the percentage of accuracy is 0 2 higher for mesh size 0 005 m compared to mesh size of 0 01 m whereas the computational time increases more than twice considering a mesh size of 0 005 m thus a mesh size of 0 01 m is chosen and used for further simulations a scale of 1 10 is adopted for modelling the deck and wave properties 3 4 focused wave impact on flat deck the numerical model is validated for the interaction of breaking focused wave with the deck by comparing with the experimental results of wu and chang 2016 and details of their experiment is explained as follows the experimental study of wu and chang 2016 was simulated in a wave tank of 36 m in length 0 9 m in width and 1 5 m in depth located at the zachry department of civil engineering texas a m university the deck model used was a rigid flat plate with a length of 0 28 m and thickness of 9 53 mm at an airgap s of 0 05 m from swl in a water depth of 0 5 m bubble image velocimetry biv is used for capturing the turbulent velocity characteristics ryu et al 2005 from where the maximum horizontal and vertical velocities above and below the deck are derived the focused wave of height h 0 15 m and period t p 1 28 s were generated in the lab using superposition of linear waves with different wave periods the probes p1 p2 and p3 placed at 14 1 m 17 1 m and 21 5 m respectively in the experimental set up before and after the deck structure is considered for comparing wave elevation the experimental setup is replicated in the numerical domain as shown in fig 8 the focused breaking wave h 0 15 m and t p 1 28 s is numerically generated by focusing irregular wave groups at a given space and time using the jonswap spectrum mesh size dx of 0 01 m is used throughout the computational domain the generated focused wave in the nwt propagates to hit the rigid structure the wave probes were located at the same positions with respect to the deck as that of the experimental set up to capture the wave elevations whereas the maximum horizontal and vertical velocities below and above the deck are derived using point probes the wave elevations and velocities measured at probe locations height and point probes in the numerical wave tank are compared with the experimental results of wu and chang 2016 it is observed that the focused wave of height 0 15 m was generated in the nwt and the wave elevations near to the structure at different probe locations are comparable with the experimental results even though variation is seen in the initial wave heights fig 9 i ii and iii the velocity variation fig 9 iv is plotted with respect to time by using point probes in the breaking zone of the nwt and the maximum resultant velocity is compared with the experimental result the resultant velocity also shows good comparison and proves that the numerical model can well capture the turbulent velocity characteristics the slight variations between the experiment and numerical results are because of the difference in techniques used in wave generation and velocity measurement the numerical model is also validated with experimental results of ghadirian et al 2016 for focused wave impact on monopile structure wave elevation and inline force using reef3d by moideen et al 2020 the validations show the applicability of the numerical model in capturing the focused wave impact and further used for carrying out the parametric study 4 results and discussion 4 1 generation of steepest focused wave for varying significant wave height and water depth the focused waves are generated in the numerical wave tank by specifying the significant wave height h si and peak wave period t p as inputs the wave profiles are generated using jonswap spectrum for k p d values less than 0 6 where k p is the wave number corresponding to the peak wave period t p the focused waves are generated at four different water depths d 0 45 0 4 0 35 and 0 3 m with input significant wave height to water depth ratios h si d ranging from 0 2 to 0 4 table 1 the wave elevation time history figs 10 and 11 is plotted with the wave elevation η normalized with the water depth d and the time t normalized with the wave focusing time t f fig 10 shows focused wave elevation characteristics crest and trough elevation for a wave elevation time history at water depth d 0 45 m the maximum crest height η c trough height η t and the maximum wave height h m for h si d 0 4 at water depth of d 0 45 m are marked in fig 10 the variation of wave profiles at h si d 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 for water depth d 0 4 m are shown in fig 11 i the wave profile becomes steeper with increase in crest height as the h si d ratio increases from 0 2 to 0 4 the normalized wave elevation plotted for h si d 0 4 fig 11 ii for all water depths shows that normalized crest height is higher for lowest water depth d 0 3 m the maximum crest height η c trough height η t and wave height h m are measured for all the wave profiles generated and the ratio of η c h m and η t h m are calculated and tabulated in table 1 the η c h m value ranges from 0 67 to 0 68 and η t h m value ranges from 0 32 to 0 33 for all the water depths when the h si d ratio reaches 0 4 the obtained values are in good agreement with the averaged wave profiles obtained by whittaker et al 2016 from different buoy locations during real storm conditions the averaged wave records at the buoy locations in whittaker et al 2016 are as follows η c h m 0 6 0 65 and 0 7 and η t h m 0 3 0 35 and 0 32 this shows the applicability of focused waves in representing extreme waves as the focused waves replicated the average wave profiles during storm in terms of the crest and trough height these waves are further used for computing the impact forces acting on the bridge deck at different airgaps 4 2 focused wave impact on deck the variation of focused wave impact forces on coastal deck at different airgaps is presented in this section the focused waves generated in the above section with increasing h si d ratio from 0 2 to 0 4 at different water depths and airgaps fig 12 are considered for investigating the impact forces the coastal deck chosen has five girders with length of l 28 m and width of b 11 m modelled to a scale of 1 10 different airgaps are chosen such that the bridge deck is fully submerged at the still water level and partially submerged the airgaps considered are 0 03 0 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 m from the swl and are normalized with the water depth s d the focused wave impact induces both horizontal and vertical impact forces on the deck structure the horizontal impact force can be divided into positive in the wave direction and negative opposite the wave direction components whereas the vertical force is divided into uplift positive z direction and downward negative z direction vertical components the impact forces are normalized with a factor 1 ρ g h m a where a is the deck area a can be replaced with a h for projected area in horizontal plane and a v for projected area in vertical plane to compute the vertical and horizontal impact forces respectively the maximum forces include the impact force as well as the hydrostatic force due to the surge the variation of peak vertical uplift and downward and horizontal positive and negative impact forces with respect to the normalized airgap is presented in fig 13 for water depth of d 0 45 m the peak vertical uplift force normalized with maximum wave height h m is higher for h si d 0 2 compared to h si d 0 3 and 0 4 fig 13 i this shows that with increasing normalized wave height the normalized vertical impact force is reduced in case of peak vertical downward force fig 13 ii h si d 0 3 and 0 4 gives higher negative downward vertical force compared to h si d 0 2 the peak horizontal positive force fig 13 iii is higher for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 compared to h si d 0 2 whereas the peak horizontal negative force fig 13 iv is higher for h si d 0 2 the horizontal positive force shows a different trend compared to the peak vertical uplift force for different h si d fig 13 ii the normalized peak horizontal positive force increases with increase in h si d ratio which shows that the wave height has significant contribution to the horizontal positive force whereas the horizontal negative force reduces with increase in h si d the peak horizontal positive and vertical uplift forces are the major forcing and its variations for increasing wave heights at four different water depths are presented in figs 14 and 15 respectively the horizontal positive impact force normalized with maximum wave height at different water depths for increasing h si d ratio of 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 fig 14 increases with increasing wave height also the peak horizontal positive force displays a large increase from h si d 0 2 to h si d 0 3 the peak vertical uplift forces fig 15 are higher for lower wave heights compared to higher wave heights the trends for the three h si d ratios show that the impact force variation is higher for h si d 0 2 at lower s d ratios s d 0 to 0 15 compared to h si d 0 3 and 0 4 this indicates that increase in vertical uplift force is not linearly dependent on the wave height but depends on the airgaps as well the variation of peak vertical uplift force fig 13 i is less significant for normalized airgaps s d 0 09 0 and 0 06 as the wave undergoes less deformation and the force time history is smoother as the s d increases resulting in gap between the deck and the swl the wave breaking occurs and larger variation in peak vertical uplift force is observed figs 16 and 17 show the interaction of the focused wave h si d 0 4 with the deck at different time steps showing velocity variation for s d 0 09 and 0 17 respectively figs 18 and 19 show the force time history at different structure locations s d ratios for h si d 0 2 and 0 4 for the submerged case with s d 0 09 fig 16 i shows the focused wave crest approaching the deck t t f 0 97 and the force time history fig 19 i shows an increase of vertical uplift force from t t f 0 95 then the wave crest impacts the deck at t t f 0 99 fig 16 ii and the crest overturns fig 16 iii and hits the top of the deck fig 16 iv variation of the vertical and horizontal impact force during these time steps are shown in fig 19 i and 19 ii the vertical impact force time history gives the peak at t t f 1 fig 19 i whereas the horizontal impact force time history fig 19 ii gives the peak after t t f 1 a similar vertical and horizontal force time history fig 19 iii and iv is obtained for the structure located at swl at t t f 1 03 and 1 07 fig 16 v and vi the wave is distributed on the top of the deck and starts leaving the deck fig 16 vii the force time history shows a reduction in vertical uplift force fig 19 i and a negative horizontal impact force fig 19 ii at these time steps for the partially submerged case with s d 0 17 the focused wave impacts the deck sides fig 17 i and the gap inside the chambers gets filled fig 17 ii the wave impacting on the deck side rises to the top of the deck fig 17 iii and at the same time t t f 1 the water leaves the chambers starting from the last girder at t t f 1 04 water gets redistributed fig 17 v and vi on the top of the deck and leaves the deck and chambers fig 17 vii reducing the force the time history of the vertical uplift force fig 19 v shows a sudden increase in impact force unlike for the submerged case at t t f 1 also as the vertical impact force is reduced there are fluctuations in the force time history compared to the submerged and at swl cases the horizontal force time history fig 19 vi also shows a sudden increase and decrease within short time span for s d 0 11 compared to s d 0 and 0 09 for s d 0 11 the structure is above swl and the wave elevation is above the deck level at this point the wave breaks on the structure and the broken wave also interact with the structure resulting in multiple peaks in the horizontal force vertical profile of pressure and the velocity distribution horizontal velocity u and vertical velocity w above the swl during the focused wave interaction with the structure is measured using probes z 1 z 2 z 12 located close to the structure one mesh size gap as shown in fig 11 the celerity used for normalizing pressure and velocity is calculated using linear dispersion relation the normalized peak pressure values with stagnation pressure varying along the vertical z direction from the swl during the wave structure interaction for different normalized airgap positions s d 0 0 06 0 1 0 17 0 23 are depicted in fig 20 the peak pressure value attains maximum magnitude at swl for an airgap of s d 0 11 and 0 17 and reduces along the positive z direction the time history of the pressure variation at the swl when the structure is placed at normalized airgap of s d 0 and 0 11 is shown in fig 22 iii the peak pressure is observed at t t f 1 just before impacting the structure and a fluctuation around the peak pressure is observed with the wave breaking the peak horizontal and vertical velocity normalized with celerity during the focused wave impact on deck placed at different normalized airgaps s d 0 0 06 0 11 0 17 0 23 are shown in fig 21 variation of normalized peak vertical and horizontal velocity is plotted along the vertical z direction above the swl the peak horizontal velocity fig 21 i is increasing above the swl as the wave approaches the deck and the focused wave crest runs up in front of the deck for the case of peak vertical velocity the velocity is increasing above the swl when the structure is placed at s d 0 11 0 17 and 0 22 but for s d 0 and 0 06 the vertical velocity decreases along the vertical direction this is because when the structure is placed just above and at the swl the wave hits the structure with increased velocity and energy is retarded further upwards but when the structure is located at a higher level the focused wave crest builds up and velocity profile represents an increase in the vertical direction variation of vertical and horizontal velocity with respect to time are shown in fig 22 i and ii respectively the vertical velocity is showing a higher peak than the horizontal velocity and the vertical velocity time history shows a sudden peak slamming and then positive and negative quasi static force magnitudes the nonlinear behaviour is seen for the velocity and pressure when the structure is located above the swl as the wave breaks on the structure 4 3 effect of wave period on focused wave impact in this section variation of the focused wave profile with three different peak wave periods t p 1 5 2 and 2 5 s and two different significant wave height h si d 0 3 and 0 4 are presented variation of the vertical and horizontal wave loads on the structure with the three different wave periods for different airgaps is discussed fig 23 shows the wave profile for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 considering three different peak wave periods t p 2 5 2 and 1 5 s the wave profile at h si d 0 4 fig 23 ii shows difference in the crest elevation with the difference in peak wave period compared to h si d 0 3 fig 23 i the effect of wave period on impact forces are analysed the peak vertical uplift force for h si d 0 3 are found to be 13 higher for t p 1 5 s compared to t p 2 and 2 5 s but for h si d 0 4 the peak vertical impact force is 13 higher for t p 2 5 s compared to t p 1 5 s it is observed that a higher peak wave period generates higher maximum wave height resulting in higher vertical uplift forces the downward vertical force does not show large variation for varying wave periods and wave heights fig 24 ii and 25 ii the peak horizontal positive force fig 24 iii and fig 25 iii is higher for t p 2 5 s and reduces with the airgap the peak negative horizontal impact force is found to be higher at t p 1 5 s for h si d 0 3 fig 24 ii and fig 24 iv and at t p 2 0 s for h si d 0 4 fig 25 ii and fig 25 iv the horizontal negative impact force shows considerable variation with a change in wave period and increase in wave height from h si d 0 3 to 0 4 fig 24 iv and fig 25 iv 4 4 phase effect of focused wave on impact force variation of impact load with change in phase crest focused and trough focused of the focused wave for two different wave heights are estimated in the present section the focused waves are generated by focusing a number of waves n at the same location and time two significant wave heights h si d 0 3 and 0 4 and a single wave period t p 2 5 s are considered as input for generating focused waves the crest and trough are focused by giving the phase values of zero and π respectively variation of wave profile using crest and trough focused conditions for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 are plotted in fig 26 the crest height of the crest focused wave has a significant increase in wave height compared to the trough height of the trough focused wave as h si d varies from 0 3 to 0 4 the peak vertical and horizontal impact forces for the crest and trough focused waves are compared in figs 27 and 28 for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 respectively the peak vertical uplift figs 27 i and fig 28 i force is comparable for both crest and trough focused waves whereas the impact force varies with the airgap positions trough focused waves gives lower uplift vertical impact force compared to the crest focused waves for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 at lower airgaps whereas trough focused impact forces have higher peaks with increase in airgap fig 27 i it can be seen that both crest and trough focused waves give similar peak vertical uplift forces at different airgaps in fact the trough focused wave impact has contribution from the trailing crest behind the trough focused wave the downward vertical impact force fig 27 ii and fig 28 ii is giving higher peak for crest focused waves for both h si d 0 3 and 0 4 the peak horizontal positive impact force is higher for the crest focused wave than the trough focused wave for both h si d 0 3 and 0 4 fig 27 iii and fig 28 iii the negative horizontal impact forces fig 27 iv and fig 28 iv are higher for trough focused waves for both h si d 0 3 and 0 4 4 5 design formulations comparison and discussion american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto has prescribed design formulae for computing the vertical and horizontal impact forces on coastal bridge decks these formulae were used to compute the forces on both fully submerged and elevated decks subjected to regular solitary and stokes waves kulicki 2010 hayatdavoodi et al 2019 azadbakht and yim 2016 in the present study applicability of the aashto formulae for computing the focused wave impact forces on coastal bridge decks were examined this is done by comparing the focused wave impact forces obtained numerically with the aashto formulations fig 29 shows variation of the horizontal impact force at different airgaps and four different water depths for increasing h si d ratios for h si d 0 2 aashto formulae were underestimating the horizontal impact force compared to the numerical model results for s d less than 0 1 beyond which it is highly overestimating contrary to the continuous increasing profile of aashto forces the numerical model results show an increase up to s d 0 12 and then reduces similarly for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 the model results show an increase up to s d 0 1 0 15 aashto underestimates and then reduces aashto overestimates for the present submerged and partially submerged scenarios the peak horizontal impact forces are underestimated up to 2 to 3 times by the aashto formulations up to s d 0 1 0 15 and for higher airgaps aashto formulae overestimates up to 7 times generally aashto formulae highly overestimate for lower wave heights h si d 0 2 and moderately overestimate for higher wave heights h si d 0 3 and 0 4 the vertical impact force variation with the airgaps for four different water depths and varying h si d ratios are shown in fig 30 for h si d 0 2 the aashto formulae underestimate the peak vertical impact forces compared to the numerical results for different airgaps considered for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 the aashto formulae overestimates the impact force up to a factor of 3 4 for the airgap up to s d 0 05 for airgaps s d 0 1 0 2 peak vertical impact forces are underestimated by the aashto formulae on an average of 5 40 for h si d 0 3 whereas the peak vertical impact forces are overestimated on an average of 9 12 for h si d 0 4 generally the aashto formulae highly underestimate the peak vertical impact force for lower wave height h si d 0 2 and moderately captures the peak vertical impact force for higher wave heights h si d 0 3 and 0 4 and airgaps s d 0 1 and 0 2 4 6 estimation of force coefficients based on varying airgap and wave height the present investigation of non breaking focused wave impact on deck structures shows that the peak horizontal and vertical impact forces are dependent on both airgap and wave height the results obtained in the present study are used to derive force coefficients for both horizontal and vertical impact forces based on coastal engineering manual cem the impact forces are calculated by the reference equation given by coastal engineering manual usace 2011 for emergent structures where the force coefficients are derived based on laboratory experiments the reference equation given in eq 13 is obtained by integrating the pressure over the surface of the emergent structure to compute the forces but neglected the effect of airgap 15 f h c u a z γ w u 2 2 g f v c u a n γ w w 2 2 g where c u is the laboratory derived coefficient a n and a z are the projected area in horizontal plane and vertical plane respectively u and w are horizontal and vertical velocities at level of object γ w is specific weight of water the non breaking focused waves are generated with increasing h si d ratio from 0 2 to 0 4 at different water depths d 0 3 0 35 0 4 and 0 45 m to investigate the impact forces acting on coastal deck at different airgaps the airgaps s 0 03 0 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 m normalized with maximum wave height h m are chosen such that the deck is fully submerged at the still water level and partially submerged when the wave hits the structure a sudden change in particle velocities is observed both in horizontal and vertical direction making it difficult to choose reference horizontal and vertical velocities to derive the respective coefficients hence unlike cem reference equation where u w are used for computing the horizontal and vertical wave forces wave celerity c obtained from wave dispersion relation is used for deriving peak impact force coefficients the revised formulations for horizontal and vertical force coefficients for non breaking focused wave impact are given as 16 c h f h 0 5 ρ a v c 2 c v f v 0 5 ρ a h c 2 the variation of force coefficients with respect to varying s h m ratios show a large scatter as seen in figs 31 and 32 the horizontal impact force coefficients for h si d 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 vary in the range of 0 7 3 2 2 8 6 8 and 2 8 7 2 respectively similarly the vertical force coefficients for h si d 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 vary in the range of 0 9 7 0 1 0 8 9 and 1 1 8 8 respectively it is observed that the horizontal force coefficients for h si d 0 2 is much less compared to h si d 0 2 hence three data sets are considered one for h si d 0 2 0 2 h si d 0 3 and other for h si d 0 2 and analysed to derive force coefficient formulations similarly for vertical force coefficients two data sets are considered one for h si d 0 2 and other for h si d 0 2 and analysed to derive force coefficient formulations at lower s h m the increase in force coefficient value is not significant however slight further increase in the s h m results in very high force coefficients hence to arrive at a conservative estimation peak values are considered for deriving the coefficients the force coefficients can be further used for larger wave heights and airgaps in the limits of h si d ratios linear regression is carried out for the data sets and best fit curves representing peak impact forces are plotted in figs 31 and 32 the best fit polynomials for horizontal and vertical force coefficients for non breaking focused wave impact are given in equations 15 and 16 respectively equation 15 gives the peak horizontal impact force where the projected vertical area a v is the length of the bridge multiplied by total height of bridge deck thickness height of girder also for peak vertical impact force in equation 16 the horizontal projected area a h is obtained by multiplying the length of the bridge with the first chamber width which is the total width divided by number of girders the relationship between the horizontal and vertical force coefficient with varying airgap and wave height is given as follows horizontal force

generated in the numerical wave tank 5 conclusions impact forces due to focused wave loads for varying airgaps wave periods wave heights and phases are numerically modelled and discussed through a parametric study the focused wave impact forces obtained from the numerical model are compared with the design formulae given by aashto following conclusions are drawn from this study behavior and characteristics of focused waves at different water depths shows that an extreme wave profile is generated at a significant wave height to water depth ratio of 0 4 without any wave breaking the focused wave crest to the maximum wave height for the wave profiles ranges from 0 67 to 0 68 whereas the focused trough height to maximum wave height ranges from 0 3 to 0 32 peak vertical uplift and downward forces are higher for lower wave heights compared to larger wave heights the peak vertical uplift force induced by focused wave impact is found to be higher for partially submerged decks than the fully submerged decks the peak horizontal positive impact force increases with the increase in wave height whereas the negative horizontal force reduces with increase of wave height higher peak wave periods of focused waves impose higher vertical uplift forces whereas the effect on downward vertical force is not significant the peak horizontal positive force is higher for increasing peak wave period and wave height whereas the peak negative horizontal force is higher for lower peak wave period and wave height both crest and trough focused waves with different phases impose similar peak vertical uplift force for different airgaps whereas the peak horizontal positive force is higher for crest focused waves the downward vertical force has no significant change with crest and trough focused waves whereas the negative horizontal force is higher for trough focused waves the peak horizontal impact force computed using aashto formulae is found to be highly overestimated for lower wave heights and moderately overestimated for higher wave heights when compared with the focused wave impact results obtained from the numerical model the aashto formulae highly underestimate the peak vertical impact force for lower wave heights and moderately captures the peak vertical impact force at higher wave heights and airgaps when compared to the focused wave results obtained from the numerical model the extreme wave impact on coastal deck structures is better represented using the focused wave simulations the force coefficients are derived for peak vertical and horizontal impact forces in relation with varying wave heights and airgaps for non breaking focused wave impact that will be useful for practical applications and practicing engineers funding the first author

20543,horizontal and vertical impact forces on a coastal bridge deck with girders due to asymmetric and nonlinear wave loads induced by the action of focused wave groups have been investigated using open source cfd model reef3d an extensive parametric study was conducted to investigate the variation of horizontal and vertical impact forces induced on bridge deck by steep focused waves results indicate that with increasing wave heights while the horizontal positive force increases the peak vertical uplift and downward forces decrease longer wave periods impart higher peak vertical uplift forces and horizontal positive forces the bridge deck location at still water level submerged and partially submerged cases are considered for the numerical study and the results are compared with the design formulae of american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto for both submerged and partially submerged scenarios aashto formulae were found to highly overestimate the peak horizontal impact forces for lower wave heights and they were found to give better results for higher wave heights in case of peak vertical impact forces aashto formulae highly underestimate for lower wave heights and moderately capture the peak vertical impact force at higher wave heights and airgaps keywords focused waves impact force coastal bridge deck cfd reef3d aashto formulae 1 introduction coastal bridge decks are subjected to wave impacts with the occurrence of extreme events like storm surges and tsunamis as the occurrence of these events have become more frequent due to climate change the impact forces on coastal bridges and its effects need in depth investigation the storm surge along with the waves are large enough to severely impact the bridge decks the damage of bridge decks affects transport hindering the rescue and relief operations during emergency large number of bridge damage cases are reported during the last decade due to the occurrence of tsunamis indian ocean tsunami 2004 great east japan tsunami 2011 and palu tsunami 2018 and storm surges katrina 2005 wilma and rita 2005 ika 2008 irma 2017 and michael 2018 which incur high repair expenses the wave impact on bridge decks induce both horizontal and vertical forces which include the forces due to buoyancy inertia drag and slamming for girder bridges the air entrapment between girders during the air water interaction also contribute to the impact forces experimental and numerical studies have been widely carried out to study the impact forces acting on the bridge decks these studies identified different structural and hydrodynamic parameters affecting the deck stability laboratory studies have been conducted in the early stage to analyse the impact forces acting on deck french 1969 performed experimental study on an elevated flat deck subjected to solitary wave impact and computed the varying impact pressures on the deck a similar study by suchithra and koola 1995 on a horizontal slab estimated the effect of air entrapment on wave slamming experiments were also performed on coastal bridge deck with girders hayatdavoodi et al 2014 guo et al 2015 and large scale testing of coastal bridges were executed by cuomo et al 2009 and bradner et al 2011 studies were executed on submerged decks hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 ertekin and hayatdavoodi 2015 fang et al 2018 and elevated decks with varying wave heights wave periods at different water depths the hydrodynamic forces due to real life tsunami loads on highway bridges are numerically investigated by qu et al 2019 using a coupled modelling system tsunami loads impinging on bridge superstructures are also numerically estimated by mesh free method like sph sarfaraz et al 2017 with the advancement of computational fluid dynamics cfd large scale numerical studies were also performed using commercial software packages ansys and star ccm and open source cfd models openfoam and reef3d using different numerical methods numerical modelling helps to investigate various complex aspects such as air entrapment effect of girders and airgap on the horizontal and vertical impact forces to reduce the air entrapment and the impact forces on bridge decks many studies have investigated the effect of air vents in reducing the vertical impact force azadbakht and yim 2016 seiffert et al 2015 qu et al 2017 different design formulae have been developed for regular and solitary waves to predict the impact force on bridges douglass et al 2006 mcpherson 2008 meng 2008 aashto 2008 the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto provides a set of equations to calculate the maximum vertical and horizontal forces during storm conditions these equations of aashto are compared with the maximum forces obtained using solitary and regular waves hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 azadbakht and yim 2016 a review conducted by hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2016 provided a detailed revision of all the theoretical formulations and investigations on the impact forces and air entrapment effect the extreme wave impact on bridge decks were studied by choosing representative events like tsunami and storm surge besides the extreme events due to weather conditions steep waves called freak or rouge waves usually dominant in deep water are also observed in shallow waters which are highly nonlinear various studies have been executed with solitary cnoidal waves seiffert et al 2014 hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 xu and cai 2017 hayatdavoodi et al 2019 qu et al 2020 and regular stokes waves cuomo et al 2009 azadbakht and yim 2016 however these waves do not represent the random sea state effectively solitary waves were used to model the long period tsunami waves but it is independent of the wave period and without the trough which is usually present in wave measurements during storm surges the regular waves fail to capture the random sea state during an extreme event in addition strong wind during storm surges escalates the wave height on top of surge and swell considering the above facts if an irregular wave train is used for the design approach it requires a lot of computational time and efforts a design approach using focused wave groups can thus be an alternative to the existing long duration irregular wave method this is of great benefit as the numerical or experimental tests can have good repeatability and the wave structure interaction can be modelled better focused wave groups have been successfully used in offshore for representing freak or rogue waves tromans et al 1991 ning et al 2008 but its applicability in shallow water to study the wave impact on coastal structures is limited this is because it is validated for intermediate and deep water where linear frequency dispersion is dominant and extreme wave profile is consistent the advantage of newwave is that the extreme wave profile is related to the properties of the sea state declared by significant wave height and peak wave period whittaker et al 2016 established the validity of the newwave generation in shallow water by comparing the second order corrected newwave profile with field measurements from buoy data recorded in the southwest of the uk the validation was done for the pre breaking waves during an extreme event and the comparison shows the ability of newwave to approximate the average shape of extreme wave profile the second order component in the newwave was given using stokes approximation ning et al 2008 for capturing the nonlinearity of steep waves sriram et al 2015 generated focused waves using linear and second order correction using schäffer 1996 and showed their applicability from deep to intermediate water depths the focused wave groups are generated in the coastal zone to capture run up overtopping hunt raby et al 2011 orszaghova et al 2014 whittaker et al 2018 and also to study the impact force on monopile ghadirian et al 2016 schløer et al 2017 focused wave group can thus be a preferred alternative to regular and irregular wave descriptions when structural reliability is the most important issue for the design approach this shows the scope of using extreme wave profile for the study of wave impact on coastal bridge deck the main objective of the present paper is to analyse the extreme wave impact on coastal bridge deck by the action of focused waves the effect of various parameters like peak wave period water depth and phase focusing on the generated focused wave profile and its impact on the bridge deck at different submergence depths are analysed the present paper generates the focused wave using newwave technique and its properties are analysed based on the maximum crest and trough heights at different water depths the nonlinearity induced by the steep focused wave and how it magnifies the wave structure interaction is analysed by comparing the impact forces at different wave heights the focused waves are generated with different phases i e crest and trough focused and its impact on the coastal bridge deck are analysed at different airgaps further the variability of extreme wave profile with the change in wave periods are also investigated and the variation of impact forces is estimated at different airgaps the impact forces obtained numerically are further compared to the design formulae of aashto the comparison of aashto results with regular wave cases was already done hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 azadbakht and yim 2016 and the present paper aims to see the performance of design formulations for the focused wave cases 2 numerical model 2 1 theory in this paper the focused wave impact on the coastal bridges with girders is investigated numerically using the open source cfd model reef3d bihs et al 2016 the numerical model solves the fluid flow problem using the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations eq 2 along with the continuity equation eq 1 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x j v v t u i x j u j x i g i where ρ is fluid density ν is kinematic viscosity ν t is eddy viscosity u is velocity averaged over time t p is the pressure and g is acceleration due to gravity turbulence is modelled using the k ω model with two transport equations the k ω model is a widely used empirical model and prominent alternative to the k ε model it is an empirical model based on transport equations for the kinetic energy and the turbulence frequency ω ε k the k ω turbulence model is generally used in cfd based numerical wave tanks in current literature such as lara et al 2012 higeura et al 2013 jacobsen et al 2011 investigated the difference between k ω and k ε turbulence models for breaking waves in their cfd model but reported there were no major differences hence this aspect is not investigated in this paper the definition of the eddy viscosity in the k ω model is ν t k ω and in the k ε model ν t c μ k 2 ε the quadratic term in the calculation of the eddy viscosity in the k ε model compared to the linear relationship in the k ω model is advantageous for numerical modelling aiding in stability in the simulation the numerical model reef3d used in this study has been widely validated using the k ω model by bihs et al 2016 the transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and the specific turbulent dissipation rate ω are given as 3 k t u j k x j x j v v t x j k x j p k β k k ω 4 ω t u j ω x j x j v v t σ w ω x j ω k a p k β ω 2 where p k is the production rate and closure coefficients are σk 2 σw 2 βk 9 100 β 3 40 and α 5 9 the kinematic viscosity contains the turbulent viscosity which is calculated from turbulent properties using the boussinesq approximation the density and kinematic viscosity have to be distinguished in two phases air and water following brackbill et al 1992 the differential equations representing the fluid flow is solved by discretizing the convective and time dependent terms the convective terms in the rans equation are discretized using fifth order weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme the time discretization is done using total variance diminishing tvd third order runge kutta explicit scheme the cfl courant frederick lew condition is used to maintain adequate time step and stability in explicit methods the projection method proposed by chorin 1968 is used to solve the pressure term in the navier stokes equation the staggered grid arrangement is implemented in the numerical model to achieve a strong pressure velocity coupling the level set method is employed in reef3d to model the free surface between the two phases considered in the present study phase 1 and 2 represent water and air respectively with an interface between the two layers fig 1 where the values are given as in eq 5 the interface thickness is given as 1 8 times the least mesh size a signed distance function called level set function captures the interface the interface movement is characterized by the convection of the level set function the motion of the free surface is captured by solving the linear advection equation with the fluid velocities convecting φ x t the property of the function is such that φ x t 0 at the interface first the level set function is defined based on the velocity magnitude u and is given as 5 φ x φ x u 1 0 φ x u 1 0 0 u 1 0 the level set function is maintained for moving interface by redistributing it at each time step for which partial differential equation pde based reinitialization technique is adopted the total wave force on the structure is computed by integrating the pressure p and the normal component of stress tensor τ over the surface ω of the structure eq 5 the integrated force is calculated at each time step for the individual cell surfaces which again depends on the cfl number and maximum velocity in the computational domain the equation used for computing the force is given as 6 f ω n p n τ d ω 2 2 focused wave generation the concept of the focused wave tromans et al 1991 ning et al 2008 was first developed for deep water to generate extreme waves from a specified frequency spectrum by superimposing several relatively small waves to form one focused extreme wave at a specified location and time this concept is then validated for intermediate water taylor and williams 2004 moideen et al 2020 and shallow water abroug et al 2020 whittaker et al 2016 in the present study focused waves are generated by superposing second order irregular waves schäffer 1996 the focused wave profile comprises both random and deterministic components representing the sea state the surface elevation is given by 7 η x t i 1 n a i cos k i x ω i t ϕ i the cosine term is set equal to one cos k i x ω i t ϕ i 1 so that at the focusing location and time ϕ i k i x t ω i t t substituting this value in equation 7 the surface elevation becomes 8 η 0 t i 1 n a i cos k i x t ω i t t t the amplitude of each wave component a i of frequency f i is defined as a i a s f i δ f i 1 n s f i δ f where 9 a 2 m o ln n the horizontal and vertical velocities of first order is given as follows 10 u u 1 i 1 n a i g k i ω i cosh k i z d cosh k i d cos k i x x 0 ω i t t 0 11 w w 1 i 1 n a i g k i ω i sinh k i z d cosh k i d sin k i x x 0 ω i t t 0 where z is the vertical coordinate measured upwards from the mean water level η is the instantaneous free surface elevation m o is the zeroth moment of input spectrum g is the gravitational acceleration d is the water depth k is the wave number s f i is the spectral density f is the frequency and ω is the angular frequency depending on the number of wave components n 25 the wave dispersion equation is valid and gives the relation between angular frequency and wave length a is the target theoretical linear wave amplitude of the focused wave x f and t f are the focusing location and time respectively where all the wave components in the non linear wave group is focused the phase angle ϕ is used for focusing the wave groups at the prescribed location and time resulting in crest focused wave ϕ 0 and trough focused wave ϕ π u and w represent the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively the subscript 1 denotes linear contributions of the above parameters the total wave elevation and velocity components u w in the new wave is obtained by superposing the linear and second order components as given below 12 η η 1 η 2 u u 1 u 2 w w 1 w 2 where η 1 u 1 and w 1 are the linear wave elevation and velocities respectively and η 2 u 2 and w 2 correspond to the second order wave elevation and velocities respectively 3 mesh sensitivity study and validation 3 1 numerical wave tank numerical wave tank nwt is modelled using reef3d providing suitable boundary conditions as shown in fig 1 for 2d cases minimum mesh size is considered as the width of the nwt the bottom of the tank is specified with wall boundary condition bc1 velocity inlet bc2 is used for wave generation and bc3 represents a symmetry plane for 2d nwt active wave absorption method is used for preventing reflected waves from affecting the wave generation in this method velocity of the waves are absorbed at the outlet or the reflected waves from the rear boundary are prescribed with the opposite sign to nullify them different types of wave generation and reflection analysis for different wave types using reef3d were conducted by miquel et al 2018 the active wave absorption boundary condition is implemented as follows assuming shallow water conditions within airy wave theory for 2d waves 13 u t g d ζ t 14 ζ t η t d where η t is the free surface elevation and d is the water depth the numerical wave tank is separated into two zones the wave generation zone and working zone fig 1 the length of wave generation zone and total nwt are considered as twice and five times the focused wave length respectively the waves are generated by focusing the irregular waves n 25 at a specific location x f and time t f the wave focusing location is given as one wave length from the wave generation zone courant number of 0 1 is chosen throughout the simulation the time step is not constant it varies depending on the maximum value of velocity in the computational domain the structure is located at different submergence levels or airgaps in the present paper airgap s is defined as the distance measured from the swl to top of the deck which is negative if the deck is submerged in water fig 1 3 2 model validation for wave and deck with girders interaction in the present study experiments conducted by seiffert et al 2014 and hayatdavoodi et al 2014 are considered as benchmark simulations for the validation of the numerical model seiffert et al 2014 and hayatdavoodi et al 2014 investigated the solitary wave loading on flat deck and deck with girders respectively with a model scale of 1 35 fig 2 representing coastal bridge structures and were tested in a wave flume located at the university of hawaii s hydraulics laboratory of the civil and environmental engineering department the impact force on flat deck was already validated using reef3d by moideen et al 2019 and impact force on deck with girders is considered for validation in the present section the experimental wave flume of 9 14 m length 0 152 m width and 0 39 m height are used for the 2d analysis seiffert et al 2014 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 a wave gauge was placed at a distance x 2 62 m from the wave maker to measure the wave elevation seiffert et al 2014 and the deck with girders hayatdavoodi et al 2014 is placed to quantify the impact forces the experiment hayatdavoodi et al 2014 was performed for different water depths with different submergence levels and wave heights the present study considers a scenario where a deck with six girders is located at the swl with zero submergence the solitary wave amplitude h 0 03431 to water depth d 0 114 m ratio of 0 301 is used to validate the numerical model a mesh sensitivity analysis is carried out first with different mesh sizes δx 0 025 0 01 and 0 005 m using a third order solitary wave with amplitude h 0 03 m the comparison between the numerical and theoretical wave height at x 4 m for different mesh sizes δx 0 025 0 01 and 0 005 m gives relative errors of 2 0 25 and 0 08 respectively fig 3 i this shows that the wave profile is captured with good accuracy using δx 0 01 and 0 005 m but a finer mesh size of δx 0 005 m is chosen for capturing the impact forces as the experimental tank considered is scaled to 1 35 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 with such small scaling the bridge deck has dimension less than 0 01 thus choosing mesh size of 0 005 m will be better in capturing the wave structure interaction the experimental condition considered for validation is simulated using the selected mesh size in the numerical wave tank the wave elevation measured at a wave probe location x 2 62 m in the experiment is compared with the numerical results from zone 1 fig 3 ii shows the comparison of numerical wave elevation profile with the experimental results of seiffert et al 2014 it can be seen that the wave profile is captured well by the numerical model the deck with six girders is then located at the distance x 2 62 m and the impact forces are computed at an airgap s 0 time series of the vertical and horizontal wave impact forces on the deck are then obtained by integrating the pressure acting on the structure at each time step the comparison of horizontal and vertical force time series with the experimental results is shown in fig 3 the horizontal fig 4 ii and vertical fig 4 i force peaks are captured well and the phase of the force time history also shows good match with the experimental results this demonstrates that the model can be further used for the investigation of wave impact on coastal bridge decks the numerical simulations were transacted with the k ω turbulence model where the impact force validation is done for deck located at swl the turbulence effects are more pronounced when the structure is placed above the swl and when the h d ratio is higher this is because the wave breaks on the deck when it is placed above the swl thus there will be differences in the impact forces especially in the peak horizontal impact force to demonstrate the effects with and without turbulence model three cases are simulated first case 1 with the deck placed at swl and h d 0 3 second case 2 when the deck is at an airgap s of 0 1384 m measured from the swl to top of the deck h d 0 3 and third case with airgap of 0 1384 m and h d 0 4 the horizontal impact forces for all three cases are compared with and without turbulence effects fig 5 shows the comparison of horizontal impact force with and without turbulence model for the three cases considered for cases 1 and 2 fig 5 i and ii the numerical simulations are compared with the experimental results of hayatdavoodi et al 2014 whereas for the case 3 fig 5 iii experimental results are not available for comparison the numerical simulations without turbulence model for the cases 1 2 and 3 overestimate the horizontal peak impact force by 0 9 9 and 26 respectively the results show that for steep and non linear focused waves with larger crest height and for decks located above swl the inclusion of turbulence model provides better results the results considered are for the first wave impact on deck and there is no sufficient time for the turbulence instability to build up larsen and fuhrman 2018 the force history for the two cases submerged and elevated shows good comparison the numerical model is further used for comparing the peak uplift and horizontal forces for varying airgaps s d 0 17 0 21 and 0 41 and wave heights h d 0 093 0 192 0 301 0 405 and 0 525 at a water depth d 0 114 m the results fig 6 state that the peak impact forces are well captured in comparison to the experimental results hayatdavoodi et al 2014 and the numerical model can be used successfully for further investigations 3 3 model validation for focused wave generation the present study considers highly non linear steep focused waves the focused wave generation and propagation using the numerical model reef3d is validated with the experimental results of ning et al 2009 the steepest focused wave case 4 of ning et al 2009 is considered for validation bihs et al 2017 has already validated the numerical model reef3d for lower steep waves case1 and case 2 of ning et al 2009 the amplitude of 0 10301 m with a wave period of 1 25 s as adopted in the experiment is considered in the numerical study this focused wave has a wave length of 2 18 m at a water depth of 0 5 m the focused wave is generated in a 15 m long 2d numerical wave tank at a focusing location of 7 m the focusing location is chosen different from the experimental case so the numerical results are moved in time to match the experimental results the focused wave is generated with different mesh sizes δx 0 05 0 025 0 01 and 0 005 m fig 7 shows the wave elevation comparison of the numerical results with the experimental results of ning et al 2009 using different mesh sizes mesh sizes of 0 01 m and 0 005 m capture the peak elevation with better accuracy whereas δx of 0 025 m and 0 05 m fail to capture the peak the percentage of accuracy is 0 2 higher for mesh size 0 005 m compared to mesh size of 0 01 m whereas the computational time increases more than twice considering a mesh size of 0 005 m thus a mesh size of 0 01 m is chosen and used for further simulations a scale of 1 10 is adopted for modelling the deck and wave properties 3 4 focused wave impact on flat deck the numerical model is validated for the interaction of breaking focused wave with the deck by comparing with the experimental results of wu and chang 2016 and details of their experiment is explained as follows the experimental study of wu and chang 2016 was simulated in a wave tank of 36 m in length 0 9 m in width and 1 5 m in depth located at the zachry department of civil engineering texas a m university the deck model used was a rigid flat plate with a length of 0 28 m and thickness of 9 53 mm at an airgap s of 0 05 m from swl in a water depth of 0 5 m bubble image velocimetry biv is used for capturing the turbulent velocity characteristics ryu et al 2005 from where the maximum horizontal and vertical velocities above and below the deck are derived the focused wave of height h 0 15 m and period t p 1 28 s were generated in the lab using superposition of linear waves with different wave periods the probes p1 p2 and p3 placed at 14 1 m 17 1 m and 21 5 m respectively in the experimental set up before and after the deck structure is considered for comparing wave elevation the experimental setup is replicated in the numerical domain as shown in fig 8 the focused breaking wave h 0 15 m and t p 1 28 s is numerically generated by focusing irregular wave groups at a given space and time using the jonswap spectrum mesh size dx of 0 01 m is used throughout the computational domain the generated focused wave in the nwt propagates to hit the rigid structure the wave probes were located at the same positions with respect to the deck as that of the experimental set up to capture the wave elevations whereas the maximum horizontal and vertical velocities below and above the deck are derived using point probes the wave elevations and velocities measured at probe locations height and point probes in the numerical wave tank are compared with the experimental results of wu and chang 2016 it is observed that the focused wave of height 0 15 m was generated in the nwt and the wave elevations near to the structure at different probe locations are comparable with the experimental results even though variation is seen in the initial wave heights fig 9 i ii and iii the velocity variation fig 9 iv is plotted with respect to time by using point probes in the breaking zone of the nwt and the maximum resultant velocity is compared with the experimental result the resultant velocity also shows good comparison and proves that the numerical model can well capture the turbulent velocity characteristics the slight variations between the experiment and numerical results are because of the difference in techniques used in wave generation and velocity measurement the numerical model is also validated with experimental results of ghadirian et al 2016 for focused wave impact on monopile structure wave elevation and inline force using reef3d by moideen et al 2020 the validations show the applicability of the numerical model in capturing the focused wave impact and further used for carrying out the parametric study 4 results and discussion 4 1 generation of steepest focused wave for varying significant wave height and water depth the focused waves are generated in the numerical wave tank by specifying the significant wave height h si and peak wave period t p as inputs the wave profiles are generated using jonswap spectrum for k p d values less than 0 6 where k p is the wave number corresponding to the peak wave period t p the focused waves are generated at four different water depths d 0 45 0 4 0 35 and 0 3 m with input significant wave height to water depth ratios h si d ranging from 0 2 to 0 4 table 1 the wave elevation time history figs 10 and 11 is plotted with the wave elevation η normalized with the water depth d and the time t normalized with the wave focusing time t f fig 10 shows focused wave elevation characteristics crest and trough elevation for a wave elevation time history at water depth d 0 45 m the maximum crest height η c trough height η t and the maximum wave height h m for h si d 0 4 at water depth of d 0 45 m are marked in fig 10 the variation of wave profiles at h si d 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 for water depth d 0 4 m are shown in fig 11 i the wave profile becomes steeper with increase in crest height as the h si d ratio increases from 0 2 to 0 4 the normalized wave elevation plotted for h si d 0 4 fig 11 ii for all water depths shows that normalized crest height is higher for lowest water depth d 0 3 m the maximum crest height η c trough height η t and wave height h m are measured for all the wave profiles generated and the ratio of η c h m and η t h m are calculated and tabulated in table 1 the η c h m value ranges from 0 67 to 0 68 and η t h m value ranges from 0 32 to 0 33 for all the water depths when the h si d ratio reaches 0 4 the obtained values are in good agreement with the averaged wave profiles obtained by whittaker et al 2016 from different buoy locations during real storm conditions the averaged wave records at the buoy locations in whittaker et al 2016 are as follows η c h m 0 6 0 65 and 0 7 and η t h m 0 3 0 35 and 0 32 this shows the applicability of focused waves in representing extreme waves as the focused waves replicated the average wave profiles during storm in terms of the crest and trough height these waves are further used for computing the impact forces acting on the bridge deck at different airgaps 4 2 focused wave impact on deck the variation of focused wave impact forces on coastal deck at different airgaps is presented in this section the focused waves generated in the above section with increasing h si d ratio from 0 2 to 0 4 at different water depths and airgaps fig 12 are considered for investigating the impact forces the coastal deck chosen has five girders with length of l 28 m and width of b 11 m modelled to a scale of 1 10 different airgaps are chosen such that the bridge deck is fully submerged at the still water level and partially submerged the airgaps considered are 0 03 0 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 m from the swl and are normalized with the water depth s d the focused wave impact induces both horizontal and vertical impact forces on the deck structure the horizontal impact force can be divided into positive in the wave direction and negative opposite the wave direction components whereas the vertical force is divided into uplift positive z direction and downward negative z direction vertical components the impact forces are normalized with a factor 1 ρ g h m a where a is the deck area a can be replaced with a h for projected area in horizontal plane and a v for projected area in vertical plane to compute the vertical and horizontal impact forces respectively the maximum forces include the impact force as well as the hydrostatic force due to the surge the variation of peak vertical uplift and downward and horizontal positive and negative impact forces with respect to the normalized airgap is presented in fig 13 for water depth of d 0 45 m the peak vertical uplift force normalized with maximum wave height h m is higher for h si d 0 2 compared to h si d 0 3 and 0 4 fig 13 i this shows that with increasing normalized wave height the normalized vertical impact force is reduced in case of peak vertical downward force fig 13 ii h si d 0 3 and 0 4 gives higher negative downward vertical force compared to h si d 0 2 the peak horizontal positive force fig 13 iii is higher for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 compared to h si d 0 2 whereas the peak horizontal negative force fig 13 iv is higher for h si d 0 2 the horizontal positive force shows a different trend compared to the peak vertical uplift force for different h si d fig 13 ii the normalized peak horizontal positive force increases with increase in h si d ratio which shows that the wave height has significant contribution to the horizontal positive force whereas the horizontal negative force reduces with increase in h si d the peak horizontal positive and vertical uplift forces are the major forcing and its variations for increasing wave heights at four different water depths are presented in figs 14 and 15 respectively the horizontal positive impact force normalized with maximum wave height at different water depths for increasing h si d ratio of 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 fig 14 increases with increasing wave height also the peak horizontal positive force displays a large increase from h si d 0 2 to h si d 0 3 the peak vertical uplift forces fig 15 are higher for lower wave heights compared to higher wave heights the trends for the three h si d ratios show that the impact force variation is higher for h si d 0 2 at lower s d ratios s d 0 to 0 15 compared to h si d 0 3 and 0 4 this indicates that increase in vertical uplift force is not linearly dependent on the wave height but depends on the airgaps as well the variation of peak vertical uplift force fig 13 i is less significant for normalized airgaps s d 0 09 0 and 0 06 as the wave undergoes less deformation and the force time history is smoother as the s d increases resulting in gap between the deck and the swl the wave breaking occurs and larger variation in peak vertical uplift force is observed figs 16 and 17 show the interaction of the focused wave h si d 0 4 with the deck at different time steps showing velocity variation for s d 0 09 and 0 17 respectively figs 18 and 19 show the force time history at different structure locations s d ratios for h si d 0 2 and 0 4 for the submerged case with s d 0 09 fig 16 i shows the focused wave crest approaching the deck t t f 0 97 and the force time history fig 19 i shows an increase of vertical uplift force from t t f 0 95 then the wave crest impacts the deck at t t f 0 99 fig 16 ii and the crest overturns fig 16 iii and hits the top of the deck fig 16 iv variation of the vertical and horizontal impact force during these time steps are shown in fig 19 i and 19 ii the vertical impact force time history gives the peak at t t f 1 fig 19 i whereas the horizontal impact force time history fig 19 ii gives the peak after t t f 1 a similar vertical and horizontal force time history fig 19 iii and iv is obtained for the structure located at swl at t t f 1 03 and 1 07 fig 16 v and vi the wave is distributed on the top of the deck and starts leaving the deck fig 16 vii the force time history shows a reduction in vertical uplift force fig 19 i and a negative horizontal impact force fig 19 ii at these time steps for the partially submerged case with s d 0 17 the focused wave impacts the deck sides fig 17 i and the gap inside the chambers gets filled fig 17 ii the wave impacting on the deck side rises to the top of the deck fig 17 iii and at the same time t t f 1 the water leaves the chambers starting from the last girder at t t f 1 04 water gets redistributed fig 17 v and vi on the top of the deck and leaves the deck and chambers fig 17 vii reducing the force the time history of the vertical uplift force fig 19 v shows a sudden increase in impact force unlike for the submerged case at t t f 1 also as the vertical impact force is reduced there are fluctuations in the force time history compared to the submerged and at swl cases the horizontal force time history fig 19 vi also shows a sudden increase and decrease within short time span for s d 0 11 compared to s d 0 and 0 09 for s d 0 11 the structure is above swl and the wave elevation is above the deck level at this point the wave breaks on the structure and the broken wave also interact with the structure resulting in multiple peaks in the horizontal force vertical profile of pressure and the velocity distribution horizontal velocity u and vertical velocity w above the swl during the focused wave interaction with the structure is measured using probes z 1 z 2 z 12 located close to the structure one mesh size gap as shown in fig 11 the celerity used for normalizing pressure and velocity is calculated using linear dispersion relation the normalized peak pressure values with stagnation pressure varying along the vertical z direction from the swl during the wave structure interaction for different normalized airgap positions s d 0 0 06 0 1 0 17 0 23 are depicted in fig 20 the peak pressure value attains maximum magnitude at swl for an airgap of s d 0 11 and 0 17 and reduces along the positive z direction the time history of the pressure variation at the swl when the structure is placed at normalized airgap of s d 0 and 0 11 is shown in fig 22 iii the peak pressure is observed at t t f 1 just before impacting the structure and a fluctuation around the peak pressure is observed with the wave breaking the peak horizontal and vertical velocity normalized with celerity during the focused wave impact on deck placed at different normalized airgaps s d 0 0 06 0 11 0 17 0 23 are shown in fig 21 variation of normalized peak vertical and horizontal velocity is plotted along the vertical z direction above the swl the peak horizontal velocity fig 21 i is increasing above the swl as the wave approaches the deck and the focused wave crest runs up in front of the deck for the case of peak vertical velocity the velocity is increasing above the swl when the structure is placed at s d 0 11 0 17 and 0 22 but for s d 0 and 0 06 the vertical velocity decreases along the vertical direction this is because when the structure is placed just above and at the swl the wave hits the structure with increased velocity and energy is retarded further upwards but when the structure is located at a higher level the focused wave crest builds up and velocity profile represents an increase in the vertical direction variation of vertical and horizontal velocity with respect to time are shown in fig 22 i and ii respectively the vertical velocity is showing a higher peak than the horizontal velocity and the vertical velocity time history shows a sudden peak slamming and then positive and negative quasi static force magnitudes the nonlinear behaviour is seen for the velocity and pressure when the structure is located above the swl as the wave breaks on the structure 4 3 effect of wave period on focused wave impact in this section variation of the focused wave profile with three different peak wave periods t p 1 5 2 and 2 5 s and two different significant wave height h si d 0 3 and 0 4 are presented variation of the vertical and horizontal wave loads on the structure with the three different wave periods for different airgaps is discussed fig 23 shows the wave profile for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 considering three different peak wave periods t p 2 5 2 and 1 5 s the wave profile at h si d 0 4 fig 23 ii shows difference in the crest elevation with the difference in peak wave period compared to h si d 0 3 fig 23 i the effect of wave period on impact forces are analysed the peak vertical uplift force for h si d 0 3 are found to be 13 higher for t p 1 5 s compared to t p 2 and 2 5 s but for h si d 0 4 the peak vertical impact force is 13 higher for t p 2 5 s compared to t p 1 5 s it is observed that a higher peak wave period generates higher maximum wave height resulting in higher vertical uplift forces the downward vertical force does not show large variation for varying wave periods and wave heights fig 24 ii and 25 ii the peak horizontal positive force fig 24 iii and fig 25 iii is higher for t p 2 5 s and reduces with the airgap the peak negative horizontal impact force is found to be higher at t p 1 5 s for h si d 0 3 fig 24 ii and fig 24 iv and at t p 2 0 s for h si d 0 4 fig 25 ii and fig 25 iv the horizontal negative impact force shows considerable variation with a change in wave period and increase in wave height from h si d 0 3 to 0 4 fig 24 iv and fig 25 iv 4 4 phase effect of focused wave on impact force variation of impact load with change in phase crest focused and trough focused of the focused wave for two different wave heights are estimated in the present section the focused waves are generated by focusing a number of waves n at the same location and time two significant wave heights h si d 0 3 and 0 4 and a single wave period t p 2 5 s are considered as input for generating focused waves the crest and trough are focused by giving the phase values of zero and π respectively variation of wave profile using crest and trough focused conditions for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 are plotted in fig 26 the crest height of the crest focused wave has a significant increase in wave height compared to the trough height of the trough focused wave as h si d varies from 0 3 to 0 4 the peak vertical and horizontal impact forces for the crest and trough focused waves are compared in figs 27 and 28 for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 respectively the peak vertical uplift figs 27 i and fig 28 i force is comparable for both crest and trough focused waves whereas the impact force varies with the airgap positions trough focused waves gives lower uplift vertical impact force compared to the crest focused waves for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 at lower airgaps whereas trough focused impact forces have higher peaks with increase in airgap fig 27 i it can be seen that both crest and trough focused waves give similar peak vertical uplift forces at different airgaps in fact the trough focused wave impact has contribution from the trailing crest behind the trough focused wave the downward vertical impact force fig 27 ii and fig 28 ii is giving higher peak for crest focused waves for both h si d 0 3 and 0 4 the peak horizontal positive impact force is higher for the crest focused wave than the trough focused wave for both h si d 0 3 and 0 4 fig 27 iii and fig 28 iii the negative horizontal impact forces fig 27 iv and fig 28 iv are higher for trough focused waves for both h si d 0 3 and 0 4 4 5 design formulations comparison and discussion american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto has prescribed design formulae for computing the vertical and horizontal impact forces on coastal bridge decks these formulae were used to compute the forces on both fully submerged and elevated decks subjected to regular solitary and stokes waves kulicki 2010 hayatdavoodi et al 2019 azadbakht and yim 2016 in the present study applicability of the aashto formulae for computing the focused wave impact forces on coastal bridge decks were examined this is done by comparing the focused wave impact forces obtained numerically with the aashto formulations fig 29 shows variation of the horizontal impact force at different airgaps and four different water depths for increasing h si d ratios for h si d 0 2 aashto formulae were underestimating the horizontal impact force compared to the numerical model results for s d less than 0 1 beyond which it is highly overestimating contrary to the continuous increasing profile of aashto forces the numerical model results show an increase up to s d 0 12 and then reduces similarly for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 the model results show an increase up to s d 0 1 0 15 aashto underestimates and then reduces aashto overestimates for the present submerged and partially submerged scenarios the peak horizontal impact forces are underestimated up to 2 to 3 times by the aashto formulations up to s d 0 1 0 15 and for higher airgaps aashto formulae overestimates up to 7 times generally aashto formulae highly overestimate for lower wave heights h si d 0 2 and moderately overestimate for higher wave heights h si d 0 3 and 0 4 the vertical impact force variation with the airgaps for four different water depths and varying h si d ratios are shown in fig 30 for h si d 0 2 the aashto formulae underestimate the peak vertical impact forces compared to the numerical results for different airgaps considered for h si d 0 3 and 0 4 the aashto formulae overestimates the impact force up to a factor of 3 4 for the airgap up to s d 0 05 for airgaps s d 0 1 0 2 peak vertical impact forces are underestimated by the aashto formulae on an average of 5 40 for h si d 0 3 whereas the peak vertical impact forces are overestimated on an average of 9 12 for h si d 0 4 generally the aashto formulae highly underestimate the peak vertical impact force for lower wave height h si d 0 2 and moderately captures the peak vertical impact force for higher wave heights h si d 0 3 and 0 4 and airgaps s d 0 1 and 0 2 4 6 estimation of force coefficients based on varying airgap and wave height the present investigation of non breaking focused wave impact on deck structures shows that the peak horizontal and vertical impact forces are dependent on both airgap and wave height the results obtained in the present study are used to derive force coefficients for both horizontal and vertical impact forces based on coastal engineering manual cem the impact forces are calculated by the reference equation given by coastal engineering manual usace 2011 for emergent structures where the force coefficients are derived based on laboratory experiments the reference equation given in eq 13 is obtained by integrating the pressure over the surface of the emergent structure to compute the forces but neglected the effect of airgap 15 f h c u a z γ w u 2 2 g f v c u a n γ w w 2 2 g where c u is the laboratory derived coefficient a n and a z are the projected area in horizontal plane and vertical plane respectively u and w are horizontal and vertical velocities at level of object γ w is specific weight of water the non breaking focused waves are generated with increasing h si d ratio from 0 2 to 0 4 at different water depths d 0 3 0 35 0 4 and 0 45 m to investigate the impact forces acting on coastal deck at different airgaps the airgaps s 0 03 0 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 m normalized with maximum wave height h m are chosen such that the deck is fully submerged at the still water level and partially submerged when the wave hits the structure a sudden change in particle velocities is observed both in horizontal and vertical direction making it difficult to choose reference horizontal and vertical velocities to derive the respective coefficients hence unlike cem reference equation where u w are used for computing the horizontal and vertical wave forces wave celerity c obtained from wave dispersion relation is used for deriving peak impact force coefficients the revised formulations for horizontal and vertical force coefficients for non breaking focused wave impact are given as 16 c h f h 0 5 ρ a v c 2 c v f v 0 5 ρ a h c 2 the variation of force coefficients with respect to varying s h m ratios show a large scatter as seen in figs 31 and 32 the horizontal impact force coefficients for h si d 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 vary in the range of 0 7 3 2 2 8 6 8 and 2 8 7 2 respectively similarly the vertical force coefficients for h si d 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 vary in the range of 0 9 7 0 1 0 8 9 and 1 1 8 8 respectively it is observed that the horizontal force coefficients for h si d 0 2 is much less compared to h si d 0 2 hence three data sets are considered one for h si d 0 2 0 2 h si d 0 3 and other for h si d 0 2 and analysed to derive force coefficient formulations similarly for vertical force coefficients two data sets are considered one for h si d 0 2 and other for h si d 0 2 and analysed to derive force coefficient formulations at lower s h m the increase in force coefficient value is not significant however slight further increase in the s h m results in very high force coefficients hence to arrive at a conservative estimation peak values are considered for deriving the coefficients the force coefficients can be further used for larger wave heights and airgaps in the limits of h si d ratios linear regression is carried out for the data sets and best fit curves representing peak impact forces are plotted in figs 31 and 32 the best fit polynomials for horizontal and vertical force coefficients for non breaking focused wave impact are given in equations 15 and 16 respectively equation 15 gives the peak horizontal impact force where the projected vertical area a v is the length of the bridge multiplied by total height of bridge deck thickness height of girder also for peak vertical impact force in equation 16 the horizontal projected area a h is obtained by multiplying the length of the bridge with the first chamber width which is the total width divided by number of girders the relationship between the horizontal and vertical force coefficient with varying airgap and wave height is given as follows horizontal force

generated in the numerical wave tank 5 conclusions impact forces due to focused wave loads for varying airgaps wave periods wave heights and phases are numerically modelled and discussed through a parametric study the focused wave impact forces obtained from the numerical model are compared with the design formulae given by aashto following conclusions are drawn from this study behavior and characteristics of focused waves at different water depths shows that an extreme wave profile is generated at a significant wave height to water depth ratio of 0 4 without any wave breaking the focused wave crest to the maximum wave height for the wave profiles ranges from 0 67 to 0 68 whereas the focused trough height to maximum wave height ranges from 0 3 to 0 32 peak vertical uplift and downward forces are higher for lower wave heights compared to larger wave heights the peak vertical uplift force induced by focused wave impact is found to be higher for partially submerged decks than the fully submerged decks the peak horizontal positive impact force increases with the increase in wave height whereas the negative horizontal force reduces with increase of wave height higher peak wave periods of focused waves impose higher vertical uplift forces whereas the effect on downward vertical force is not significant the peak horizontal positive force is higher for increasing peak wave period and wave height whereas the peak negative horizontal force is higher for lower peak wave period and wave height both crest and trough focused waves with different phases impose similar peak vertical uplift force for different airgaps whereas the peak horizontal positive force is higher for crest focused waves the downward vertical force has no significant change with crest and trough focused waves whereas the negative horizontal force is higher for trough focused waves the peak horizontal impact force computed using aashto formulae is found to be highly overestimated for lower wave heights and moderately overestimated for higher wave heights when compared with the focused wave impact results obtained from the numerical model the aashto formulae highly underestimate the peak vertical impact force for lower wave heights and moderately captures the peak vertical impact force at higher wave heights and airgaps when compared to the focused wave results obtained from the numerical model the extreme wave impact on coastal deck structures is better represented using the focused wave simulations the force coefficients are derived for peak vertical and horizontal impact forces in relation with varying wave heights and airgaps for non breaking focused wave impact that will be useful for practical applications and practicing engineers funding the first author

20544,in the recent past intervention class autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have gained the ocean marine research community s attention due to their multidisciplinary operational capabilities this article discusses a detailed comparative performance study of an underwater vehicle uv with two different actuator configurations based on fixed thrusters and vectored thrusters the fixed thruster configuration consists of eight thrusters four thrusters generate thrust in the horizontal plane and the remaining thrusters produce thrust in heave direction the vectored thruster configuration has four thrusters placed at diagonal corners of a rectangular vehicle and four independent internal servomotors rotate these thrusters the classification terminology in this article identifies the underwater vehicle without vectoring capability as fixed thruster underwater vehicle ftuv and the one with vectoring capability as vectored thruster underwater vehicle vtuv furthermore a nonlinear

underwater vehicles are generally used in ocean observations monitoring marine flora and fauna ocean ecology and geoscience these vehicles also termed as long range uvs usually focus on the low drag hull forms to reduce losses due to the dissipative forces they typically employ rear thrusters to increase thruster efficiency by reducing the flow separation often manoeuvred by control surfaces to improve autonomy these vehicles are generally underactuated with the number of independently controllable inputs four less than the required degrees of freedom six leading to dependency coupled motion between the translation and rotation on the other hand complex surveying palmer 2009 maintenance and defence missions employ fully actuated or fully manoeuvrable auvs the primary prerequisites in designing these vehicles are agility and multi directional thrust response holonomy this holonomy makes these vehicles more power exhaustive with diminished endurance thus each class has its advantages and limitations in recent times the demand for the new generation of underwater robots kadiyam and mohan 2019 to perform a broader range of operations with contrasting capabilities has increased hence a new approach is required to develop uvs which should achieve excellent manoeuvring capabilities without compromising autonomy with that objective in mind two configurations of the same vehicle are compared by implementing and modifying the propulsion system several architectures were proposed based on the propulsion system application and capabilities to perform specific missions the number of thrusters for the vehicle is chosen based on the application and the mission conventionally the uvs use aft thrusters with control surfaces ferguson and pope 2000 for good endurance and multiple thrusters over actuated for good manoeuvrability antonelli et al 2001 the multiple thruster layout is widely used in commercial vehicles to meet the manoeuvrability requirements this study provides an opportunity to extend the vtuvs real time application to a broader research community using innovative solutions and state of the art tools the research on these vehicles is rigorous from the last decade in the underwater community le page and holappa 2000 cavallo et al 2004 ehlers et al 2014 bak et al 2017 with few cases of experiments guo and lin 2011 jin et al 2015 meyer et al 2013 in the underwater vehicle terminology the vectored thruster configuration is synonymous to the pivoted tiltable rotatable thrusters in ships the same is termed as azimuth thruster configuration vtuvs employ servomotors for the vectored thrust with comparatively less unit weight per actuator than the conventional uvs this modification effectively results in highly coupled and nonlinear equations of motion due to which the complexity of the dynamic model and the controller design increases the rise in the number of control inputs from four to eight helps achieve more independent controllable inputs than the required degrees of freedom thus an over actuated system is realized faul and katupitiya 2015 with the redundancy in control inputs compared to the former this redundancy helps the vtuv to follow an arbitrary trajectory this article presents a simulation based comparative study of fixed thruster underwater vehicle ftuv and vectored thruster underwater vehicle vtuv operating in similar conditions missions by understanding their performance characteristics specific to a rectangular shaped hull a dynamic model is developed for both the configurations using the decomposed nonlinear force characteristics in the horizontal and vertical directions the thrust generated with respect to the propeller blade s angular velocity is based on the empirical results blanke et al 2000 additionally the forces generated in the vtuv configuration thrusters are simulated by considering the ram drag effects perpendicular to the thrust forces ko et al 2007 in the ftuv configuration the vertical thrusters are placed to not interfere with the forbidden zone fz of the horizontal thrusters arditti et al 2019 furthermore an optimized controller design is necessary to control the underwater robot s two configurations in the vtuv variant the controller design is challenging due to the system nonlinearity caused by the rotatable thrusters the complexity further increases in the presence of disturbances a tracking controller is designed for both the variants based on the model parameters and the pose error the simulation results are presented to validate the proposed controller by comparing ftuv and vtuv 2 background and research rationale the high mobility agility requirements during the operations such as vertical mooring jacket surveys mine detection pipeline maintenance and other operations under highly variable environment is still an unsolved problem due to the complexity involved in realizing the control for manoeuvring motions most of the existing current vehicles use multiple thrusters mounted at different locations on the vehicle to achieve the required high operability requirements the flexibility of attaining multi directional control at zero speed state demands redundancy in the thrust forces thus the multiple redundant thruster layout is quite widely used in high manoeuvrability requirements a torpedo shaped auv called delphin2 is an over actuated hover capable system developed for manoeuvring research philips et al 2013 in a few other vehicles similar thruster layouts are implemented to increase the manoeuvring capabilities he et al 2013 tanakitkorn et al 2018 due to the increase in the number of external appendages the additional form drag leads to a substantial rise in the vehicle s resistance also in most cases to reduce the complexity of the control scheme and the power consumption some of the redundant thrusters are invoked only during tracking dynamic station keeping tasks santhakumar and asokan 2013 this redundancy leads to under utilization of resources as some thrusters remain idle for most of the mission time wang et al 2019 if somehow an enhancement in the system enables changing the direction of the thrust then the agility and manoeuvrability of the uv improve in the past few vehicles ehlers et al 2014 meyer et al 2013 gu and guo 2017 implemented pivoted thrusters concept to perform a holonomic control of the six degrees of freedom of the auv a comparative study at the university of florence implemented a reconfigurable propulsion layout with pivoted thrusters on the marta auv pugi et al 2018 it aims to understand the performance of the pivoted thruster layout compared to the conventional benchmark test vehicle however it did not consider the interaction effects or the other performance constraints on the thruster performance thus the current work implements the thrusters performance constraints to replicate real life issues in the simulations the vtuv system uses thrusters pivoted about particular axes to change the thrust directions the complete or partial rotation tilt vectoring depends on the mechanism and application masmitja et al 2018 few auvs with spatial linkages utilize a 2 dof single vector thruster to provide propulsion as well as manoeuvring cavallo and michelini 2004 however these vehicle mechanisms have difficulties such as redundant degree of freedom due to the complexity in driving the mechanism and relatively complex control due to the presence of redundant linkages inherent to these mechanisms the thruster s orientation may not follow the desired value at certain positions which affects the stability of the underwater vehicle cavallo et al 2004 thus an internal servomotor is connected to a sealed shaft to tilt the external thrusters to simplify the mechanism and accomplish the required attitude with a minimum number of thrusters this modification helps avoid wasting the power resources required in multiple thruster layout vehicles and redundancy of degrees of freedom in mechanism based vectored thruster vehicle the lower number of appendages help to reduce the resistance and improve the utility of the available resources here the proposed two variants are evaluated by understanding both the propulsion strategies possible outcomes by considering the possibilities and limitations 3 organization of the article the subsequent portion of the article discusses the modelling and analysis procedures explored and adopted for simulating the ftuv and vtuv variants with various performance constraints the mathematical modelling of uv in section 4 discusses the system description basic frame definitions kinematics and dynamics considering all the hydrodynamics aspects in section 5 the details of the thruster modelling for both the configurations considering few safe assumptions which include the dynamics of the thrusters saturation characteristics and various interaction effects later section 6 details the controller design based on the backstepping and its derivation of stability aspects for gain tuning in section 7 the results of simulations are presented initially followed by a detailed discussion on comparative analysis for both the variants section 8 summarizes the concluding remarks of the study 4 modelling the kinematics and dynamics of the uv a nonlinear mathematical model of the underwater robot emphasizing the thruster dynamics is derived using the newton eulerian approach the vehicle is considered as a rigid body operating in full six degree of freedom extensive efforts are required to examine every aspect that may affect the uv dynamics e g mass inertial hydrodynamic and mechanical properties of the vehicle these aspects help deliver a thorough physical understanding of the system towards a comprehensive mathematical model an attempt to derive the uv s full dynamics using the first principles such as the laws of mechanics and hydrodynamics is termed as white box modelling yuan 2013 the models based on these first principles provide a basis to generate linearized vehicle models for designing simple controllers however it is not easy to obtain accurate system parameters using the first principles due to the complex physical structure and hydrodynamic characteristics this complexity further increases when it functions in a wide operational range such as cruising hovering position keeping and tracking thus a comprehensive approach called grey box modelling yuan and katupitiya 2012 is required to obtain an accurate validated model using the empirical data which is a system identification process in this approach the system s unknown physical parameters are identified based on actual empirical input output data recorded here the thruster and the internal servomotor s performance characteristics are obtained from the empirical data the unknown vehicle physical parameters are obtained for designing the controller using simple regression techniques 4 1 system description the modular rectangular shaped hull of the uv has two possible variants the ftuv configuration in fig 1a has eight thrusters with four vertical thrusters mounted in tandem along the v x axis on both the port and starboard side of the vehicle the other four thrusters are fixed horizontally 45 to the longitudinal plane of the vehicle frame similarly in the vtuv configuration four rotatable thrusters are pivoted about the hull s diagonal axis actuated by four independent internal servomotors as shown in fig 1b as both the variants of the uv have eight inputs kadiyam et al 2020 to accomplish six independent degrees of freedom pose the resulting vehicle is over actuated these independent thrusters are considered as rigid bodies with a relative motion to the hull in the vtuv variant in the ftuv configuration there is no relative motion between the hull and thrusters thus the entire vehicle including the thrusters can be considered as a single rigid body with force inputs at their respective locations 4 2 kinematics of the vehicle it is essential to define the reference coordinate frames to model a uv here the euler angles represent the vehicle s orientation in the e frame also all the parameters are defined using the state space representation for the ease of modelling 4 2 1 coordinate frames definition the coordinate frames e earth inertial v vehicle and t i thruster are defined to model the kinematics and dynamics of the uv during operation as depicted in fig 2 here i represents the thrusters a to h in ftuv as shown in fig 2a similarly in the vtuv i represents the thrusters a to d as shown in fig 2b the coordinate frame e is assumed to follow the north east down ned notation somewhere at a known point on the earth s surface the e x axis points along the north e y axis along east and e z axis points downwards the origin of the v frame is fixed to the body of the vehicle and coincides with the c g here the v x axis points in the forward direction the v y axis points due starboard and the v z axis points down to the uv t i represents four additional coordinate frames attached to each thruster assembly of the vtuv as there is a relative motion between the hull and the thrusters these frames are located at the points where each thruster mounting arm axis intersects their respective axis of rotation of the propeller the t x i axis points forward i e about the propeller axes of rotation perpendicular to the vectoring axes the t y i axis is along the starboard and t z i axis direction completes the right hand rule in the t i frame 4 2 2 state space representation of the uv the state space representation offers a compact way to model and analyse the states of the uv expressed in different reference frames the position of the uv expressed in e frame is represented by a vector η r 6 1 ν r 6 1 is the velocity vector expressed in v frame with respect to e frame as given in eq 1 1 η x y z ϕ θ ψ t ν u v w p q r t here the euler angles ϕ θ and ψ commonly identified as roll pitch and yaw map the orientation of v with respect to the e frame antonelli et al 2008 the vector η in eq 2 is the time rate of change of η 2 η x y z ϕ θ ψ t the velocity vector ν comprises linear and angular velocity components here the first three terms represent the linear velocity and the latter three terms denote the angular velocity this vector can be transformed from the v to e frame by the eq 3 3 η t η ν where the coordinate transformation matrix t η in eq 4 is written in terms of the euler angles for a vehicle submerged in the fluid fossen 1994 the matrix t η s o 6 a special orthogonal group is a r 6 6 array here the number of rows 6 signifies the vehicle degrees of freedom

buoyancy and gravity acting on the submerged vehicle are called restoring forces and moments for static stability which is written as a 6 1 vector g η the vector notation of the force torque vector of the thruster input is given by eq 6 the term τ signifies the vector of generalized forces and moments without considering the environmental disturbances on the vehicle with reference to the v frame 6 τ f x f y f z m x m y m z t as represented above the detailed discussion on the hydrodynamic damping terms is found in fossen 1994 the mass distribution of the rigid body contributes to the inertia as well as to the added mass an inertia matrix can be written in a diagonal form when the vehicle is symmetric about all of its planes as the speed of the vehicle is low and the origin of v frame is considered to coincide with the centre of gravity of the uv it is safe to assume that the degrees of freedom are decoupled antonelli et al 2008 thus the rigid body rb m matrix can be simplified as a diagonal and positive definite matrix in eq 7 7 rb m m 0 0 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 0 0 i x x i x y i x z 0 0 0 i x y i y y i y z 0 0 0 i x z i y z i z z the added mass a m matrix is the effect of hydrodynamic inertia of fluid adjacent to the body that accelerates along with the vehicle this inertia is an additional effort to achieve the required acceleration opposite to the fluid flow it is equal in magnitude to the mass of boundary fluid and depends on the hull form and number of appendages it increases with the rise in the hull s projected area and the number of thrusters or controls surfaces thus the a m matrix can be abridged to a diagonal form as eq 8 considering decoupled degrees of freedom due to the same assumptions in rigid body mass tensor 8 a m x u 0 0 0 0 0 0 y v 0 0 0 0

identification and derivation of vehicle parameters i e added mass and rigid body terms by exploiting the strip theory newman 1977 dong 1978 fossen 1994 triantafyllou and hover 2003 thus for a fully submerged symmetrical rigid body travelling with low velocity the resulting m can be written as m m t 0 m 0 like the inertia matrix the centripetal and coriolis matrix c ν is also written as a sum of a rigid body and added mass components the centripetal and coriolis rigid body rb c ν matrix is a skew symmetrical matrix and this property is useful for nonlinear motion control the explicit expression for rb c ν is given in eq 9 9 rb c ν 0 0 0 0 m w m v 0 0 0 m w 0 m u 0 0 0 m v m u 0 0 m w m v 0 r i z z q i y y m w 0 m u r i z z 0 p i x x m v m u 0 q i y y p i x x 0 the terms of a c ν matrix are derived using the strip theory and can be written as the following skew symmetric matrix in eq 10 when the c g of the vehicle coincides with the origin of the v frame 10 a c ν 0 0 0 0 w z w

the viscous fluid domain as the velocity of the vehicle is low and the origin of v frame is considered to coincide with the c g of the uv it is safe to consider that the degrees of freedom are decoupled hence the hydrodynamic damping d ν is approximated as a sum of decoupled diagonal matrices consisting of linear damping d l and quadratic damping d q ν such that d ν 0 ν r 6 1 it can be safely assumed that d ν d q ν as the effect of linear damping matrix is negligible newman 1977 in this simulation the terms x u u y v v and z w w in the eq 11 are the drag coefficients along surge

and gravity acting on the submerged vehicle g η is ignored by assuming the uv as neutrally buoyant and c g coincides with the centre of buoyancy the system identification of a uv involves complex nonlinear forces these forces are the inertia hydrodynamic forces drag and lift coriolis and centripetal effects damping and the restoring forces gravity and buoyancy the comprehensive knowledge of the forces generated by the thruster against any form of environmental disturbances requires exploring kinematics and dynamics for effective modelling and control of a uv the table 1 shows the details of the identified modular vehicle system physical and geometrical parameters bak et al 2017 5 thruster model 5 1 dynamics of the thruster due to the exposed nature of the external thrusters to the surroundings in both the variants under consideration cowl based thrusters are chosen which has two fold advantages first the exposed nature of propeller blades is reduced which is a practical design concern secondly the performance enhancement in the cowl or shroud s presence benefits vehicle performance even at low speeds in the chosen thrusters for this simulation a hydrodynamically shaped cowl shroud surrounds the propeller blades to improve the static and dynamic performance the auv design process requires to explore different ways of integrating the thrusters to the vehicle hull to provide adequate control stability and manoeuvring for a given hull form few to many thruster configurations are possible thus each possibility needs to be considered based on the operability here a modular design approach provides a minimum redesign in the vehicle when operating in different configurations the main aim is to develop a multi purpose auv using external thrusters as the primary propulsion system for varied missions the thruster configuration chosen for the ftuv and vtuv variants is such that the effect of the thrust generated is identical and practically feasible for the mounting on the hull the thruster dynamics modelling considers the following aspects 1 it is not possible to consider the axial thrust loss effects entirely by using the thrust model thus an empirical model based on the bollard thrust is considered for clockwise cw and counter clockwise ccw rotations of the propeller 2 in the vtuv configuration the presence of the thruster cowl induces the axial thrust losses and ram drag effects these effects may affect the performance in real time so the simulation considers the ram drag effects in the thruster modelling 3 the thrust force saturation due to the propeller s angular velocity limitation is modelled using the empirical data 4 the thruster modelling considers the empirical model of saturation of rate of change of thrust for better accuracy 5 in the vtuv apart from the thruster saturation the internal servomotor used for vectoring also suffer saturation in generating the required tilting velocity thus based on the motor s empirical data tilting velocity saturation is also implemented 6 based on the free jet theory nienhuis 1992 faltinsen 1993 the thrust losses due to the thruster thruster and hull thruster interaction range up to 25 in the worst case thus the model considers a thrust loss due to interactions for low speed operations 5 2 thrust generation the thrust generation is modelled using a classical approach of discontinuous pressure drop kumon et al 2010 over the rotor propeller blades the rotation of the propeller fins generates high pressure zones on one side and low pressure regions on the other the resultant pressure difference delivers the required thrust for the forward motion in the fluid due to the range of pressure variation the fluid density does not change thus it is safe to consider that the mass flow rate is constant in open ducted thrusters thrust losses occur at the tip of each fin blade due to the escape of fluid from the high pressure end to the blade s suction pressure end a hydrodynamically shaped shroud cowl around the propeller blades obstructs the fluid s escape by restricting its flow to the fin blade tips if the area of the cowl converges the mass flow is conserved by compensating with a higher velocity at the trailing end this condition is met by accelerating the flow all through the duct the additional fluid flow is induced along the ducted propeller yielding more thrust at the same input power huynh 2016 the thrust generated is equal to the force required to accelerate the fluid where the propeller is the part that induces the flow through the cowl the amount of thrust generated is given by eq 12 12 t m v freestream t ρ s v induced v freestream where t is the thrust force m is the mass flow rate of the fluid through the thruster ρ is the density of the fluid s is the cross sectional area of the propeller including the cowl the v freestream is the freestream velocity of the fluid v induced is the induced velocity of the fluid due to the rotation of the propeller the induced velocity can be modelled to be proportionate to the rotational speed of the rotor propeller blades thus the thrust force can be approximated as a function of the rotational velocity of the propeller shaft in eq 13 13 t c f ω p 2 where c f is a constant coefficient and ω p is the rotor s angular velocity the steady state relationship between the rotor s angular velocity and thrust generated is nonlinear from the above equation moreover speed controlled thruster performance depends on several factors such as axial flow effects and rotational effects the propeller blades rotation induces complicated hydrodynamic phenomena simultaneously such as the lift forces and drag forces wake generation at the trailing edge and rotational acceleration at the exit of the flow moreover the dynamic model considers other effects on the rigid body such as inertial force added mass and couple generated by the pivoted thruster s vectoring thus the coefficient c f is obtained experimentally due to the complexity in the explicit modelling of the quantities mentioned above in the comparative study t200 thrusters from blue robotics inc are considered in all the configurations a brushless motor with encapsulated motor windings and stator bluerobotics 2020 an off the shelf electronic speed controller esc is used to regulate the thruster speed in both cw and ccw directions the thruster performance in both the directions is measured for a range of propeller speed it is almost impossible to derive a finite dimensional analytical model by using physics laws to model the thrust force and torque generated by a thruster this complexity is due to the difficulty in modelling the flow dynamics especially when the flow is not uniform pivano et al 2008 though it is a common practice to simplify the thruster model based on the application in our case instead of using a simplified model empirical thruster characteristics are introduced to model the underwater vehicle as shown in fig 3 in the eq 13 the constant coefficient c f is arrived by setting up the thruster in a water tank the setup measures the thruster s output force using a static load cell for a range of propeller rotational speeds controlled by micro controller by using off the shelf instrumentation the measured thrust force is plotted on the y axis against the propeller rotational speed on x axis as shown in fig 3 based on these static test results the constant coefficient c f is arrived for both forward and reverse rotation of the propeller as a quadratic function with a dead zone thus the curve yields the values of c f 5 1 0 6 for forward rotation and c f 4 1 0 6 for reverse rotation using simple regression 5 3 ftuv configuration in the ftuv configuration four thrusters are in the horizontal plane the other four thrusters are along the vertical plane fig 4 shows the position and orientation of the thrusters where the horizontal thrusters are aligned 45 to the longitudinal plane in the v frame the choice of thrusters arrangement in vtuv ensures the thrust generation in both the configurations is strictly comparable horizontal thrusters provide motion in three degrees of freedom viz surge sway and yaw directions two vertical thrusters are placed near the bow and the remaining two towards the stern on both the port and starboard sides vertical thrusters provide motion in the remaining three degrees of freedom viz heave roll and pitch directions based on fig 4 we define f f i f f a f f b f f c f f d f f e f f f f f g f f h t a vector consisting of respective thrust force values of each of the eight thrusters a to h in their respective frames where f f a f f b f f c and f f d are the horizontal thruster forces and f f e f f f f f g and f f h are the vertical thruster forces respectively the length l and breadth a of the vehicle hull is shown in fig 2b the distances between the origin of the vehicle frame to the thruster frame are shown in fig 4 the position vector of each horizontal thruster origin in the v frame is given by l h a h 0 and similarly the position vector of each vertical thruster origin in the v frame is given by l v a v 0 the generalized forces and moments in vector form τ f i f f x f f y f f z m f x m f y m f z t is expressed in v frame of reference in terms of thruster forces and rotation angles with this notion the thrust force vector f f i of all the eight thrusters in their respective thruster frames is mapped to generalized forces moment vector τ f i expressed in the v frame by the matrix b f t as shown in eq 14 14 τ f i b f t f f i where b f t 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 a v a v a v a v 0 0 0 0 l v l v l v l v l h a h 2 l h a h 2 l h a h 2 l h a h 2 0 0 0 0 5 4 vtuv configuration we have seen the fixed thruster model using empirical data now the same is extended to the thrust vectoring it is important to note that the axial thrust force generated by the thruster results from the applied force essential to change the fluid s momentum at the centre of pressure ko et al 2007 the change in the momentum of the free stream flow generates the thrust hydrodynamically in a traditional conventional ftuv the thrust vector s direction is almost collinear with the incoming fluid velocity for low to medium angles of attack in contrast in the vtuv the angle between them can be substantial as the vehicle s speed increases the momentum changes in a conventional ftuv thruster acts along the line of its axis which results in only a loss of thrust in vtuv the significant change in the direction of the thruster axis can generate drag lift and a pitching moment due to the offset between these two components the thrusters labelled a b c and d are attached to the four diagonal pivots of the rectangular hull as shown in fig 5 they are located at the same angle as that of horizontal thrusters in ftuv these thrusters are rotatable in their respective vertical plane within a range of 90 to 9 0 the resultant thrust forces of the rotatable thrusters a b c and d are represented by f v i f v a f v b f v c f v d t a vector consisting of resolved thrust force components of each rotatable thruster is given by f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 f 8 t where f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 are the horizontal components and f 5 f 6 f 7 f 8 are the vertical components of the resultant thrust forces f v a f v b f v c and f v d respectively the position vector of each rotatable thruster origin in the vehicle fixed frame is given by l h a h 0 the generalized forces and moments in vector form τ v i f v x f v y f v z m v x m v y m v z t is expressed in v frame of reference in terms of thruster forces components vector f and rotational angles as below thus the four rotatable angles can be expressed as the sine and cosine functions in the equations which is due to the orientation of the thruster with respect to v frame and due to the rotatable action of each thruster based on the relationship between force components and their corresponding resultant thrust forces the rotatable angles α a α b α c and α d in table 2 are the angles made by the thrust force vector with the horizontal plane of the t i frame the relationship between force components and their corresponding resultant thrust forces shown in the below table holds thus the resolved thrust force components of each thruster f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 f 8 t in their respective thruster frames are mapped to generalized forces moment vector in the v frame τ v i f v x f v y f v z m v x m v y m v z t by a thrust dynamics matrix b v t as shown in eq 15 15 τ v i b v t f where b v t 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 a h a h a h a h 0 0

generated at the centre of the propeller p apart from the axial thrust generated as a function of angular velocity and acceleration of the rotor the forces and torques induce another primary hydrodynamic force perpendicular to the cowl s axis this force termed as ram drag given in eq 16 is a result of a change in the direction of the free stream fluid flow acting perpendicular to the thruster axis 16 d f c d ω p v r t where c d is a constant coefficient and v r t represents the relative velocity of the fluid with respect to t i frame the details of the relative velocity are discussed in section 5 7 3 it has been theoretically and experimentally found that it is difficult to understand and analyse the drag forces at the centre of pressure and realize the dynamic system s hydrodynamic behaviour in a fluid flow since the centre of pressure varies with the angle of attack thus the resultant hydrodynamic forces are assumed to be applied at the hydrodynamic centre hc fernandes et al 2006 the ram drag has a significant influence at the hydrodynamic centre it contributes a pitching moment on the thruster and over the complete vehicle the lift and drag forces from the shroud velocity variations of the vehicle the interactive forces between the hull and the thruster and the thrust vectoring affect the location of hc yuan 2013 coincidentally the length of thruster cowl is minimal so is the variation of hc ko et al 2007 thus the hc can be safely assumed as a fixed point h at the point of intersection of the thrust axis and the trailing edge of the cowl as shown in fig 6 as mentioned already due to the rotatable action of the thrusters in their respective frames the resultant ram drag forces on the rotatable thrusters a b c and d are represented by d v i d v a d v b d v c d v d t a vector consisting of resolved ram drag force components of each rotatable thruster is given by d d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 d 5 d 6 d 7 d 8 t where d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 are the horizontal components and d 5 d 6 d 7 d 8 are the vertical components of the resultant ram drag forces d v a d v b d v c and d v d respectively the distance between the vectoring centre v and the hydrodynamic centre h is represented by a constant value vh 0 017 m whose horizontal and vertical components based on the vector angles α i are given by a vector r r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 r 8 t corresponding to each thruster it should be noted that the scalar centre distances r 1 to r 8 in the vector r are given by table 3 the generalized drag forces and moments in vector form f v i f v x f v y f v z m v x m v y m v z t is expressed in v frame in terms of ram drag forces components vector d and rotational angles thus the four rotatable angles can be expressed as the sine and cosine functions in the equations which is due to the orientation of the horizontal thruster with respect to v frame the relationship between drag force components and their corresponding resultant thrust forces is shown in table 4 thus the ram drag vector d v i d v a d v b d v c d v d t of all the four rotatable thrusters in their respective thruster frames is mapped to generalized forces moment vector expressed in the v frame by the ram drag transformation matrix b v d as shown in eq 17 the superscript d signifies the drag and subscript v denotes vectored configuration 17 f v i b v d d where b v d 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 a h r 1 2 a h r 2 2 a h r 3 2 a h r 4 2 r 5 r 6 r 7 r 8 l h r 1 2 l h r 2 2 l h r 3 2 l h r 4 2 l h a h 2 l h a h 2 l h a h 2 l h a h 2 0 0 0 0 a vital concern in any closed loop system s real time control is the individual subsystems response time based on the control input the actuator dynamics also affect system performance thus the actuators influence i e the thruster and the vectoring motor is considered by implementing the actuator saturation and response rate the observations from the initial simulations show that the actuators response for a control input is instantaneous also there is no limit on the maximum thrust provided by each thruster based on the system identification approach two critical issues are considered in modelling the actuator dynamics 5 5 saturation of the thruster for both ftuv and vtuv the actuators are the critical components of the vehicle performance and operation which suffer from the mechanical limitation during operation this limitation leads to response saturation in desired control input by the electrically powered subsystems and creates a bias in operation between the simulation model and the vehicle s actual performance so it is necessary to model these properties at least minimally by using the empirical data the thrust generated by each of the thrusters at any given point of time has a maximum threshold of f m i f m a x 60 n for cw rotation and 42 n for ccw rotation of the propeller as shown in fig 3 based on the simulations using the closed loop control the thruster attains the necessary thrust almost instantaneously nevertheless in real time there is a constraint on the time taken to reach that thrust this constraint leads to two more restrictions in the evolution of the required thrust to propel the vehicle i e the propeller s angular velocity and its time rate of change hence the simulation implements these two constraints by using the empirical data where fig 7 shows the propeller angular velocity s response rate the threshold limit of angular velocity ω threshold for cw and ccw rotations implemented in eq 18 is based on fig 3 where the value of the same is positive for cw rotation and vice versa 18 ω pmin ω threshold ω pmax similarly the second constraint the threshold rate of the angular velocity of the propeller blades ω threshold is implemented utilizing eqs 19 and 20 the ω threshold in the eq 19 is attained from the empirical data and is equal to 5876 rad s 2 19 δ ω threshold ω threshold d t the desired angular velocity of the propeller ω is given the inequality below 20 ω ω i δ ω threshold here ω i is the current angular velocity of the propeller blades ω threshold is the time rate of change of threshold angular velocity of the propeller blade of thrusters and d t is the time interval of each time step of the time domain simulation 5 6 saturation of the internal servomotor for the vtuv in the vtuv configuration the internal servomotor responsible for orienting the thruster is constrained by the angle of rotation and its time rate of change due to mechanical limitations the angle of vectored rotation is limited to only two quadrants i e from 0 to 9 0 to avoid any cable damage of the thruster during vectoring the saturation speed of the internal servomotor limits the rate of the thrust vectoring both these constraints are also implemented in the thruster model to improve the control s robustness and accuracy additionally the internal servomotor s wear and tear are also minimized due to the limit established the constraint on the rate of the angular rotation α max of the vectored thrusters is implemented utilizing eqs 21 and 22 the α max in the eq 21 is attained from the empirical data and is equal to 32 rad s 21 δ α max α max d t the desired vector angle α is given in the inequality eq 22 22 α i δ α max α α i δ α max here α i is the current vectored angle of the thrusters α max is the maximum rotation rate of the vectored angle by the internal servomotor and d t is the time interval of each time step of the time domain simulation 5 7 effects of hydrodynamic interactions in addition to physical limitations discussed already other significant factors that affect the vehicle performance are the hydrodynamic interactions these are the interaction between thruster thruster hull thruster and effect of the underwater currents eq 23 presents the actual thrust generated by each thruster 23 f actual μ tt μ th f nominal where μ tt is the thrust loss factor of the trailing thruster due to the thruster thruster interaction and μ th is the thrust loss factor given by the thruster hull interactions the nominal thrust f nominal is equal to the actual thrust f actual when the thrust losses are negligible 5 7 1 interaction of thruster thruster it is important to note that the combined interaction effects are quite challenging to understand and implement thus in this article interaction effects are modelled separately by considering the thrust losses in the form of thrust reduction ratios arrived from the model test data results dang and laheij 2004 plaza 2013 the interaction between thrusters in a vehicle results from any thruster functioning in the wake of any source thruster the induced velocity of the forward thruster wake modifies the inflow of the aft thruster it affects the available thrust and propeller torque schlichting 1979 molland et al 2011 the conflict of the wake flow on the affected thruster due to the source thruster reduces with increase in the distance between them as shown in fig 8 here x is the distance between the two tandem thrusters it is always essential to check beforehand during the simulations whether the wake of source thruster affects the downstream thruster this check is done by the defining a region for the source thruster where the aft thruster operation is prohibited this region is defined as the spread angle of the wake this study considers a spread angle of 5 green shaded region based on the approximations as discussed in arditti et al 2014 2019 to understand the effect of the source thruster on the affected one as seen in fig 8 in general identification of forbidden zones fz for the source thrusters prevents the aft thruster interaction these regions angles are defined for the source thrusters to avoid unwanted interactions on the aft thrusters the fz red shaded region is characterized by the propeller angular velocity ratio of two interacting thrusters xu et al 2016 i e the ratio of the forward thruster angular velocity to the aft thruster angular velocity the empirical data for the thrust reduction of the downstream thruster from different independent researchers schlichting 1979 nienhuis 1992 blanke et al 2000 are valid for open water operations few examples are the thrusters mounted close to a hull surface fixed thrusters positioned in tandem and other situations such as thrust vectoring a practical approach towards implementing the thruster thruster interaction in the model is derived by model tests discussed in the american bureau of shipping abs guide for dynamic positioning systems plaza 2013 eq 24 describes the thrust reduction ratio μ tt for the trailing thruster due to interactions with the source thruster 24 μ tt μ r 1 μ r γ 3 γ 2 130 μ r 3 where μ r is the thrust reduction ratio at zero tilting relative angle and γ is the relative angle between the source thruster and the centreline that connects the thrusters in degrees as the fz can be dynamically defined based on the interacting thrusters rotation ratio it is feasible to modify the design by predefining a smaller fz this modification is done by placing the aft thruster away from the existing fz thus minimizing the thruster thruster interaction but there is a caveat the fig 8 shows that the spread angle overlaps with the fz for a particular range therefore a different skipping strategy is required to avoid fz during the thrust action thus based on the empirical data shown in arditti et al 2019 for a thrust reduction ratio of 10 the thrust loss of aft vertical thrusters is calculated to be around 14 5 7 2 interaction between hull thruster unlike the hull thruster interactions several systematic experimental results lead to realistic and consistent formulae for the thruster thruster interactions the interaction between the hull and the thruster is much more complicated compared to interaction between thrusters a significant factor for the complication is the thruster orientation and the hull form the slipstream from the thruster tends to adhere to the hull surface based on the thruster position and orientation with respect to the vehicle the interaction of the slipstream of the thrusters is mainly due to the pressure drag forces over the vehicle hull surface where the slipstream from the propeller is drawn towards the boundary surface vehicle hull due to the coanda effect faltinsen 1993 the coanda effect can be termed as the resultant force from the wake to the vehicle hull due to the differential pressure between the low pressure high velocity stream and the low velocity high pressure boundary surface hull this effect leads to the interaction between the thruster and the hull in the form of resistance to the flow drag which mainly depends on the hull s shape empirically this reduction is in the range of 3 to 12 nienhuis 1992 arditti et al 2019 in this study we use the maximum reduction ratio for a conservative approach thus interaction effects are modelled by considering the thrust losses as thrust reduction ratios the thrust degradation due to hull friction is arrived based on the hull s length and breadth from the analytical relations dang and laheij 2004 plaza 2013 5 7 3 interaction of ocean currents in the 3 d cartesian space a resultant average current velocity v c is defined to model the underwater ocean currents considering two orientation angles a sideslip angle β c and angle of attack γ c with respect to the e frame of reference as shown in fig 9 the oceanic stream is assumed to be irrotational and varies gradually with time i e virtually steady also the flow parameters γ c β c and v c are assumed to be constant for simplification purpose the parameter values used in this simulation are γ c π 6 β c π 3 and v c 0 2 m s however the capability of the vehicle under variable disturbances is discussed in the author s previous work kadiyam et al 2020 the current velocity v c is expressed in its component form using the vector v c e u c e v c e w c e 0 0 0 t as seen in eq 25 25 u c e v c cos γ c cos β c v c e v c sin β c w c e v c sin γ c cos β c to understand the effects of the current velocity v c on the uv and thrusters in their corresponding frames we define two vectors v c v u c v v c v w c v 0 0 0 t in v and v c t u c t v c t w c t 0 0 0 t in the t i frames of reference respectively similarly the vectors v v and v t represent the velocity of the vehicle and thrusters in their respective frames of reference the relative velocity between the vehicle velocity and ocean currents is given by the vector v r v expressed in the v frame of reference in short termed as relative vehicle velocity similarly the relative velocity between the thruster speed and oceanic currents is given by the vector v r t expressed in the t i frame also termed as thruster relative velocity as seen in eq 26 below 26 v r v v v v c v v r t v t v c t a transformation matrix h θ so 3 a special orthogonal group of order 3 is represented by eq 27 the angle θ is represents the orientation angles n π 4 and α i of the t i with reference to v frame 27 h λ θ i 3 3 s i n θ 1 cos θ s 2 λ where s λ s s 3 a skew symmetric matrix of order 3 for the unit vector λ λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 t if s λ s t λ the one axis rotations can be obtained by setting λ 1 0 0 t λ 0 1 0 t and λ 0 0 1 t corresponding to x y and z axis of t i frame it is assumed that the maximum current velocity is not more than 0 5 m s during the operation which may result in reduced thrust productivity of the thrusters the linear velocity vector of the oceanic currents in the thruster fixed frame is given by eq 28 28 u c t v c t w c t h i t n π 4 h i t α i u c v v c v w c v the matrices h i t n π 4 and h i t α i rotates the velocity vector from v frame to t i frame by using the two orientation angles of the thrusters with respect to the v frame here n represents an integer 1 or 1 based on the orientation of the thruster as already discussed the oceanic current velocity vector v c g is assumed to be varying slowly with time where g is defined by frames e v or t i thus we can write v r g as in eq 29 in its respective frame of reference 29 v c g 0 v r g v g the linear velocity vector of the oceanic currents in the v frame is given by eq 30 30 u c v v c v w c v t 1 t η u c e v c e w c e here the eq 4 gives the matrix t 1 η thus the equations of motion of the vehicle in the v frame are modified to eq 31 31 m v r v c v r v v r v d v r v v r v g η τ where from eq 14 τ τ f i for the ftuv and from eqs 15 and 17 τ τ v i f v i for the vtuv configuration 6 nonlinear tracking controller design feedback controllers use the system s output to regulate the error where the control action depends on the difference between the output and desired value decentralized and linear controllers such as proportional integral and derivative controllers pids may not provide the required results as that of the model based control methods for highly non linear systems due to the cancellation of potentially useful non linearities thus it is necessary to design a nonlinear controller by implementing complex dynamics such as nonlinear disturbances in the presence of modelling uncertainties we utilize one such nonlinear controller formulation to develop stabilizing control suitable for strict feedback systems a specific class of nonlinear dynamical systems these systems are propagated from subsystems that radiate out from an irreducible subsystem that can be stabilized using some other method krstic et al 1995 these lower order or irreducible systems exhibit flexibility to solve robust complex stabilization and tracking control problems khalil and grizzle 2002 in the simulation we attempt to design a scheme that demonstrates certain advantages over other existing control schemes to overcome the singularities by a certain extent krstic et al 1995 however it is impossible to design pure state feedback time invariant asymptotically stable controller to satisfy the required performance globally because of the closed loop system s very nature we define two subsystems recursively where the kinematics is considered the first subsystem inner loop and the dynamics as the second outer loop this recursive procedure interlaced with a lyapunov function s choice progressively stabilizes each outer subsystem from a known stable system to stabilize the vehicle within a prescribed error while tracking the desired trajectory before discussing the controller design we define a second order control affine strict feedback system in the eq 32 it shows the formulation in its general mathematical sense 32 y 1 g 1 y 1 g 2 y 1 y 2 y 2 g 3 y 1 y 2 g 4 y 1 y 2 u it can be observed from the above irreducible subsystems that the first subsystem in eq 32 resembles the kinematics eq 3 the second subsystem resembles the dynamics eq 31 where each subsystem is dealt separately for the stabilization in this control scheme a state variable is chosen as an intermediate control variable for virtual control these variables are reliant on the state of the system and by utilizing these intermediate controllers the outer loop is designed as seen in fig 10 the control objective is to keep the system stable for any initial condition by regulating the state to the vicinity of the origin consider eqs 3 and 31 where η is the vector of state variables the design involves stabilization of the η to the origin equilibrium by means of ν after defining and forcing tracking error term η in eq 33 to zero in this context we require η d η d η d as the known continuous and bounded functions note we consider the terms ν v r v for brevity in the derivation of control strategy 33 η η d η a decreasing exponential function of the tracking error η is considered in eq 34 to regulate the state η towards an asymptotically stable condition with a positive constant decay of k 1 and a vector of scaling parameters γ 34 η γ e k 1 t an ode as seen in eq 35 can be written based on the above equation 35 η k 1 η 0 the time rate of change of tracking error in eq 33 gives eq 36 36 η η d t η ν a backstepping error ν is defined by introducing a virtual desired velocity controller ν c into eq 36 this leaves us with eq 37 37 η η d t η ν c t η ν where ν is given by eq 38 38 ν ν c ν at this juncture a transformation matrix t η d based on the desired orientation is defined to account for any unmodelled dynamics in the system this unaccounted dynamics is considered as a disturbance and the controller requires to take care of the same in the absence of t η d thus from eqs 3 and 31 a virtual desired velocity controller ν c is chosen and written as eq 39 39 ν c t 1 η d η t 1 η d η d k 1 η and therefore eq 3 leaves us with eq 40 40 η t η t 1 η d η d k 1 η t η ν as the values of ν and ν c are initially different the control effort regulates ν to follow ν c accordingly the control vector input τ c is designed by taking the derivative of the backstepping error from eq 38 thus we have eq 41 41 ν ν c ν based on the eq 39 the derivative of ν c is given by the eq 42 42 ν c t 1 η d η d k 1 η t 1 η d η d k 1 η the dynamics of system can be written as eq 43 43 ν m 1 τ o η ν where o η ν c ν ν d ν ν g η therefore the thrust force vector is chosen from the vector of control forces moments τ c from eqs 14 and 15 by implementing the stability analysis 6 1 lyapunov stability criterion a positive definite lyapunov candidate function l is considered for the dynamical system as seen in eq 44 44 l η ν 1 2 η t η 1 2 ν t ν where l η ν 0 t η ν the dynamical system is said to be global asymptotically stable when the time derivative of lyapunov candidate function l is negative definite the control vector input τ c is chosen as in eq 45 such that l η ν 0 45 τ c o η ν m k 2 ν t t η η m t 1 η d η d k 1 η t 1 η d η d k 1 η by substituting eq 45 in eqs 14 and 15 the thrust vector components are given as shown in eq 46 46 for ftuv f f i b m j o η ν b m j m k 2 ν t t η η b m j m t 1 η d η d k 1 η t 1 η d η d k 1 η for vtuv f b m j o η ν b m j m k 2 ν t t η η b m j m t 1 η d η d k 1 η t 1 η d η d k 1 η as b m j is a non square matrix it not possible to invert it thus the moore penrose pseudoinverse b m j is utilized to find the vector of thrust components the time derivative of the lyapunov candidate function is given by the eq 47 47 l η ν η t k 1 η ν t k 2 ν 0 hence it can be written as l η ν 0 t η ν when the gains k 1 and k 2 0 this proves that the designed nonlinear controller ensures global asymptotic stability of the system the choice of appropriate gain constants as seen in table 5 is realized by trial and error considering the root mean square rms of position and orientation error of the uv 7 results of trajectory tracking simulations the constraints described in table 6 are implemented to show the effect of thruster dynamics on robot performance this section discusses the simulation results of a spatial trajectory tracking of the two configurations for a reference path generated 7 1 ftuv variant the simulation results of the ftuv configuration with the performance constraints are discussed here later the results of the vtuv configuration are shown then a comparative study of the results from both variants is discussed the trajectory chosen for this comparison is a spatial infinity shaped profile defined by a desired position vector η 1 d t 2 2 c o s 0 1 t 2 s i n 0 2 t 2 2 c o s 0 1 t t expressed in the e frame where t is the simulation time step the tracking plot of the manoeuvre is presented in fig 11 where the desired trajectory is defined by using c 2 continuity i e the velocity and acceleration constraints along with the position profile is defined for smooth and continuous tracking capability the desired trajectory is indicated by the red coloured profile whereas the blue profile indicates the simulated trajectory the trajectory tracking simulations are performed using the mentioned backstepping control scheme for 64 s as the velocity profile constraints require 64 s to complete one complete cycle of the infinity profile fig 12 shows that the initial tracking errors are in the order of 0 1 m or rad in both position heave and orientation yaw after around 2 3 s the surge sway and heaves errors converge close to the neighbourhood of the zero with very negligible oscillations in the roll pitch and yaw errors though the values are also near the zero range the oscillations in the yaw and the roll directions are slightly higher than the translational errors this difference can be attributed to the orientation profiles in the infinity trajectory as mentioned in table 6 the performance constraints in the form of the thruster s saturation are induced in the thruster dynamics of the vtuv configuration it limits the amount of possible thrust force generated from the thrusters this limitation allows simulating the real time performance of the vehicle control system against constraints the thruster interaction effects with the mentioned performance constraints are established in the time series plots figs 13 and 14 shows the time series plots of the thrust generated by the vehicle considering all the constraints in vtuv configuration it can be observed from fig 13 that the thrust generated by all the four horizontal thrusters a b c and d reach to a maximum limit of 60 n in the positive direction and 40 n in the reverse direction which matches with the threshold of the thrust generated by a t200 thruster these peak values occur to counter high initial tracking errors after the high initial thrust the maximum thrust appears in thrusters a and b with a threshold limited to 18 n this indicates that the proposed control scheme could generate the required thrust for the tracking nevertheless a small chattering is observed near the zero thrust locations in all the four horizontal thrusters it proves that the model could also clearly replicate the dead zone characteristics as shown in fig 13 figs 15 and 16 further strengthen this argument here the chattering occurs only in the regions when the propeller s angular velocity operates near the thruster s dead zone range another factor contributing to this chattering is the rate of change of the position profile at these junctures here the pitch and yaw requirements dominate the other linear motion requirements thus these requirements are compensated by the vertical thrusters as seen in fig 14 the thrust dynamics matrix reconfigures the manoeuvring requirements in the zero thrust regions of the horizontal thruster and the vertical thrusters produce the essential thrust in contrast to the horizontal thrusters the vertical ones did not compensate for the high initial tracking errors as the heave errors are low compared to the sway and surge errors combined another factor affecting the vertical thrust values is the interaction effects directly acting on the vertical thrusters under the influence of horizontal thrusters thus it can be seen in fig 14 that the thrust values of all the vertical thrusters are relatively low compared to the thrust generated by the horizontal thrusters a further clarity can be gained on the thrust loss during the comparative analysis with the vtuv configuration the limitation of the maximum angular velocity and time rate of the change of the same influences the maximum thrust produced and the time rate of thrust variation fig 15 shows the saturated thrust values for both the positive and reverse rotational direction of the propeller shaft the threshold value of around 3750 revolutions per minute rpm on either side causes different maximum thrust values since the propeller performs poorly for the reverse angular velocity thus from figs 13 and 15 it can be observed that the threshold angular velocity in the positive direction produces a maximum net thrust of 60 n in contrast in the reverse direction the same angular velocity produces a maximum thrust of 40 n the vertical thrusters the thrusters operate close to the dead zone for a considerable amount of the simulation time as seen in fig 16 the vertical thrusters maximum angular velocity is around 60 80 of the horizontal ones due to the interaction effects 7 2 vtuv variant after the discussion on the ftuv configuration in the previous section the simulation results of the vtuv configuration with the performance constraints are shown here as the comparative study requires similar characteristics to be understood the same infinity profile is chosen with respect to the inertial reference frame fig 17 shows the vehicle s performance in following the desired trajectory indicated by the red coloured profile using the designed control scheme in contrast the blue profile is the simulated vehicle trajectory it is obvious to observe that the trend of the initial tracking errors is similar to the ftuv configuration the values are in the order of 0 1 m rad for both position heave and orientation yaw as seen in fig 18 this similarity is due to the reason that both variants track the same profile another similarity in the tracking errors plot is that the surge sway and heaves errors converge close to the vicinity of the zero after around 2 3 s with minor oscillations in the roll and yaw errors however the values are still near to the zero range the oscillations in the yaw and the roll directions are slightly higher than the translational errors due to the given trajectory s orientation profiles the vehicle performance comparison is made on both the variants by inducing the constraints in table 6 where a higher number of restrictions apply to the vtuv configuration than the ftuv the simulation results of the vtuv configuration show that the maximum thrust generated is limited to a maximum value of 60 n in the positive direction and 40 n in the reverse direction a chattering is observed due to low thrust requirement while operating near the dead zone region contrary to the ftuv results the thrust forces are maintained at a minimum level of 5 10 n due to continuous thrust demand at every instant it can be seen from fig 19 that the continuous thrust demand by the control system reaches to a maximum limit of 20 n which is well below the threshold of the t200 thruster the peak values of thrust occur to counter the high initial tracking errors and the high manoeuvring requirements that arise at similar time frames like that of the ftuv variant another interesting observation is that the thrust reversal in the ftuv variant is smooth from negative to positive or vice versa compared to a quick reversal not instantaneous thrust in its counterpart this performance could be attributed to the fact that vertical thrusters counteract the mild thrust requirements in the vertical plane in the ftuv on the other hand in the vtuv configuration the sharp reversals in the desired spatial infinity trajectory s velocity profile demand the sudden reversals of thrust these reversals are observed due to the absence of additional thrusters to balance the required control action thus all the thrusters continuous action in vtuv is necessary this condition demands comparatively high values and quick reversal of thrust forces compared to the ftuv thus the proposed control scheme could generate the required thrust for the tracking with thrust reversals and comparatively higher thrust the thrust values generated by the vtuv has a direct correlation with the angular velocity of the propeller as shown in fig 20 unlike the ftuv where the chattering occurs near the thruster s dead zone range the continuous high angular velocity requirement provides a smooth thrust profile in the time frames where the time rate of change of the profile change rapidly the control system compensates these changes by a change in the direction of rotation of the propeller shaft in contrast to the ftuv vertical thrusters which did not compensate much for the high tracking errors due to the horizontal thrusters interaction effects the vtuv compensated by quick thrust reversal in the absence of thruster thruster interactions due to the tilting velocity ram drag effects are induced over the thrusters as disturbances these disturbances are to be taken care of by the controller apart from the other interaction effects the magnitude of the thrust vector velocities and their direction directly impact the ram drag magnitude the tilting velocities are affected by the saturation of the internal servomotors hence the thrust vector velocities are limited to a threshold of 32 rad s on both positive and negative directions as seen in fig 21 based on these velocities the ram drag values reach a maximum of 1 5 n which is approximately 10 of the instantaneous thrust forces of each thruster as seen in fig 22 the thrust forces and ram drag effects follow a similar pattern as that of the vector velocity the quick thrust and drag reversals happen simultaneously where the vector velocity reaches its threshold this phenomenon occurs due to the vector angles limitation in the range of 9 0 as shown in fig 23 in the absence of this limitation the variation of the thrust values is smooth despite this advantage it is safe to limit the vector angles for the sake of simplicity in mechanical design thus the vtuv performance is also smooth with additional performance constraints compared to the ftuv 7 3 discussion on the comparative analysis after considering the performance constraints to effectively compare both the variants the simulation results in terms of the power consumed or thruster load for the trajectory tracking of both the ftuv and vtuv configurations are given in figs 24 27 the thrusters power consumption is established using the empirical results here the power characteristics are arrived using the voltage and the current data thus a quartic polynomial is employed as seen in eq 48 to describe the power consumption the description is based on the propeller shaft s angular velocity with 0 998 as the coefficient of determination r squared value 48 p t p 1 t ω p 4 p 2 t ω p 3 p 3 t ω p 2 p 4 t ω p p 5 t where p 1 t 2 1 0 12 p 2 t 8 1 0 10 p 3 t 9 1 0 6 p 4 t 0 0049 and p 5 t 3 2546 fig 24 shows the instantaneous power consumption based on the horizontal thruster characteristics here each thruster s initial load reaches a maximum value of 500 w for the initial 2 3 s after that the maximum instantaneous thrust load on the front horizontal thruster reaches 100 w at around 40 s to compensate for the manoeuvring action similarly in fig 25 it can be observed that the maximum thrust load of 100 w on the aft vertical thrusters g and h occurs at around 5 8 s after the start of the simulation the result shows that the aft vertical thrusters take care of the vehicle s manoeuvrability requirement during the beginning for a pitch up condition the front horizontal thrusters take care of the latter need for the tight yaw in the vtuv configuration the thrust loads of four thrusters are also calculated based on the empirical results fig 26 shows the instantaneous power consumption of the thrusters where the initial load of each thruster reaches to a maximum value of 500 w for the initial 2 3 s after that the maximum instantaneous thrust load on the front two thrusters reaches to the range of 100 w around 40 s where the vehicle performs a manoeuvring action similarly the aft two thrusters take care of the manoeuvring requirements at 8 10 s after the start of simulation with a maximum thrust load of 50 80 w fig 27 shows that the maximum instantaneous load of 250 w acts on the diagonal motors b and c and occurs at around 18 s after the start of the simulation during most of the operation time the power consumption is almost negligible equal to the motors minimum operational load the power consumption by the servomotors is instantaneous due to the requirement of thrust reversals otherwise for a continuous 360 operation the total power consumption would be smooth and barely high based on the instantaneous power consumption the vehicle s total energy expenditure is arrived by calculating the total area under the plot for all the thrusters considering each of the power consumption plots simultaneously for the ftuv and the vtuv table 7 shows the values of the total energy consumed for the entire simulation time of 64 s it is assumed the hotel load for both the variants remain the same for better comparison it can be inferred from the results using the empirical relations that the vtuv consumes lesser total power than the ftuv configuration i e about 26 lesser for the same trajectory tracking problem however the power consumed by each thruster is more in the vtuv i e about 23 high compared to the ftuv configuration this comparison proves that the consumption of power in the vtuv is reduced by using servomotors where the thrusters consume more than their counterparts in the ftuv variant the maximum oscillations observed after the initial tracking errors are in the order of 0 025 0 03 m rad against comparatively high tracking errors of 0 04 0 06 m rad in the vtuv variant this increase in the error values is due to a single thruster s action versus the two thrusters in ftuv to achieve the same effect nevertheless as this error difference is quite reasonable it suggests that the vtuv configuration can perform well on par with its counterpart fig 13 shows the ftuv horizontal thrust values and fig 19 shows the vtuv thrust values a behaviour worth noting in these thrust generation plots is that the diagonal thrusters demand the same amount of thrust at the initial point and in the same direction this behaviour shows that the vehicle requires a significant component of thrust from the horizontal thrusters fig 23 shows that the average full operational range of the vtuv thrust is close to the 0 for most of the active time hence the described trajectory tracking problem effectively depends more on the horizontal thrusters of the ftuv or an effective vector angle close to the vehicle frame s horizontal plane as the total power consumed by the vtuv is lower compared to the ftuv configuration the power consumed per actuator is also about 26 lesser thus for the same thrust output the vtuv occupies lesser space has better autonomy and weighs lighter than the ftuv nevertheless based on the thrust and power plots it can be understood that the comparatively continuous high thrust operation leads to more tear in the vtuv compared to the ftuv due to the increase in the number of thrusters the form drag of the ftuv considerably increases which leads to a considerable vehicle resistance in most cases some redundant thrusters are invoked only during complex tracking to reduce the control scheme s complexity and power consumption thus some of the thrusters remain idle for most of the mission time leading to the under utilized resources 8 concluding remarks a simulation based detailed comparative study on an auv performance with different configurations using vectored and fixed thruster is presented in this article various performance constraints on the thrusters are implemented in the same vehicle with different propulsion strategies its main purpose is to see the vectored thruster s applicability compared to the fixed thruster vehicles towards good manoeuvrability demanding applications in the vtuv four independent internal servomotors tilt four thrusters the ftuv utilizes eight fixed thrusters for independent propulsion the simulations are performed by constraining the vehicle parameters such as the thrust saturation effect of the propeller s angular velocity interaction effects of the thrusters with other thrusters and the hull by defining each thruster s spread range this modelling includes all the constraints in the ftuv configuration except the thruster thruster interaction in vtuv few additional performance constraints are implemented due to the thrusters vectoring action such as ram drag effects and the internal servomotor s saturation furthermore a non linear controller was designed based on the backstepping scheme for a tracking problem to provide both the vehicle s variants with autonomous navigation capabilities an underwater robot s control for a trajectory tracking problem is useful for any multidisciplinary autonomous operability in real time applications the system stability has been addressed using the simulation results and was proven that it achieves global asymptotic stability the discussed vehicle system is currently under fabrication it uses an inertial measurement unit imu to estimate its position and orientation a pressure sensor is installed external to the hull to measure the vehicle depth a short baseline sbl system with an array of hydrophones is mounted in the tank to validate the imu position data the vehicle also consists of a single board computer system to process the feedback data from the sensors and generate the control signals to the actuators accordingly as a part of the future scope it is planned to measure the imu data s drift and validate with the sbl system both vehicle variants have been corroborated through simulations and the comparative results show the performance difference between the two configurations it has been observed from the performance comparison that the power consumed by the vtuv is lower compared to the ftuv configuration under similar conditions the power consumed per actuator in the vtuv is about 26 lesser this comparison shows that for the same thrust output the vtuv has an advantage of occupying lesser space better autonomy and weighing lighter compared to the ftuv nevertheless the high thrust operation in the vtuv leads to more wear and tear of the actuators than the ftuv in the case of fault tolerance capabilities the ftuv has an advantage over the vtuv due to thruster redundancy that reduces the risk of vehicle loss during the missions in subsystem faults the ftuv has a clear advantage over the vtuv due to thruster redundancy without any unique fault tolerance algorithms thus the redundancy of thrusters in ftuv helps to ease the controller design and leads to comparatively low risk of vehicle loss during the missions in vtuv the fault tolerant design kadiyam et al 2020 becomes complex compared to the ftuv it is due to the coupling between the horizontal and vertical thrust thus vtuv requires additional fault tolerant mechanisms for safety based on both the configurations advantages and limitations it can be summarized that a vectored thrust vehicle can act as a potential alternative to the fixed thrusters vehicle in the challenging missions where manoeuvrability is a crucial factor credit authorship contribution statement jagadeesh kadiyam

20544,in the recent past intervention class autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have gained the ocean marine research community s attention due to their multidisciplinary operational capabilities this article discusses a detailed comparative performance study of an underwater vehicle uv with two different actuator configurations based on fixed thrusters and vectored thrusters the fixed thruster configuration consists of eight thrusters four thrusters generate thrust in the horizontal plane and the remaining thrusters produce thrust in heave direction the vectored thruster configuration has four thrusters placed at diagonal corners of a rectangular vehicle and four independent internal servomotors rotate these thrusters the classification terminology in this article identifies the underwater vehicle without vectoring capability as fixed thruster underwater vehicle ftuv and the one with vectoring capability as vectored thruster underwater vehicle vtuv furthermore a nonlinear controller is designed based on a backstepping scheme for tracking a given spatial profile in a three dimensional space an underwater robot s control for a trajectory tracking problem is useful for any real time multidisciplinary autonomous applications the comparative simulation results are summarized to validate both the vehicle variants performance differences keywords vectored thrust

underwater vehicles are generally used in ocean observations monitoring marine flora and fauna ocean ecology and geoscience these vehicles also termed as long range uvs usually focus on the low drag hull forms to reduce losses due to the dissipative forces they typically employ rear thrusters to increase thruster efficiency by reducing the flow separation often manoeuvred by control surfaces to improve autonomy these vehicles are generally underactuated with the number of independently controllable inputs four less than the required degrees of freedom six leading to dependency coupled motion between the translation and rotation on the other hand complex surveying palmer 2009 maintenance and defence missions employ fully actuated or fully manoeuvrable auvs the primary prerequisites in designing these vehicles are agility and multi directional thrust response holonomy this holonomy makes these vehicles more power exhaustive with diminished endurance thus each class has its advantages and limitations in recent times the demand for the new generation of underwater robots kadiyam and mohan 2019 to perform a broader range of operations with contrasting capabilities has increased hence a new approach is required to develop uvs which should achieve excellent manoeuvring capabilities without compromising autonomy with that objective in mind two configurations of the same vehicle are compared by implementing and modifying the propulsion system several architectures were proposed based on the propulsion system application and capabilities to perform specific missions the number of thrusters for the vehicle is chosen based on the application and the mission conventionally the uvs use aft thrusters with control surfaces ferguson and pope 2000 for good endurance and multiple thrusters over actuated for good manoeuvrability antonelli et al 2001 the multiple thruster layout is widely used in commercial vehicles to meet the manoeuvrability requirements this study provides an opportunity to extend the vtuvs real time application to a broader research community using innovative solutions and state of the art tools the research on these vehicles is rigorous from the last decade in the underwater community le page and holappa 2000 cavallo et al 2004 ehlers et al 2014 bak et al 2017 with few cases of experiments guo and lin 2011 jin et al 2015 meyer et al 2013 in the underwater vehicle terminology the vectored thruster configuration is synonymous to the pivoted tiltable rotatable thrusters in ships the same is termed as azimuth thruster configuration vtuvs employ servomotors for the vectored thrust with comparatively less unit weight per actuator than the conventional uvs this modification effectively results in highly coupled and nonlinear equations of motion due to which the complexity of the dynamic model and the controller design increases the rise in the number of control inputs from four to eight helps achieve more independent controllable inputs than the required degrees of freedom thus an over actuated system is realized faul and katupitiya 2015 with the redundancy in control inputs compared to the former this redundancy helps the vtuv to follow an arbitrary trajectory this article presents a simulation based comparative study of fixed thruster underwater vehicle ftuv and vectored thruster underwater vehicle vtuv operating in similar conditions missions by understanding their performance characteristics specific to a rectangular shaped hull a dynamic model is developed for both the configurations using the decomposed nonlinear force characteristics in the horizontal and vertical directions the thrust generated with respect to the propeller blade s angular velocity is based on the empirical results blanke et al 2000 additionally the forces generated in the vtuv configuration thrusters are simulated by considering the ram drag effects perpendicular to the thrust forces ko et al 2007 in the ftuv configuration the vertical thrusters are placed to not interfere with the forbidden zone fz of the horizontal thrusters arditti et al 2019 furthermore an optimized controller design is necessary to control the underwater robot s two configurations in the vtuv variant the controller design is challenging due to the system nonlinearity caused by the rotatable thrusters the complexity further increases in the presence of disturbances a tracking controller is designed for both the variants based on the model parameters and the pose error the simulation results are presented to validate the proposed controller by comparing ftuv and vtuv 2 background and research rationale the high mobility agility requirements during the operations such as vertical mooring jacket surveys mine detection pipeline maintenance and other operations under highly variable environment is still an unsolved problem due to the complexity involved in realizing the control for manoeuvring motions most of the existing current vehicles use multiple thrusters mounted at different locations on the vehicle to achieve the required high operability requirements the flexibility of attaining multi directional control at zero speed state demands redundancy in the thrust forces thus the multiple redundant thruster layout is quite widely used in high manoeuvrability requirements a torpedo shaped auv called delphin2 is an over actuated hover capable system developed for manoeuvring research philips et al 2013 in a few other vehicles similar thruster layouts are implemented to increase the manoeuvring capabilities he et al 2013 tanakitkorn et al 2018 due to the increase in the number of external appendages the additional form drag leads to a substantial rise in the vehicle s resistance also in most cases to reduce the complexity of the control scheme and the power consumption some of the redundant thrusters are invoked only during tracking dynamic station keeping tasks santhakumar and asokan 2013 this redundancy leads to under utilization of resources as some thrusters remain idle for most of the mission time wang et al 2019 if somehow an enhancement in the system enables changing the direction of the thrust then the agility and manoeuvrability of the uv improve in the past few vehicles ehlers et al 2014 meyer et al 2013 gu and guo 2017 implemented pivoted thrusters concept to perform a holonomic control of the six degrees of freedom of the auv a comparative study at the university of florence implemented a reconfigurable propulsion layout with pivoted thrusters on the marta auv pugi et al 2018 it aims to understand the performance of the pivoted thruster layout compared to the conventional benchmark test vehicle however it did not consider the interaction effects or the other performance constraints on the thruster performance thus the current work implements the thrusters performance constraints to replicate real life issues in the simulations the vtuv system uses thrusters pivoted about particular axes to change the thrust directions the complete or partial rotation tilt vectoring depends on the mechanism and application masmitja et al 2018 few auvs with spatial linkages utilize a 2 dof single vector thruster to provide propulsion as well as manoeuvring cavallo and michelini 2004 however these vehicle mechanisms have difficulties such as redundant degree of freedom due to the complexity in driving the mechanism and relatively complex control due to the presence of redundant linkages inherent to these mechanisms the thruster s orientation may not follow the desired value at certain positions which affects the stability of the underwater vehicle cavallo et al 2004 thus an internal servomotor is connected to a sealed shaft to tilt the external thrusters to simplify the mechanism and accomplish the required attitude with a minimum number of thrusters this modification helps avoid wasting the power resources required in multiple thruster layout vehicles and redundancy of degrees of freedom in mechanism based vectored thruster vehicle the lower number of appendages help to reduce the resistance and improve the utility of the available resources here the proposed two variants are evaluated by understanding both the propulsion strategies possible outcomes by considering the possibilities and limitations 3 organization of the article the subsequent portion of the article discusses the modelling and analysis procedures explored and adopted for simulating the ftuv and vtuv variants with various performance constraints the mathematical modelling of uv in section 4 discusses the system description basic frame definitions kinematics and dynamics considering all the hydrodynamics aspects in section 5 the details of the thruster modelling for both the configurations considering few safe assumptions which include the dynamics of the thrusters saturation characteristics and various interaction effects later section 6 details the controller design based on the backstepping and its derivation of stability aspects for gain tuning in section 7 the results of simulations are presented initially followed by a detailed discussion on comparative analysis for both the variants section 8 summarizes the concluding remarks of the study 4 modelling the kinematics and dynamics of the uv a nonlinear mathematical model of the underwater robot emphasizing the thruster dynamics is derived using the newton eulerian approach the vehicle is considered as a rigid body operating in full six degree of freedom extensive efforts are required to examine every aspect that may affect the uv dynamics e g mass inertial hydrodynamic and mechanical properties of the vehicle these aspects help deliver a thorough physical understanding of the system towards a comprehensive mathematical model an attempt to derive the uv s full dynamics using the first principles such as the laws of mechanics and hydrodynamics is termed as white box modelling yuan 2013 the models based on these first principles provide a basis to generate linearized vehicle models for designing simple controllers however it is not easy to obtain accurate system parameters using the first principles due to the complex physical structure and hydrodynamic characteristics this complexity further increases when it functions in a wide operational range such as cruising hovering position keeping and tracking thus a comprehensive approach called grey box modelling yuan and katupitiya 2012 is required to obtain an accurate validated model using the empirical data which is a system identification process in this approach the system s unknown physical parameters are identified based on actual empirical input output data recorded here the thruster and the internal servomotor s performance characteristics are obtained from the empirical data the unknown vehicle physical parameters are obtained for designing the controller using simple regression techniques 4 1 system description the modular rectangular shaped hull of the uv has two possible variants the ftuv configuration in fig 1a has eight thrusters with four vertical thrusters mounted in tandem along the v x axis on both the port and starboard side of the vehicle the other four thrusters are fixed horizontally 45 to the longitudinal plane of the vehicle frame similarly in the vtuv configuration four rotatable thrusters are pivoted about the hull s diagonal axis actuated by four independent internal servomotors as shown in fig 1b as both the variants of the uv have eight inputs kadiyam et al 2020 to accomplish six independent degrees of freedom pose the resulting vehicle is over actuated these independent thrusters are considered as rigid bodies with a relative motion to the hull in the vtuv variant in the ftuv configuration there is no relative motion between the hull and thrusters thus the entire vehicle including the thrusters can be considered as a single rigid body with force inputs at their respective locations 4 2 kinematics of the vehicle it is essential to define the reference coordinate frames to model a uv here the euler angles represent the vehicle s orientation in the e frame also all the parameters are defined using the state space representation for the ease of modelling 4 2 1 coordinate frames definition the coordinate frames e earth inertial v vehicle and t i thruster are defined to model the kinematics and dynamics of the uv during operation as depicted in fig 2 here i represents the thrusters a to h in ftuv as shown in fig 2a similarly in the vtuv i represents the thrusters a to d as shown in fig 2b the coordinate frame e is assumed to follow the north east down ned notation somewhere at a known point on the earth s surface the e x axis points along the north e y axis along east and e z axis points downwards the origin of the v frame is fixed to the body of the vehicle and coincides with the c g here the v x axis points in the forward direction the v y axis points due starboard and the v z axis points down to the uv t i represents four additional coordinate frames attached to each thruster assembly of the vtuv as there is a relative motion between the hull and the thrusters these frames are located at the points where each thruster mounting arm axis intersects their respective axis of rotation of the propeller the t x i axis points forward i e about the propeller axes of rotation perpendicular to the vectoring axes the t y i axis is along the starboard and t z i axis direction completes the right hand rule in the t i frame 4 2 2 state space representation of the uv the state space representation offers a compact way to model and analyse the states of the uv expressed in different reference frames the position of the uv expressed in e frame is represented by a vector η r 6 1 ν r 6 1 is the velocity vector expressed in v frame with respect to e frame as given in eq 1 1 η x y z ϕ θ ψ t ν u v w p q r t here the euler angles ϕ θ and ψ commonly identified as roll pitch and yaw map the orientation of v with respect to the e frame antonelli et al 2008 the vector η in eq 2 is the time rate of change of η 2 η x y z ϕ θ ψ t the velocity vector ν comprises linear and angular velocity components here the first three terms represent the linear velocity and the latter three terms denote the angular velocity this vector can be transformed from the v to e frame by the eq 3 3 η t η ν where the coordinate transformation matrix t η in eq 4 is written in terms of the euler angles for a vehicle submerged in the fluid fossen 1994 the matrix t η s o 6 a special orthogonal group is a r 6 6 array here the number of rows 6 signifies the vehicle degrees of freedom and the number of columns 6 equals the vehicle generalized coordinates respectively craig 2009 4 t η t 1 η 0 3 3 0 3 3 t 2 η t 1 η c ψ c θ s ψ c ϕ c ψ s θ s ϕ s ψ s ϕ c ψ c ϕ s θ s ψ c θ c ψ c ϕ s ψ s

identification the motion equations in eq 5 are derived in v frame based on the d alembert s principle and the principle of virtual work by assuming the uv as a rigid body in the fluid domain fossen 1994 5 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g η τ where m rb m a m is the sum of a rigid body and added mass terms respectively the array size of the inertia tensor is 6 6 for the current vehicle c ν rb c ν a c ν is the 6 6 coriolis and centripetal matrix for the rigid body and added mass respectively d ν d l ν d q ν is the 6 6 hydrodynamic damping matrix with linear and quadratic drag terms respectively the effect of buoyancy and gravity acting on the submerged vehicle are called restoring forces and moments for static stability which is written as a 6 1 vector g η the vector notation of the force torque vector of the thruster input is given by eq 6 the term τ signifies the vector of generalized forces and moments without considering the environmental disturbances on the vehicle with reference to the v frame 6 τ f x f y f z m x m y m z t as represented above the detailed discussion on the hydrodynamic damping terms is found in fossen 1994 the mass distribution of the rigid body contributes to the inertia as well as to the added mass an inertia matrix can be written in a diagonal form when the vehicle is symmetric about all of its planes as the speed of the vehicle is low and the origin of v frame is considered to coincide with the centre of gravity of the uv it is safe to assume that the degrees of freedom are decoupled antonelli et al 2008 thus the rigid body rb m matrix can be simplified as a diagonal and positive definite matrix in eq 7 7 rb m m 0 0 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 0 0 i x x i x y i x z 0 0 0 i x y i y y i y z 0 0 0 i x z i y z i z z the added mass a m matrix is the effect of hydrodynamic inertia of fluid adjacent to the body that accelerates along with the vehicle this inertia is an additional effort to achieve the required acceleration opposite to the fluid flow it is equal in magnitude to the mass of boundary fluid and depends on the hull form and number of appendages it increases with the rise in the hull s projected area and the number of thrusters or controls surfaces thus the a m matrix can be abridged to a diagonal form as eq 8 considering decoupled degrees of freedom due to the same assumptions in rigid body mass tensor 8 a m x u 0 0 0 0 0 0 y v 0 0 0 0 0 0 z w 0 0 0 0 0 0 k p 0 0 0 0 0 0 m q 0 0 0 0 0 0 n r based on the vehicle s shape and symmetricity it is safe to assume it as a rectangular parallelepiped this assumption simplifies the system identification and derivation of vehicle parameters i e added mass and rigid body terms by exploiting the strip theory newman 1977 dong 1978 fossen 1994 triantafyllou and hover 2003 thus for a fully submerged symmetrical rigid body travelling with low velocity the resulting m can be written as m m t 0 m 0 like the inertia matrix the centripetal and coriolis matrix c ν is also written as a sum of a rigid body and added mass components the centripetal and coriolis rigid body rb c ν matrix is a skew symmetrical matrix and this property is useful for nonlinear motion control the explicit expression for rb c ν is given in eq 9 9 rb c ν 0 0 0 0 m w m v 0 0 0 m w 0 m u 0 0 0 m v m u 0 0 m w m v 0 r i z z q i y y m w 0 m u r i z z 0 p i x x m v m u 0 q i y y p i x x 0 the terms of a c ν matrix are derived using the strip theory and can be written as the following skew symmetric matrix in eq 10 when the c g of the vehicle coincides with the origin of the v frame 10 a c ν 0 0 0 0 w z w v y v 0 0 0 w z w 0 u x u 0 0 0 v y v u x u 0 0 w z w v y v 0 r n r q m q w z w 0 u x u r n r 0 p k p v y v u x u 0 q m q p k p 0 the lift and drag forces are generated due to the motion of a uv in the viscous fluid domain as the velocity of the vehicle is low and the origin of v frame is considered to coincide with the c g of the uv it is safe to consider that the degrees of freedom are decoupled hence the hydrodynamic damping d ν is approximated as a sum of decoupled diagonal matrices consisting of linear damping d l and quadratic damping d q ν such that d ν 0 ν r 6 1 it can be safely assumed that d ν d q ν as the effect of linear damping matrix is negligible newman 1977 in this simulation the terms x u u y v v and z w w in the eq 11 are the drag coefficients along surge sway and heave of the vehicle arrived using computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis the other terms k p p m q q and n r r are the drag coefficients for angular velocities roll pitch and yaw of the

and gravity acting on the submerged vehicle g η is ignored by assuming the uv as neutrally buoyant and c g coincides with the centre of buoyancy the system identification of a uv involves complex nonlinear forces these forces are the inertia hydrodynamic forces drag and lift coriolis and centripetal effects damping and the restoring forces gravity and buoyancy the comprehensive knowledge of the forces generated by the thruster against any form of environmental disturbances requires exploring kinematics and dynamics for effective modelling and control of a uv the table 1 shows the details of the identified modular vehicle system physical and geometrical parameters bak et al 2017 5 thruster model 5 1 dynamics of the thruster due to the exposed nature of the external thrusters to the surroundings in both the variants under consideration cowl based thrusters are chosen which has two fold advantages first the exposed nature of propeller blades is reduced which is a practical design concern secondly the performance enhancement in the cowl or shroud s presence benefits vehicle performance even at low speeds in the chosen thrusters for this simulation a hydrodynamically shaped cowl shroud surrounds the propeller blades to improve the static and dynamic performance the auv design process requires to explore different ways of integrating the thrusters to the vehicle hull to provide adequate control stability and manoeuvring for a given hull form few to many thruster configurations are possible thus each possibility needs to be considered based on the operability here a modular design approach provides a minimum redesign in the vehicle when operating in different configurations the main aim is to develop a multi purpose auv using external thrusters as the primary propulsion system for varied missions the thruster configuration chosen for the ftuv and vtuv variants is such that the effect of the thrust generated is identical and practically feasible for the mounting on the hull the thruster dynamics modelling considers the following aspects 1 it is not possible to consider the axial thrust loss effects entirely by using the thrust model thus an empirical model based on the bollard thrust is considered for clockwise cw and counter clockwise ccw rotations of the propeller 2 in the vtuv configuration the presence of the thruster cowl induces the axial thrust losses and ram drag effects these effects may affect the performance in real time so the simulation considers the ram drag effects in the thruster modelling 3 the thrust force saturation due to the propeller s angular velocity limitation is modelled using the empirical data 4 the thruster modelling considers the empirical model of saturation of rate of change of thrust for better accuracy 5 in the vtuv apart from the thruster saturation the internal servomotor used for vectoring also suffer saturation in generating the required tilting velocity thus based on the motor s empirical data tilting velocity saturation is also implemented 6 based on the free jet theory nienhuis 1992 faltinsen 1993 the thrust losses due to the thruster thruster and hull thruster interaction range up to 25 in the worst case thus the model considers a thrust loss due to interactions for low speed operations 5 2 thrust generation the thrust generation is modelled using a classical approach of discontinuous pressure drop kumon et al 2010 over the rotor propeller blades the rotation of the propeller fins generates high pressure zones on one side and low pressure regions on the other the resultant pressure difference delivers the required thrust for the forward motion in the fluid due to the range of pressure variation the fluid density does not change thus it is safe to consider that the mass flow rate is constant in open ducted thrusters thrust losses occur at the tip of each fin blade due to the escape of fluid from the high pressure end to the blade s suction pressure end a hydrodynamically shaped shroud cowl around the propeller blades obstructs the fluid s escape by restricting its flow to the fin blade tips if the area of the cowl converges the mass flow is conserved by compensating with a higher velocity at the trailing end this condition is met by accelerating the flow all through the duct the additional fluid flow is induced along the ducted propeller yielding more thrust at the same input power huynh 2016 the thrust generated is equal to the force required to accelerate the fluid where the propeller is the part that induces the flow through the cowl the amount of thrust generated is given by eq 12 12 t m v freestream t ρ s v induced v freestream where t is the thrust force m is the mass flow rate of the fluid through the thruster ρ is the density of the fluid s is the cross sectional area of the propeller including the cowl the v freestream is the freestream velocity of the fluid v induced is the induced velocity of the fluid due to the rotation of the propeller the induced velocity can be modelled to be proportionate to the rotational speed of the rotor propeller blades thus the thrust force can be approximated as a function of the rotational velocity of the propeller shaft in eq 13 13 t c f ω p 2 where c f is a constant coefficient and ω p is the rotor s angular velocity the steady state relationship between the rotor s angular velocity and thrust generated is nonlinear from the above equation moreover speed controlled thruster performance depends on several factors such as axial flow effects and rotational effects the propeller blades rotation induces complicated hydrodynamic phenomena simultaneously such as the lift forces and drag forces wake generation at the trailing edge and rotational acceleration at the exit of the flow moreover the dynamic model considers other effects on the rigid body such as inertial force added mass and couple generated by the pivoted thruster s vectoring thus the coefficient c f is obtained experimentally due to the complexity in the explicit modelling of the quantities mentioned above in the comparative study t200 thrusters from blue robotics inc are considered in all the configurations a brushless motor with encapsulated motor windings and stator bluerobotics 2020 an off the shelf electronic speed controller esc is used to regulate the thruster speed in both cw and ccw directions the thruster performance in both the directions is measured for a range of propeller speed it is almost impossible to derive a finite dimensional analytical model by using physics laws to model the thrust force and torque generated by a thruster this complexity is due to the difficulty in modelling the flow dynamics especially when the flow is not uniform pivano et al 2008 though it is a common practice to simplify the thruster model based on the application in our case instead of using a simplified model empirical thruster characteristics are introduced to model the underwater vehicle as shown in fig 3 in the eq 13 the constant coefficient c f is arrived by setting up the thruster in a water tank the setup measures the thruster s output force using a static load cell for a range of propeller rotational speeds controlled by micro controller by using off the shelf instrumentation the measured thrust force is plotted on the y axis against the propeller rotational speed on x axis as shown in fig 3 based on these static test results the constant coefficient c f is arrived for both forward and reverse rotation of the propeller as a quadratic function with a dead zone thus the curve yields the values of c f 5 1 0 6 for forward rotation and c f 4 1 0 6 for reverse rotation using simple regression 5 3 ftuv configuration in the ftuv configuration four thrusters are in the horizontal plane the other four thrusters are along the vertical plane fig 4 shows the position and orientation of the thrusters where the horizontal thrusters are aligned 45 to the longitudinal plane in the v frame the choice of thrusters arrangement in vtuv ensures the thrust generation in both the configurations is strictly comparable horizontal thrusters provide motion in three degrees of freedom viz surge sway and yaw directions two vertical thrusters are placed near the bow and the remaining two towards the stern on both the port and starboard sides vertical thrusters provide motion in the remaining three degrees of freedom viz heave roll and pitch directions based on fig 4 we define f f i f f a f f b f f c f f d f f e f f f f f g f f h t a vector consisting of respective thrust force values of each of the eight thrusters a to h in their respective frames where f f a f f b f f c and f f d are the horizontal thruster forces and f f e f f f f f g and f f h are the vertical thruster forces respectively the length l and breadth a of the vehicle hull is shown in fig 2b the distances between the origin of the vehicle frame to the thruster frame are shown in fig 4 the position vector of each horizontal thruster origin in the v frame is given by l h a h 0 and similarly the position vector of each vertical thruster origin in the v frame is given by l v a v 0 the generalized forces and moments in vector form τ f i f f x f f y f f z m f x m f y m f z t is expressed in v frame of reference in terms of thruster forces and rotation angles with this notion the thrust force vector f f i of all the eight thrusters in their respective thruster frames is mapped to generalized forces moment vector τ f i expressed in the v frame by the matrix b f t as shown in eq 14 14 τ f i b f t f f i where b f t 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 a v a v a v a v 0 0 0 0 l v l v l v l v l h a h 2 l h a h 2 l h a h 2 l h a h 2 0 0 0 0 5 4 vtuv configuration we have seen the fixed thruster model using empirical data now the same is extended to the thrust vectoring it is important to note that the axial thrust force generated by the thruster results from the applied force essential to change the fluid s momentum at the centre of pressure ko et al 2007 the change in the momentum of the free stream flow generates the thrust hydrodynamically in a traditional conventional ftuv the thrust vector s direction is almost collinear with the incoming fluid velocity for low to medium angles of attack in contrast in the vtuv the angle between them can be substantial as the vehicle s speed increases the momentum changes in a conventional ftuv thruster acts along the line of its axis which results in only a loss of thrust in vtuv the significant change in the direction of the thruster axis can generate drag lift and a pitching moment due to the offset between these two components the thrusters labelled a b c and d are attached to the four diagonal pivots of the rectangular hull as shown in fig 5 they are located at the same angle as that of horizontal thrusters in ftuv these thrusters are rotatable in their respective vertical plane within a range of 90 to 9 0 the resultant thrust forces of the rotatable thrusters a b c and d are represented by f v i f v a f v b f v c f v d t a vector consisting of resolved thrust force components of each rotatable thruster is given by f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 f 8 t where f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 are the horizontal components and f 5 f 6 f 7 f 8 are the vertical components of the resultant thrust forces f v a f v b f v c and f v d respectively the position vector of each rotatable thruster origin in the vehicle fixed frame is given by l h a h 0 the generalized forces and moments in vector form τ v i f v x f v y f v z m v x m v y m v z t is expressed in v frame of reference in terms of thruster forces components vector f and rotational angles as below thus the four rotatable angles can be expressed as the sine and cosine functions in the equations which is due to the orientation of the thruster with respect to v frame and due to the rotatable action of each thruster based on the relationship between force components and their corresponding resultant thrust forces the rotatable angles α a α b α c and α d in table 2 are the angles made by the thrust force vector with the horizontal plane of the t i frame the relationship between force components and their corresponding resultant thrust forces shown in the below table holds thus the resolved thrust force components of each thruster f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 f 8 t in their respective thruster frames are mapped to generalized forces moment vector in the v frame τ v i f v x f v y f v z m v x m v y m v z t by a thrust dynamics matrix b v t as shown in eq 15 15 τ v i b v t f where b v t 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 a h a h a h a h 0 0

generated at the centre of the propeller p apart from the axial thrust generated as a function of angular velocity and acceleration of the rotor the forces and torques induce another primary hydrodynamic force perpendicular to the cowl s axis this force termed as ram drag given in eq 16 is a result of a change in the direction of the free stream fluid flow acting perpendicular to the thruster axis 16 d f c d ω p v r t where c d is a constant coefficient and v r t represents the relative velocity of the fluid with respect to t i frame the details of the relative velocity are discussed in section 5 7 3 it has been theoretically and experimentally found that it is difficult to understand and analyse the drag forces at the centre of pressure and realize the dynamic system s hydrodynamic behaviour in a fluid flow since the centre of pressure varies with the angle of attack thus the resultant hydrodynamic forces are assumed to be applied at the hydrodynamic centre hc fernandes et al 2006 the ram drag has a significant influence at the hydrodynamic centre it contributes a pitching moment on the thruster and over the complete vehicle the lift and drag forces from the shroud velocity variations of the vehicle the interactive forces between the hull and the thruster and the thrust vectoring affect the location of hc yuan 2013 coincidentally the length of thruster cowl is minimal so is the variation of hc ko et al 2007 thus the hc can be safely assumed as a fixed point h at the point of intersection of the thrust axis and the trailing edge of the cowl as shown in fig 6 as mentioned already due to the rotatable action of the thrusters in their respective frames the resultant ram drag forces on the rotatable thrusters a b c and d are represented by d v i d v a d v b d v c d v d t a vector consisting of resolved ram drag force components of each rotatable thruster is given by d d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 d 5 d 6 d 7 d 8 t where d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 are the horizontal components and d 5 d 6 d 7 d 8 are the vertical components of the resultant ram drag forces d v a d v b d v c and d v d respectively the distance between the vectoring centre v and the hydrodynamic centre h is represented by a constant value vh 0 017 m whose horizontal and vertical components based on the vector angles α i are given by a vector r r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 r 5 r 6 r 7 r 8 t corresponding to each thruster it should be noted that the scalar centre distances r 1 to r 8 in the vector r are given by table 3 the generalized drag forces and moments in vector form f v i f v x f v y f v z m v x m v y m v z t is expressed in v frame in terms of ram drag forces components vector d and rotational angles thus the four rotatable angles can be expressed as the sine and cosine functions in the equations which is due to the orientation of the horizontal thruster with respect to v frame the relationship between drag force components and their corresponding resultant thrust forces is shown in table 4 thus the ram drag vector d v i d v a d v b d v c d v d t of all the four rotatable thrusters in their respective thruster frames is mapped to generalized forces moment vector expressed in the v frame by the ram drag transformation matrix b v d as shown in eq 17 the superscript d signifies the drag and subscript v denotes vectored configuration 17 f v i b v d d where b v d 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 a h r 1 2 a h r 2 2 a h r 3 2 a h r 4 2 r 5 r 6 r 7 r 8 l h r 1 2 l h r 2 2 l h r 3 2 l h r 4 2 l h a h 2 l h a h 2 l h a h 2 l h a h 2 0 0 0 0 a vital concern in any closed loop system s real time control is the individual subsystems response time based on the control input the actuator dynamics also affect system performance thus the actuators influence i e the thruster and the vectoring motor is considered by implementing the actuator saturation and response rate the observations from the initial simulations show that the actuators response for a control input is instantaneous also there is no limit on the maximum thrust provided by each thruster based on the system identification approach two critical issues are considered in modelling the actuator dynamics 5 5 saturation of the thruster for both ftuv and vtuv the actuators are the critical components of the vehicle performance and operation which suffer from the mechanical limitation during operation this limitation leads to response saturation in desired control input by the electrically powered subsystems and creates a bias in operation between the simulation model and the vehicle s actual performance so it is necessary to model these properties at least minimally by using the empirical data the thrust generated by each of the thrusters at any given point of time has a maximum threshold of f m i f m a x 60 n for cw rotation and 42 n for ccw rotation of the propeller as shown in fig 3 based on the simulations using the closed loop control the thruster attains the necessary thrust almost instantaneously nevertheless in real time there is a constraint on the time taken to reach that thrust this constraint leads to two more restrictions in the evolution of the required thrust to propel the vehicle i e the propeller s angular velocity and its time rate of change hence the simulation implements these two constraints by using the empirical data where fig 7 shows the propeller angular velocity s response rate the threshold limit of angular velocity ω threshold for cw and ccw rotations implemented in eq 18 is based on fig 3 where the value of the same is positive for cw rotation and vice versa 18 ω pmin ω threshold ω pmax similarly the second constraint the threshold rate of the angular velocity of the propeller blades ω threshold is implemented utilizing eqs 19 and 20 the ω threshold in the eq 19 is attained from the empirical data and is equal to 5876 rad s 2 19 δ ω threshold ω threshold d t the desired angular velocity of the propeller ω is given the inequality below 20 ω ω i δ ω threshold here ω i is the current angular velocity of the propeller blades ω threshold is the time rate of change of threshold angular velocity of the propeller blade of thrusters and d t is the time interval of each time step of the time domain simulation 5 6 saturation of the internal servomotor for the vtuv in the vtuv configuration the internal servomotor responsible for orienting the thruster is constrained by the angle of rotation and its time rate of change due to mechanical limitations the angle of vectored rotation is limited to only two quadrants i e from 0 to 9 0 to avoid any cable damage of the thruster during vectoring the saturation speed of the internal servomotor limits the rate of the thrust vectoring both these constraints are also implemented in the thruster model to improve the control s robustness and accuracy additionally the internal servomotor s wear and tear are also minimized due to the limit established the constraint on the rate of the angular rotation α max of the vectored thrusters is implemented utilizing eqs 21 and 22 the α max in the eq 21 is attained from the empirical data and is equal to 32 rad s 21 δ α max α max d t the desired vector angle α is given in the inequality eq 22 22 α i δ α max α α i δ α max here α i is the current vectored angle of the thrusters α max is the maximum rotation rate of the vectored angle by the internal servomotor and d t is the time interval of each time step of the time domain simulation 5 7 effects of hydrodynamic interactions in addition to physical limitations discussed already other significant factors that affect the vehicle performance are the hydrodynamic interactions these are the interaction between thruster thruster hull thruster and effect of the underwater currents eq 23 presents the actual thrust generated by each thruster 23 f actual μ tt μ th f nominal where μ tt is the thrust loss factor of the trailing thruster due to the thruster thruster interaction and μ th is the thrust loss factor given by the thruster hull interactions the nominal thrust f nominal is equal to the actual thrust f actual when the thrust losses are negligible 5 7 1 interaction of thruster thruster it is important to note that the combined interaction effects are quite challenging to understand and implement thus in this article interaction effects are modelled separately by considering the thrust losses in the form of thrust reduction ratios arrived from the model test data results dang and laheij 2004 plaza 2013 the interaction between thrusters in a vehicle results from any thruster functioning in the wake of any source thruster the induced velocity of the forward thruster wake modifies the inflow of the aft thruster it affects the available thrust and propeller torque schlichting 1979 molland et al 2011 the conflict of the wake flow on the affected thruster due to the source thruster reduces with increase in the distance between them as shown in fig 8 here x is the distance between the two tandem thrusters it is always essential to check beforehand during the simulations whether the wake of source thruster affects the downstream thruster this check is done by the defining a region for the source thruster where the aft thruster operation is prohibited this region is defined as the spread angle of the wake this study considers a spread angle of 5 green shaded region based on the approximations as discussed in arditti et al 2014 2019 to understand the effect of the source thruster on the affected one as seen in fig 8 in general identification of forbidden zones fz for the source thrusters prevents the aft thruster interaction these regions angles are defined for the source thrusters to avoid unwanted interactions on the aft thrusters the fz red shaded region is characterized by the propeller angular velocity ratio of two interacting thrusters xu et al 2016 i e the ratio of the forward thruster angular velocity to the aft thruster angular velocity the empirical data for the thrust reduction of the downstream thruster from different independent researchers schlichting 1979 nienhuis 1992 blanke et al 2000 are valid for open water operations few examples are the thrusters mounted close to a hull surface fixed thrusters positioned in tandem and other situations such as thrust vectoring a practical approach towards implementing the thruster thruster interaction in the model is derived by model tests discussed in the american bureau of shipping abs guide for dynamic positioning systems plaza 2013 eq 24 describes the thrust reduction ratio μ tt for the trailing thruster due to interactions with the source thruster 24 μ tt μ r 1 μ r γ 3 γ 2 130 μ r 3 where μ r is the thrust reduction ratio at zero tilting relative angle and γ is the relative angle between the source thruster and the centreline that connects the thrusters in degrees as the fz can be dynamically defined based on the interacting thrusters rotation ratio it is feasible to modify the design by predefining a smaller fz this modification is done by placing the aft thruster away from the existing fz thus minimizing the thruster thruster interaction but there is a caveat the fig 8 shows that the spread angle overlaps with the fz for a particular range therefore a different skipping strategy is required to avoid fz during the thrust action thus based on the empirical data shown in arditti et al 2019 for a thrust reduction ratio of 10 the thrust loss of aft vertical thrusters is calculated to be around 14 5 7 2 interaction between hull thruster unlike the hull thruster interactions several systematic experimental results lead to realistic and consistent formulae for the thruster thruster interactions the interaction between the hull and the thruster is much more complicated compared to interaction between thrusters a significant factor for the complication is the thruster orientation and the hull form the slipstream from the thruster tends to adhere to the hull surface based on the thruster position and orientation with respect to the vehicle the interaction of the slipstream of the thrusters is mainly due to the pressure drag forces over the vehicle hull surface where the slipstream from the propeller is drawn towards the boundary surface vehicle hull due to the coanda effect faltinsen 1993 the coanda effect can be termed as the resultant force from the wake to the vehicle hull due to the differential pressure between the low pressure high velocity stream and the low velocity high pressure boundary surface hull this effect leads to the interaction between the thruster and the hull in the form of resistance to the flow drag which mainly depends on the hull s shape empirically this reduction is in the range of 3 to 12 nienhuis 1992 arditti et al 2019 in this study we use the maximum reduction ratio for a conservative approach thus interaction effects are modelled by considering the thrust losses as thrust reduction ratios the thrust degradation due to hull friction is arrived based on the hull s length and breadth from the analytical relations dang and laheij 2004 plaza 2013 5 7 3 interaction of ocean currents in the 3 d cartesian space a resultant average current velocity v c is defined to model the underwater ocean currents considering two orientation angles a sideslip angle β c and angle of attack γ c with respect to the e frame of reference as shown in fig 9 the oceanic stream is assumed to be irrotational and varies gradually with time i e virtually steady also the flow parameters γ c β c and v c are assumed to be constant for simplification purpose the parameter values used in this simulation are γ c π 6 β c π 3 and v c 0 2 m s however the capability of the vehicle under variable disturbances is discussed in the author s previous work kadiyam et al 2020 the current velocity v c is expressed in its component form using the vector v c e u c e v c e w c e 0 0 0 t as seen in eq 25 25 u c e v c cos γ c cos β c v c e v c sin β c w c e v c sin γ c cos β c to understand the effects of the current velocity v c on the uv and thrusters in their corresponding frames we define two vectors v c v u c v v c v w c v 0 0 0 t in v and v c t u c t v c t w c t 0 0 0 t in the t i frames of reference respectively similarly the vectors v v and v t represent the velocity of the vehicle and thrusters in their respective frames of reference the relative velocity between the vehicle velocity and ocean currents is given by the vector v r v expressed in the v frame of reference in short termed as relative vehicle velocity similarly the relative velocity between the thruster speed and oceanic currents is given by the vector v r t expressed in the t i frame also termed as thruster relative velocity as seen in eq 26 below 26 v r v v v v c v v r t v t v c t a transformation matrix h θ so 3 a special orthogonal group of order 3 is represented by eq 27 the angle θ is represents the orientation angles n π 4 and α i of the t i with reference to v frame 27 h λ θ i 3 3 s i n θ 1 cos θ s 2 λ where s λ s s 3 a skew symmetric matrix of order 3 for the unit vector λ λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 t if s λ s t λ the one axis rotations can be obtained by setting λ 1 0 0 t λ 0 1 0 t and λ 0 0 1 t corresponding to x y and z axis of t i frame it is assumed that the maximum current velocity is not more than 0 5 m s during the operation which may result in reduced thrust productivity of the thrusters the linear velocity vector of the oceanic currents in the thruster fixed frame is given by eq 28 28 u c t v c t w c t h i t n π 4 h i t α i u c v v c v w c v the matrices h i t n π 4 and h i t α i rotates the velocity vector from v frame to t i frame by using the two orientation angles of the thrusters with respect to the v frame here n represents an integer 1 or 1 based on the orientation of the thruster as already discussed the oceanic current velocity vector v c g is assumed to be varying slowly with time where g is defined by frames e v or t i thus we can write v r g as in eq 29 in its respective frame of reference 29 v c g 0 v r g v g the linear velocity vector of the oceanic currents in the v frame is given by eq 30 30 u c v v c v w c v t 1 t η u c e v c e w c e here the eq 4 gives the matrix t 1 η thus the equations of motion of the vehicle in the v frame are modified to eq 31 31 m v r v c v r v v r v d v r v v r v g η τ where from eq 14 τ τ f i for the ftuv and from eqs 15 and 17 τ τ v i f v i for the vtuv configuration 6 nonlinear tracking controller design feedback controllers use the system s output to regulate the error where the control action depends on the difference between the output and desired value decentralized and linear controllers such as proportional integral and derivative controllers pids may not provide the required results as that of the model based control methods for highly non linear systems due to the cancellation of potentially useful non linearities thus it is necessary to design a nonlinear controller by implementing complex dynamics such as nonlinear disturbances in the presence of modelling uncertainties we utilize one such nonlinear controller formulation to develop stabilizing control suitable for strict feedback systems a specific class of nonlinear dynamical systems these systems are propagated from subsystems that radiate out from an irreducible subsystem that can be stabilized using some other method krstic et al 1995 these lower order or irreducible systems exhibit flexibility to solve robust complex stabilization and tracking control problems khalil and grizzle 2002 in the simulation we attempt to design a scheme that demonstrates certain advantages over other existing control schemes to overcome the singularities by a certain extent krstic et al 1995 however it is impossible to design pure state feedback time invariant asymptotically stable controller to satisfy the required performance globally because of the closed loop system s very nature we define two subsystems recursively where the kinematics is considered the first subsystem inner loop and the dynamics as the second outer loop this recursive procedure interlaced with a lyapunov function s choice progressively stabilizes each outer subsystem from a known stable system to stabilize the vehicle within a prescribed error while tracking the desired trajectory before discussing the controller design we define a second order control affine strict feedback system in the eq 32 it shows the formulation in its general mathematical sense 32 y 1 g 1 y 1 g 2 y 1 y 2 y 2 g 3 y 1 y 2 g 4 y 1 y 2 u it can be observed from the above irreducible subsystems that the first subsystem in eq 32 resembles the kinematics eq 3 the second subsystem resembles the dynamics eq 31 where each subsystem is dealt separately for the stabilization in this control scheme a state variable is chosen as an intermediate control variable for virtual control these variables are reliant on the state of the system and by utilizing these intermediate controllers the outer loop is designed as seen in fig 10 the control objective is to keep the system stable for any initial condition by regulating the state to the vicinity of the origin consider eqs 3 and 31 where η is the vector of state variables the design involves stabilization of the η to the origin equilibrium by means of ν after defining and forcing tracking error term η in eq 33 to zero in this context we require η d η d η d as the known continuous and bounded functions note we consider the terms ν v r v for brevity in the derivation of control strategy 33 η η d η a decreasing exponential function of the tracking error η is considered in eq 34 to regulate the state η towards an asymptotically stable condition with a positive constant decay of k 1 and a vector of scaling parameters γ 34 η γ e k 1 t an ode as seen in eq 35 can be written based on the above equation 35 η k 1 η 0 the time rate of change of tracking error in eq 33 gives eq 36 36 η η d t η ν a backstepping error ν is defined by introducing a virtual desired velocity controller ν c into eq 36 this leaves us with eq 37 37 η η d t η ν c t η ν where ν is given by eq 38 38 ν ν c ν at this juncture a transformation matrix t η d based on the desired orientation is defined to account for any unmodelled dynamics in the system this unaccounted dynamics is considered as a disturbance and the controller requires to take care of the same in the absence of t η d thus from eqs 3 and 31 a virtual desired velocity controller ν c is chosen and written as eq 39 39 ν c t 1 η d η t 1 η d η d k 1 η and therefore eq 3 leaves us with eq 40 40 η t η t 1 η d η d k 1 η t η ν as the values of ν and ν c are initially different the control effort regulates ν to follow ν c accordingly the control vector input τ c is designed by taking the derivative of the backstepping error from eq 38 thus we have eq 41 41 ν ν c ν based on the eq 39 the derivative of ν c is given by the eq 42 42 ν c t 1 η d η d k 1 η t 1 η d η d k 1 η the dynamics of system can be written as eq 43 43 ν m 1 τ o η ν where o η ν c ν ν d ν ν g η therefore the thrust force vector is chosen from the vector of control forces moments τ c from eqs 14 and 15 by implementing the stability analysis 6 1 lyapunov stability criterion a positive definite lyapunov candidate function l is considered for the dynamical system as seen in eq 44 44 l η ν 1 2 η t η 1 2 ν t ν where l η ν 0 t η ν the dynamical system is said to be global asymptotically stable when the time derivative of lyapunov candidate function l is negative definite the control vector input τ c is chosen as in eq 45 such that l η ν 0 45 τ c o η ν m k 2 ν t t η η m t 1 η d η d k 1 η t 1 η d η d k 1 η by substituting eq 45 in eqs 14 and 15 the thrust vector components are given as shown in eq 46 46 for ftuv f f i b m j o η ν b m j m k 2 ν t t η η b m j m t 1 η d η d k 1 η t 1 η d η d k 1 η for vtuv f b m j o η ν b m j m k 2 ν t t η η b m j m t 1 η d η d k 1 η t 1 η d η d k 1 η as b m j is a non square matrix it not possible to invert it thus the moore penrose pseudoinverse b m j is utilized to find the vector of thrust components the time derivative of the lyapunov candidate function is given by the eq 47 47 l η ν η t k 1 η ν t k 2 ν 0 hence it can be written as l η ν 0 t η ν when the gains k 1 and k 2 0 this proves that the designed nonlinear controller ensures global asymptotic stability of the system the choice of appropriate gain constants as seen in table 5 is realized by trial and error considering the root mean square rms of position and orientation error of the uv 7 results of trajectory tracking simulations the constraints described in table 6 are implemented to show the effect of thruster dynamics on robot performance this section discusses the simulation results of a spatial trajectory tracking of the two configurations for a reference path generated 7 1 ftuv variant the simulation results of the ftuv configuration with the performance constraints are discussed here later the results of the vtuv configuration are shown then a comparative study of the results from both variants is discussed the trajectory chosen for this comparison is a spatial infinity shaped profile defined by a desired position vector η 1 d t 2 2 c o s 0 1 t 2 s i n 0 2 t 2 2 c o s 0 1 t t expressed in the e frame where t is the simulation time step the tracking plot of the manoeuvre is presented in fig 11 where the desired trajectory is defined by using c 2 continuity i e the velocity and acceleration constraints along with the position profile is defined for smooth and continuous tracking capability the desired trajectory is indicated by the red coloured profile whereas the blue profile indicates the simulated trajectory the trajectory tracking simulations are performed using the mentioned backstepping control scheme for 64 s as the velocity profile constraints require 64 s to complete one complete cycle of the infinity profile fig 12 shows that the initial tracking errors are in the order of 0 1 m or rad in both position heave and orientation yaw after around 2 3 s the surge sway and heaves errors converge close to the neighbourhood of the zero with very negligible oscillations in the roll pitch and yaw errors though the values are also near the zero range the oscillations in the yaw and the roll directions are slightly higher than the translational errors this difference can be attributed to the orientation profiles in the infinity trajectory as mentioned in table 6 the performance constraints in the form of the thruster s saturation are induced in the thruster dynamics of the vtuv configuration it limits the amount of possible thrust force generated from the thrusters this limitation allows simulating the real time performance of the vehicle control system against constraints the thruster interaction effects with the mentioned performance constraints are established in the time series plots figs 13 and 14 shows the time series plots of the thrust generated by the vehicle considering all the constraints in vtuv configuration it can be observed from fig 13 that the thrust generated by all the four horizontal thrusters a b c and d reach to a maximum limit of 60 n in the positive direction and 40 n in the reverse direction which matches with the threshold of the thrust generated by a t200 thruster these peak values occur to counter high initial tracking errors after the high initial thrust the maximum thrust appears in thrusters a and b with a threshold limited to 18 n this indicates that the proposed control scheme could generate the required thrust for the tracking nevertheless a small chattering is observed near the zero thrust locations in all the four horizontal thrusters it proves that the model could also clearly replicate the dead zone characteristics as shown in fig 13 figs 15 and 16 further strengthen this argument here the chattering occurs only in the regions when the propeller s angular velocity operates near the thruster s dead zone range another factor contributing to this chattering is the rate of change of the position profile at these junctures here the pitch and yaw requirements dominate the other linear motion requirements thus these requirements are compensated by the vertical thrusters as seen in fig 14 the thrust dynamics matrix reconfigures the manoeuvring requirements in the zero thrust regions of the horizontal thruster and the vertical thrusters produce the essential thrust in contrast to the horizontal thrusters the vertical ones did not compensate for the high initial tracking errors as the heave errors are low compared to the sway and surge errors combined another factor affecting the vertical thrust values is the interaction effects directly acting on the vertical thrusters under the influence of horizontal thrusters thus it can be seen in fig 14 that the thrust values of all the vertical thrusters are relatively low compared to the thrust generated by the horizontal thrusters a further clarity can be gained on the thrust loss during the comparative analysis with the vtuv configuration the limitation of the maximum angular velocity and time rate of the change of the same influences the maximum thrust produced and the time rate of thrust variation fig 15 shows the saturated thrust values for both the positive and reverse rotational direction of the propeller shaft the threshold value of around 3750 revolutions per minute rpm on either side causes different maximum thrust values since the propeller performs poorly for the reverse angular velocity thus from figs 13 and 15 it can be observed that the threshold angular velocity in the positive direction produces a maximum net thrust of 60 n in contrast in the reverse direction the same angular velocity produces a maximum thrust of 40 n the vertical thrusters the thrusters operate close to the dead zone for a considerable amount of the simulation time as seen in fig 16 the vertical thrusters maximum angular velocity is around 60 80 of the horizontal ones due to the interaction effects 7 2 vtuv variant after the discussion on the ftuv configuration in the previous section the simulation results of the vtuv configuration with the performance constraints are shown here as the comparative study requires similar characteristics to be understood the same infinity profile is chosen with respect to the inertial reference frame fig 17 shows the vehicle s performance in following the desired trajectory indicated by the red coloured profile using the designed control scheme in contrast the blue profile is the simulated vehicle trajectory it is obvious to observe that the trend of the initial tracking errors is similar to the ftuv configuration the values are in the order of 0 1 m rad for both position heave and orientation yaw as seen in fig 18 this similarity is due to the reason that both variants track the same profile another similarity in the tracking errors plot is that the surge sway and heaves errors converge close to the vicinity of the zero after around 2 3 s with minor oscillations in the roll and yaw errors however the values are still near to the zero range the oscillations in the yaw and the roll directions are slightly higher than the translational errors due to the given trajectory s orientation profiles the vehicle performance comparison is made on both the variants by inducing the constraints in table 6 where a higher number of restrictions apply to the vtuv configuration than the ftuv the simulation results of the vtuv configuration show that the maximum thrust generated is limited to a maximum value of 60 n in the positive direction and 40 n in the reverse direction a chattering is observed due to low thrust requirement while operating near the dead zone region contrary to the ftuv results the thrust forces are maintained at a minimum level of 5 10 n due to continuous thrust demand at every instant it can be seen from fig 19 that the continuous thrust demand by the control system reaches to a maximum limit of 20 n which is well below the threshold of the t200 thruster the peak values of thrust occur to counter the high initial tracking errors and the high manoeuvring requirements that arise at similar time frames like that of the ftuv variant another interesting observation is that the thrust reversal in the ftuv variant is smooth from negative to positive or vice versa compared to a quick reversal not instantaneous thrust in its counterpart this performance could be attributed to the fact that vertical thrusters counteract the mild thrust requirements in the vertical plane in the ftuv on the other hand in the vtuv configuration the sharp reversals in the desired spatial infinity trajectory s velocity profile demand the sudden reversals of thrust these reversals are observed due to the absence of additional thrusters to balance the required control action thus all the thrusters continuous action in vtuv is necessary this condition demands comparatively high values and quick reversal of thrust forces compared to the ftuv thus the proposed control scheme could generate the required thrust for the tracking with thrust reversals and comparatively higher thrust the thrust values generated by the vtuv has a direct correlation with the angular velocity of the propeller as shown in fig 20 unlike the ftuv where the chattering occurs near the thruster s dead zone range the continuous high angular velocity requirement provides a smooth thrust profile in the time frames where the time rate of change of the profile change rapidly the control system compensates these changes by a change in the direction of rotation of the propeller shaft in contrast to the ftuv vertical thrusters which did not compensate much for the high tracking errors due to the horizontal thrusters interaction effects the vtuv compensated by quick thrust reversal in the absence of thruster thruster interactions due to the tilting velocity ram drag effects are induced over the thrusters as disturbances these disturbances are to be taken care of by the controller apart from the other interaction effects the magnitude of the thrust vector velocities and their direction directly impact the ram drag magnitude the tilting velocities are affected by the saturation of the internal servomotors hence the thrust vector velocities are limited to a threshold of 32 rad s on both positive and negative directions as seen in fig 21 based on these velocities the ram drag values reach a maximum of 1 5 n which is approximately 10 of the instantaneous thrust forces of each thruster as seen in fig 22 the thrust forces and ram drag effects follow a similar pattern as that of the vector velocity the quick thrust and drag reversals happen simultaneously where the vector velocity reaches its threshold this phenomenon occurs due to the vector angles limitation in the range of 9 0 as shown in fig 23 in the absence of this limitation the variation of the thrust values is smooth despite this advantage it is safe to limit the vector angles for the sake of simplicity in mechanical design thus the vtuv performance is also smooth with additional performance constraints compared to the ftuv 7 3 discussion on the comparative analysis after considering the performance constraints to effectively compare both the variants the simulation results in terms of the power consumed or thruster load for the trajectory tracking of both the ftuv and vtuv configurations are given in figs 24 27 the thrusters power consumption is established using the empirical results here the power characteristics are arrived using the voltage and the current data thus a quartic polynomial is employed as seen in eq 48 to describe the power consumption the description is based on the propeller shaft s angular velocity with 0 998 as the coefficient of determination r squared value 48 p t p 1 t ω p 4 p 2 t ω p 3 p 3 t ω p 2 p 4 t ω p p 5 t where p 1 t 2 1 0 12 p 2 t 8 1 0 10 p 3 t 9 1 0 6 p 4 t 0 0049 and p 5 t 3 2546 fig 24 shows the instantaneous power consumption based on the horizontal thruster characteristics here each thruster s initial load reaches a maximum value of 500 w for the initial 2 3 s after that the maximum instantaneous thrust load on the front horizontal thruster reaches 100 w at around 40 s to compensate for the manoeuvring action similarly in fig 25 it can be observed that the maximum thrust load of 100 w on the aft vertical thrusters g and h occurs at around 5 8 s after the start of the simulation the result shows that the aft vertical thrusters take care of the vehicle s manoeuvrability requirement during the beginning for a pitch up condition the front horizontal thrusters take care of the latter need for the tight yaw in the vtuv configuration the thrust loads of four thrusters are also calculated based on the empirical results fig 26 shows the instantaneous power consumption of the thrusters where the initial load of each thruster reaches to a maximum value of 500 w for the initial 2 3 s after that the maximum instantaneous thrust load on the front two thrusters reaches to the range of 100 w around 40 s where the vehicle performs a manoeuvring action similarly the aft two thrusters take care of the manoeuvring requirements at 8 10 s after the start of simulation with a maximum thrust load of 50 80 w fig 27 shows that the maximum instantaneous load of 250 w acts on the diagonal motors b and c and occurs at around 18 s after the start of the simulation during most of the operation time the power consumption is almost negligible equal to the motors minimum operational load the power consumption by the servomotors is instantaneous due to the requirement of thrust reversals otherwise for a continuous 360 operation the total power consumption would be smooth and barely high based on the instantaneous power consumption the vehicle s total energy expenditure is arrived by calculating the total area under the plot for all the thrusters considering each of the power consumption plots simultaneously for the ftuv and the vtuv table 7 shows the values of the total energy consumed for the entire simulation time of 64 s it is assumed the hotel load for both the variants remain the same for better comparison it can be inferred from the results using the empirical relations that the vtuv consumes lesser total power than the ftuv configuration i e about 26 lesser for the same trajectory tracking problem however the power consumed by each thruster is more in the vtuv i e about 23 high compared to the ftuv configuration this comparison proves that the consumption of power in the vtuv is reduced by using servomotors where the thrusters consume more than their counterparts in the ftuv variant the maximum oscillations observed after the initial tracking errors are in the order of 0 025 0 03 m rad against comparatively high tracking errors of 0 04 0 06 m rad in the vtuv variant this increase in the error values is due to a single thruster s action versus the two thrusters in ftuv to achieve the same effect nevertheless as this error difference is quite reasonable it suggests that the vtuv configuration can perform well on par with its counterpart fig 13 shows the ftuv horizontal thrust values and fig 19 shows the vtuv thrust values a behaviour worth noting in these thrust generation plots is that the diagonal thrusters demand the same amount of thrust at the initial point and in the same direction this behaviour shows that the vehicle requires a significant component of thrust from the horizontal thrusters fig 23 shows that the average full operational range of the vtuv thrust is close to the 0 for most of the active time hence the described trajectory tracking problem effectively depends more on the horizontal thrusters of the ftuv or an effective vector angle close to the vehicle frame s horizontal plane as the total power consumed by the vtuv is lower compared to the ftuv configuration the power consumed per actuator is also about 26 lesser thus for the same thrust output the vtuv occupies lesser space has better autonomy and weighs lighter than the ftuv nevertheless based on the thrust and power plots it can be understood that the comparatively continuous high thrust operation leads to more tear in the vtuv compared to the ftuv due to the increase in the number of thrusters the form drag of the ftuv considerably increases which leads to a considerable vehicle resistance in most cases some redundant thrusters are invoked only during complex tracking to reduce the control scheme s complexity and power consumption thus some of the thrusters remain idle for most of the mission time leading to the under utilized resources 8 concluding remarks a simulation based detailed comparative study on an auv performance with different configurations using vectored and fixed thruster is presented in this article various performance constraints on the thrusters are implemented in the same vehicle with different propulsion strategies its main purpose is to see the vectored thruster s applicability compared to the fixed thruster vehicles towards good manoeuvrability demanding applications in the vtuv four independent internal servomotors tilt four thrusters the ftuv utilizes eight fixed thrusters for independent propulsion the simulations are performed by constraining the vehicle parameters such as the thrust saturation effect of the propeller s angular velocity interaction effects of the thrusters with other thrusters and the hull by defining each thruster s spread range this modelling includes all the constraints in the ftuv configuration except the thruster thruster interaction in vtuv few additional performance constraints are implemented due to the thrusters vectoring action such as ram drag effects and the internal servomotor s saturation furthermore a non linear controller was designed based on the backstepping scheme for a tracking problem to provide both the vehicle s variants with autonomous navigation capabilities an underwater robot s control for a trajectory tracking problem is useful for any multidisciplinary autonomous operability in real time applications the system stability has been addressed using the simulation results and was proven that it achieves global asymptotic stability the discussed vehicle system is currently under fabrication it uses an inertial measurement unit imu to estimate its position and orientation a pressure sensor is installed external to the hull to measure the vehicle depth a short baseline sbl system with an array of hydrophones is mounted in the tank to validate the imu position data the vehicle also consists of a single board computer system to process the feedback data from the sensors and generate the control signals to the actuators accordingly as a part of the future scope it is planned to measure the imu data s drift and validate with the sbl system both vehicle variants have been corroborated through simulations and the comparative results show the performance difference between the two configurations it has been observed from the performance comparison that the power consumed by the vtuv is lower compared to the ftuv configuration under similar conditions the power consumed per actuator in the vtuv is about 26 lesser this comparison shows that for the same thrust output the vtuv has an advantage of occupying lesser space better autonomy and weighing lighter compared to the ftuv nevertheless the high thrust operation in the vtuv leads to more wear and tear of the actuators than the ftuv in the case of fault tolerance capabilities the ftuv has an advantage over the vtuv due to thruster redundancy that reduces the risk of vehicle loss during the missions in subsystem faults the ftuv has a clear advantage over the vtuv due to thruster redundancy without any unique fault tolerance algorithms thus the redundancy of thrusters in ftuv helps to ease the controller design and leads to comparatively low risk of vehicle loss during the missions in vtuv the fault tolerant design kadiyam et al 2020 becomes complex compared to the ftuv it is due to the coupling between the horizontal and vertical thrust thus vtuv requires additional fault tolerant mechanisms for safety based on both the configurations advantages and limitations it can be summarized that a vectored thrust vehicle can act as a potential alternative to the fixed thrusters vehicle in the challenging missions where manoeuvrability is a crucial factor credit authorship contribution statement jagadeesh kadiyam
