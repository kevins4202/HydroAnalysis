11000,drip irrigation is considered as one of the most suitable methods to utilize multiple low quality water sources however the emitter clogging issue caused has become the main constraint for its application and promotion which possibly leads to system failure if it becomes uncontrollably acute how to select the anti clogging emitter product precisely in order to improve the system functionality and extend the service life is the premise of increasing the sustainability of drip irrigation systems broadly used for agriculture and landscape irrigation therefore drip irrigation emitter clogging experiments using three types of low quality water sources including water with high sediment and salinity loads and their mixture with the same volume ratio were conducted under the fourteen working conditions included in the present study the discharge variation rate dra christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu and emitter clogging substances ecs of the referenced emitter all showed linear correlations with the other eight types of emitters used in this paper and the regression slopes were referred to as the anti clogging relative index cri the relative magnitudes of cri dra cri cu and cri ecs could effectively represent the anti clogging abilities of different emitters instead of being affected by the different working conditions or water quality parameters the differences in cri were mainly due to the emitter structural characteristics two dimensionless parameters of emitter flow paths w d and a1 2 l were significantly correlated to the relative magnitudes of cri and thus these two parameters directly allowed for assessing of the anti clogging ability of emitters the model established could provide an accurate method for the selection of anti clogging drip emitter products in a rapid way which is beneficial for the safe high efficiency and long time running of the drip irrigation system using low quality water sources keywords low quality water irrigation drip irrigation emitter clogging direct evaluation 1 introduction utilizing low quality water sources such as reclaimed water and other water sources with high sediment and salinity loads in agricultural irrigation has offered an effective way to address water shortage liu and huang 2009 puig bargu√©s et al 2010 however the excessive or inappropriate use of low quality water sources may bring about soil and environmental pollution or even risks to crop safety and human health drip irrigation is considered as the most reliable and environmentally friendly method to utilize low quality water sources due to its enclosed pipelines targeted water and fertilizer supply and controllable outflow capra and scicolone 2007 zhou et al 2013 lu et al 2016 zhangzhong et al 2016 han et al 2018 however the emitter clogging issue has always been the main barrier to the scaled application and promotion of drip irrigation technology since it directly affects system operation and service life pei et al 2014 zhou et al 2016a in addition there are more substances included in low quality water sources and their compounds would couple with the reactive components of the fertilizers which further increases the clogging risk of drip irrigation system or even leads to system failure selecting the most appropriate emitter product with high anti clogging ability is critical to improve the drip irrigation system functionality and extend its service life this would also avoid frequent replacement of the irrigation equipment and the possible wastes related increasing the sustainability of these systems broadly used for agriculture and landscape irrigation therefore effectively controlling drip irrigation clogging is the key to achieve high efficiency production when utilizing low quality water in irrigation however emitter design recommendations for avoiding clogging differ between studies thus less clogging was observed with emitters with large outflow or flow path dimensions zheng 1993 emitters with short and wide flow path adin and sacks 1991 emitters with large cross sectional average velocities feng et al 2018 meanwhile the clogging features were influenced by the water quality characteristics zhangzhong et al 2016 zhou et al 2016a therefore the anti clogging ability of emitters cannot merely be evaluated by the relative magnitudes of rated outflows or flow path dimensions and a rapid method is needed to predict the anti clogging ability of emitters in order to accurately evaluate the emitter anti clogging ability most scholars carried out drip irrigation emitter clogging experiments to monitor the dynamic outflow variations of different types of emitters for a long irrigation period pei et al 2014 bounoua et al 2016 han et al 2018 however these experiments were time and labor consuming although zhou et al 2016a proposed an evaluation method for assessing the emitter anti clogging ability in a drip irrigation system using reclaimed water which was based on the characteristic parameters of emitter flow path there were obvious differences in evaluations for different water sources and different types of emitters there are still no evaluation and prediction methods for emitter anti clogging ability which are suitable for various low quality water qualities and working conditions such as operating according to irrigation amount or time duration different working pressures or irrigation frequencies the objectives of this paper were to 1 establish an anti clogging relative index cri for evaluating anti clogging ability and verify its applicability under different low quality water sources and working conditions 2 explore the direct prediction method of cri based on utilizing characteristic parameters of emitter flow path as the reference to select appropriate emitters for drip irrigation systems using low quality water sources 2 material and methods 2 1 experiment layout the drip irrigation emitter clogging experiments were carried out both in 2015 and 2017 at the irrigation experimental station located at ulanbuhe arid area in bayinaoer inner mongolia china 106 98 e 40 39 n there were three types of low quality water sources the high sediment water imported from the yellow river yrw the brackish water brought from the local lake slw and their 1 1 mixed water in volume as the mixed water source mxw waters were sampled seven times in 2015 and six times in 2017 to determine the main quality parameters that are shown in table 1 there were fourteen different working conditions included in the experiments and they were either based on the total operation time control named as totc or the total emitter discharge control named as tedc among them the totc scenarios were mainly focused on the low quality water sources including three water sources with flushing treatments as well as the non flushing treatment of yrw on the other hand the tedc scenarios were the fertigation treatments including applying the urea phosphate named as up with two concentrations 0 15 g l and 0 30 g l which were designated as up0 15 and up0 30 respectively the potassium phosphate monobasic named as ppm with two concentrations 0 15 g l and 0 30 g l which were designated as ppm0 15 and ppm0 30 respectively the ammonium polyphosphate named as app with two concentrations 0 15 g l and 0 30 g l which were named as app0 15 and app0 30 respectively and the control group without fertilizers as well as three irrigation frequencies with ppm0 15 irrigate once every day four days and seven days which were named as p1 1 p1 4 and p1 7 respectively the fourteen working conditions are summarized in table 2 nine types of emitters those that were used in at least four working conditions among the total fourteen scenarios mentioned above were selected to further analyze their anti clogging abilities under different water sources and working conditions the geometric parameters of emitter flow path were quantified using a reading microscope type jc 10 range 4 mm measurement accuracy 0 01 mm manufacturer shoif shanghai china and a digital vernier caliper type pd 151 range 150 mm measurement accuracy 0 02 mm manufacturer pro s kit taiwan china the initial outflow was measured with the preliminary experiment and their manufacturing variation coefficients were obtained from the manufacturers these results are summarized in table 3 2 2 testing methods for drip irrigation emitter clogging parameters and substances 1 emitter outflow indices the emitter outflow was tested during 5 min every 60 h for totc scenarios or every 8 days for tedc scenarios of system operation these scenarios operated with consistent time every day till the clogging degree reached 50 which happened between 2 and 3 5 months depending on the operation modes summarized in table 2 the data obtained were corrected by the temperature modification model used by zhou et al 2018 to eliminate the effects of temperature differences then the revised outflow results were used to calculate the average discharge variation rate dra to reflect the overall clogging condition of the drip irrigation system and meanwhile the irrigation uniformity was characterized by the christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu the calculation methods were introduced in zhou et al 2018 2 clogging substances the clogging substances ecs inside each type of emitter were extracted and tested when the dra was decreased to 95 90 85 80 75 70 60 and 50 respectively five emitters were collected from the head middle and end sections of the laterals respectively and then were weighed with an electronic balance type 2204 n measurement accuracy 10 4 g manufacturer benpu suzhou china emitter samples were removed from the laterals and placed in a valve bag with 45 ml deionized water then each bag was placed in an ultrasonic cleaner type gvs 10 l manufacturer gouwei technology co ltd shenzhen china for 60 min at 60 hz to strip off the clogging substances the emitter samples were dried in an oven at a constant temperature of 110 c and then weighed again the weight difference was the content of ecs and the average value is presented for the fifteen emitters 2 3 anti clogging relative index cri in order to comprehensively assess the anti clogging ability of emitters under different working conditions the concept of the anti clogging relative index cri is proposed cri could cover the all main parameters of emitter clogging dra cu and ecs introduced in the previous section the initial values i e without emitter clogging for dra cu and ecs should be 100 100 and 0 mg cm 2 respectively by using cri one type of emitter was taken as the reference and its performance difference with other types of emitters was quantified by the ratio of their anti clogging parameters 1 c r i e i i e i 0 where eii the clogging parameter dra cu or ecs of the ith emitter studied the units for dra and cu are and that of ecs is mg cm 2 ei0 the clogging parameter of the reference emitter being the parameters and their units the same as eii the reference emitter could be any commercial product flat emitter fe1 was selected in this paper mainly because it was used in all fourteen working conditions cri the anti clogging relative index which indicated the relative magnitudes of anti clogging comparing to the reference emitter the results were the linear regression slopes of eii and ei0 larger cri means higher anti clogging ability 2 4 statistical analysis linear regression analysis was used to quantify the correlations among clogging parameters dra cu and ecs for the initial conditions the emitters were considered ideally unclogged dra cu 100 without any clogging substances ecs 0 mg cm 2 therefore the regression lines included dot 100 100 for both dra and cu correlations while those for ecs included dot 0 0 then the same analysis method was further applied to study the correlations between cri cri dra cri cu and cri ecs and structural parameters including emitter initial outflow q flow path length l width w depth d cross sectional area a which equals to w d average cross section velocity v which equals to q a as well as two dimensionless ratios between emitter flow path width and depth w d and cross sectional area and length a 1 2 l li et al 2018 following statistical analysis the significance of the independent variable was determined at p 0 05 the statistical analyses were carried out using spss ver 20 0 ibm analytics software 3 results 3 1 evaluation of emitter performance based on the overall clogging degree cri dra fig 1 shows the quantitative correlations of dra among nine types of emitters and the cri dra obtained accordingly under the fourteen working conditions included in the experiments dra of emitters fe2 fe9 showed a linear distribution with that of the reference emitter fe1 the differences in water sources and working conditions merely changed the position around the regression line rather than affecting the overall distribution all the dra of fe2 fe9 had significant linear correlations with the dra of fe1 r 2 0 96 p 0 05 through the slopes of regression curves the cri dra of fe2 fe9 were obtained as 0 99 1 14 1 06 0 95 1 01 1 20 0 89 and 0 80 respectively since the manufacturing variation coefficients of all types of emitters were similar table 3 the differences in cri dra mainly resulted from their anti clogging performances the results also indicated that under all water sources and working conditions emitter fe7 showed the best anti clogging ability which was 20 stronger than the reference fe1 while that of emitter fe9 was on average 20 weaker than fe1 therefore on the basis of the evaluation of the cri dra fe3 fe4 and fe7 all had better anti clogging ability than fe1 as their cri dra were relatively larger meanwhile fe2 and fe6 anti clogging capacity were almost the same as fe1 and the other three types of emitters showed relatively weaker anti clogging ability than fe1 3 2 evaluation of emitter performance based on the irrigation uniformity cri cu fig 2 shows the quantitative correlations of cu among nine types of emitters and the cri cu obtained accordingly linear corrections for cu were also obtained which showed consistency with those of their dra the differences in the relative positions of each emitter were due to different water sources and working conditions the cu of fe2 fe9 showed significant linear correlations with the cu of fe1 r 2 0 92 p 0 05 and the cri cu of emitters fe2 fe9 were acquired with the regression slopes being 1 03 1 19 1 09 0 94 1 01 1 26 0 98 and 0 85 respectively based on the evaluation results of cri cu fe3 fe4 and fe7 had better anti clogging ability than fe1 while fe2 fe6 and fe8 had almost the same the other two types of emitters fe5 and fe9 showed relatively weaker anti clogging ability than fe1 the ranking of cri cu was slightly different from that of cri dra however the common ground lies in the maximum cri cu 1 26 obtained by emitter fe7 and the minimum cri cu 0 85 by emitter fe9 3 3 evaluation of emitter performance based on the clogging substances cri ecs fig 3 shows the quantitative correlations of ecs among nine types of emitters and the cri ecs obtained accordingly the ecs of emitters fe2 fe9 showed significant linear correlations with the ecs of fe1 r 2 0 93 p 0 05 slopes of the fitted curves for fe2 fe9 were respectively 1 10 1 15 1 11 1 02 1 09 0 96 0 81 and 0 95 therefore the anti clogging abilities of fe2 fe3 fe4 and fe6 were better than fe1 on basis of the cri ecs evaluation fe5 and fe7 showed similar anti clogging ability comparing with fe1 and those of fe8 and fe9 were relatively weaker the ranking order of the cri ecs results was different from those of the cri dra and cri cu under this condition fe3 had the relatively highest cri ecs 1 15 while fe8 showed the lowest 0 81 4 discussion selecting the appropriate drip irrigation emitters which are suitable for different working conditions is of vital importance to avoid emitter clogging when using low quality water sources in addition frequent replacement of the irrigation equipment due to emitter clogging may lead to concomitant secondary pollution in order to select the most suitable emitter products accurately scholars in related studies explored and came up with several parameters to reflect emitter performance including flow index x dra cu design uniformity coefficient du and statistic uniformity us wei et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 feng et al 2018 these parameters were obtained through either short cycle rapid tests or long cycle dynamic monitoring tests however these tests could not comprehensively evaluate the anti clogging performance because they were carried out with specific types of water source or working condition under these circumstances it was only possible to assess the anti clogging ability under each specific experimental condition but could not select the appropriate emitters rapidly and accurately for different low quality water sources or working conditions 4 1 selection of the reference emitter in this paper three types of low quality water sources applied under fourteen working conditions were included for the drip irrigation experiments and the cri was proposed as an easy index for computing emitter performance against clogging taking cri of the reference emitter fe1 as 1 the cri values of the other eight types of emitters were obtained with linear regression and thus relative magnitudes of cri dra cri cu and cri ecs could well represent the specific anti clogging ability of each emitter one advantage of the cri index is that any commercial emitter product could be used as the reference emitter in this paper fe1 was selected mainly because it was used in all 14 working conditions however the effect of the selected reference emitter on cri should be assessed considering that at least one shared working condition was needed for comparison fe6 was firstly regarded as another reference emitter and the cri dra results and rankings of different emitter products are summarized in table 4 although the cri dra values changed with the new reference emitter their overall ranking was almost the same the slightly inconsistency among fe1 fe2 and fe5 was mainly because their cri dra values were close to each other which indicated their anti clogging abilities were almost the same but the largest cri dra was still obtained with fe7 and the smallest cri dra was acquired by fe9 fe1 and fe6 showed similar cri dra values when fe1 was selected as the reference emitter which may be the reason for the consistent results obtained above therefore we further selected the emitters with relatively larger fe3 1 14 and smaller fe9 0 80 cri dra values according to the results obtained in table 4 they both showed the same ranking of cri dra values of the emitter products included and thus verified the consistency of selecting different types of emitters for calculating cri 4 2 direct estimation method of cri based on their structural parameters the correlations between cri values and the structural parameters of the emitter flow path including q l w d v a1 2 l and w d were also analyzed using linear regressions only w d and a 1 2 l showed significant linear correlations with all three cri parameters r2 0 42 p 0 05 fig 4 this explained why neither larger outflow and flow path zheng 1993 short flow path adin and sacks 1991 nor larger average cross sectional velocity feng et al 2018 were the best choice as these references for selecting the appropriate emitter products were obtained from either fixed water source or specific working condition this was exactly the starting point of the study in this paper in this study the two dimensionless parameters w d and a 1 2 l acquired were the combination of the fundamental structural parameters l w d and their joint effects led to the variations of local hydrodynamics inside emitters feng et al 2018 as a result the local hydrodynamics changed the dynamic attach detach regrow process of the clogging substances and correspondingly their accumulation zhangzhong et al 2016 zhou et al 2016b as accumulated clogging substances directly affected the emitter clogging degrees zhou et al 2013 the service life and application benefit of the drip irrigation systems using low quality water sources varied accordingly as w d was not significantly correlated to a 1 2 l r 0 55 significance value 0 128 sample number 9 the variations of cri were merely determined by w d and a 1 2 l of different types of emitters therefore multiple linear correlations were established for cri dra cri cu and cri ecs respectively according to the eqs 2 4 and statistical results obtained cri dra was the most suitable parameter to evaluate the anti clogging ability of emitters as it contributed the largest regression coefficient while their rmse values were almost the same 2 cri dra 13 16 a1 2 l 0 33 w d 1 57 r 2 0 75 rmse 0 06 f 20 99 p 0 05 3 cri cu 14 48 a1 2 l 0 25 w d 1 55 r 2 0 62 rmse 0 07 f 11 44 p 0 05 4 cri ecs 11 26 a1 2 l 0 24 w d 1 46 r 2 0 62 rmse 0 06 f 11 46 p 0 05 4 3 the feasibility and accuracy of utilizing cri to select commercial product in order to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the cri method proposed we collected data from all the emitter clogging related papers available by doing so we could apply the estimation model established in the previous section to further verify its accuracy to evaluate the anti clogging abilities of the various emitters studied under the other working conditions described in these papers unfortunately the majority of the studies did not report all of the structural parameters of the flat emitters used eventually we summarized twenty eight types of emitters in total yan et al 2009 oliver et al 2014 li et al 2015 liu et al 2015 hao et al 2016 zhangzhong et al 2016 han et al 2018 zhou et al 2016a 2016b 2018 and the results indicated that the accuracy of cri dra exceeded 86 which means that twenty four of the emitters those marked in black in fig 5 showed consistency with the results obtained in the studies e28 showed the lowest cri dra as its flow path width was relatively large 1 68 mm while flow path depth was relatively small 0 48 mm and the cri dra showed negative linear correlation with w d eq 2 results demonstrated that the accuracy of the cri method was suitable for selecting the most appropriate emitter products against clogging for drip irrigation systems using low quality water sources although some meaningful results were obtained based on the establishment and the verification of the cri models some issues still need to be studied in the future 1 the estimation models were obtained with flat emitters and the regression coefficients for w d and a 1 2 l for other types of emitters needs to be verified 2 the feasibility and consistency of drip irrigation systems using low quality water sources applied under farm conditions requires further verification 5 conclusion by systematic study and analysis of the drip irrigation emitter outflows under fourteen working conditions using low quality water sources with high sediment and salinity loads for agricultural irrigation the anti clogging relative index cri was proposed to assess the anti clogging ability of each emitter considering the clogging related parameters the average discharge variation rate dra and the christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu and clogging substances found inside emitters ecs the relative magnitudes of cri dra cri cu and cri ecs could effectively represent the relative differences of anti clogging abilities of the tested emitters cri results were accurate and consistent under all water sources and working conditions their differences were determined by their structural characteristics rather than the water used or the operating mode the dimensionless ratios between emitter flow path width and depth w d and cross sectional area and length a 1 2 l were significantly correlated to cri especially cri dra and the estimation model established on basis of w d and a 1 2 l could be utilized to directly predict emitter anti clogging ability the cri index here defined is useful for selecting the suitable emitters

table 3 the differences in cri dra mainly resulted from their anti clogging performances the results also indicated that under all water sources and working conditions emitter fe7 showed the best anti clogging ability which was 20 stronger than the reference fe1 while that of emitter fe9 was on average 20 weaker than fe1 therefore on the basis of the evaluation of the cri dra fe3 fe4 and fe7 all had better anti clogging ability than fe1 as their cri dra were relatively larger meanwhile fe2 and fe6 anti clogging capacity were almost the same as fe1 and the other three types of emitters showed relatively weaker anti clogging ability than fe1 3 2 evaluation of emitter performance based on the irrigation uniformity cri cu fig 2 shows the quantitative correlations of cu among nine types of emitters and the cri cu obtained accordingly linear corrections for cu were also obtained which showed consistency with those of their dra the differences in the relative positions of each emitter were due to different water sources and working conditions the cu of fe2 fe9 showed significant linear correlations with the cu of fe1 r 2 0 92 p 0 05 and the cri cu of emitters fe2 fe9 were acquired with the regression slopes being 1 03 1 19 1 09 0 94 1 01 1 26 0 98 and 0 85 respectively based on the evaluation results of cri cu fe3 fe4 and fe7 had better anti clogging ability than fe1 while fe2 fe6 and fe8 had almost the same the other two types of emitters fe5 and fe9 showed relatively weaker anti clogging ability than fe1 the ranking of cri cu was slightly different from that of cri dra however the common ground lies in the maximum cri cu 1 26 obtained by emitter fe7 and the minimum cri cu 0 85 by emitter fe9 3 3 evaluation of emitter performance based on the clogging substances cri ecs fig 3 shows the quantitative correlations of ecs among nine types of emitters and the cri ecs obtained accordingly the ecs of emitters fe2 fe9 showed significant linear correlations with the ecs of fe1 r 2 0 93 p 0 05 slopes of the fitted curves for fe2 fe9 were respectively 1 10 1 15 1 11 1 02 1 09 0 96 0 81 and 0 95 therefore the anti clogging abilities of fe2 fe3 fe4 and fe6 were better than fe1 on basis of the cri ecs evaluation fe5 and fe7 showed similar anti clogging ability comparing with fe1 and those of fe8 and fe9 were relatively weaker the ranking order of the cri ecs results was different from those of the cri dra and cri cu under this condition fe3 had the relatively highest cri ecs 1 15 while fe8 showed the lowest 0 81 4 discussion selecting the appropriate drip irrigation emitters which are suitable for different working conditions is of vital importance to avoid emitter clogging when using low quality water sources in addition frequent replacement of the irrigation equipment due to emitter clogging may lead to concomitant secondary pollution in order to select the most suitable emitter products accurately scholars in related studies explored and came up with several parameters to reflect emitter performance including flow index x dra cu design uniformity coefficient du and statistic uniformity us wei et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 feng et al 2018 these parameters were obtained through either short cycle rapid tests or long cycle dynamic monitoring tests however these tests could not comprehensively evaluate the anti clogging performance because they were carried out with specific types of water source or working condition under these circumstances it was only possible to assess the anti clogging ability under each specific experimental condition but could not select the appropriate emitters rapidly and accurately for different low quality water sources or working conditions 4 1 selection of the reference emitter in this paper three types of low quality water sources applied under fourteen working conditions were included for the drip irrigation experiments and the cri was proposed as an easy index for computing emitter performance against clogging taking cri of the reference emitter fe1 as 1 the cri values of the other eight types of emitters were obtained with linear regression and thus relative magnitudes of cri dra cri cu and cri ecs could well represent the specific anti clogging ability of each emitter one advantage of the cri index is that any commercial emitter product could be used as the reference emitter in this paper fe1 was selected mainly because it was used in all 14 working conditions however the effect of the selected reference emitter on cri should be assessed considering that at least one shared working condition was needed for comparison fe6 was firstly regarded as another reference emitter and the cri dra results and rankings of different emitter products are summarized in table 4 although the cri dra values changed with the new reference emitter their overall ranking was almost the same the slightly inconsistency among fe1 fe2 and fe5 was mainly because their cri dra values were close to each other which indicated their anti clogging abilities were almost the same but the largest cri dra was still obtained with fe7 and the smallest cri dra was acquired by fe9 fe1 and fe6 showed similar cri dra values when fe1 was selected as the reference emitter which may be the reason for the consistent results obtained above therefore we further selected the emitters with relatively larger fe3 1 14 and smaller fe9 0 80 cri dra values according to the results obtained in table 4 they both showed the same ranking of cri dra values of the emitter products included and thus verified the consistency of selecting different types of emitters for calculating cri 4 2 direct estimation method of cri based on their structural parameters the correlations between cri values and the structural parameters of the emitter flow path including q l w d v a1 2 l and w d were also analyzed using linear regressions only w d and a 1 2 l showed significant linear correlations with all three cri parameters r2 0 42 p 0 05 fig 4 this explained why neither larger outflow and flow path zheng 1993 short flow path adin and sacks 1991 nor larger average cross sectional velocity feng et al 2018 were the best choice as these references for selecting the appropriate emitter products were obtained from either fixed water source or specific working condition this was exactly the starting point of the study in this paper in this study the two dimensionless parameters w d and a 1 2 l acquired were the combination of the fundamental structural parameters l w d and their joint effects led to the variations of local hydrodynamics inside emitters feng et al 2018 as a result the local hydrodynamics changed the dynamic attach detach regrow process of the clogging substances and correspondingly their accumulation zhangzhong et al 2016 zhou et al 2016b as accumulated clogging substances directly affected the emitter clogging degrees zhou et al 2013 the service life and application benefit of the drip irrigation systems using low quality water sources varied accordingly as w d was not significantly correlated to a 1 2 l r 0 55 significance value 0 128 sample number 9 the variations of cri were merely determined by w d and a 1 2 l of different types of emitters therefore multiple linear correlations were established for cri dra cri cu and cri ecs respectively according to the eqs 2 4 and statistical results obtained cri dra was the most suitable parameter to evaluate the anti clogging ability of emitters as it contributed the largest regression coefficient while their rmse values were almost the same 2 cri dra 13 16 a1 2 l 0 33 w d 1 57 r 2 0 75 rmse 0 06 f 20 99 p 0 05 3 cri cu 14 48 a1 2 l 0 25 w d 1 55 r 2 0 62 rmse 0 07 f 11 44 p 0 05 4 cri ecs 11 26 a1 2 l 0 24 w d 1 46 r 2 0 62 rmse 0 06 f 11 46 p 0 05 4 3 the feasibility and accuracy of utilizing cri to select commercial product in order to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the cri method proposed we collected data from all the emitter clogging related papers available by doing so we could apply the estimation model established in the previous section to further verify its accuracy to evaluate the anti clogging abilities of the various emitters studied under the other working conditions described in these papers unfortunately the majority of the studies did not report all of the structural parameters of the flat emitters used eventually we summarized twenty eight types of emitters in total yan et al 2009 oliver et al 2014 li et al 2015 liu et al 2015 hao et al 2016 zhangzhong et al 2016 han et al 2018 zhou et al 2016a 2016b 2018 and the results indicated that the accuracy of cri dra exceeded 86 which means that twenty four of the emitters those marked in black in fig 5 showed consistency with the results obtained in the studies e28 showed the lowest cri dra as its flow path width was relatively large 1 68 mm while flow path depth was relatively small 0 48 mm and the cri dra showed negative linear correlation with w d eq 2 results demonstrated that the accuracy of the cri method was suitable for selecting the most appropriate emitter products against clogging for drip irrigation systems using low quality water sources although some meaningful results were obtained based on the establishment and the verification of the cri models some issues still need to be studied in the future 1 the estimation models were obtained with flat emitters and the regression coefficients for w d and a 1 2 l for other types of emitters needs to be verified 2 the feasibility and consistency of drip irrigation systems using low quality water sources applied under farm conditions requires further verification 5 conclusion by systematic study and analysis of the drip irrigation emitter outflows under fourteen working conditions using low quality water sources with high sediment and salinity loads for agricultural irrigation the anti clogging relative index cri was proposed to assess the anti clogging ability of each emitter considering the clogging related parameters the average discharge variation rate dra and the christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu and clogging substances found inside emitters ecs the relative magnitudes of cri dra cri cu and cri ecs could effectively represent the relative differences of anti clogging abilities of the tested emitters cri results were accurate and consistent under all water sources and working conditions their differences were determined by their structural characteristics rather than the water used or the operating mode the dimensionless ratios between emitter flow path width and depth w d and cross sectional area and length a 1 2 l were significantly correlated to cri especially cri dra and the estimation model established on basis of w d and a 1 2 l could be utilized to directly predict emitter anti clogging ability the cri index here defined is useful for selecting the suitable emitters

11001,the area under irrigation in mexico is just over 6 64 million hectares most of which is irrigated with surface gravity systems borders or furrows however one of the main problems presented by these methods is the loss associated with deep infiltration tailwaters and flooding in some parts of the land as a result of a poor flow design at the entrance of the furrow or border in this study the evaluation of irrigation tests the data of the plot and the net irrigation depth to be applied show that the optimum expense that can be put in each furrow during an irrigation event can be calculated under the hypothesis that with this expense the historical water depths applied in the evaluated plots can be reduced the results obtained in 250 irrigation tests in 1010 ha in the irrigation district 085 la bego√±a guanajuato m√©xico showed that average water depths decreased by 19 cm irrigation time decreased 12 h ha 1 on average and the average volume saved was 2150 m3 ha which represented a total of 49 of the total volume used in addition the average efficiency rose from 51 to 86 keywords analytical formula green and ampt equation kinematic wave model efficient water use optimal discharge saint venant and richards equations 1 introduction and objectives in mexico there are 6 64 million hectares under irrigation of these 3 50 million are distributed in 85 irrigation districts and 3 14 million are in just over 39 thousand irrigation units located mainly in the center and north of the country gravity surface irrigation is the most used method comisi√≥n nacional del agua conagua 2017 since the energy used is gravitational and does not usually require additional energy inputs to the system surface gravity irrigation consists of the supply of water at the head of a channel or inclined channel built on the plot such as a border or a furrow to take advantage of the gravitational field and provide the necessary amount of water for the development of cultivated plants fuentes et al 2012 in surface gravity irrigation there are three phases the advanced phase the storage phase and the recession phase which together are studied with a variety of models to understand the phenomenon however with the application of water in this method it is much more difficult to have good efficiency since there are many losses by tailwater due to the selection of an inappropriate irrigation flow or due to poor operation in the water distribution network due to poor leveling in the ground by percolation which is due to a poor design of the length of irrigation or the expense of irrigation and allows water to remain longer than necessary at each point along the furrow or border in many cases these inadequate irrigation practices have led to over elevation of water tables and progressive soil salinization fig 1 a and b shows two examples of bad surface gravity irrigation designs in the figure on the left the expense given to a border was of such magnitude that it overflowed the borders while in the figure on the right the opportune time of irrigation was greater than that which was required in both cases the consequence was a partial flooding of the land that brings devastating consequences for the soil and the crop there are a large number of models that describe gravity fed surface irrigation ranging from empirical to physical based models that use the barr√© de saint venant and richards equations to model the surface movement and underground movement respectively schmitz et al 1985 saucedo et al 2005 2011 fuentes et al 2012 saucedo et al 2015 the use of these models whether numerical or analytical helps us to understand the movement of water in an irrigation event which allows us to give pertinent recommendations for efficient application of water in the plot however the complexity that these models has in some cases caused their use to be limited only to theoretical investigations in recent years an efficient irrigation design has been extensively studied since it is a question of applying the optimal expense to furrow or border irrigation which is defined as one that allows maximum uniformity to be obtained in water distribution along a border or furrow this uniformity is achieved with the maximization of the christiansen coefficient thus maintaining high values of application efficiency ea which is defined as the amount of water available to crops in relation to the water applied to the plots and irrigation requirement efficiency er which is defined as the required volume by the crop in relation to the available volume to the crop however this improvement consists of new solving methods of the saint venant and richards equations banti et al 2011 and the results are compared with existing conventional solutions seidel et al 2015 in an effort to reduce computation times moreover other authors have tried to optimize the optimal expense by using the saint venant equation on the surface but the infiltrated water depth is calculated with the empirical equation of kostiakov lewis morris et al 2015 gillies et al 2015 however optimization is done by trial and error moving the expense according to the modeler s experience or with constants obtained from the literature although modern and traditional pressurized irrigation systems are still a viable option because of all the advantages they offer a good design of surface gravity irrigation will continue to represent a cheap alternative to provide the right amount of water to plants with reasonable irrigation efficiency rend√≥n et al 2012 the aim of this study is to show the design of surface gravity irrigation with an analytical formula rend√≥n et al 2017 in the irrigation district 085 la bego√±a guanajuato mexico the evaluation and irrigation design is developed using the kinematic wave model with the characteristic values of the plot length moisture content density texture and for the design of the optimal expense the found values of the evaluation k s and h f and the characteristics of the plot length moisture content net irrigation depth to apply and bulk density are used 2 methodology 2 1 theoretical aspects 2 1 1 the kinematic wave model the kinematic wave model considers that in the equation of momentum the inertial and pressure terms are negligible with respect to the terms of friction and gravity with such assumptions the model of barr√© de saint venant is as follows 1 a t q x w 2 j j o this model is expressed by eq 3 ponce 1980 woolhiser 1980 litrico 2001 3 q t c k q q x c k q w c k q q a the value of the coefficient c k q is obtained from a law of resistance with j j o that is c k Œ± Œ≤ q Œ± 1 1 Œ≤ since the friction and gravitational forces are considered to be equal there is no appreciable acceleration of the flow and therefore the model is applicable to runoffs with small expenses and gentle slopes as in surface gravity irrigation from simulations in channels of different geometric and operational characteristics it has been established that the kinematic wave model adequately represents the dynamics of the flow provided that the following inequality is fulfilled ligget and woolhiser 1967 4 k j o l o f o 2 h n 30 where k is a kinematic number j o is the slope of the bottom of the channel l o is the normalized length of the channel and can be taken as the length of the channel f o 2 q 2 t g a 3 the froude number q is the discharge at the entrance of the channel t is the width of the free surface in the same position a is the area at the entrance of the channel and h n is the normal depth of water finally to have the complete solution of this model knowledge is required for all the time of the evolution of the infiltrated water depth which in this study was obtained with the green and ampt equation 1911 2 1 2 the green and ampt equation the green and ampt equation is established under the following hypotheses a the initial moisture content Œ∏ i is constant throughout the soil column b during the infiltration process two wetting zones are formed and one is totally saturated Œ∏ Œ∏ s 0 z z f t while the other one is dry with the initial moisture content Œ∏ i Œ∏ 0 c in the saturated zone the distribution of the pressure is hydrostatic œà h sup h f h sup z z f where œà is the water pressure h sup is the depth of water on the surface and h f is the suction on the wetting front and d the darcy flow is independent of z in the saturated zone and is equal to the infiltration flow that occurs on the surface thus the resulting green and ampt equation is 5 d i d t k s 1 h h f z f t i t Œ¥ Œ∏ z f t where Œ¥ Œ∏ Œ∏ s Œ∏ 0 is the storage capacity and i is the accumulated infiltrated volume per unit of soil surface or infiltrated water depth 2 1 3 analytical representation of optimal discharge the christiansen uniformity coefficient is maximized in the gravity irrigation simulation with the saint venant green and ampt system to obtain optimal discharge this optimal design discharge has a linear proportion to the order strip length which is 6 q o q u l where q u has units of unitary discharge per unit length since q u is a constant it is deduced that for the application of a specific irrigation depth a unique irrigation time exists which is independent of the length that allows a maximum value of the uniformity coefficient to be obtained the structure of eq 6 is deduced considering that the net water volume per unit width of border strip equals the product of the length border strip l by the net irrigation depth ‚Ñì n and is also equal to the product of the input discharge q o by the time necessary to infiltrate the net depth œÑ n q o œÑ n l ‚Ñì n the relationship is also argued by involving the irrigation time to obtain the volume per unit width that is provided by the gross depth q o œÑ b l ‚Ñì b comparing both results with eq 6 it follows 7 q u ‚Ñì n œÑ n ‚Ñì b œÑ b it should be noted that this relationship implies considering eq 7 the following expression for the application efficiency 8 Œ∑ a ‚Ñì n ‚Ñì b œÑ n œÑ b the minimum unitary irrigation discharge for the water wave to arrive at the end of the streambed is given by q m k s l the discharge should be greater than this minimum discharge and the inequality q o q m must be satisfied if it is written q o Œ± u q m where Œ± u is a dimensionless parameter that must satisfy Œ± u 1 then eq s 6 and 7 are written as follows 9 q o Œ± u k s l Œ± u q u k s ‚Ñì n k s œÑ n in which it must be investigated the dependence of Œ± u with respect to the irrigation depth and the soil properties the time variation of the water depth on the soil is provided by the system of equations saint venant green and ampt but its analytical representation is unknown which is why it is supposed to be equal to zero integrating eq 5 with the condition i 0 at t 0 and with the null water depth written as 10 k s t i s 2 2 k s ln 1 2 k s s 2 i Œª h f Œ∏ s Œ∏ 0 s 2 2 k s the relationship between the optimal irrigation time and the net irrigation depth is deduced from the above equation namely 11 œÑ n 1 k s ‚Ñì n s 2 2 k s ln 1 2 k s s 2 ‚Ñì n fig 2 compares the optimal infiltration time obtained with the system of equations of saint venant and green and ampt and the one obtained with eq 11 of green and ampt 1911 r 2 0 9979 introducing eqs 11 into 9 provides the formula for calculating the optimal unitary discharge as a function of the border strip length the net depth the characteristic infiltration parameters which represent the capillary forces the sorptivity and the gravitational forces the saturated hydraulic conductivity and a shape parameter of the hydrodynamic characteristics namely 12 q o Œ± u k s l Œ± u ‚Ñì n ‚Ñì n s 2 2 k s ln 1 2 k s s 2 ‚Ñì n in which it should be noted that k s l q m represents the minimum unitary irrigation discharge for the wave to arrive at the end of the border s is the sorptivity of the medium expressed by s 2 2 k s h f Œ∏ s Œ∏ o k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity h f is the suction at the wetting front Œ∏ s and Œ∏ o are the contents of moisture at saturation and at the initial depth respectively and ‚Ñì n is the net irrigation depth to be applied according to the established crop and the phenological stage in which it is found this analytical formula has been validated with the complete model of the saint venant and richards equations whose results are widely discussed in rend√≥n et al 2017 in this work eq 3 is solved with the method of finite differences with an eulerian approach the values of the coefficients used in this study have been taken from the work of ch√°vez and fuentes 2018 the input data required by the model were measured in the field from irrigation tests and direct measurements of the moisture content and the infiltration parameters k s and h f were estimated through an inverse method using levenverg marquardt s optimization algorithm mor√© 1978 2 2 study area irrigation tests were carried out in plots belonging to irrigation district 085 la bego√±a guanajuato mexico which is located in the central eastern part of the state of guanajuato and includes the municipalities of celaya and comonfort geographically this site is located between the parallels 20 38 and 21 07 n and the meridians 100 45 and 100 53 w of the greenwich meridian comisi√≥n nacional del agua conagua 2017 the irrigation district 085 la bego√±a covers an area of 12 389 5 ha and serves 3288 users the main source of water for irrigation comes from the laja river and its main tributary is the neutla stream it has two storage dams ignacio allende and isidro orozco portugal 2 3 measurements of variables the characteristics and properties that were measured in the plots were length slope texture bulk density initial and at saturation moisture content the first two were obtained with a total station the initial moisture contents were obtained with a calibrated tdr 300 the texture was obtained by analyzing soil samples in the laboratory with the bouyucos method the bulk density œÅ a was obtained with the cylinder of the known volume method and the moisture content at saturation Œ∏ s was assimilated to the total porosity of the soil œï which was obtained from the bulk density and density of solids œÅ s taken as 2 65 g c m 3 i e Œ∏ s œï 1 œÅ a œÅ s the measurement of the variables and the hydrodynamic characterization of soils are widely discussed in ch√°vez y fuentes 2018 2 4 irrigation tests to carry out the irrigation tests after characterizing the soil and measuring the initial moisture content chains with flags were set every 20 or 30 m to measure the advance and recession phase a variation that was in function of the length of the furrow or border once irrigation started the times in which the water wave reached the previously placed flags and when the water was cut off at the entrance of the furrow or border were measured all the irrigation tests evaluated in this study were carried out at the open furrow during the development of the irrigation test the expense at the entrance of the user and the furrows was measured using a doppler ultrasonic flow meter fluxsense when the water was almost at the end of the furrows the water was cut off at the entrance and the recession phase was measured it is important to mention that during the evaluation of the irrigation tests there was no interference from the users since the interest we have in this test is to evaluate how it is being irrigated and above all the water depths that were applied thus in some cases irrigation with sets from 20 to 65 furrows was evaluated and the variation depended on the expense of the entrance to the plot and the experience of each of the users 3 results and discussion 3 1 textures analysis and moisture content at saturation table 1 shows the results of the 250 irrigation test analysis where it can be seen that the predominant soil in 1010 52 ha is the clay loam texture which comprises 36 16 of the surface moreover the value of the moisture content at saturation is classified by textural class and as seen the value changed even within the same type of soil so it is important to measure moisture content before starting a study and proceeding with caution when taking the average values that are recommended by some authors di et al 2017 fangm et al 2018 weibo et al 2017 3 2 evaluation of the irrigation tests with the advanced and recession data and the characteristics of the soils from the locations where the irrigation tests were carried out the calibration of the test was performed using the kinematic wave model whereby using the nonlinear optimization algorithm levenberg marquardt mor√© 1978 we proceeded to find the characteristic values that minimized the sum of the squares of the errors in this test as an example fig 3 shows the final result of the calibration and the fitting found for plot 973 0 k s 1 3 cm h and h f 108 cm in this irrigation test the user wanted to apply 20 cm water depth lr however after measuring the volume of water entering the plot and the application time the user applied 75 cm water depth that is 55 cm more than was needed which tells us that the application efficiency that the user has is 26 4 once the calibration was completed it was also possible to see that an efficiency of requirement er of 100 an efficiency of application e a of 26 4 and a coefficient of uniformity of christiansen cuc of 91 8 were obtained there were high efficiencies due to the volume of water that was applied on the soil however this simple analysis allows us to see that the user s usual way of irrigating slow advance is critical and must be changed table 2 shows the results that were obtained from the evaluation of the 250 irrigation tests discharge at the entrance of the plot q number of furrows by irrigation set n saturated hydraulic conductivity k s efficiency of application e a the slope of the direction of irrigation s the mean x and the standard deviation œÉ of all parameters in general it can be seen that the application efficiencies are very low however it is important to note that soils with silty clay texture are those with the highest efficiencies 52 69 and the soils with sandy clay loam are those that present the lowest efficiencies 32 36 in addition it can be seen that there is no correspondence between the expense received at the entrance of the plot and the number of furrows that are opened by a set of irrigation which is reflected in a low efficiency of application the irrigation tests were performed in plots with the next crops zea mayz 26 25 sorghum vulgare 18 42 medicago sativa 16 01 phaseolus vulgaris 13 99 pachyrhizus erosus 8 13 hordeum vulgare 6 41 triticum aestivum 6 03 and allium cepa 4 67 3 3 irrigation design with the parameters found k s and h f for the evaluation of the irrigation tests and the net irrigation depth that is intended to be applied on the plot water depth depending on each of the crops established in the plots eq 12 is used to make the design the obtained result is the expense that must go into each furrow for this value we divide the expense for the entrance of the plot between that obtained with eq 12 and then approach the nearest whole value as a result the equation gives us the number of furrows that the user has to open by set and the time that must pass before cutting off the water in table 3 the evaluation and design carried out in lot 973 0 is shown as an example it can be seen that the user was used to irrigate by a set of 45 furrows for which to finish the irrigation on his plot the user used a time of 8 18 days which involved 75 cm water depth however once the design was complete he was told that with the expense of entering the plot he only had to open 31 furrows per set and change it every 209 min therefore the user now irrigates in only 2 17 days which translates into a 6 days reduction in the irrigation time which is equivalent to a savings of 55 cm water depth and a 71 7 increase in the application efficiency figs 4 6 show the results obtained when applying the design with the analytical formula the number of furrows by sets decreases fig 4 the irrigation time per hectare is lower fig 5 and the water depths applied are close to the water depth design fig 6 in fig 5 it can also be seen that the irrigation times per hectare decreased considerably in all the textural classes however the atypical points that are still shown in the irrigation with design correspond to the plots having slope problems and the recommendation given to the owners is that leveling is needed to further reduce the times of irrigation on the other hand the atypical points in fig 6 correspond to those plots that had irrigation lengths that are longer than 150 m in some cases 320 m lengths were measured which is the relevant recommendation to cut off the irrigation runs to no more than 150 m to reduce percolation losses 3 4 reduction in water use on average for each irrigation event little more than 2150 m 3 h a 1 is not being applied however as was observed in fig 7 there are some cases in which the reduction in water use applied exceeds 9500 m 3 this occurred in those plots where besides reducing the number of furrows per set the distances of the furrows were shortened and in some cases the leveling that was implemented by the owners also helped to reduce the volume that was applied on the other hand in the same graph it can be seen that there are minimal savings this is because not all the results of the irrigation evaluation were deficient since several users were found to have efficiencies greater than 70 and the recommendation given with the analytical formula was to decrease from 4 to 7 furrows per irrigation 4 conclusions the analytical formula that was used for the design of irrigation by gravity was used with successful results it could be seen that together with the validation made with the saint venant and richards complete equations their use of the kinematic wave model gives very good results the measurement of the advance and recession tests in the plots is of great importance without them there would be no data on the water depths that were applied the efficiencies of application or especially the representative parameters of each plot the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the suction in the moisture front in addition to knowledge of the soil conditions including length slope moisture content and texture the results of the design of the surface gravity irrigation with the formula allows for savings in water depths from 10 up to 118 cm and also a reduction in the irrigation times which in some cases involved 69 time savings the above data not only mean a savings in the amount of water applied to the crop but also refers to a decrease in the volume of water that is extracted from the storage sources which may allow more of the surface area to be irrigated with the same volume of water stored acknowledgements this work was supported as part of a collaboration

cultivated plants fuentes et al 2012 in surface gravity irrigation there are three phases the advanced phase the storage phase and the recession phase which together are studied with a variety of models to understand the phenomenon however with the application of water in this method it is much more difficult to have good efficiency since there are many losses by tailwater due to the selection of an inappropriate irrigation flow or due to poor operation in the water distribution network due to poor leveling in the ground by percolation which is due to a poor design of the length of irrigation or the expense of irrigation and allows water to remain longer than necessary at each point along the furrow or border in many cases these inadequate irrigation practices have led to over elevation of water tables and progressive soil salinization fig 1 a and b shows two examples of bad surface gravity irrigation designs in the figure on the left the expense given to a border was of such magnitude that it overflowed the borders while in the figure on the right the opportune time of irrigation was greater than that which was required in both cases the consequence was a partial flooding of the land that brings devastating consequences for the soil and the crop there are a large number of models that describe gravity fed surface irrigation ranging from empirical to physical based models that use the barr√© de saint venant and richards equations to model the surface movement and underground movement respectively schmitz et al 1985 saucedo et al 2005 2011 fuentes et al 2012 saucedo et al 2015 the use of these models whether numerical or analytical helps us to understand the movement of water in an irrigation event which allows us to give pertinent recommendations for efficient application of water in the plot however the complexity that these models has in some cases caused their use to be limited only to theoretical investigations in recent years an efficient irrigation design has been extensively studied since it is a question of applying the optimal expense to furrow or border irrigation which is defined as one that allows maximum uniformity to be obtained in water distribution along a border or furrow this uniformity is achieved with the maximization of the christiansen coefficient thus maintaining high values of application efficiency ea which is defined as the amount of water available to crops in relation to the water applied to the plots and irrigation requirement efficiency er which is defined as the required volume by the crop in relation to the available volume to the crop however this improvement consists of new solving methods of the saint venant and richards equations banti et al 2011 and the results are compared with existing conventional solutions seidel et al 2015 in an effort to reduce computation times moreover other authors have tried to optimize the optimal expense by using the saint venant equation on the surface but the infiltrated water depth is calculated with the empirical equation of kostiakov lewis morris et al 2015 gillies et al 2015 however optimization is done by trial and error moving the expense according to the modeler s experience or with constants obtained from the literature although modern and traditional pressurized irrigation systems are still a viable option because of all the advantages they offer a good design of surface gravity irrigation will continue to represent a cheap alternative to provide the right amount of water to plants with reasonable irrigation efficiency rend√≥n et al 2012 the aim of this study is to show the design of surface gravity irrigation with an analytical formula rend√≥n et al 2017 in the irrigation district 085 la bego√±a guanajuato mexico the evaluation and irrigation design is developed using the kinematic wave model with the characteristic values of the plot length moisture content density texture and for the design of the optimal expense the found values of the evaluation k s and h f and the characteristics of the plot length moisture content net irrigation depth to apply and bulk density are used 2 methodology 2 1 theoretical aspects 2 1 1 the kinematic wave model the kinematic wave model considers that in the equation of momentum the inertial and pressure terms are negligible with respect to the terms of friction and gravity with such assumptions the model of barr√© de saint venant is as follows 1 a t q x w 2 j j o this model is expressed by eq 3 ponce 1980 woolhiser 1980 litrico 2001 3 q t c k q q x c k q w c k q q a the value of the coefficient c k q is obtained from a law of resistance with j j o that is c k Œ± Œ≤ q Œ± 1 1 Œ≤ since the friction and gravitational forces are considered to be equal there is no appreciable acceleration of the flow and therefore the model is applicable to runoffs with small expenses and gentle slopes as in surface gravity irrigation from simulations in channels of different geometric and operational characteristics it has been established that the kinematic wave model adequately represents the dynamics of the flow provided that the following inequality is fulfilled ligget and woolhiser 1967 4 k j o l o f o 2 h n 30 where k is a kinematic number j o is the slope of the bottom of the channel l o is the normalized length of the channel and can be taken as the length of the channel f o 2 q 2 t g a 3 the froude number q is the discharge at the entrance of the channel t is the width of the free surface in the same position a is the area at the entrance of the channel and h n is the normal depth of water finally to have the complete solution of this model knowledge is required for all the time of the evolution of the infiltrated water depth which in this study was obtained with the green and ampt equation 1911 2 1 2 the green and ampt equation the green and ampt equation is established under the following hypotheses a the initial moisture content Œ∏ i is constant throughout the soil column b during the infiltration process two wetting zones are formed and one is totally saturated Œ∏ Œ∏ s 0 z z f t while the other one is dry with the initial moisture content Œ∏ i Œ∏ 0 c in the saturated zone the distribution of the pressure is hydrostatic œà h sup h f h sup z z f where œà is the water pressure h sup is the depth of water on the surface and h f is the suction on the wetting front and d the darcy flow is independent of z in the saturated zone and is equal to the infiltration flow that occurs on the surface thus the resulting green and ampt equation is 5 d i d t k s 1 h h f z f t i t Œ¥ Œ∏ z f t where Œ¥ Œ∏ Œ∏ s Œ∏ 0 is the storage capacity and i is the accumulated infiltrated volume per unit of soil surface or infiltrated water depth 2 1 3 analytical representation of optimal discharge the christiansen uniformity coefficient is maximized in the gravity irrigation simulation with the saint venant green and ampt system to obtain optimal discharge this optimal design discharge has a linear proportion to the order strip length which is 6 q o q u l where q u has units of unitary discharge per unit length since q u is a constant it is deduced that for the application of a specific irrigation depth a unique irrigation time exists which is independent of the length that allows a maximum value of the uniformity coefficient to be obtained the structure of eq 6 is deduced considering that the net water volume per unit width of border strip equals the product of the length border strip l by the net irrigation depth ‚Ñì n and is also equal to the product of the input discharge q o by the time necessary to infiltrate the net depth œÑ n q o œÑ n l ‚Ñì n the relationship is also argued by involving the irrigation time to obtain the volume per unit width that is provided by the gross depth q o œÑ b l ‚Ñì b comparing both results with eq 6 it follows 7 q u ‚Ñì n œÑ n ‚Ñì b œÑ b it should be noted that this relationship implies considering eq 7 the following expression for the application efficiency 8 Œ∑ a ‚Ñì n ‚Ñì b œÑ n œÑ b the minimum unitary irrigation discharge for the water wave to arrive at the end of the streambed is given by q m k s l the discharge should be greater than this minimum discharge and the inequality q o q m must be satisfied if it is written q o Œ± u q m where Œ± u is a dimensionless parameter that must satisfy Œ± u 1 then eq s 6 and 7 are written as follows 9 q o Œ± u k s l Œ± u q u k s ‚Ñì n k s œÑ n in which it must be investigated the dependence of Œ± u with respect to the irrigation depth and the soil properties the time variation of the water depth on the soil is provided by the system of equations saint venant green and ampt but its analytical representation is unknown which is why it is supposed to be equal to zero integrating eq 5 with the condition i 0 at t 0 and with the null water depth written as 10 k s t i s 2 2 k s ln 1 2 k s s 2 i Œª h f Œ∏ s Œ∏ 0 s 2 2 k s the relationship between the optimal irrigation time and the net irrigation depth is deduced from the above equation namely 11 œÑ n 1 k s ‚Ñì n s 2 2 k s ln 1 2 k s s 2 ‚Ñì n fig 2 compares the optimal infiltration time obtained with the system of equations of saint venant and green and ampt and the one obtained with eq 11 of green and ampt 1911 r 2 0 9979 introducing eqs 11 into 9 provides the formula for calculating the optimal unitary discharge as a function of the border strip length the net depth the characteristic infiltration parameters which represent the capillary forces the sorptivity and the gravitational forces the saturated hydraulic conductivity and a shape parameter of the hydrodynamic characteristics namely 12 q o Œ± u k s l Œ± u ‚Ñì n ‚Ñì n s 2 2 k s ln 1 2 k s s 2 ‚Ñì n in which it should be noted that k s l q m represents the minimum unitary irrigation discharge for the wave to arrive at the end of the border s is the sorptivity of the medium expressed by s 2 2 k s h f Œ∏ s Œ∏ o k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity h f is the suction at the wetting front Œ∏ s and Œ∏ o are the contents of moisture at saturation and at the initial depth respectively and ‚Ñì n is the net irrigation depth to be applied according to the established crop and the phenological stage in which it is found this analytical formula has been validated with the complete model of the saint venant and richards equations whose results are widely discussed in rend√≥n et al 2017 in this work eq 3 is solved with the method of finite differences with an eulerian approach the values of the coefficients used in this study have been taken from the work of ch√°vez and fuentes 2018 the input data required by the model were measured in the field from irrigation tests and direct measurements of the moisture content and the infiltration parameters k s and h f were estimated through an inverse method using levenverg marquardt s optimization algorithm mor√© 1978 2 2 study area irrigation tests were carried out in plots belonging to irrigation district 085 la bego√±a guanajuato mexico which is located in the central eastern part of the state of guanajuato and includes the municipalities of celaya and comonfort geographically this site is located between the parallels 20 38 and 21 07 n and the meridians 100 45 and 100 53 w of the greenwich meridian comisi√≥n nacional del agua conagua 2017 the irrigation district 085 la bego√±a covers an area of 12 389 5 ha and serves 3288 users the main source of water for irrigation comes from the laja river and its main tributary is the neutla stream it has two storage dams ignacio allende and isidro orozco portugal 2 3 measurements of variables the characteristics and properties that were measured in the plots were length slope texture bulk density initial and at saturation moisture content the first two were obtained with a total station the initial moisture contents were obtained with a calibrated tdr 300 the texture was obtained by analyzing soil samples in the laboratory with the bouyucos method the bulk density œÅ a was obtained with the cylinder of the known volume method and the moisture content at saturation Œ∏ s was assimilated to the total porosity of the soil œï which was obtained from the bulk density and density of solids œÅ s taken as 2 65 g c m 3 i e Œ∏ s œï 1 œÅ a œÅ s the measurement of the variables and the hydrodynamic characterization of soils are widely discussed in ch√°vez y fuentes 2018 2 4 irrigation tests to carry out the irrigation tests after characterizing the soil and measuring the initial moisture content chains with flags were set every 20 or 30 m to measure the advance and recession phase a variation that was in function of the length of the furrow or border once irrigation started the times in which the water wave reached the previously placed flags and when the water was cut off at the entrance of the furrow or border were measured all the irrigation tests evaluated in this study were carried out at the open furrow during the development of the irrigation test the expense at the entrance of the user and the furrows was measured using a doppler ultrasonic flow meter fluxsense when the water was almost at the end of the furrows the water was cut off at the entrance and the recession phase was measured it is important to mention that during the evaluation of the irrigation tests there was no interference from the users since the interest we have in this test is to evaluate how it is being irrigated and above all the water depths that were applied thus in some cases irrigation with sets from 20 to 65 furrows was evaluated and the variation depended on the expense of the entrance to the plot and the experience of each of the users 3 results and discussion 3 1 textures analysis and moisture content at saturation table 1 shows the results of the 250 irrigation test analysis where it can be seen that the predominant soil in 1010 52 ha is the clay loam texture which comprises 36 16 of the surface moreover the value of the moisture content at saturation is classified by textural class and as seen the value changed even within the same type of soil so it is important to measure moisture content before starting a study and proceeding with caution when taking the average values that are recommended by some authors di et al 2017 fangm et al 2018 weibo et al 2017 3 2 evaluation of the irrigation tests with the advanced and recession data and the characteristics of the soils from the locations where the irrigation tests were carried out the calibration of the test was performed using the kinematic wave model whereby using the nonlinear optimization algorithm levenberg marquardt mor√© 1978 we proceeded to find the characteristic values that minimized the sum of the squares of the errors in this test as an example fig 3 shows the final result of the calibration and the fitting found for plot 973 0 k s 1 3 cm h and h f 108 cm in this irrigation test the user wanted to apply 20 cm water depth lr however after measuring the volume of water entering the plot and the application time the user applied 75 cm water depth that is 55 cm more than was needed which tells us that the application efficiency that the user has is 26 4 once the calibration was completed it was also possible to see that an efficiency of requirement er of 100 an efficiency of application e a of 26 4 and a coefficient of uniformity of christiansen cuc of 91 8 were obtained there were high efficiencies due to the volume of water that was applied on the soil however this simple analysis allows us to see that the user s usual way of irrigating slow advance is critical and must be changed table 2 shows the results that were obtained from the evaluation of the 250 irrigation tests discharge at the entrance of the plot q number of furrows by irrigation set n saturated hydraulic conductivity k s efficiency of application e a the slope of the direction of irrigation s the mean x and the standard deviation œÉ of all parameters in general it can be seen that the application efficiencies are very low however it is important to note that soils with silty clay texture are those with the highest efficiencies 52 69 and the soils with sandy clay loam are those that present the lowest efficiencies 32 36 in addition it can be seen that there is no correspondence between the expense received at the entrance of the plot and the number of furrows that are opened by a set of irrigation which is reflected in a low efficiency of application the irrigation tests were performed in plots with the next crops zea mayz 26 25 sorghum vulgare 18 42 medicago sativa 16 01 phaseolus vulgaris 13 99 pachyrhizus erosus 8 13 hordeum vulgare 6 41 triticum aestivum 6 03 and allium cepa 4 67 3 3 irrigation design with the parameters found k s and h f for the evaluation of the irrigation tests and the net irrigation depth that is intended to be applied on the plot water depth depending on each of the crops established in the plots eq 12 is used to make the design the obtained result is the expense that must go into each furrow for this value we divide the expense for the entrance of the plot between that obtained with eq 12 and then approach the nearest whole value as a result the equation gives us the number of furrows that the user has to open by set and the time that must pass before cutting off the water in table 3 the evaluation and design carried out in lot 973 0 is shown as an example it can be seen that the user was used to irrigate by a set of 45 furrows for which to finish the irrigation on his plot the user used a time of 8 18 days which involved 75 cm water depth however once the design was complete he was told that with the expense of entering the plot he only had to open 31 furrows per set and change it every 209 min therefore the user now irrigates in only 2 17 days which translates into a 6 days reduction in the irrigation time which is equivalent to a savings of 55 cm water depth and a 71 7 increase in the application efficiency figs 4 6 show the results obtained when applying the design with the analytical formula the number of furrows by sets decreases fig 4 the irrigation time per hectare is lower fig 5 and the water depths applied are close to the water depth design fig 6 in fig 5 it can also be seen that the irrigation times per hectare decreased considerably in all the textural classes however the atypical points that are still shown in the irrigation with design correspond to the plots having slope problems and the recommendation given to the owners is that leveling is needed to further reduce the times of irrigation on the other hand the atypical points in fig 6 correspond to those plots that had irrigation lengths that are longer than 150 m in some cases 320 m lengths were measured which is the relevant recommendation to cut off the irrigation runs to no more than 150 m to reduce percolation losses 3 4 reduction in water use on average for each irrigation event little more than 2150 m 3 h a 1 is not being applied however as was observed in fig 7 there are some cases in which the reduction in water use applied exceeds 9500 m 3 this occurred in those plots where besides reducing the number of furrows per set the distances of the furrows were shortened and in some cases the leveling that was implemented by the owners also helped to reduce the volume that was applied on the other hand in the same graph it can be seen that there are minimal savings this is because not all the results of the irrigation evaluation were deficient since several users were found to have efficiencies greater than 70 and the recommendation given with the analytical formula was to decrease from 4 to 7 furrows per irrigation 4 conclusions the analytical formula that was used for the design of irrigation by gravity was used with successful results it could be seen that together with the validation made with the saint venant and richards complete equations their use of the kinematic wave model gives very good results the measurement of the advance and recession tests in the plots is of great importance without them there would be no data on the water depths that were applied the efficiencies of application or especially the representative parameters of each plot the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the suction in the moisture front in addition to knowledge of the soil conditions including length slope moisture content and texture the results of the design of the surface gravity irrigation with the formula allows for savings in water depths from 10 up to 118 cm and also a reduction in the irrigation times which in some cases involved 69 time savings the above data not only mean a savings in the amount of water applied to the crop but also refers to a decrease in the volume of water that is extracted from the storage sources which may allow more of the surface area to be irrigated with the same volume of water stored acknowledgements this work was supported as part of a collaboration

11002,demand for irrigation water has been steadily increasing in arid regions where intensification of crop production is supported by flood irrigation an assessment of irrigation performance water productivity and irrigation schedules is critical to water conservation in dry climates in this study we conducted a field experiment to compare soil water balance in a flood irrigated wheat maize rotation system during the growing season of 2015 2016 we then modeled the soil water balance and improved irrigation strategies by coupling hydrus 1d with the cropwat model and using evapotranspiration calculated from climatic data the calibrated hydrus 1d model was used to simulate the temporal and spatial variation of evapotranspiration and deep percolation based on measured soil water distribution of soil profiles in the unsaturated zone results showed that using soil hydraulic parameters from inversion modeling can simulate soil water flow in multi layer soil during a crop growing season simulation results indicated that about 36 6 and 40 6 478 6 and 680 1 mm of total water input in 2015 and 2016 respectively was consumed by evapotranspiration furthermore simulated deep percolation amounted for approximately 32 3 and 42 9 403 9 and 696 6 mm of the total amount of irrigation water in 2015 and 2016 respectively these results indicated that only a small proportion of irrigation water was used by crops for transpiration in addition irrigation performance indicators such as relative water supply relative irrigation supply depleted fraction and overall consumed ratio values indicated poor performance of irrigation practices in the study area particularly crop yields did not increase with increases in irrigation water in flood irrigated fields during the last ten years results of the cropwat model indicated that combinations of a fixed irrigation depth and timing of 40 mm every 10 days and 50 mm every 10 days were reasonable for wheat and maize respectively given the sandy soil in the study area the improved irrigation strategies will limit water irrigation loss to 20 without significant effects on crop yields this study provides an alternative approach for estimating deep percolation and crop water requirements supporting management efforts in water conservation in dry climates keywords soil water dynamic deep percolation irrigation schedules hydrus 1d model cropwat model 1 introduction water shortage is gradually developing into one of the most pressing crises in many parts of the world alcamo et al 2017 gleeson et al 2012 water is becoming increasingly scarce and expensive due to demands from the ever growing human population industry and agriculture roost et al 2008 during the last twenty years in particular water scarcity has affected the development of irrigated agriculture in arid and semi arid regions where agriculture consumes more than 90 of total water available wawer et al 2014 whittlesey et al 2003 conflicts arising from the needs for water for irrigation and the environment have become a novel challenge zhou et al 2013 making future water management even more difficult than currently lemke et al 2007 northwestern china is one of the most intensively irrigated and highly productive areas in the world inefficient irrigation systems and lack of knowledge to optimize irrigation schedules have resulted in over exploitation of ground and surface water to meet irrigation needs zhu et al 2013 after fertilizer water is one of the most important inputs in high yield grain production jalota and arora 2002 li et al 2004 traditional flood irrigation is the predominant irrigation method in northwestern china but it requires more water than other irrigation types sharmasarkar et al 2001 the heihe river basin in northwestern china is one of the most important agricultural area in the country irrigated agriculture is the primary consumer of water in this region ground and river water are the main source of agricultural water supply contributing approximately 84 to the total agricultural water use gao et al 2004 in recent decades the extraction of groundwater has greatly increased to accommodate increasing food demand economic pressure and surface water deficits wei et al 2010 zhao et al 2010c in turn the excessive extraction of groundwater has led to the drying up of many inland rivers ji et al 2006 2005 zhu et al 2013 indeed it was presumed that over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation purposes was partly responsible for the decrease in ground water levels in this region zhu et al 2013 maize and wheat are the main irrigated crop in the heihe river basin area and both crops have high irrigation requirements stone et al 2001 water supply is largely dependent on irrigation because average annual precipitation is very low but evapotranspiration is very high in this area average daily evapotranspiration in maize exceeded 10 mm d at milking stage howell et al 1997 while that in wheat reached 8 5 mm d in mid season wang et al 2010c about 43 of flood irrigation in a maize field was consumed by deep percolation ji et al 2007 consequently one of the simplest ways to maintain high and stable yields is to increase irrigation amount however water resources are scarce in the heihe river basin and high efficiency irrigation strategies must be adopted to quantify the flood irrigated water partitioning during the crop growing season in order to mitigate water stresses and to support agricultural water management at present much attention has been given to irrigation water losses that lower water use efficiency and cause deep percolation field studies have focused on the soil water balance under different field conditions kovac et al 2005 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 wang et al 2016 zhao and zhao 2014a evapotranspiration under different irrigations methods lian et al 2014 lv et al 2010 tong et al 2007 wang et al 2010b zhao and zhao 2014b zhao et al 2010b and irrigation scheduling he et al 2017 shang et al 2004 simulation efforts determined deep percolation under flood irrigation du and shao 2014 li and shao 2014 these studies concentrated on the relationship between irrigation amount and deep percolation or evapotranspiration the effects of different irrigation regimes on crop productivity and effects of different tillage methods on soil water balance however we know little about high efficiency irrigation strategies in flood irrigated fields and detailed irrigation plans have yet to be proposed zhao and zhao 2014a in addition field studies are time consuming and laborious while regional hydrological processes complex due to spatial variability of soils crops weather groundwater and irrigation and management practices jiang et al 2015 a more expedient alternative to identifying efficient irrigation strategies involves modeling of the effects of irrigation strategies on soil water balance and crop productivity xi et al 2016 challenges to modeling approaches involve obtaining data on agrometeorological conditions soil physical properties root distribution and crop growth dynamics farming practices and water regimes in specific crop fields tan et al 2014 to develop a sensible irrigation plan for flood irrigation conditions using computer simulation soil water dynamics in the crop rooting zone needs to be quantified first the hydrus 1d model is a well known mechanistic model that predicts variability of saturated one dimensional soil water movement and root water uptake simunek et al 2008 ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2006 so far the hydrus 1d model has been used to simulate water movement in maize fields hou et al 2016 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 spring wheat and rotation cropping systems liu et al 2013 to our knowledge the model was seldom used to simulate evapotranspiration or deep percolation in maize or in wheat maize rotation fields the hydrus 1d model simulates one dimensional water movement in multi layered variably saturated soil it was applied to predict actual evapotranspiration and deep percolation in combination with reference crop evapotranspiration e t 0 crop stress coefficient k c was used to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration penman monteith equation recommended by fao in 1998 was used to calculate e t 0 bormann et al 1999 goyal 2004 kite and droogers 2000 and richards equation model was used to predict deep percolation jim√©nez mart√≠nez et al 2009 selle et al 2011 simulation of deep percolation or evapotranspiration derived from the hydrus 1d model combined with irrigation performance indicators such as relative water supply relative irrigation supply depleted fraction and overall consumed ratio values will allow irrigation performance assessment one of the key elements in improving irrigation management merriam et al 1980 then assessment results can be applied to generate irrigation schedules for different crop and seasons an irrigation schedule should involve crop monitoring soil monitoring and a water balance technique cropwat a software package developed by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao uses soil water budgeting in the root zone in which actual evapotranspiration calculation also estimated by e t 0 with k c and water stress coefficient k s and the penman monteith equation recommended by fao in 1998 was used to calculate e t 0 it showed higher accuracy and wider suitability in application therefore the cropwat model was used to recognize crop water deficits in irrigated fields smith 1992 to estimate the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration in spring maize feng et al 2007 and to design irrigation schedules setegn et al 2011 because it requires minimal climatic information soil properties and crop information cropwat is widely used for developing irrigation schedules ali et al 2011 currently farmers have little incentive to save water moreover not all of farmers realize that water is a finite resource wang et al 2010a especially in arid regions where flood irrigation prevails water waste during agricultural irrigation is still extremely high some of the immediate needs in water management include efficient use of limited soil water for flood irrigation understanding the relationship between evapotranspiration and deep percolation under different irrigation patterns and analysis of effects of field soil water budgeting and different irrigation schedules on farming practices the objectives of this study were to a evaluate the accuracy of hydrus 1d model in simulating soil water dynamics in a wheat maize rotation system in flood irrigated conditions using field data b predict soil evapotranspiration and deep percolation during a growing season with hydrus 1d model and c evaluate the performance of current irrigation practices and improve irrigation scheduling with the cropwat model 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experimental description 2 1 1 study area a field experiment was conducted in

the sink term s was specified in terms of a potential water uptake rate and a stress factor feddes et al 1978 defined s as follows 5 s h Œ± h s p s p b z t p where Œ± h was a prescribed dimensionless

the wheat and maize roots in the field were generally distributed within a depth of 0 80 cm and 0 100 cm with the maximum root depth to 80 and 100 cm respectively therefore we assumed linearly

fitting soil water retention data table 2 fig 4 retc uses a nonlinear least squares optimization approach to estimate the unknown model parameters from observed retention data genuchten et al 1991 2 4 2 potential et the measured values of lai were key parameters at each growth stage during two years model input data were given on the basis of field observation data by fitting a regression curve table 3 2 4 3 soil water flux rainfall and irrigation events were measured during the growing period directly in the field the relevant data are shown as follows table 4 2 5 initial and boundary conditions in this modeling effort initial conditions were defined based on the measured soil water content and turned the soil water content into soil matric potential with the vg model since the soil surface is subjected to the atmospheric boundary condition the atmospheric boundary condition was specified for the top of soil surface in the water movement for hydrus 1d model where the parameters are the measured and calculated values as described above free drainage was considered at the low boundary when water table was absent fig 5 the soil profile was considered to be 120 cm in depth a spatial discretization of 1 cm was used leading to 121 nodes across the whole profile and no hysteresis in water retention was considered the soil matric potential was interpolated at various depths from values measured on march 19 2015 at 0 00 and on march 25 2016 at 0 00 respectively observation nodes were placed in 0 120 cm depths at 20 cm intervals to track moisture fluxes 2 6 test of hydrus 1d model performance root means square error rmse and mean weighted absolute error mae were applied to test the difference between simulated and measured values as follows 17 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 18 m a e 1 n i 1 n m i s i where n was the number of observed data points si was the simulated value m i was the observed value and m was the mean observed value the closer the rmse was to 0 the closer were the simulation results to actual values 2 7 soil water balance water balances in the field during the crop growing season were estimated based on the following equation 19 Œ¥ s w s i r e t a s where sws was the change in soil water storage between crop planting and harvesting mm determining water consumption of the crop during growth r and i were the amounts of rainfall and irrigation mm respectively and s was deep percolation amount mm e t a at field level was the evapotranspiration mm which was estimated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration derived from the penman monteith equation by the maize coefficient allen et al 1998 and based on meteorological data 2 8 performance of irrigation practices in the field in this study the irrigation system was assessed using common irrigation performance indicators such as relative water supply rws relative irrigation supply ris depleted fraction df and overall consumed ratio ocr mathematically these were represented as 20 r w s i p e t a s 21 r i s i e t a s p e f f 22 d f e t a i p 23 o c r e t a p e f f i where p was rainfall i was irrigation e t a was crop evapotranspiration and s was deep percolation and p e f f was effective rainfall a ris value of 1 indicated efficient irrigation whereas values 1 indicated potential for crop stress if the supply was sufficient the ocr value was around 1 if it was 1 it indicated under irrigation and a value 1 indicated over irrigation 2 9 numerical modeling with cropwat cropwat http www fao org nr water infores databases cropwat html version 8 0 is a software package developed by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao smith 1992 which is being used to design an irrigation schedule or recognize water deficits in irrigated or rainfed conditions 2 9 1 irrigation efficiency irrigation application rates were estimated through field investigation and irrigation application rates were about 70 percent in this region in the past years 2 9 2 crop evapotranspiration in the cropwat model in combination with multiplying reference crop evapotranspiration e t 0 k c and k s was used to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration and the penman monteith equation recommended by fao in 1998 has been used to calculate e t 0 all climatic data for the growing period were obtained from the meteorological station as described for the hydrus 1d model 24 e t a e t 0 k c k s where k s was the water stress coefficient in our study k smax 1 with no water stress conditions under flood irrigation respective k c values for the three crop stages are found in table 5 2 9 3 crop data in this module crop data included crop coefficient stage of crop growth period root depth soil moisture depletion percentage yield response factor and planting and harvesting dates table 5 furthermore the estimation of water stress coefficient ks required a daily water balance computation for the root zone under soil water limiting conditions ks 1 while under no soil water stress ks 1 25 k s t a w d r 1 p t a w where ks was a dimensionless transpiration reduction factor dependent on available soil water 0 1 d r root zone depletion mm taw total available soil water in the root zone mm p fraction of taw that a crop can extract from the root zone without suffering water stress 2 9 4 soil data in this module soil data included total available soil water maximum rain infiltration rate maximum rooting depth and initial available soil water as described in the previous section for the hydrus 1d model 2 9 5 effective precipitation we used the method adopted by the usda soil conservation service in conjunction with the cropwat software for calculating effective precipitation franchek and biggam 1992 the equation was as shown 26 p e p m 125 0 2 p m 125 p m 250 m m 125 0 1 p m p m 250 m m where p e was effective rainfall and p m was monthly rainfall 2 10 irrigation application strategies for the crop field optimal water use at the field scale requires monitoring and measuring of soil water content to decide when to irrigate and how much irrigation accordingly irrigation schedules were developed using cropwat model for both light and medium soil conditions for some of the major irrigated crops namely wheat and maize therefore optimal irrigation schedules correspond to the combination of an irrigation interval and depth that result in both low water losses and a reasonable yield reduction this model is water driven with a core idea of modeling yield and water use efficiency for crop response functions the following equation was used to compute crop yield reduction 27 1 y a y max k y 1 e t a e t max where y a was the actual crop yield kg ha 1 y max was the maximum yield kg ha 1 k y was yield response factor e t max was maximum crop evapotranspiration in addition a fixed timing and depth of application option would ensure an optimized utilization of water resource and improve application efficiency 3 results 3 1 crop root distribution and uptake vertical root length density rld for wheat and maize at 0 100 cm depths is shown in fig 6 in this study rld gradually decreased with soil depth and about 80 of root length density for wheat was found between 0 and 30 cm of the soil profile with almost no rooting below 100 cm about 95 of maize roots was distributed in soil layers between 0 60 cm and only a small proportion reached to 100 cm similar results were reported in other studies and root density decreased exponentially with soil depth barron et al 2003 hou et al 2016 the hydrus 1d model can describe root water uptake in wheat very well specifically their simulations showed that hydrus 1d can be used for improving the efficiency of water use in flood irrigated mature wheat lv et al 2010 we showed in this study that root water uptake in wheat started during the early stages of seed germination fig 7 with growth the rate of water uptake by wheat roots increased gradually and peaked between 40 and 60 das because this period was the jointing and heading stage water demand increased while corresponding high values of lai further accelerated root water uptake the maximum rate of water uptake by wheat roots was 0 86 cm day 1 at approximately 50 das cumulative root water uptake during the wheat growing period was approximately 14 5 cm these observations were consistent with the results obtained by others tafteh et al 2017 root water uptake in maize was low in early growth stages and reached its peak about 60 das during the jointing and tasseling stages the maximum rate of water uptake was 0 82 cm day 1 at approximately 60 das cumulative root water uptake during the maize growing period was approximately 21 9 cm fig 7 which was consistent with previous results klement et al 2016 3 2 calibration and validation of the hydrus 1d model many previous studies have shown that model hydrus 1d is a reliable tool for describing soil water movement in different types of unsaturated soils such as paddy tan et al 2014 maize hou et al 2016 direct seeded rice fields li et al 2014 and wheat maize rotation fields he et al 2017 during model calibration inverse estimation of vg soil hydraulic parameters using field experimental for soil layers from 0 to 120 cm soil water content in 2015 to full use the measured soil hydraulic parameters and decrease the uncertainties of parameter optimization we selected saturated hydraulic conductivity k Œ∏ and saturation moisture content Œ∏ s for calibration simulated soil water content fit the measured values well for depths of 0 120 cm as shown in fig 8 for these cases the average value of r2 achieved 0 83 the rmse ranged from 0 003 to 0 012 cm 3 cm 3 with a mean of 0 007 cm 3 cm 3 and mae ranged from 0 002 0 011 cm 3 cm 3 with a mean of 0 006 cm 3 cm 3 table 6 maximum of rmse and mae of 0 024 cm 3 cm 3 were found in the 80 120 cm soil depths generally there were agreements between simulated and measured soil water contents for the two growing seasons similarly during the validation process optimized soil hydraulic parameters derived by the soil water content data for 2015 were used as input to predict the soil water content for 2016 high correlations were obtained between observed and simulated soil water content when calibrations for one crop were applied to the other crop on same site fig 9 rmse of soil water content ranged from 0 004 to 0 024 cm 3 cm 3 with a mean of 0 012 cm 3 cm 3 mae ranged from 0 007 0 013 cm 3 cm 3 with a mean of 0 009 cm 3 cm 3 table 6 furthermore as shown in figs 8 and 9 the measured soil water content was the highest for 60 cm and 80 cm soil depths this may be due to strong water holding capacity of the higher clay and silt contents in this layer which lead to low soil water content at 120 cm especially during the wheat growing season simulated data were not consistent with the measured data figs 8 and 9 this may be explained by soil water hysteresis effect especially in the deepest examined soil layer 80 120 cm however we concluded that based on the overall rmse and mae simulation results accurately described soil moisture changes before and after irrigation events moreover water balance of the soil profile was analyzed by means of simulation results including boundary flux evaporation and transpiration in short our study showed that hydrus 1d reliably simulated water transport under flood irrigation 3 3 evapotranspiration the seasonal actual values of evapotranspiration for the crops growing periods as simulated by the hydrus 1d are shown in fig 10 total et was 478 6 and 680 1 mm for wheat and maize respectively during the entire growing period the three main growth stages of jointing heading and filling accounted for 72 of the total et most of the e p in our study occurred during the early part of the season when crop cover was still relatively low t p occurred mainly in mid to late growth stages when lai reached the maximum values fig 10 however the value of e p for wheat was higher than that of maize during growth from 40 to 80 days low canopy density may have led to the higher e p for wheat e p was approximately zero for maize during the initial phase when the soil water content was likely to be extremely low in the absence of irrigation and rainfall in this period 3 4 deep percolation downward percolation represented the largest loss of water from the crop field deep percolation depended predominantly on the soil permeability coefficients of individual soil layers and on irrigation intensity fig 11 shows water flux deep percolation at 120 cm soil depth in crop fields total deep percolation was 403 9 and 696 6 mm for wheat and maize respectively over the growing season the negative value represented deep percolation because groundwater level ranged from 4 25 to 3 05 m and there was no capillary rise of groundwater fig 11 deep percolation closely corresponded with irrigation events during the entire growing season percolation rates were controlled mainly by irrigation relatively high deep percolation occurred mainly during the latter growth stages which are high water demanding the maximum percolation rate 1 89 cm day 1 occurred on 42 das during the 2015 wheat season during the 2016 season the maximum percolation rate 3 91 cm day 1 occurred at 96 das after continuous intensive irrigation as shown in fig 11 the differences in percolation rates between two seasons were mainly caused by different irrigation amount 3 5 water balance and crop productivity measured and simulated components of the water balance in the upper 120 cm of the soil profile are presented in table 7 total water input irrigation rainfall was 1306 6 and 1679 0 mm in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively simulated evapotranspiration accounted for 36 6 and 40 6 of water input respectively for 2015 and 2016 while simulated deep percolation reached 403 9 and 696 6 mm and accounted for approximately 32 25 and 42 9 of water input in the 2015 and 2016 seasons respectively the average crop yields were 3 78 mg ha 1 and 8 58 mg ha 1 in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively water productivity wp or water use efficiency is a measure that characterizes crop yield per unit of water used including irrigation water productivity w p i the ratio of crop yield to the amount of irrigation water and evapotranspiration water productivity w p e t the ratio of grain yield to crop et phogat et al 2010 the difference between w p i and w p e t values in 2016 seasons be attributed mostly to different amounts of irrigation the w p i in our study was only 0 31 kg m 3 in the 2015 season and lower than the average value 1 09 kg m 3 during the 2016 season w p i in our experiment was 1 74 kg m 3 but the w p e t close to the range of measured values 1 1 2 7 kg m 3 reported by zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 3 6 assessment of irrigation performance irrigation performance indicators are shown in table 8 in this study the rws values for wheat and maize were 1 indicating over supply of water the rws value for wheat was lower than that for maize table 8 further the ris values were also 1 indicating high supply of irrigation however the comparison of rws and ris indicated that the supply exceeded the requirements of wheat and maize on a seasonal basis moreover df and ocr values were 1 also indicating high irrigation rates and excess water supply for wheat and maize simulation results showed that 32 42 of irrigation water was lost as deep percolation to below the rooting zone therefore improvement in water application efficiency of field irrigation practices is essential to water conservation 3 7 improved irrigation scheduling improved irrigation schedules for different combinations of fixed irrigation intervals of 7 10 15 and 20 days were obtained using the cropwat model possible irrigation losses and associated yield losses for wheat and maize is presented in table 10 the balance of yield and irrigation amount should be taken into consideration when designing irrigation scheduling and if the focus is only on the reduction of water losses yield reduction may be high setegn et al 2011 because availability of water is limited in our study area water should be applied in such a way that the production is maximized tilahun et al 2002 thus for wheat an expected minimum irrigation water loss of 11 8 results in the maximum yield reduction of 28 5 under light soil conditions if yield is not to be reduced the loss of water ranges from 18 1 to 23 8 in two soil types by comparing the relationships between yield reduction and irrigation water loss at different irrigation times and different irrigation applications we established improved schedules for wheat simulation results suggest that application of a fixed irrigation depth and fixed irrigation interval combinations of 65 mm 15 day and 40 mm 10 day would work well for wheat in the study area table 11 improved irrigation schedules for maize are shown in table 10 for two soil textures therefore to improve available irrigation water and increase irrigation performance this irrigation planning would be feasible under the condition of small scale irrigation practices in the study area 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation water use and crop productivity the heihe river basin in northwestern china is an important food production area where irrigation uses about 83 of the total water resource available in the basin zhao et al 2010a due to increasing human population and changes in government policies toward production and marketing conventional flood irrigation practices are still widely used in most of this region additionally in most cases the amount of water applied to crops as irrigation depends on experience or the amount of water a farmer can capture thus the overuse of water for irrigation is very common the current local irrigation strategies aim at providing maximum water for maximum crop production and stabilize crop production huang et al 2006 however irrigation systems of the last several years are inefficient and the average w p i for wheat was 0 25 notably lower than the median value of 1 2 kg m 3 as reported zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 based on different irrigation regime zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 average w p i for maize was 0 74 kg m 3 which was far from that reported by djaman et al 2018 djaman et al 2018 under full irrigation djaman et al 2018 reported the greatest w p i of 2 36 kg m 3 obtained under limited irrigation moreover as shown in table 9 crop yield has not increased with increasing irrigation amounts rather crop yield exhibited a downward trend especially in maize one of the possible explanations was that large amounts of water were consumed but not utilized by the crops 4 2 evapotranspiration and deep percolation the midstream of the heihe river is a typical dessert oasis with high rates of water percolation and evaporation kang et al 2004 therefore accurate estimation of percolation and evapotranspiration plays an important role in decision making about water utilization and management as a main component in water balance evapotranspiration is of great importance for water conservation and irrigation measures zhao and zhao 2014b et simulated with hydrus 1d model was 478 6 mm in the 2015 growing seasons reflecting the range of measured values in this region for wheat 424 61 621 16 mm tong et al 2007 this was close to the 505 1 mm reported by ji et al 2007 but slightly higher than the value of 425 7 mm reported by li et al 2003 the simulated et for maize was 680 1 mm higher than the value of 572 5 mm reported by li et al 2003 but close to 699 mm reported by jiang et al 2015 the differences may be due to the differences in irrigation amount meteorological parameters and plant density in addition hydrus 1d can provide relatively reasonable et estimates in the field lian and huang 2015 a large amount of irrigation water however is depleted by evaporation below the root zone in conventionally flood irrigated fields chen et al 2005 and frequent irrigations leads to ponding and water loss by evaporation simulation results indicated that there was a high rate of deep percolation in flood irrigated fields in the two years of study simulated percolation was 403 9 and 696 6 mm higher than the 364 9 mm reported by ji et al 2007 and the 390 mm reported by li and shao 2014 the differences in percolation amounts were mainly caused by different irrigation amounts moreover previous research showed that the crop deep percolation corresponded to 10 40 of the total irrigation amount in the heihe river basin jiang et al 2015 percolation amounts in our experiments accounted for 25 5 and 42 9 of total irrigation in 2015 and 2016 respectively and were higher than the average value that can be attributed to low water holding capacity of sandy soil minimizing deep percolation will undoubtedly reduce water waste and will be vital to understanding the impact of flood irrigation scheduling on water balance at a field scale 4 3 improved irrigation scheduling reliability water shortage has become the main constraint to agricultural development in this region of china beyene et al 2017 improved irrigation scheduling with limited water will be critical for sustainable management of water resources reasonable water use at the farm level requires monitoring of soil moisture in the field to decide when to irrigate and how much as well as reduced water loss in a certain degree setegn et al 2011 to assess irrigation performance and water productivity in irrigated areas distributed hydrological models like swat arnold et al 1993 cropwat thimme gowda et al 2013 hydrus 1d awan et al 2012 stirzaker et al 2017 and swap model kroes and van dam 2003 have also been widely used at watershed and basin scales one of the most popular approaches is the use cropwat to decide on an irrigation regime compared with others models the advantage of cropwat model is that it synthetically considers crop coefficients drainage and the evolution of the soil water reserve at the maximal root depth used to estimate evapotranspiration kuo et al 2006 in addition an important attribute of the cropwat model is the flexibility of extending actual findings to conditions not tested in the field thimme gowda et al 2013 in addition when water is applied through surface irrigation methods like flood or border method it is not practically feasible to vary the irrigation depth and interval frequently brouwer et al 1989 therefore in our study considering the level of technical background of the farmers around heihe river basin method of fixed timing and amount of water to be applied were considered as the criteria based on our results we concur with previous authors that cropwat can be used as a tool to accurately simulate irrigation scheduling under flood irrigation in wheat maize rotation system in our study cropwat was selected for simulating of irrigation water requirements and proper irrigation scheduling in a wheat maize rotation field taking into account local water supply conditions fixed irrigation depth and interval combinations 40 mm 10 day and 50 mm 10 day were recommended for wheat and maize for light textured soil of the arid region this kind of irrigation scheduling minimizes losses of crop productivity while maintaining water loss below 20 those irrigation schedules correspond with the results of other studies feng et al 2007 for example proposed irrigating maize at fixed intervals of 14 days and at variable depths feng et al 2007 dechmi et al 2003 also found that an optimal irrigation schedule would involve increasing wheat seasonal irrigation depth by 350 mm and applying frequents irrigations events 10 times per season dechmi et al 2003 meanwhile some researchers suggested that an irrigation schedule with more frequent applications and lower amounts may be more suitable under flood irrigation in arid regions beyene et al 2018 ji et al 2007 li and shao 2014 zhao and zhao 2014a we concluded that cropwat was a reliable alternative to guide irrigation decision making however the analysis of the relationship between crop yield and irrigation scheduling in this study need a comprehensive investigation first fertilization option may lead to an overestimation of percent crop yield reduction second when a new irrigation schedule is recommended many additional factors need to be considered such as input for irrigation water water supply plan in irrigation area and the environmental impact of irrigation therefore the solutions proposed by cropwat will be strengthened with additional data 4 4 other considerations agricultural production in areas experiencing water scarcity must engage in highly efficient use of water resources and control environmental impacts of over irrigation bouman and tuong 2001 recorded data from the past decade in study area showed the amount of water extracted from the surface and groundwater for crop irrigation in particular in recent years intensive irrigation has led to increased exploitation of groundwater resources groundwater is being pumped at rates that exceed replenishment in many areas postel 2000 in general an aquifer can be recharged by water percolating from irrigation systems and from rivers in a basin chen 2007 found that a significant delay time and redistribution of infiltration can result when surface water is transferred to groundwater through the vadose zone chen 2007 as shown in fig 12 soil water content at the 0 160 cm depth in our study was sensitive to changes with irrigation events but below 180 cm soil water contents stayed relatively steady at 8 throughout the growing season that indicates that a change in groundwater due to percolation of irrigation water is not a simple response and recharge of groundwater through the vadose zone may be limited wang et al found that the heihe river is the main sources of water recharging the phreatic aquifer ping et al 2013 in addition under present irrigation practices more than 20 of irrigation water is consumed by deep percolation leading not only to a significant waste of valuable water resources but also of nutrients resources increasingly nitrate contamination has been detected in ground water in this region gu et al 2013 found that during the period 1980 2008 in china total reactive n leakage to groundwater increased about 1 5 times from 2 0 to 5 0 tg n year 1 and overuse of nitrogen n fertilizer in croplands has been identified as one of the main sources of groundwater nitrate gu et al 2013 kaushal et al 2011 in recent years important crops in the heihe river basin include wheat and maize with the average input of nitrogen fertilizer exceeding 350 kg ha 1 in maize su et al 2014 desert soil has been replaced with irrigated farmland and high crop yield in newly reclaimed farmlands in marginal oases rely mainly on a large amount of fertilizer input and high rate of irrigation by flooding su et al 2010 this has resulted in nitrate leaching to groundwater through deep percolation after irrigation events and increased the risks of nitrogen pollutant in the groundwater therefore understanding of deep percolation and limiting irrigation water are key to mitigating groundwater nitrate pollution 5 conclusions analysis of water supply and demand and determination of appropriate water irrigation strategies is critical to the reduction of the waste of water resources and to the improvement of water application efficiency of the small scale irrigation practices in this research we applied the hydrus 1d simulation model and combined it with the cropwat model to determine efficient irrigation strategies in a wheat maize system in the heihe river basin hydrus 1d simulation had a good fit to the observed soil water content measurements and the cropwat model application was successful in meeting our objectives however further studies can lead to further improvements in irrigation scheduling local fertilizer programs and field management practices model simulations showed that evapotranspiration and deep percolation are the dominant processes in the hydrological cycle in crop field the results also indicated reasonable estimates of daily actual crop evapotranspiration because it succeeds in account for the change in crop coefficient k c with growth stage and it neglected the influence of water stress coefficient k s under flood irrigation practices loss by deep percolation accounted for 32 3 and 42 9 of water from irrigation and rainfall respectively this may be related to excessive use of flood irrigation and weak water holding capacity of sandy soils in this region our results also showed that the existing efficiency of irrigation is low meanwhile crop production has not increased with increased irrigation and this is likely to accelerate evapotranspiration and deep percolation in addition deep percolation not only causes a waste of water but also leaching of nitrate n to groundwater resulting in a significant health hazard for rural populations using groundwater as a main source of water supply therefore measures need to be taken to reduce the loss of irrigation water a scenario for water conservation was simulated using the cropwat model and based on daily soil moisture balance in the crop root zone analysis showed that improved irrigation strategies need to integrate irrigation frequency and application depth an appropriate irrigation schedule for flood irrigation included more frequent applications and lower amounts such schedule can reduce deep percolation and save approximately 10 20 of irrigation water without significant effects on crop yield the result of this work can be extended to similar irrigation districts and other areas of the world sharing similar irrigation technology

11002,demand for irrigation water has been steadily increasing in arid regions where intensification of crop production is supported by flood irrigation an assessment of irrigation performance water productivity and irrigation schedules is critical to water conservation in dry climates in this study we conducted a field experiment to compare soil water balance in a flood irrigated wheat maize rotation system during the growing season of 2015 2016 we then modeled the soil water balance and improved irrigation strategies by coupling hydrus 1d with the cropwat model and using evapotranspiration calculated from climatic data the calibrated hydrus 1d model was used to simulate the temporal and spatial variation of evapotranspiration and deep percolation based on measured soil water distribution of soil profiles in the unsaturated zone results showed that using soil hydraulic parameters from inversion modeling can simulate soil water flow in multi layer soil during a crop growing season simulation results indicated that about 36 6 and 40 6 478 6 and 680 1 mm of total water input in 2015 and 2016 respectively was consumed by evapotranspiration furthermore simulated deep percolation amounted for approximately 32 3 and 42 9 403 9 and 696 6 mm of the total amount of irrigation water in 2015 and 2016 respectively these results indicated that only a small proportion of irrigation water was used by crops for transpiration in addition irrigation performance indicators such as relative water supply relative irrigation supply depleted fraction and overall consumed ratio values indicated poor performance of irrigation practices in the study area particularly crop yields did not increase with increases in irrigation water in flood irrigated fields during the last ten years results of the cropwat model indicated that combinations of a fixed irrigation depth and timing of 40 mm every 10 days and 50 mm every 10 days were reasonable for wheat and maize respectively given the sandy soil in the study area the improved irrigation strategies will limit water irrigation loss to 20 without significant effects on crop yields this study provides an alternative approach for estimating deep percolation and crop water requirements supporting management efforts in water conservation in dry climates keywords soil water dynamic deep percolation irrigation schedules hydrus 1d model cropwat model 1 introduction water shortage is gradually developing into one of the most pressing crises in many parts of the world alcamo et al 2017 gleeson et al 2012 water is becoming increasingly scarce and expensive due to demands from the ever growing human population industry and agriculture roost et al 2008 during the last twenty years in particular water scarcity has affected the development of irrigated agriculture in arid and semi arid regions where agriculture consumes more than 90 of total water available wawer et al 2014 whittlesey et al 2003 conflicts arising from the needs for water for irrigation and the environment have become a novel challenge zhou et al 2013 making future water management even more difficult than currently lemke et al 2007 northwestern china is one of the most intensively irrigated and highly productive areas in the world inefficient irrigation systems and lack of knowledge to optimize irrigation schedules have resulted in over exploitation of ground and surface water to meet irrigation needs zhu et al 2013 after fertilizer water is one of the most important inputs in high yield grain production jalota and arora 2002 li et al 2004 traditional flood irrigation is the predominant irrigation method in northwestern china but it requires more water than other irrigation types sharmasarkar et al 2001 the heihe river basin in northwestern china is one of the most important agricultural area in the country irrigated agriculture is the primary consumer of water in this region ground and river water are the main source of agricultural water supply contributing approximately 84 to the total agricultural water use gao et al 2004 in recent decades the extraction of groundwater has greatly increased to accommodate increasing food demand economic pressure and surface water deficits wei et al 2010 zhao et al 2010c in turn the excessive extraction of groundwater has led to the drying up of many inland rivers ji et al 2006 2005 zhu et al 2013 indeed it was presumed that over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation purposes was partly responsible for the decrease in ground water levels in this region zhu et al 2013 maize and wheat are the main irrigated crop in the heihe river basin area and both crops have high irrigation requirements stone et al 2001 water supply is largely dependent on irrigation because average annual precipitation is very low but evapotranspiration is very high in this area average daily evapotranspiration in maize exceeded 10 mm d at milking stage howell et al 1997 while that in wheat reached 8 5 mm d in mid season wang et al 2010c about 43 of flood irrigation in a maize field was consumed by deep percolation ji et al 2007 consequently one of the simplest ways to maintain high and stable yields is to increase irrigation amount however water resources are scarce in the heihe river basin and high efficiency irrigation strategies must be adopted to quantify the flood irrigated water partitioning during the crop growing season in order to mitigate water stresses and to support agricultural water management at present much attention has been given to irrigation water losses that lower water use efficiency and cause deep percolation field studies have focused on the soil water balance under different field conditions kovac et al 2005 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 wang et al 2016 zhao and zhao 2014a evapotranspiration under different irrigations methods lian et al 2014 lv et al 2010 tong et al 2007 wang et al 2010b zhao and zhao 2014b zhao et al 2010b and irrigation scheduling he et al 2017 shang et al 2004 simulation efforts determined deep percolation under flood irrigation du and shao 2014 li and shao 2014 these studies concentrated on the relationship between irrigation amount and deep percolation or evapotranspiration the effects of different irrigation regimes on crop productivity and effects of different tillage methods on soil water balance however we know little about high efficiency irrigation strategies in flood irrigated fields and detailed irrigation plans have yet to be proposed zhao and zhao 2014a in addition field studies are time consuming and laborious while regional hydrological processes complex due to spatial variability of soils crops weather groundwater and irrigation and management practices jiang et al 2015 a more expedient alternative to identifying efficient irrigation strategies involves modeling of the effects of irrigation strategies on soil water balance and crop productivity xi et al 2016 challenges to modeling approaches involve obtaining data on agrometeorological conditions soil physical properties root distribution and crop growth dynamics farming practices and water regimes in specific crop fields tan et al 2014 to develop a sensible irrigation plan for flood irrigation conditions using computer simulation soil water dynamics in the crop rooting zone needs to be quantified first the hydrus 1d model is a well known mechanistic model that predicts variability of saturated one dimensional soil water movement and root water uptake simunek et al 2008 ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2006 so far the hydrus 1d model has been used to simulate water movement in maize fields hou et al 2016 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 spring wheat and rotation cropping systems liu et al 2013 to our knowledge the model was seldom used to simulate evapotranspiration or deep percolation in maize or in wheat maize rotation fields the hydrus 1d model simulates one dimensional water movement in multi layered variably saturated soil it was applied to predict actual evapotranspiration and deep percolation in combination with reference crop evapotranspiration e t 0 crop stress coefficient k c was used to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration penman monteith equation recommended by fao in 1998 was used to calculate e t 0 bormann et al 1999 goyal 2004 kite and droogers 2000 and richards equation model was used to predict deep percolation jim√©nez mart√≠nez et al 2009 selle et al 2011 simulation of deep percolation or evapotranspiration derived from the hydrus 1d model combined with irrigation performance indicators such as relative water supply relative irrigation supply depleted fraction and overall consumed ratio values will allow irrigation performance assessment one of the key elements in improving irrigation management merriam et al 1980 then assessment results can be applied to generate irrigation schedules for different crop and seasons an irrigation schedule should involve crop monitoring soil monitoring and a water balance technique cropwat a software package developed by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao uses soil water budgeting in the root zone in which actual evapotranspiration calculation also estimated by e t 0 with k c and water stress coefficient k s and the penman monteith equation recommended by fao in 1998 was used to calculate e t 0 it showed higher accuracy and wider suitability in application therefore the cropwat model was used to recognize crop water deficits in irrigated fields smith 1992 to estimate the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration in spring maize feng et al 2007 and to design irrigation schedules setegn et al 2011 because it requires minimal climatic information soil properties and crop information cropwat is widely used for developing irrigation schedules ali et al 2011 currently farmers have little incentive to save water moreover not all of farmers realize that water is a finite resource wang et al 2010a especially in arid regions where flood irrigation prevails water waste during agricultural irrigation is still extremely high some of the immediate needs in water management include efficient use of limited soil water for flood irrigation understanding the relationship between evapotranspiration and deep percolation under different irrigation patterns and analysis of effects of field soil water budgeting and different irrigation schedules on farming practices the objectives of this study were to a evaluate the accuracy of hydrus 1d model in simulating soil water dynamics in a wheat maize rotation system in flood irrigated conditions using field data b predict soil evapotranspiration and deep percolation during a growing season with hydrus 1d model and c evaluate the performance of current irrigation practices and improve irrigation scheduling with the cropwat model 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experimental description 2 1 1 study area a field experiment was conducted in

experimental station in a field where wheat maize rotation system has been maintained for almost ten years spring wheat summer crop rotation is the most common rotation type in this region therefore a spring wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l rotation system was chosen for this study during the growing season of 2015 2016 fig 2 the wheat and maize cultivars used were long chun 30 and

the wheat and maize roots in the field were generally distributed within a depth of 0 80 cm and 0 100 cm with the maximum root depth to 80 and 100 cm respectively therefore we assumed linearly decreasing root distribution function and a root depth of 80 cm and 100 cm along the profile the parameters in wesseling were selected for the root water uptake of wheat and maize wesseling 1991 2 2 4

table 3 2 4 3 soil water flux rainfall and irrigation events were measured during the growing period directly in the field the relevant data are shown as follows table 4 2 5 initial and boundary conditions in this modeling effort initial conditions were defined based on the measured soil water content and turned the soil water content into soil matric potential with the vg model since the soil surface is subjected to the atmospheric boundary condition the atmospheric boundary condition was specified for the top of soil surface in the water movement for hydrus 1d model where the parameters are the measured and calculated values as described above free drainage was considered at the low boundary when water table was absent fig 5 the soil profile was considered to be 120 cm in depth a spatial discretization of 1 cm was used leading to 121 nodes across the whole profile and no hysteresis in water retention was considered the soil matric potential was interpolated at various

the closer were the simulation results to actual values 2 7 soil water balance water balances in the field during the crop growing season were estimated based on the following equation 19 Œ¥ s w s i r e t a s where sws was the change in soil water storage between crop planting and harvesting mm determining water consumption of the crop during growth r and i were the amounts of rainfall and irrigation mm respectively and s was deep percolation amount mm e t a at field level was the evapotranspiration mm which was estimated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration derived from the penman monteith equation by the maize coefficient allen et al 1998 and based on meteorological data 2 8 performance of irrigation practices in the field in this study the irrigation system was assessed using common irrigation performance indicators such as relative water supply rws relative irrigation supply ris depleted fraction df and overall consumed ratio ocr mathematically these were represented as 20 r w s i p e t a s 21 r i s i e t a s p e f f 22 d f e t a i p 23 o c r e t a p e f f i where p was rainfall i was irrigation e t a was crop evapotranspiration and s was deep percolation and p e f f was effective rainfall a ris value of 1 indicated efficient irrigation whereas values 1 indicated potential for crop stress if the supply was sufficient the ocr value was around 1 if it was 1 it indicated under irrigation and a value 1 indicated over irrigation 2 9 numerical modeling with cropwat cropwat http www fao org nr water infores databases cropwat html version 8 0 is a software package developed by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao smith 1992 which is being used to design an irrigation schedule or recognize water deficits in irrigated or rainfed conditions 2 9 1 irrigation efficiency irrigation application rates were estimated through field investigation and irrigation application rates were about 70 percent in this region in the past years 2 9 2 crop evapotranspiration in the cropwat model in combination with multiplying reference crop evapotranspiration e t 0 k c and k s was used to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration and the penman monteith equation recommended by fao in 1998 has been used to calculate e t 0 all climatic data for the growing period were obtained from the meteorological station as described for the hydrus 1d model 24 e t a e t 0 k c k s where k s was the water stress coefficient in our study k smax 1 with no water stress conditions under flood irrigation respective k c values for the three crop stages are found in table 5 2 9 3 crop data in this module crop data included crop coefficient stage of crop growth period root depth soil moisture depletion percentage yield response factor and

method adopted by the usda soil conservation service in conjunction with the cropwat software for calculating effective precipitation franchek and biggam 1992 the equation was as shown 26 p e p m 125

scale requires monitoring and measuring of soil water content to decide when to irrigate and how much irrigation accordingly irrigation schedules were developed using cropwat model for both light and medium soil conditions for some of the major irrigated crops namely wheat and maize therefore optimal irrigation schedules correspond to the combination of an irrigation interval and depth that result in both low water losses and a reasonable yield reduction this model is water driven with a core idea of modeling yield and water use efficiency for crop response functions the following equation was used to compute crop yield reduction 27 1 y a y max k y 1 e t a e t max where y a was the actual crop yield kg ha 1 y max was the maximum yield kg ha 1 k y was yield response factor e t max was maximum crop evapotranspiration in addition a fixed timing and depth of application option would ensure an optimized utilization of water resource and improve application efficiency 3 results 3 1 crop root distribution and uptake vertical root length density rld for wheat and maize at 0 100 cm depths is shown in fig 6 in this study rld gradually decreased with soil depth and about 80 of root length density for wheat was found between 0 and 30 cm of the soil profile with almost no rooting below 100 cm about 95 of maize roots was distributed in soil layers between 0 60 cm and only a small proportion reached to 100 cm similar results were reported in other studies and root density decreased exponentially with soil depth barron et al 2003 hou et al 2016 the hydrus 1d model can describe root water uptake in wheat very well specifically their simulations showed that hydrus 1d can be used for improving the efficiency of water use in flood irrigated mature wheat lv et al 2010 we showed in this study that root water uptake in wheat started during the early stages of seed germination fig 7 with growth the rate of water uptake by wheat roots increased gradually and peaked between 40 and 60 das because this period was the jointing and heading stage water demand increased while corresponding high values of lai further accelerated root water uptake the maximum rate of water uptake by wheat roots was 0 86 cm day 1 at approximately 50 das cumulative root water uptake during the wheat growing period was approximately 14 5 cm these observations were consistent with the results obtained by others tafteh et al 2017 root water uptake in maize was low in early growth stages and reached its peak about 60 das during the jointing and tasseling stages the maximum rate of water uptake was 0 82 cm day 1 at approximately 60 das cumulative root water uptake during the maize growing period was approximately 21 9 cm fig 7 which was consistent with previous results klement et al 2016 3 2 calibration and validation of the hydrus 1d model many previous studies have shown that model hydrus 1d is a reliable tool for describing soil water movement in different types of unsaturated soils such as paddy tan et al 2014 maize hou et al 2016 direct seeded rice fields li et al 2014 and wheat maize rotation fields he et al 2017 during model calibration inverse estimation of vg soil hydraulic parameters using field experimental for soil layers from 0 to 120 cm soil water content in 2015 to full use the measured soil hydraulic parameters and decrease the uncertainties of parameter optimization we selected saturated hydraulic conductivity k Œ∏ and saturation moisture content Œ∏ s for calibration simulated soil water content fit the measured values well for depths of 0 120 cm as shown in fig 8 for these cases the average value of r2 achieved 0 83 the rmse ranged from 0 003 to 0 012 cm 3 cm 3 with a mean of 0 007 cm 3 cm 3 and mae ranged from 0 002 0 011 cm 3 cm 3 with a mean of 0 006 cm 3 cm 3 table 6 maximum of rmse and mae of 0 024 cm 3 cm 3 were found in the 80 120 cm soil depths generally there were agreements between simulated and measured soil water contents for the two growing seasons similarly during the validation process optimized soil hydraulic parameters derived by the soil water content data for 2015 were used as input to predict the soil water content for 2016 high correlations were obtained between observed and simulated soil water content when calibrations for one crop were applied to the other crop on same site fig 9 rmse of soil water content ranged from 0 004 to 0 024 cm 3 cm 3 with a mean of 0 012 cm 3 cm 3 mae ranged from 0 007 0 013 cm 3 cm 3 with a mean of 0 009 cm 3 cm 3 table 6 furthermore as shown in figs 8 and 9 the measured soil water content was the highest for 60 cm and 80 cm soil depths this may be due to strong water holding capacity of the higher clay and silt contents in this layer which lead to low soil water content at 120 cm especially during the wheat growing season simulated data were not consistent with the measured data figs 8 and 9 this may be explained by soil water hysteresis effect especially in the deepest examined soil layer 80 120 cm however we concluded that based on the overall rmse and mae simulation results accurately described soil moisture changes before and after irrigation events moreover water balance of the soil profile was analyzed by means of simulation results including boundary flux evaporation and transpiration in short our study showed that hydrus 1d reliably simulated water transport under flood irrigation 3 3 evapotranspiration the seasonal actual values of evapotranspiration for the crops growing periods as simulated by the hydrus 1d are shown in fig 10 total et was 478 6 and 680 1 mm for wheat and maize respectively during the entire growing period the three main growth stages of jointing heading and filling accounted for 72 of the total et most of the e p in our study occurred during the early part of the season when crop cover was still relatively low t p occurred mainly in mid to late growth stages when lai reached the maximum values fig 10 however the value of e p for wheat was higher than that of maize during growth from 40 to 80 days low canopy density may have led to the higher e p for wheat e p was approximately zero for maize during the initial phase when the soil water content was likely to be extremely low in the absence of irrigation and rainfall in this period 3 4 deep percolation downward percolation represented the largest loss of water from the crop field deep percolation depended predominantly on the soil permeability coefficients of individual soil layers and on irrigation intensity fig 11 shows water flux deep percolation at 120 cm soil depth in crop fields total deep percolation was 403 9 and 696 6 mm for wheat and maize respectively over the growing season the negative value represented deep percolation because groundwater level ranged from 4 25 to 3 05 m and there was no capillary rise of groundwater fig 11 deep percolation closely corresponded with irrigation events during the entire growing season percolation rates were controlled mainly by irrigation relatively high deep percolation occurred mainly during the latter growth stages which are high water demanding the maximum percolation rate 1 89 cm day 1 occurred on 42 das during the 2015 wheat season during the 2016 season the maximum percolation rate 3 91 cm day 1 occurred at 96 das after continuous intensive irrigation as shown in fig 11 the differences in percolation rates between two seasons were mainly caused by different irrigation amount 3 5 water balance and crop productivity measured and simulated components of the water balance in the upper 120 cm of the soil profile are presented in table 7 total water input irrigation rainfall was 1306 6 and 1679 0 mm in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively simulated evapotranspiration accounted for 36 6 and 40 6 of water input respectively for 2015 and 2016 while simulated deep percolation reached 403 9 and 696 6 mm and accounted for approximately 32 25 and 42 9 of water input in the 2015 and 2016 seasons respectively the average crop yields were 3 78 mg ha 1 and 8 58 mg ha 1 in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively water productivity wp or water use efficiency is a measure that characterizes crop yield per unit of water used including irrigation water productivity w p i the ratio of crop yield to the amount of irrigation water and evapotranspiration water productivity w p e t the ratio of grain yield to crop et phogat et al 2010 the difference between w p i and w p e t values in 2016 seasons be attributed mostly to different amounts of irrigation the w p i in our study was only 0 31 kg m 3 in the 2015 season and lower than the average value 1 09 kg m 3 during the 2016 season w p i in our experiment was 1 74 kg m 3 but the w p e t close to the range of measured values 1 1 2 7 kg m 3 reported by zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 3 6 assessment of irrigation performance irrigation performance indicators are shown in table 8 in this study the rws values for wheat and maize were 1 indicating over supply of water the rws value for wheat was lower than that for maize table 8 further the ris values were also 1 indicating high supply of irrigation however the comparison of rws and ris indicated that the supply exceeded the requirements of wheat and maize on a seasonal basis moreover df and ocr values were 1 also indicating high irrigation rates and excess water supply for wheat and maize simulation results showed that 32 42 of irrigation water was lost as deep percolation to below the rooting zone therefore improvement in water application efficiency of field irrigation practices is essential to water conservation 3 7 improved irrigation scheduling improved irrigation schedules for different combinations of fixed irrigation intervals of 7 10 15 and 20 days were obtained using the cropwat model possible irrigation losses and associated yield losses for wheat and maize is presented in table 10 the balance of yield and irrigation amount should be taken into consideration when designing irrigation scheduling and if the focus is only on the reduction of water losses yield reduction may be high setegn et al 2011 because availability of water is limited in our study area water should be applied in such a way that the production is maximized tilahun et al 2002 thus for wheat an expected minimum irrigation water loss of 11 8 results in the maximum yield reduction of 28 5 under light soil conditions if yield is not to be reduced the loss of water ranges from 18 1 to 23 8 in two soil types by comparing the relationships between yield reduction and irrigation water loss at different irrigation times and different irrigation applications we established improved schedules for wheat simulation results suggest that application of a fixed irrigation depth and fixed irrigation interval combinations of 65 mm 15 day and 40 mm 10 day would work well for wheat in the study area table 11 improved irrigation schedules for maize are shown in table 10 for two soil textures therefore to improve available irrigation water and increase irrigation performance this irrigation planning would be feasible under the condition of small scale irrigation practices in the study area 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation water use and crop productivity the heihe river basin in northwestern china is an important food production area where irrigation uses about 83 of the total water resource available in the basin zhao et al 2010a due to increasing human population and changes in government policies toward production and marketing conventional flood irrigation practices are still widely used in most of this region additionally in most cases the amount of water applied to crops as irrigation depends on experience or the amount of water a farmer can capture thus the overuse of water for irrigation is very common the current local irrigation strategies aim at providing maximum water for maximum crop production and stabilize crop production huang et al 2006 however irrigation systems of the last several years are inefficient and the average w p i for wheat was 0 25 notably lower than the median value of 1 2 kg m 3 as reported zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 based on different irrigation regime zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 average w p i for maize was 0 74 kg m 3 which was far from that reported by djaman et al 2018 djaman et al 2018 under full irrigation djaman et al 2018 reported the greatest w p i of 2 36 kg m 3 obtained under limited irrigation moreover as shown in table 9 crop yield has not increased with increasing irrigation amounts rather crop yield exhibited a downward trend especially in maize one of the possible explanations was that large amounts of water were consumed but not utilized by the crops 4 2 evapotranspiration and deep percolation the midstream of the heihe river is a typical dessert oasis with high rates of water percolation and evaporation kang et al 2004 therefore accurate estimation of percolation and evapotranspiration plays an important role in decision making about water utilization and management as a main component in water balance evapotranspiration is of great importance for water conservation and irrigation measures zhao and zhao 2014b et simulated with hydrus 1d model was 478 6 mm in the 2015 growing seasons reflecting the range of measured values in this region for wheat 424 61 621 16 mm tong et al 2007 this was close to the 505 1 mm reported by ji et al 2007 but slightly higher than the value of 425 7 mm reported by li et al 2003 the simulated et for maize was 680 1 mm higher than the value of 572 5 mm reported by li et al 2003 but close to 699 mm reported by jiang et al 2015 the differences may be due to the differences in irrigation amount meteorological parameters and plant density in addition hydrus 1d can provide relatively reasonable et estimates in the field lian and huang 2015 a large amount of irrigation water however is depleted by evaporation below the root zone in conventionally flood irrigated fields chen et al 2005 and frequent irrigations leads to ponding and water loss by evaporation simulation results indicated that there was a high rate of deep percolation in flood irrigated fields in the two years of study simulated percolation was 403 9 and 696 6 mm higher than the 364 9 mm reported by ji et al 2007 and the 390 mm reported by li and shao 2014 the differences in percolation amounts were mainly caused by different irrigation amounts moreover previous research showed that the crop deep percolation corresponded to 10 40 of the total irrigation amount in the heihe river basin jiang et al 2015 percolation amounts in our experiments accounted for 25 5 and 42 9 of total irrigation in 2015 and 2016 respectively and were higher than the average value that can be attributed to low water holding capacity of sandy soil minimizing deep percolation will undoubtedly reduce water waste and will be vital to understanding the impact of flood irrigation scheduling on water balance at a field scale 4 3 improved irrigation scheduling reliability water shortage has become the main constraint to agricultural development in this region of china beyene et al 2017 improved irrigation scheduling with limited water will be critical for sustainable management of water resources reasonable water use at the farm level requires monitoring of soil moisture in the field to decide when to irrigate and how much as well as reduced water loss in a certain degree setegn et al 2011 to assess irrigation performance and water productivity in irrigated areas distributed hydrological models like swat arnold et al 1993 cropwat thimme gowda et al 2013 hydrus 1d awan et al 2012 stirzaker et al 2017 and swap model kroes and van dam 2003 have also been widely used at watershed and basin scales one of the most popular approaches is the use cropwat to decide on an irrigation regime compared with others models the advantage of cropwat model is that it synthetically considers crop coefficients drainage and the evolution of the soil water reserve at the maximal root depth used to estimate evapotranspiration kuo et al 2006 in addition an important attribute of the cropwat model is the flexibility of extending actual findings to conditions not tested in the field thimme gowda et al 2013 in addition when water is applied through surface irrigation methods like flood or border method it is not practically feasible to vary the irrigation depth and interval frequently brouwer et al 1989 therefore in our study considering the level of technical background of the farmers around heihe river basin method of fixed timing and amount of water to be applied were considered as the criteria based on our results we concur with previous authors that cropwat can be used as a tool to accurately simulate irrigation scheduling under flood irrigation in wheat maize rotation system in our study cropwat was selected for simulating of irrigation water requirements and proper irrigation scheduling in a wheat maize rotation field taking into account local water supply conditions fixed irrigation depth and interval combinations 40 mm 10 day and 50 mm 10 day were recommended for wheat and maize for light textured soil of the arid region this kind of irrigation scheduling minimizes losses of crop productivity while maintaining water loss below 20 those irrigation schedules correspond with the results of other studies feng et al 2007 for example proposed irrigating maize at fixed intervals of 14 days and at variable depths feng et al 2007 dechmi et al 2003 also found that an optimal irrigation schedule would involve increasing wheat seasonal irrigation depth by 350 mm and applying frequents irrigations events 10 times per season dechmi et al 2003 meanwhile some researchers suggested that an irrigation schedule with more frequent applications and lower amounts may be more suitable under flood irrigation in arid regions beyene et al 2018 ji et al 2007 li and shao 2014 zhao and zhao 2014a we concluded that cropwat was a reliable alternative to guide irrigation decision making however the analysis of the relationship between crop yield and irrigation scheduling in this study need a comprehensive investigation first fertilization option may lead to an overestimation of percent crop yield reduction second when a new irrigation schedule is recommended many additional factors need to be considered such as input for irrigation water water supply plan in irrigation area and the environmental impact of irrigation therefore the solutions proposed by cropwat will be strengthened with additional data 4 4 other considerations agricultural production in areas experiencing water scarcity must engage in highly efficient use of water resources and control environmental impacts of over irrigation bouman and tuong 2001 recorded data from the past decade in study area showed the amount of water extracted from the surface and groundwater for crop irrigation in particular in recent years intensive irrigation has led to increased exploitation of groundwater resources groundwater is being pumped at rates that exceed replenishment in many areas postel 2000 in general an aquifer can be recharged by water percolating from irrigation systems and from rivers in a basin chen 2007 found that a significant delay time and redistribution of infiltration can result when surface water is transferred to groundwater through the vadose zone chen 2007 as shown in fig 12 soil water content at the 0 160 cm depth in our study was sensitive to changes with irrigation events but below 180 cm soil water contents stayed relatively steady at 8 throughout the growing season that indicates that a change in groundwater due to percolation of irrigation water is not a simple response and recharge of groundwater through the vadose zone may be limited wang et al found that the heihe river is the main sources of water recharging the phreatic aquifer ping et al 2013 in addition under present irrigation practices more than 20 of irrigation water is consumed by deep percolation leading not only to a significant waste of valuable water resources but also of nutrients resources increasingly nitrate contamination has been detected in ground water in this region gu et al 2013 found that during the period 1980 2008 in china total reactive n leakage to groundwater increased about 1 5 times from 2 0 to 5 0 tg n year 1 and overuse of nitrogen n fertilizer in croplands has been identified as one of the main sources of groundwater nitrate gu et al 2013 kaushal et al 2011 in recent years important crops in the heihe river basin include wheat and maize with the average input of nitrogen fertilizer exceeding 350 kg ha 1 in maize su et al 2014 desert soil has been replaced with irrigated farmland and high crop yield in newly reclaimed farmlands in marginal oases rely mainly on a large amount of fertilizer input and high rate of irrigation by flooding su et al 2010 this has resulted in nitrate leaching to groundwater through deep percolation after irrigation events and increased the risks of nitrogen pollutant in the groundwater therefore understanding of deep percolation and limiting irrigation water are key to mitigating groundwater nitrate pollution 5 conclusions analysis of water supply and demand and determination of appropriate water irrigation strategies is critical to the reduction of the waste of water resources and to the improvement of water application efficiency of the small scale irrigation practices in this research we applied the hydrus 1d simulation model and combined it with the cropwat model to determine efficient irrigation strategies in a wheat maize system in the heihe river basin hydrus 1d simulation had a good fit to the observed soil water content measurements and the cropwat model application was successful in meeting our objectives however further studies can lead to further improvements in irrigation scheduling local fertilizer programs and field management practices model simulations showed that evapotranspiration and deep percolation are the dominant processes in the hydrological cycle in crop field the results also indicated reasonable estimates of daily actual crop evapotranspiration because it succeeds in account for the change in crop coefficient k c with growth stage and it neglected the influence of water stress coefficient k s under flood irrigation practices loss by deep percolation accounted for 32 3 and 42 9 of water from irrigation and rainfall respectively this may be related to excessive use of flood irrigation and weak water holding capacity of sandy soils in this region our results also showed that the existing efficiency of irrigation is low meanwhile crop production has not increased with increased irrigation and this is likely to accelerate evapotranspiration and deep percolation in addition deep percolation not only causes a waste of water but also leaching of nitrate n to groundwater resulting in a significant health hazard for rural populations using groundwater as a main source of water supply therefore measures need to be taken to reduce the loss of irrigation water a scenario for water conservation was simulated using the cropwat model and based on daily soil moisture balance in the crop root zone analysis showed that improved irrigation strategies need to integrate irrigation frequency and application depth an appropriate irrigation schedule for flood irrigation included more frequent applications and lower amounts such schedule can reduce deep percolation and save approximately 10 20 of irrigation water without significant effects on crop yield the result of this work can be extended to similar irrigation districts and other areas of the world sharing similar irrigation technology

11003,wastewater from the olive oil industry is often spread on soils but this practice requires caution because of the possible harmful hydrological and physico chemical effects on soils treated while research has mainly focussed on the long term changes in soil properties very few studies refer to short term effects which appear a few weeks or months after olive mill wastewater omw application mediterranean areas are particularly prone to runoff and soil erosion risks and the evaluation of the short term effects of omw on hydraulic conductivity and other physico chemical properties of soils in this area are scarce to fill this gap this study has evaluated the effects of omw spreading on the hydrology of a loamy soil at one and three weeks after application more specifically irrigation tests with omw were carried out in olive field plots in calabria southern italy the infiltrability and physico chemical properties of treated soils were compared with unirrigated soils and soils irrigated with clean water such as groundwater a temporary reduction in the soil infiltration rate was detected immediately after omw irrigation although it was followed by a significant increase after three weeks in the topsoil irrigation with omw produced an increase in phosphorous potassium and organic matter contents as well as a higher stability of aggregates in the deeper layer of soil treated with omw the contents of organic matter and nutrients as well as of polyphenols were lower than in the unirrigated plot potassium calcium and sodium contents were higher in the soil irrigated with omw both in topsoil and deeper layers principal component analysis highlighted a noticeable influence of treatments on soil micronutrient contents cation exchange capacity and the stability of aggregates with slight differences between topsoil and deeper soil layers conversely the concentration of organic matter polyphenols and nutrients is noticeably stratified in both the topsoil and the deeper layers regardless the type of treatment keywords infiltration rate organic matter soil physico chemical changes wastewater irrigation soil aggregate stability runoff and erosion risk 1 introduction the extraction process of olive oil requires the addition of a high volume of water a large share of which becomes waste aktas et al 2001 mechri et al 2007 sellami et al 2008 this oil mill effluent known as olive mill wastewater omw contains the water added during the process the water and pulp contents of olives and a stable emulsion of oil residues paredes et al 2002 brunetti et al 2007 generally omw shows high concentrations of organic matter suspended solids and inhibiting compounds such as polyphenols the content in mineral elements such as potassium phosphorus and calcium is lower amaral et al 2008 di serio et al 2008 because of these peculiar characteristics uncontrolled disposal of omw poses serious environmental risks to water soil and air such as the pollution of surface and ground water bodies degradation of soil properties and foul smelling emissions dermeche et al 2013 chaari et al 2015 the most dangerous omw properties are the acidic ph and the high contents of both organic matter and phenols dermeche et al 2013 chaari et al 2015 aggoun et al 2016 to reduce the environmental drawbacks linked to omw disposal several physico chemical e g evaporation reverse osmosis filtration oxidation thermal drying or biological e g aerobic and anaerobic treatments composting phyto depuration methods have been proposed for omw treatment dourou et al 2016 however until now their economic and technological application is in most cases limited chartzoulakis et al 2010 in contrast to the usual omw treatments several studies have suggested the controlled application of omw to cultivated soil according to these studies omw can be used as a cheap soil conditioner and or fertilizer saadi et al 2007 caputo et al 2013 ayoub et al 2014 barbera et al 2014 and represents an additional water and nutrient resource for fertilisation irrigation of mediterranean olive groves affected by a chronic water and organic matter scarcity di bene et al 2013 ayoub et al 2014 chaari et al 2015 in this practice called omw land treatment and utilisation omw is applied to bare or cultivated soil cabrera et al 1996 sierra et al 2001 kapellakis et al 2008 mechri et al 2008 however omw land treatment must be practised with caution since omw application may induce serious environmental damage due to its toxicity towards plants and bacteria living in soils moreno et al 1987 mekki et al 2006 barbera et al 2014 moreover the agronomic use of omw is limited by other constraints such as oil and grease amaral et al 2008 ouzounidou et al 2008 suspended solids paredes et al 1987 roig et al 2006 chaari et al 2015 as well as high salinity and acidity barbera et al 2014 cavallaro et al 2014 therefore the impacts of omw application on crops and on the chemical physical and biological properties of soils must be further studied and tested in field since little is known about these effects aggelis et al 2003 mekki et al 2008 2009 a comprehensive review was carried out by mekki et al 2006 and more recently barbera et al 2013 in general due to the variability of omw application rates and properties of receiving soils literature data on omw effects on soil properties is not unanimous and in many cases even contradictory chartzoulakis et al 2010 in addition most of the studies reported in the scientific literature have mainly evaluated the long term effects on soil properties that is on a yearly or decade scale with contrasting results greco et al 2006 l√≥pez et al 1996 piotrowska et al 2006 2011 compared to studies on the long term effects those on the short term effects are far fewer e g levi minzi et al 1992 sierra et al 2007 di serio et al 2008 di bene et al 2013 piotrowska et al 2011 the evaluation of the effects of omw on the chemical physical and biological soil properties performed some weeks or months after omw application on soil are equally important since many adverse effects may be present only in this period for instance sierra et al 2007 detected increases in soil salinity and in content of phenolic compounds four months after omw application a decrease in soil ph and polyphenol pp content were claimed by di serio et al 2008 in 2 month field experiments di bene et al 2013 and caruso et al 2018 suggested strict control of omw use as an organic conditioner given the negative effects on soil properties such as the increase in pp and electrical conductivity and decrease in fungal communities five days after omw application these early adverse effects become more negligible as time passes as a general response to omw application piotrowska et al 2011 observed sudden changes in some biological properties of the soil immediately after application and in the following 14 days by contrast no differences in cod chemical oxygen demand phenol content and electrical conductivity of soils were detected three months after omw application by levi minzi et al 1992 compared to untreated soils furthermore few studies have focused on the short term hydrological effects of omw application thus the time evolution of infiltrability on soils treated with omw is also not completely understood and literature data about the effects of omw on water infiltration and hydraulic conductivity of soil are contrasting barbera et al 2013 much caution should be paid to the possible changes in the hydrological properties of receiving soils such as infiltration rates in mediterranean areas particularly prone to runoff and soil erosion risks zema et al 2014 fortugno et al 2017 lucas borja et al 2018 zema et al 2018 omw should not be applied to soils during the wet period a decrease in soil infiltrability after omw land treatment may worsen the hydrological response to intense storms on the steep olive groves of some mediterranean areas e g southern italy tamburino et al 1999 bombino et al 2010 spain g√≥mez et al 2009 burguet et al 2016 therefore more research may help to better understand the changes of infiltrability and physico chemical properties of soils immediately or few weeks after receiving omw to fill this gap this study evaluates the short term effects of omw spreading on soil hydrology in the immediate weeks after application more specifically irrigation tests with omw have been carried out in olive field plots at an experimental site in calabria southern italy and the infiltrability and physico chemical properties of treated soils were compared with unirrigated soils and soils irrigated with clean water we hypothesized that the short term effects of omw application are not as beneficial as those reported after long term monitoring e g mekki et al 2006 2007 mechri et al 2008 moraetis et al 2011 this experimental study aims to address the insufficient literature available on this topic to either confirm or reject this hypothesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tests were carried in plots on an olive farm 180 m above mean sea level geographical coordinates 38 9685n 16 2883e in the territory of lamezia terme calabria southern italy fig 1 a olive grove soils were characterized from forty five samples collected at two different depths 0 5 and 30 40 cm below ground soil showed on average 34 of sand 36 of silt and 31 of clay w w and lack of skeleton and was classified as alfisol loamy soil with moderately fine texture according to the usda soil taxonomy 2 2 experimental design in the olive grove three plots each one including 18 seven year old olive trees cultivar carolea planted at 5 4 m were chosen fig 1b each plot covered an area of 360 m2 24 m long by 15 m wide within each plot three sample areas were chosen fig 1b of which one area was not irrigated henceforth indicated as no irrigation and assumed as control a second area was treated in march with omw henceforth indicated as irrigation with omw a third area was treated in march with clean water henceforth indicated as irrigation with cw at one and three weeks after irrigation the sample areas in the three plots were subject to infiltration tests after eight weeks the main chemical physical properties of soil in each sample area of the three plots were evaluated at two different profile depths 0 5 and 30 40 cm fig 1b all measurements were carried out in triplicate 2 3 irrigation equipment and methods the micro irrigation system consisted of a 40 mesh disk filter a main pvc pipeline 75 mm in diameter and a secondary low density polyethylene pipeline 32 mm supplying eight distributing lines 16 mm provided with drippers of long path type each olive tree was irrigated by two drippers distributing 8 l h 1 at distance of 1 m the irrigation water was pressured by an electric pump of nominal power of 4 kw with pressure manually setup through a by pass set at a pressure of 1 1 1 bar further details over the irrigation system are reported in the paper by capra et al 2005 the hydraulic load equal for plots irrigated with omw and cw was 75 m3 ha 1 equivalent to 150 l per olive tree in 10 h and 33 mm on the area of effective infiltration the hydraulic load of omw supply is close to the maximum limit permitted by the italian law n 574 96 equal to 80 m3 ha 1 per year 2 4 water analysis omw was supplied from a continuous three phase oil extraction system and stored in the period november march in a 180 m3 open concrete tank cw was pumped from a well analysis of omw and cw was carried out in triplicate on water samples following the italian standards apat irsa cnr 2003 which refer to the common international methods apha awwa ef 1998 astm 1981 epa 1974 omw was characterized at the beginning during and at the end of the watering while cw was sampled at the beginning of watering table 1 2 5 infiltration tests measurements of soil infiltration rates were performed by a double cylinder infiltrometer consisting of two coaxial cylinders having inner and outer diameters of 320 and 570 mm respectively and height of 300 mm and driven into the soil to a depth of 150 mm the test measured the time needed for the infiltration of 20 mm of water in the cylinders filled with 50 70 mm of cw the infiltration test was repeated until three equal time measurements had been recorded between filling operations the ratio between the water depth of 20 mm and the time recorded for water infiltration gave the soil infiltration rate the infiltration measurements were made in three randomly chosen points of each plot soil samples with cracks or pebbles which could lead to unrealistic measurements were excluded 2

irrigation with omw or irrigation with cw soil sampling depth that is 0 5 or 30 40 cm and the interactions between treatment and soil sampling depth the post hoc test applied was fisher s least significant difference at p 0 05 level of significance then tukey s test at p 0 05 was also used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in soil infiltration rates and physico chemical changes between pairs of treatments the latter comparisons were performed separately at the two sampling depths the same test was preliminarily applied to physico chemical properties of irrigation waters used for the treatments that is omw and cw finally principal component analysis pca was performed on a spearman rank correlation matrix of the physico chemical properties of soils sampled at the two depths after treatments to reduce the dimensionality of the data set in order to satisfy the assumptions of the statistical tests that is the equality of variance and normal distribution the data were subjected to normality test or were square root transformed whenever necessary the statistical analyses were carried out with the statgraphics centurion and xlstat software

were absent table 1 3 2 changes of hydrological properties of the soil fig 2 illustrates the infiltration curves measured by the tests carried out by the infiltrometer the initial infiltration rate was higher for plots irrigated with omw and lower for irrigation with cw the steady state was achieved after about 6 7 h in the unirrigated plots or plots irrigated with omw and after 12 h in those irrigated with cw fig 2 one week after irrigation the steady state infiltration rate 3 31 mm h 1 in the case of omw application and 2 22 mm h 1 for cw was much lower compared to the unirrigated plot 42 3 mm h 1 the plots irrigated with omw showed a higher infiltration rate by about 50 compared to those irrigated with cw table 2 three weeks after irrigation a shift of the steady state infiltration rate was observed in the plots irrigated with omw 20 74 mm h 1 three times higher than measurements in plots irrigated with cw 6 79 mm h 1 although remaining lower than the values achieved in the unirrigated control plot 42 3 mm h 1 table 2 3 3 changes of physico chemical properties of the soil two way anova showed that the irrigation and the sampling depth factors separately influenced all the physico chemical parameters of the soil excluding mg concentration for the irrigation factor and ph cec and asindex for soil depth the interactions among these variability factors were always statistically significant except ca na cec volacid and asindex table 3 in the topsoil compared to the unirrigated soil the plots treated with omw showed a slight increase of ph from 6 47 to 6 85 irrigation with omw increased the soil s content of om from 23 4 27 6 g kg 1 and of all macro and micronutrients with the exception of tn 1 6 g kg 1 for both and mg 210 and 206 g kg 1 respectively due to the increase of om content and cations also asindex and cec were higher in plots treated with omw 34 97 and 13 83 meq 100 g 1 respectively compared with unirrigated plots 20 33 and 10 37 meq 100 g

content of om and micro macro nutrients except sodium the asindex was higher than in unirrigated plots 21 6 against 20 33 respectively table 4 in the deeper soil layer 30 40 cm compared to control plots irrigation with omw increased ph from 6 33 to 6 59 and decreased the soil content of om tn p mg and pp conversely the content of k ca and na as well as cec and asindex were higher table 4 the same trend was detected in the plots irrigated with cw but with a more noticeable decrease of k and pp contents table 3 3 4 statistical analysis 3 4 1 correlation analysis positive and significant correlations were detected between om and tn p k mg pp and volacid the ph of soil was also positively correlated with p k volacid and asindex moreover tn and p were correlated positively with k pp and volacid and negatively with na also asindex showed a positive correlation with na and ca both volacid and asindex were not correlated with cec and mg finally the correlation between cec and k ca na was positive and significant table 5 3 4 2 principal component analysis pca by pca two principal components pc1 and pc2 were extracted explaining about 75 of the total variance of the original variables 47 for pc1 and 28 for pc2 plotting the pca scores on the two pcs allowed clustering six well differentiated groups fig 3 the clustered groups were the following i irrigation with omw 30 40 sampling depth ii irrigation with omw 0 5 sampling depth iii irrigation with cw 30 40 sampling depth iv irrigation with cw 0 5 sampling depth v no irrigation 30 40 sampling depth and vi no irrigation and 0 5 sampling depth fig 3 more specifically as explained by the loadings of the soil parameters on the pcs the organic matter om the acidity volacid as well as the concentrations of nutrients tn p and k and pp significantly influenced the first pc while the concentrations of some micro nutrients ca and na as well as the aggregate stability asindex mainly weighted on pc2 table 6 and fig 3 some of these correlations are in tune with those found by the study of chaari et al 2015 mainly those relating k and ph om and p from the multivariate statistical analysis by pca two interesting considerations can be drawn first of all a gradient along the first principal component mainly related to om tn p k and pp content is evident among samples taken at different depths fig 3 in other words these physico chemical properties of topsoil are associated with positive values of pc1 except two samples irrigated with cw while those of the deeper soil show negative values of pc1 moreover another evident gradient can be found along the second principal component on which the concentration of ca and na as well as cec and asindex mainly weigh fig 3 the different soil treatments are arranged along this gradient without noticeable differences between topsoil and deeper layers the soil irrigated with omw is associated with positive values of pc2 whereas the unirrigated soil has negative scores on the same pc 4 discussions 4 1 characterisation of omw and cw the preliminary characterisation of residual omw and clean cw waters used for olive grove irrigation showed a noticeable content of polluting compounds acid and saline water containing high concentrations of om macro and micro nutrients and inhibiting compounds pp may alter in both short and long term the physico chemical and biological equilibrium of the treated soils moreno et al 1987 paredes et al 1999 piotrowska et al 2011 for instance when unstable organic matter is applied to soil several negative effects can be detected on soil properties and plant growth such as increased mineralization of soil organic carbon anaerobic conditions phytotoxicity and immobilization of plant nutrients senesi et al 1999 cereti et al 2004 komilis et al 2005 brunetti et al 2007 4 2 changes in hydrological properties of the soil as regards the hydrological affects of omw application it is known that the hydraulic conductivity of saturated soils is generally reduced by irrigation with wastewater gharaibeh et al 2007 this investigation showed that one week after watering a reduction of soil infiltration rate in the soil treated with omw is evident however also the soil with cw irrigation showed a drastic decrease of infiltration these reductions of infiltration rates detected in both irrigated soils may be due to soil particle movement with surface pores clogging after irrigation also the addition of exchangeable cations and high amounts of total suspended solids of which our omw is rich and the accumulation of fatty substances of residual olive oil in omw bhardwaj et al 2008 travis et al 2008 barbera et al 2013 may have aggravated this behaviour of the top soil horizons after three weeks steady state infiltration rates of irrigated soils are lower than the values achieved in the unirrigated control plot however soils treated with omw showed noticeable increases compared to soils irrigated with cw whose infiltrability remains very low compared to the unirrigated plots irrigation with cw showed a steady state infiltration rate reduced by over 80 while the value measured in the soil treated with omw was 50 compared to the unirrigated plots the higher infiltration rate of plots irrigated with omw compared to those irrigated with cw probably depends on the soil particle aggregation effect provided by the addition of organic matter l√≥pez pi√±eiro et al 2007 the results of this study are in agreement with the short term reduction of soil infiltration rate reported by andiloro et al 2005 table 7 moreover barbera et al 2013 report that soil infiltration decreases approximately 20 days after omw application and then gradually increases with a trend likely related to the biological decomposition of the fatty substances the short term reduction of soil infiltration rate detected in our study confirms the working hypothesis that the omw application may worsen the hydrological response of soil immediately after its application therefore the reduction in soil infiltrability suggests caution in irrigation of agricultural land since it may increase runoff and erosion processes however the noticeable improvement of the hydrological response of soils treated with omw compared to the decreased infiltration rates shown by soils irrigated by cw confirms the benefits of omw application against the possible hydrological risks occurring in steep slopes after intense storms 4 3 changes in physico chemical properties of the soil the action of organic matter seems to be responsible for the increase of the infiltration rate in soils treated with omw compared to irrigation with cw organic matter improves the porosity cox et al 1996 and other physical properties such as the stability of aggregates table 3 within the topsoil chaney and swift 1984 lado et al 2004 furthermore the susceptivity of the soil to sealing is decreased le bissonais 1996 the results confirmed the high correlation between organic matter and the soil infiltration rate also detected by mbagwu and auerswald 1999 0 55 significant at p level 0 05 contrasting effects in the analysed soil properties were found in the treated plots and the investigated soil depths many of these contrasts were significant and mutually dependent as two way anova demonstrated at both investigated soil depths omw application induced a slight increase of ph values in spite of the omw slight acidity presumably the high buffer capacity of the soil did not decrease soil ph after the omw application this beneficial action seems to assure a soil tolerance in receiving acid wastewater therefore in the short term no detrimental effects to ph were detected in the experimental soil literature reports contrasting results about changes in soil ph after omw application most studies report ph decreases due to irrigation with omw this was detected both in the short terms within 5 6 months zenjari and nejmeddine 2001 sierra et al 2007 di serio et al 2008 brunetti et al 2007 and many months after irrigation chaari et al 2015 table 7 according to these authors soil acidity slightly decreases in the upper layer immediately after omw application since omw had a low ph di serio et al 2008 conversely others authors reported as in our study slight increase of ph when soils were irrigated with omw di bene et al 2013 at six months in the topsoil piotrowska et al 2011 after seven weeks chartzoulakis et al 2005 in the long term table 7 an increase in organic matter content was detected in the topsoil which supports the working hypothesis that omw land application has a beneficial effect on soil properties also in the short terms except sierra et al 2007 and di bene et al 2013 on a sandy loam soil all the authors reported increases in organic matter or carbon content of the topsoil after omw application both in short zenjari and nejmeddine 2001 di serio et al 2008 piotrowska et al 2011 brunetti et al 2007 and in long terms andiloro et al 2005 mekki et al 2006 chartzoulakis et al 2005 chaari et al 2015 because of the high organic matter content of the effluent table 7 in the topsoil a significant increase of potassium and polyphenol contents were also measured while the total nitrogen did not change for this nutrient a slight reduction was instead recorded after irrigation with cw practically all the previous literature report increases in the contents of nitrogen phosphorous and potassium with few exceptions among these latter sierra et al 2007 and piotrowska et al 2011 detected reductions or no changes in nitrogen content of the topsoil in the short terms while decreases in phosphorous sierra et al 2007 after 120 days from irrigation and andiloro et al 2005 after seven months and potassium andiloro et al 2005 concentrations were measured the increases of potassium and phosphorous may well be due to the high phosphorous content of omw and to the action of microflora which affects the available potassium fraction in organic form within the effluent papini et al 2000 the increase in the content of potassium and phosphorus enhances soil fertility and this suggests the viability of omw use as soil fertiliser supposed in this study therefore the omw application reduces the need for chemical fertilizers in spring with evident economic and ecological benefits di serio et al 2008 the effects of the polyphenols are notable throughout three months after omw application saviozzi et al 1993 saadi et al 2007 and subsequently the content of phenols gradually decreases since these compounds are broken down by specific bacteria such as yeasts and fungi di serio et al 2008 barbera et al 2013 this study confirms the sharp increase in polyphenol content of the topsoil which is in accordance with those literature studies carried out no later than 3 4 months after omw applications zenjari and nejmeddine 2001 di serio et al 2008 after this period andiloro et al 2005 sierra et al 2007 and di bene et al 2013 showed that the polyphenol content is reduced both in the topsoil and in the deeper layer table 7 sierra et al 2007 recommended a limit of 180 m3 ha 1 for omw yearly application because at doses over 360 m3 ha 1 the phenolic content of soil may increase due to the temporal immobilization of nitrate which may decrease plant production since the omw application load of the present study 80 m3 ha 1 year 1 was much lower than the suggested limit the phytotoxic and antibacterial actions of polyphenols which represent the main limiting factor for spreading omw may be excluded in the short terms considering the limited increase detected in the topsoil as regards the deeper soil layer 30 40 cm the contents of organic matter total nitrogen phosphorous and polyphenols basically similar in the plots irrigated both with omw and cw are lower than in the unirrigated control plot presumably due to the leaching effects induced by water percolation into the soil s deeper layers conversely a slight increase in the potassium content was measured after omw application according to chartzoulakis et al 2010 this allows a reduction of the potassium fertilizer added to soil treated with omw at both the investigated profile depths of soil irrigated with omw a higher value of sodium content was found compared to the control here careful attention should be paid since excessive sodium application through wastewater may lead to soil structure decay due to excessive alkalinity and adverse effects on plant growth and yield due to the increased osmotic potential finally mahmoud et al 2012 report that the effect of omw application on aggregate stability has not been thoroughly studied although this property is important in evaluating the hydrological behaviour and long term crop productivity of soil letey 1985 the aggregate stability index after irrigation with omw is higher at both the investigated soil depths compared to the control plot and this may represent a beneficial effect of soil treatment with omw this increase may well be due to the higher soil aggregation induced by the om content of wastewater table 7 this result contrasts with findings of andiloro et al 2005 who detected a reduction in aggregate stability in both the surface and deeper layers of the treated soil seven months after omw application 5 conclusions in this study omw was applied at a rate close to the maximum limit permitted by the italian law 80 m3 ha 1 year 1 on a loamy soil the hydrological and physico chemical effects were measured some weeks after omw application and compared to untreated soils control tests and soils irrigated with cw these short term results of omw application were not always as beneficial as those reported after long term literature experiences as regards the hydrological aspects omw application temporarily reduced the soil infiltration rate immediately after irrigation subsequently a significant increase mainly at two or three weeks from watering was noticed on the treated soils although infiltration was lower than in the control therefore steep soils should not be irrigated with omw during or immediately before the wet season to avoid the risks of surface runoff and soil erosion a few weeks after irrigation some of the monitored physico chemical properties of the soil treated with omw had improved e g organic matter phosphorous and potassium contents soil aggregate stability and the remaining properties were not negatively affected e g ph nitrogen and polyphenol content by omw application compared to the unirrigated plots or those treated with cw however an excessive sodium concentration in applied omw may lead to soil structure decay and plant development reduction pca highlighted a noticeable influence of soil treatments on micro nutrient contents cec and the stability of aggregates with slight differences between topsoil and deeper layers conversely the concentration of organic matter polyphenols and nutrients is noticeably stratified into the topsoil and the deeper layers regardless the type of treatment irrigation with omw or cw either no irrigation overall the experimental tests confirm that the effluents of olive oil mills when used in addition to clear water for crop irrigation may represent both a soil improvement and an important resource in mediterranean agriculture in such environmental contexts the availability of irrigation water is limited due to the semi arid climate and competition with other uses and soils are in general poor in fertilising compounds irrigation of soils with omw reduces clean water demand and improves soil fertility due to the addition of organic matter and nutrients however omw should not be applied to soils during or immediately before the wet season finally omw land application avoids or at least limits the need for effluent depuration before its disposal thus reducing the pollution risk to water bodies 
11003,wastewater from the olive oil industry is often spread on soils but this practice requires caution because of the possible harmful hydrological and physico chemical effects on soils treated while research has mainly focussed on the long term changes in soil properties very few studies refer to short term effects which appear a few weeks or months after olive mill wastewater omw application mediterranean areas are particularly prone to runoff and soil erosion risks and the evaluation of the short term effects of omw on hydraulic conductivity and other physico chemical properties of soils in this area are scarce to fill this gap this study has evaluated the effects of omw spreading on the hydrology of a loamy soil at one and three weeks after application more specifically irrigation tests with omw were carried out in olive field plots in calabria southern italy the infiltrability and physico chemical properties of treated soils were compared with unirrigated soils and soils irrigated with clean water such as groundwater a temporary reduction in the soil infiltration rate was detected immediately after omw irrigation although it was followed by a significant increase after three weeks in the topsoil irrigation with omw produced an increase in phosphorous potassium and organic matter contents as well as a higher stability of aggregates in the deeper layer of soil treated with omw the contents of organic matter and nutrients as well as of polyphenols were lower than in the unirrigated plot potassium calcium and sodium contents were higher in the soil irrigated with omw both in topsoil and deeper layers principal component analysis highlighted a noticeable influence of treatments on soil micronutrient contents cation exchange capacity and the stability of aggregates with slight differences between topsoil and deeper soil layers conversely the concentration of organic matter polyphenols and nutrients is noticeably stratified in both the topsoil and the deeper layers regardless the type of treatment keywords infiltration rate organic matter soil physico chemical changes wastewater irrigation soil aggregate stability runoff and erosion risk 1 introduction the extraction process of olive oil requires the addition of a high volume of water a large share of which becomes waste aktas et al 2001 mechri et al 2007 sellami et al 2008 this oil mill effluent known as olive mill wastewater omw contains the water added during the process the water and pulp contents of olives and a stable emulsion of oil residues paredes et al 2002 brunetti et al 2007 generally omw shows high concentrations of organic matter suspended solids and inhibiting compounds such as polyphenols the content in mineral elements such as potassium phosphorus and calcium is lower amaral et al 2008 di serio et al 2008 because of these peculiar characteristics uncontrolled disposal of omw poses serious environmental risks to water soil and air such as the pollution of surface and ground water bodies degradation of soil properties and foul smelling emissions dermeche et al 2013 chaari et al 2015 the most dangerous omw properties are the acidic ph and the high contents of both organic matter and phenols dermeche et al 2013 chaari et al 2015 aggoun et al 2016 to reduce the environmental drawbacks linked to omw disposal several physico chemical e g evaporation reverse osmosis filtration oxidation thermal drying or biological e g aerobic and anaerobic treatments composting phyto depuration methods have been proposed for omw treatment dourou et al 2016 however until now their economic and technological application is in most cases limited chartzoulakis et al 2010 in contrast to the usual omw treatments several studies have suggested the controlled application of omw to cultivated soil according to these studies omw can be used as a cheap soil conditioner and or fertilizer saadi et al 2007 caputo et al 2013 ayoub et al 2014 barbera et al 2014 and represents an additional water and nutrient resource for fertilisation irrigation of mediterranean olive groves affected by a chronic water and organic matter scarcity di bene et al 2013 ayoub et al 2014 chaari et al 2015 in this practice called omw land treatment and utilisation omw is applied to bare or cultivated soil cabrera et al 1996 sierra et al 2001 kapellakis et al 2008 mechri et al 2008 however omw land treatment must be practised with caution since omw application may induce serious environmental damage due to its toxicity towards plants and bacteria living in soils moreno et al 1987 mekki et al 2006 barbera et al 2014 moreover the agronomic use of omw is limited by other constraints such as oil and grease amaral et al 2008 ouzounidou et al 2008 suspended solids paredes et al 1987 roig et al 2006 chaari et al 2015 as well as high salinity and acidity barbera et al 2014 cavallaro et al 2014 therefore the impacts of omw application on crops and on the chemical physical and biological properties of soils must be further studied and tested in field since little is known about these effects aggelis et al 2003 mekki et al 2008 2009 a comprehensive review was carried out by mekki et al 2006 and more recently barbera et al 2013 in general due to the variability of omw application rates and properties of receiving soils literature data on omw effects on soil properties is not unanimous and in many cases even contradictory chartzoulakis et al 2010 in addition most of the studies reported in the scientific literature have mainly evaluated the long term effects on soil properties that is on a yearly or decade scale with contrasting results greco et al 2006 l√≥pez et al 1996 piotrowska et al 2006 2011 compared to studies on the long term effects those on the short term effects are far fewer e g levi minzi et al 1992 sierra et al 2007 di serio et al 2008 di bene et al 2013 piotrowska et al 2011 the evaluation of the effects of omw on the chemical physical and biological soil properties performed some weeks or months after omw application on soil are equally important since many adverse effects may be present only in this period for instance sierra et al 2007 detected increases in soil salinity and in content of phenolic compounds four months after omw application a decrease in soil ph and polyphenol pp content were claimed by di serio et al 2008 in 2 month field experiments di bene et al 2013 and caruso et al 2018 suggested strict control of omw use as an organic conditioner given the negative effects on soil properties such as the increase in pp and electrical conductivity and decrease in fungal communities five days after omw application these early adverse effects become more negligible as time passes as a general response to omw application piotrowska et al 2011 observed sudden changes in some biological properties of the soil immediately after application and in the following 14 days by contrast no differences in cod chemical oxygen demand phenol content and electrical conductivity of soils were detected three months after omw application by levi minzi et al 1992 compared to untreated soils furthermore few studies have focused on the short term hydrological effects of omw application thus the time evolution of infiltrability on soils treated with omw is also not completely understood and literature data about the effects of omw on water infiltration and hydraulic conductivity of soil are contrasting barbera et al 2013 much caution should be paid to the possible changes in the hydrological properties of receiving soils such as infiltration rates in mediterranean areas particularly prone to runoff and soil erosion risks zema et al 2014 fortugno et al 2017 lucas borja et al 2018 zema et al 2018 omw should not be applied to soils during the wet period a decrease in soil infiltrability after omw land treatment may worsen the hydrological response to intense storms on the steep olive groves of some mediterranean areas e g southern italy tamburino et al 1999 bombino et al 2010 spain g√≥mez et al 2009 burguet et al 2016 therefore more research may help to better understand the changes of infiltrability and physico chemical properties of soils immediately or few weeks after receiving omw to fill this gap this study evaluates the short term effects of omw spreading on soil hydrology in the immediate weeks after application more specifically irrigation tests with omw have been carried out in olive field plots at an experimental site in calabria southern italy and the infiltrability and physico chemical properties of treated soils were compared with unirrigated soils and soils irrigated with clean water we hypothesized that the short term effects of omw application are not as beneficial as those reported after long term monitoring e g mekki et al 2006 2007 mechri et al 2008 moraetis et al 2011 this experimental study aims to address the insufficient literature available on this topic to either confirm or reject this hypothesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tests were carried in plots on an olive farm 180 m above mean sea level geographical coordinates 38 9685n 16 2883e in the territory of lamezia terme calabria southern italy fig 1 a olive grove soils were characterized from forty five samples collected at two different depths 0 5 and 30 40 cm below ground soil showed on average 34 of sand 36 of silt and 31 of clay w w and lack of skeleton and was classified as alfisol loamy soil with moderately fine texture according to the usda soil taxonomy 2 2 experimental design in the olive grove three plots each one including 18 seven year old olive trees cultivar carolea planted at 5 4 m were chosen fig 1b each plot covered an area of 360 m2 24 m long by 15 m wide within each plot three sample areas were chosen fig 1b of which one area was not irrigated henceforth indicated as no irrigation and assumed as control a second area was treated in march with omw henceforth indicated as irrigation with omw a third area was treated in march with clean water henceforth indicated as irrigation with cw at one and three weeks after irrigation the sample areas in the three plots were subject to infiltration tests after eight weeks the main chemical physical properties of soil in each sample area of the three plots were evaluated at two different profile depths 0 5 and 30 40 cm fig 1b all measurements were carried out in triplicate 2 3 irrigation equipment and methods the micro irrigation system consisted of a 40 mesh disk filter a main pvc pipeline 75 mm in diameter and a secondary low density polyethylene pipeline 32 mm supplying eight distributing lines 16 mm provided with drippers of long path type each olive tree was irrigated by two drippers distributing 8 l h 1 at distance of 1 m the irrigation water was pressured by an electric pump of nominal power of 4 kw with pressure manually setup through a by pass set at a pressure of 1 1 1 bar further details over the irrigation system are reported in the paper by capra et al 2005 the hydraulic load equal for plots irrigated with omw and cw was 75 m3 ha 1 equivalent to 150 l per olive tree in 10 h and 33 mm on the area of effective infiltration the hydraulic load of omw supply is close to the maximum limit permitted by the italian law n 574 96 equal to 80 m3 ha 1 per year 2 4 water analysis omw was supplied from a continuous three phase oil extraction system and stored in the period november march in a 180 m3 open concrete tank cw was pumped from a well analysis of omw and cw was carried out in triplicate on water samples following the italian standards apat irsa cnr 2003 which refer to the common international methods apha awwa ef 1998 astm 1981 epa 1974 omw was characterized at the beginning during and at the end of the watering while cw was sampled at the beginning of watering table 1 2 5 infiltration tests measurements of soil infiltration rates were performed by a double cylinder infiltrometer consisting of two coaxial cylinders having inner and outer diameters of 320 and 570 mm respectively and height of 300 mm and driven into the soil to a depth of 150 mm the test measured the time needed for the infiltration of 20 mm of water in the cylinders filled with 50 70 mm of cw the infiltration test was repeated until three equal time measurements had been recorded between filling operations the ratio between the water depth of 20 mm and the time recorded for water infiltration gave the soil infiltration rate the infiltration measurements were made in three randomly chosen points of each plot soil samples with cracks or pebbles which could lead to unrealistic measurements were excluded 2

irrigation with omw or irrigation with cw soil sampling depth that is 0 5 or 30 40 cm and the interactions between treatment and soil sampling depth the post hoc test applied was fisher s least significant difference at p 0 05 level of significance then tukey s test at p 0 05 was also used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in soil infiltration rates and physico chemical changes between pairs of treatments the latter comparisons were performed separately at the two sampling depths the same test was preliminarily applied to physico chemical properties of irrigation waters used for the treatments that is omw and cw finally principal component analysis pca was performed on a spearman rank correlation matrix of the physico chemical properties of soils sampled at the two depths after treatments to reduce the dimensionality of the data set in order to satisfy the assumptions of the statistical tests that is the equality of variance and normal distribution the data were subjected to normality test or were square root transformed whenever necessary the statistical analyses were carried out with the statgraphics centurion and xlstat software

were absent table 1 3 2 changes of hydrological properties of the soil fig 2 illustrates the infiltration curves measured by the tests carried out by the infiltrometer the initial infiltration rate was higher for plots irrigated with omw and lower for irrigation with cw the steady state was achieved after about 6 7 h in the unirrigated plots or plots irrigated with omw and after 12 h in those irrigated with cw fig 2 one week after irrigation the steady state infiltration rate 3 31 mm h 1 in the case of omw application and 2 22 mm h 1 for cw was much lower compared to the unirrigated plot 42 3 mm h 1 the plots irrigated with omw showed a higher infiltration rate by about 50 compared to those irrigated with cw table 2 three weeks after irrigation a shift of the steady state infiltration rate was observed in the plots irrigated with omw 20 74 mm h 1 three times higher than measurements in plots irrigated with cw 6 79 mm h 1 although remaining lower than the values achieved in the unirrigated control plot 42 3 mm h 1 table 2 3 3 changes of physico chemical properties of the soil two way anova showed that the irrigation and the sampling depth factors separately influenced all

statistically significant except ca na cec volacid and asindex table 3 in the topsoil compared to the unirrigated soil the plots treated with omw showed a slight increase of ph from 6 47 to 6 85 irrigation with omw increased the soil s content of om from 23 4 27 6 g kg 1 and of all macro and micronutrients with the exception of tn 1 6 g kg 1 for both and mg 210 and 206 g kg 1 respectively due to the increase of om content and cations also asindex and cec were higher in plots treated with omw 34 97 and 13 83 meq 100 g 1 respectively compared with unirrigated plots 20 33 and 10 37 meq 100 g 1 respectively also the pp content of treated soil was higher 7 50 g kg 1 than in the control plots 6 17 g kg 1 table 3 compared to the control plots irrigation with cw decreased ph and the soil content of om and micro macro nutrients except sodium the asindex was higher than in unirrigated plots 21 6 against 20 33 respectively table 4 in the deeper soil layer 30 40 cm compared to control plots irrigation with omw increased ph from 6 33 to 6 59 and decreased the soil content of om tn p mg and pp conversely the content of k ca and na as well as cec and asindex were higher table 4 the same trend was detected in the plots irrigated with cw but with a more noticeable decrease of k and pp contents table 3 3 4 statistical analysis 3 4 1 correlation analysis positive and significant correlations were detected between om and tn p k mg pp and volacid the ph of soil was also positively correlated with p k volacid and asindex moreover tn and p were correlated positively with k pp and volacid and negatively with na also asindex showed a positive correlation with na and ca both volacid and asindex were not correlated with cec and mg finally the correlation between cec and k ca na was positive and significant table 5 3 4 2 principal component analysis pca by pca two principal components pc1 and pc2 were extracted explaining about 75 of the total variance of the original variables 47 for pc1 and 28 for pc2 plotting the pca scores on the two pcs allowed clustering six well differentiated groups fig 3 the clustered groups were the following i irrigation with omw 30 40 sampling depth ii irrigation with omw 0 5 sampling depth iii irrigation with cw 30 40 sampling depth iv irrigation with cw 0 5 sampling depth v no irrigation 30 40 sampling depth and vi no irrigation and 0 5 sampling depth fig 3 more specifically as explained by the loadings of the soil parameters on the pcs the organic matter om the acidity volacid as well as the concentrations of nutrients tn p and k and pp significantly influenced the first pc while the concentrations of some micro nutrients ca and na as well as the aggregate stability asindex mainly weighted on pc2 table 6 and fig 3 some of these correlations are in tune with those found by the study of chaari et al 2015 mainly those relating k and ph om and p from the multivariate statistical analysis by pca two interesting considerations can be drawn first of all a gradient along the first principal component mainly related to om tn p k and pp content is evident among samples taken at different depths fig 3 in other words these physico chemical properties of topsoil are associated with positive values of pc1 except two samples irrigated with cw while those of the deeper soil show negative values of pc1 moreover another evident gradient can be found along the second principal component on which the concentration of ca and na as well as cec and asindex mainly weigh fig 3 the different soil treatments are arranged along this gradient without noticeable differences between topsoil and deeper layers the soil irrigated with omw is associated with positive values of pc2 whereas the unirrigated soil has negative scores on the same pc 4 discussions 4 1 characterisation of omw and cw the preliminary characterisation of residual omw and clean cw waters used for olive grove irrigation showed a noticeable content of polluting compounds acid and saline water containing high concentrations of om macro and micro nutrients and inhibiting compounds pp may alter in both short and long term the physico chemical and biological equilibrium of the treated soils moreno et al 1987 paredes et al 1999 piotrowska et al 2011 for instance when unstable organic matter is applied to soil several negative effects can be detected on soil properties and plant growth such as increased mineralization of soil organic carbon anaerobic conditions phytotoxicity and immobilization of plant nutrients senesi et al 1999 cereti et al 2004 komilis et al 2005 brunetti et al 2007 4 2 changes in hydrological properties of the soil as regards the hydrological affects of omw application it is known that the hydraulic conductivity of saturated soils is generally reduced by irrigation with wastewater gharaibeh et al 2007 this investigation showed that one week after watering a reduction of soil infiltration rate in the soil treated with omw is evident however also the soil with cw irrigation showed a drastic decrease of infiltration these reductions of infiltration rates detected in both irrigated soils may be due to soil particle movement with surface pores clogging after irrigation also the addition of exchangeable cations and high amounts of total suspended solids of which our omw is rich and the accumulation of fatty substances of residual olive oil in omw bhardwaj et al 2008 travis et al 2008 barbera et al 2013 may have aggravated this behaviour of the top soil horizons after three weeks steady state infiltration rates of irrigated soils are lower than the values achieved in the unirrigated control plot however soils treated with omw showed noticeable increases compared to soils irrigated with cw whose infiltrability remains very low compared to the unirrigated plots irrigation with cw showed a steady state infiltration rate reduced by over 80 while the value measured in the soil treated with omw was 50 compared to the unirrigated plots the higher infiltration rate of plots irrigated with omw compared to those irrigated with cw probably depends on the soil particle aggregation effect provided by the addition of organic matter l√≥pez pi√±eiro et al 2007 the results of this study are in agreement with the short term reduction of soil infiltration rate reported by andiloro et al 2005 table 7 moreover barbera et al 2013 report that soil infiltration decreases approximately 20 days after omw application and then gradually increases with a trend likely related to the biological decomposition of the fatty substances the short term reduction of soil infiltration rate detected in our study confirms the working hypothesis that the omw application may worsen the hydrological response of soil immediately after its application therefore the reduction in soil infiltrability suggests caution in irrigation of agricultural land since it may increase runoff and erosion processes however the noticeable improvement of the hydrological response of soils treated with omw compared to the decreased infiltration rates shown by soils irrigated by cw confirms the benefits of omw application against the possible hydrological risks occurring in steep slopes after intense storms 4 3 changes in physico chemical properties of the soil the action of organic matter seems to be responsible for the increase of the infiltration rate in soils treated with omw compared to irrigation with cw organic matter improves the porosity cox et al 1996 and other physical properties such as the stability of aggregates table 3 within the topsoil chaney and swift 1984 lado et al 2004 furthermore the susceptivity of the soil to sealing is decreased le bissonais 1996 the results confirmed the high correlation between organic matter and the soil infiltration rate also detected by mbagwu and auerswald 1999 0 55 significant at p level 0 05 contrasting effects in the analysed soil properties were found in the treated plots and the investigated soil depths many of these contrasts were significant and mutually dependent as two way anova demonstrated at both investigated soil depths omw application induced a slight increase of ph values in spite of the omw slight acidity presumably the high buffer capacity of the soil did not decrease soil ph after the omw application this beneficial action seems to assure a soil tolerance in receiving acid wastewater therefore in the short term no detrimental effects to ph were detected in the experimental soil literature reports contrasting results about changes in soil ph after omw application most studies report ph decreases due to irrigation with omw this was detected both in the short terms within 5 6 months zenjari and nejmeddine 2001 sierra et al 2007 di serio et al 2008 brunetti et al 2007 and many months after irrigation chaari et al 2015 table 7 according to these authors soil acidity slightly decreases in the upper layer immediately after omw application since omw had a low ph di serio et al 2008 conversely others authors reported as in our study slight increase of ph when soils were irrigated with omw di bene et al 2013 at six months in the topsoil piotrowska et al 2011 after seven weeks chartzoulakis et al 2005 in the long term table 7 an increase in organic matter content was detected in the topsoil which supports the working hypothesis that omw land application has a beneficial effect on soil properties also in the short terms except sierra et al 2007 and di bene et al 2013 on a sandy loam soil all the authors reported increases in organic matter or carbon content of the topsoil after omw application both in short zenjari and nejmeddine 2001 di serio et al 2008 piotrowska et al 2011 brunetti et al 2007 and in long terms andiloro et al 2005 mekki et al 2006 chartzoulakis et al 2005 chaari et al 2015 because of the high organic matter content of the effluent table 7 in the topsoil a significant increase of potassium and polyphenol contents were also measured while the total nitrogen did not change for this nutrient a slight reduction was instead recorded after irrigation with cw practically all the previous literature report increases in the contents of nitrogen phosphorous and potassium with few exceptions among these latter sierra et al 2007 and piotrowska et al 2011 detected reductions or no changes in nitrogen content of the topsoil in the short terms while decreases in phosphorous sierra et al 2007 after 120 days from irrigation and andiloro et al 2005 after seven months and potassium andiloro et al 2005 concentrations were measured the increases of potassium and phosphorous may well be due to the high phosphorous content of omw and to the action of microflora which affects the available potassium fraction in organic form within the effluent papini et al 2000 the increase in the content of potassium and phosphorus enhances soil fertility and this suggests the viability of omw use as soil fertiliser supposed in this study therefore the omw application reduces the need for chemical fertilizers in spring with evident economic and ecological benefits di serio et al 2008 the effects of the polyphenols are notable throughout three months after omw application saviozzi et al 1993 saadi et al 2007 and subsequently the content of phenols gradually decreases since these compounds are broken down by specific bacteria such as yeasts and fungi di serio et al 2008 barbera et al 2013 this study confirms the sharp increase in polyphenol content of the topsoil which is in accordance with those literature studies carried out no later than 3 4 months after omw applications zenjari and nejmeddine 2001 di serio et al 2008 after this period andiloro et al 2005 sierra et al 2007 and di bene et al 2013 showed that the polyphenol content is reduced both in the topsoil and in the deeper layer table 7 sierra et al 2007 recommended a limit of 180 m3 ha 1 for omw yearly application because at doses over 360 m3 ha 1 the phenolic content of soil may increase due to the temporal immobilization of nitrate which may decrease plant production since the omw application load of the present study 80 m3 ha 1 year 1 was much lower than the suggested limit the phytotoxic and antibacterial actions of polyphenols which represent the main limiting factor for spreading omw may be excluded in the short terms considering the limited increase detected in the topsoil as regards the deeper soil layer 30 40 cm the contents of organic matter total nitrogen phosphorous and polyphenols basically similar in the plots irrigated both with omw and cw are lower than in the unirrigated control plot presumably due to the leaching effects induced by water percolation into the soil s deeper layers conversely a slight increase in the potassium content was measured after omw application according to chartzoulakis et al 2010 this allows a reduction of the potassium fertilizer added to soil treated with omw at both the investigated profile depths of soil irrigated with omw a higher value of sodium content was found compared to the control here careful attention should be paid since excessive sodium application through wastewater may lead to soil structure decay due to excessive alkalinity and adverse effects on plant growth and yield due to the increased osmotic potential finally mahmoud et al 2012 report that the effect of omw application on aggregate stability has not been thoroughly studied although this property is important in evaluating the hydrological behaviour and long term crop productivity of soil letey 1985 the aggregate stability index after irrigation with omw is higher at both the investigated soil depths compared to the control plot and this may represent a beneficial effect of soil treatment with omw this increase may well be due to the higher soil aggregation induced by the om content of wastewater table 7 this result contrasts with findings of andiloro et al 2005 who detected a reduction in aggregate stability in both the surface and deeper layers of the treated soil seven months after omw application 5 conclusions in this study omw was applied at a rate close to the maximum limit permitted by the italian law 80 m3 ha 1 year 1 on a loamy soil the hydrological and physico chemical effects were measured some weeks after omw application and compared to untreated soils control tests and soils irrigated with cw these short term results of omw application were not always as beneficial as those reported after long term literature experiences as regards the hydrological aspects omw application temporarily reduced the soil infiltration rate immediately after irrigation subsequently a significant increase mainly at two or three weeks from watering was noticed on the treated soils although infiltration was lower than in the control therefore steep soils should not be irrigated with omw during or immediately before the wet season to avoid the risks of surface runoff and soil erosion a few weeks after irrigation some of the monitored physico chemical properties of the soil treated with omw had improved e g organic matter phosphorous and potassium contents soil aggregate stability and the remaining properties were not negatively affected e g ph nitrogen and polyphenol content by omw application compared to the unirrigated plots or those treated with cw however an excessive sodium concentration in applied omw may lead to soil structure decay and plant development reduction pca highlighted a noticeable influence of soil treatments on micro nutrient contents cec and the stability of aggregates with slight differences between topsoil and deeper layers conversely the concentration of organic matter polyphenols and nutrients is noticeably stratified into the topsoil and the deeper layers regardless the type of treatment irrigation with omw or cw either no irrigation overall the experimental tests confirm that the effluents of olive oil mills when used in addition to clear water for crop irrigation may represent both a soil improvement and an important resource in mediterranean agriculture in such environmental contexts the availability of irrigation water is limited due to the semi arid climate and competition with other uses and soils are in general poor in fertilising compounds irrigation of soils with omw reduces clean water demand and improves soil fertility due to the addition of organic matter and nutrients however omw should not be applied to soils during or immediately before the wet season finally omw land application avoids or at least limits the need for effluent depuration before its disposal thus reducing the pollution risk to water bodies 
11004,studies of sugarcane varieties grown under water restrictive conditions are necessary because climate changes may result in insufficient rain for agriculture and selecting or breeding drought tolerant cultivars will become more and more important this study aimed to quantify the accumulation and partitioning of biomass as well as water use efficiency of commercial sugarcane varieties under different soil water availability conditions throughout the growing season the study was conducted during two cropping cycles in southeast brazil 22 7 s 47 6 w four soil moisture availability regimens were set up to provide 100 75 75 and 50 of the water demand of eight commercial varieties of sugarcane ctc15 ctc17 rb867515 rb92579 rb931011 rb966928 iac5000 and nco376 the total aboveground biomass was measured in both crop cycles our results indicate that two brazilian varieties ctc15 and ctc17 and one south african variety nco376 canegrow dssat reference increased their water use efficiency when grown under an irrigation deficit of 75 of normal without yielding less biomass we did not observe any change in sucrose content under controlled water deficits however the studied varieties showed different biomass partitioning rb966928 had the largest biomass fraction allocated in the stalks 0 59 while iac5000 showed the lowest fraction 0 51 we verified that the harvest index for sucrose was not altered by reduced irrigation but that its variability was attributed to the genotype inherited from traditional breeding programs thus we conclude from these results that increased sugar yield per unit area is only possible nowadays by increasing sugarcane biomass productivity under highly efficient irrigation conditions to minimize the loss of yield from water stress keywords saccharum sp growth analysis water deficit water use efficiency harvest index 1 introduction sugarcane saccharum spp is an important commercial crop throughout the world being the source of about 75 of the world s production of table sugar sucrose commodity research bureau 2015 demand for sugar has grown largely in the past decade because of its use in the production of ethanol as a renewable fuel and for co generation of electricity from residual biomass it is cultivated in more than 120 countries fao 2016 with brazil being the leading producer with a cultivated area of approximately nine million hectares producing almost 633 million tons of sugarcane in the 2017 2018 harvest conab 2018 sugarcane has a high demand for water and drought can seriously retard its development lakshmanan and robinson 2014 silva et al 2018 according to several authors robertson et al 1999 ramesh 2000 basnayake et al 2012 gentile et al 2015 productivity losses can reach up to 60 depending on the magnitude and duration of the water stress which makes it impossible to grow sugarcane commercially in regions with uneven rainfall in brazil sugarcane is concentrated in the south central and northeast regions of the country where it depends on rain fed or salvation irrigation at planting time or after harvesting however farmers have expanded the crop to other regions of the country looking for lower land costs which has subjected the crop to climatic instability these areas with periods of decreased rainfall or uneven distribution may reduce sugarcane productivity or even make it impracticable in view of these problems it is necessary to study new methods of irrigation technology to retain economic productivity according to dalri and cruz 2002 irrigation has always been the preferred agricultural method for generating higher yields better product quality and security against drought providing crops with a sort of weather insurance however water for irrigation is limited and it must be carefully managed to minimize waste and to reduce the cost in order to maintain the economic sustainability of the system silva et al 2007 mansour et al 2017 among the tools available to minimize water use for agriculture deficit irrigation is a good option since several authors cirillo et al 2014 davies et al 2016 bell et al 2018 comas et al 2019 have concurred that its use not only reduces water demand in certain crops but also allows farmers to control crop quality this technique can be used most efficiently with drip irrigation el hendawy et al 2008 like other species sugarcane responds differently to a water deficit during different phenological phases studies conducted by robertson and donaldson 1998 inman bamber and smith 2005 and olivier et al 2006 clearly showed that reducing irrigation during the maturation phase saved water and increased the sucrose content for this reason it is common practice in irrigated crops to suspend irrigation before harvesting obtaining as an additional advantage a reduction in moisture content and biomass that will be taken to the sugar mill and lower transportation costs inman bamber and smith 2005 there are also opportunities to save water in the early stages of sugarcane growth roberts et al 1990 robertson et al 1999 and machado et al 2009 a period of water deficit in the early stage of the crop results in compensatory growth of the plants when normal water levels are restored in contrast to the initial and final stages of sugarcane development the intermediate stages where the stem elongates and the plants leaf out have not shown a clear response to irrigation chaudhry and leme 1996 pene and edi 1999 silva and costa 2004 and rossler et al 2013 for example wiedenfeld 2000 did not see any reduction in the fresh stalk yield when irrigation was suspended for six weeks during the growing season it is evident that there is a wide range of sensitivity to water deficit for sugarcane and it is probable that production loss due to drought varies among genotypes inman bamber and smith 2005 silva et al 2007 and silva et al 2013a b thus comparative studies of the responses of different varieties to water restriction are essential good data are needed to understand the growth variables of sugarcane and the allocation of dry matter among the different plant structures with the purpose of identifying the most efficient conversion of water to biomass in this work we conducted a controlled experiment to investigate the effects of soil water availability on the accumulation and partitioning of biomass in eight commercial sugarcane varieties seven brazilian and one south african over two growing seasons plant cane and first ratoon aiming to determine the relative sensitivity of these varieties to soil water restriction conditions and the most efficient use of irrigation water 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and general data experiments were conducted between february 2013 and february 2015 in piracicaba s√£o paulo located in southwestern brazil 22 42 32 s 47 37 45 w elevation 546 m during two growing cycles of sugarcane plant cane and 1 st ratoon under conditions that prevented rainwater from reaching the plants a total of 384 plots were cultivated each with a soil volume of 0 33 m3 and dimensions of 1 04 0 41 x 0 76 m length width and depth filled with soil classified as red yellow latosol with a sandy loam texture corresponding most closely to typic hapludox according to u s soil taxonomy definitions the physical water retention characteristics of the soil are given in table 1 each plot was planted at 0 52 m spacing with two sugarcane seedlings clumps as the experimental units in this study during the growing seasons plants were constantly inspected and pests were controlled with thiametoxan 1000 g ha 1 triflumuron 0 8 l ha 1 and abamectin 0 4 l ha 1 for the control of aphids caterpillars and mites respectively weeding was done by hand plants were fertilized monthly through fertigation and leaf spraying with totals applied during the cycles of plant cane 93 kg n 92 kg k 2 kg b 0 3 kg cu 0 6 kg mn 0 7 kg mo and 6 2

minimum and average air temperature and solar radiation were made with sensors installed inside the greenhouse pyranometers and vaisala sensors with variable height accompanying sugarcane canopy growth for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto we used the method of priestley and taylor 1972 because wind readings were not necessary the meteorological data are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design experiments were done in triplicate and the design utilized randomized blocks treatments were composed of two types in a split plot scheme the first treatment variable was four watering levels and the second was the eight sugarcane varieties totaling 4 8 32 treatments irrigation was administered at100 75 and 50 of the potential water demand wdp of the varieties and a variable level 75 with a final volume similar to the 75 treatment but variable in time 125 100 75 and 50 was included the eight sugarcane varieties included seven brazilian ctc15 ctc17 rb867515 rb92579 rb931011 rb966928 iac 5000 and one south african nco376 we also considered an additional factor four sampling times of the plants specifically for the ratoon crop 1 st ratoon where 25 of the plants were cut at intervals of about 90 days 2 3 irrigation each of the 384 experimental plots was irrigated individually controlled through the opening and closing of micro taps installed in a control panel irrigation was by drip with self compensating emitters anti siphons and ant drainage each dripper had a flow rate of 1 6 l h 1 and five emitters per experimental plot were installed spaced at 0 20 m thus totaling a flow of 8 l h 1 per plot drip tube feeding used a microtube network irrigation was managed according to soil moisture matric potential to restore the volume of water consumed by each variety individually soil tension data were obtained from 24 tensiometer batteries 3 24 72 tensiometers units installed in the plots that received the l100 irrigation treatment reference level field capacity the installation depth of each of the tensiometer batteries was 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 and 0 4 to 0 6 m the interval between the readings was no more than 2 days and after obtaining the soil water potential data œàm the average value was calculated between replications thus obtaining a pressure value for each layer and for each of the varieties these values were used to estimate moisture Œ∏ in m3 m 3 through the model proposed by van genuchten 1980 eq 1 1 Œ∏ œà m Œ∏ r Œ∏ s Œ∏ r 1 Œ± œà m n m where Œ∏ œàm volumetric moisture in m3 m 3 Œ∏r soil residual volumetric

and œàm matric potential in kpa the reference irrigation depth 100 of each variety was calculated independently and the irrigation time necessary for the actual soil moisture to be replenishment at field capacity every other day was calculated for each variety fig 2 for the other irrigation treatments 50 75 and 75 the fractions of the irrigation time l100 that needed to be used for each treatment were calculated before the imposition of irrigation reduction plants were given 100 irrigation until establishment of the crop this phase lasted 110 days during the plant crop and 44 days in the ratoon crop 2 4 biomass accumulation and partitioning for growing cycle 1 plant canes the total biomass was measured only by harvesting time which was done 12 months after seedlings were transplanted for growing cycle 2 we measured the accumulation and partitioning of total aerial biomass in four sampling periods cutting the plants each of which was performed every 90 days after the harvesting plant cane cycle the plants were cut at ground level five aerial biomass partitions of the plants were analyzed leaves sheaths stalks pointers and dead stalks the top of a sugarcane plant was defined as the portion of the stalk above a breaking point where the internode in maturation starts internode formation this point was easily identified by the ease of manual breakage in addition to the follow up of the immature stem samples were also taken from the pointers of the plants the leaves and the sheaths in expansion the fraction corresponding to dead stalks consisted of obviously dead stalks and those considered as unproductive specifically for the first cut due to the absence of dead stalks and pointers we took only the other fractions leaves sheaths and stalks after each cutting of the above ground biomass the samples were packed in paper bags and their fresh mass was measured followed by determination of the dry mass after drying in an oven with forced air circulation at a temperature of 65 c until constant weight was reached 2 5 water use efficiency wue the water use efficiency was determined from the accumulated dry biomass of the aerial part kg and the water transpired by the crop during each growing season m3 eq 2 2 wue total aboveground biomass accumulated total water transpired 2 6 determination of sugar in the total aerial biomass the method of consecana 2006 was used for determining total recoverable sugar trs at the end of both growing cycles plant cane and first ratoon the fresh stalks were broken up and homogenized obtaining a representative sample of each plot a 500 g aliquot of each homogenate was subjected to a pressure of 25 mpa for 60 s using a hydraulic press ma098 cana marconi after pressing both the juice and the wet cake were used to measure the trs to the juice was added 6 0 g of an aluminum based clarifying mixture which after stirring and filtering the filtrate was read in a polarimeter autopol i rudolph to determine the trs content as described in consecana 2006 the ratio of trs to total dry biomass yields the sugar content which is commonly known as the harvest index hi 2 7 statistical analysis the experimental plot contained two plantings that were measured individually and the sum of these two values was representative of the total plot sampled before performing the analysis of variance the experimental data were subjected to the shapiro wilk and levene tests both p 0 05 to verify residual normality and homoscedasticity respectively after this step anova was performed with variables having significant f values at least 0 05 probability their means submitted to the scott knott test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water demand accumulation and partitioning of dry biomass above ground water consumption of the sugarcane varieties both plant cane and 1 st ratoon cycles are presented in fig 3 the average potential water demand ranged from 914 to 1025 mm for plant cane and 1 st ratoon cycles respectively the difference between the highest and lowest consumption varieties was 355 plant cane and 450 mm 1 st ratoon there was no significant difference p 0 05 between the two crop cycles for the accumulation of total dry biomass above ground tdba with the mean value obtained for both periods being 5954 g m 2 table 2 considering the effect of irrigation on tdba we verified a highly significant p 0 01 effect within the cycles showing an increase of dry biomass as the volume of water available to the varieties increased the mean value for the 50 wdp condition was 4454 g m 2 which represented only 60 of tdba verified in the treatment without water restriction wdp of 100 which was 7394 g m 2 as for treatments of 75 and 75 these produced intermediate yields with values of 6321 and 5646 g m 2 respectively in comparing the irrigation responses of the varieties we observed highly significant effects p 0 01 and interaction between irrigation levels and cycles was verified over the two cultivation cycles of the experimental period we found that the ctc17 variety was the most productive with an average tdba value of 7062 g m 2 38 higher than that presented by variety rb966928 when we extrapolated the tdba values to the usual unit for evaluation of yield we found that the productivity of ctc17 was 85 t ha 1 wdp 100 which according to van heerden et al 2010 is close to the potential maximum yield of the crop 88 t ha 1 dry basis we also observed that ctc15 rb867515 and rb92579 defined a second group of tdba production of the four that were created from the categorization with the scott knott average test these varieties had yields of 6450 6450 and 6400 g m 2 respectively the variety rb931011 which alone formed the third group and the varieties nco376 iac 5000 and rb966928 which comprised the fourth and last group had yields of 5887 5483 5339 and 5371 g m 2 respectively fig 4 which shows the interaction between irrigation and variety in addition we also verified that the ctc17 and south african nco376 varieties were the only ones with statistically equal yields for irrigation treatments of 100 and 75 of wdp the cultivar iac5000 had the lowest yields of tdba and the dry biomass productivity for this material was directly proportional to the volume of water demand in the tdba comparison of the two crop cycles fig 5 we observed that only the varieties rb966928 and rb931011 did not show statistical differences p 0 05 between cycles in the 1 st ratoon cycle in which the tdba was measured over four sampling periods fig 6 we observed that the effect of irrigation was not verified only in the 1 st cut with three probable causes i the period of 44 days after the cutting of the plant cane during which unrestricted irrigation was allowed in every experiment for plants to recover ii the milder temperatures recorded in the cut off month and iii the high coefficient of variation 36 5 that may have prevented seeing a statistical difference as for the other cuts there was a significant difference between irrigation levels even more pronounced at the 3rd evaluation when the growth occurred more sharply for the cuts with a statistical difference p 0 05 tdba values generally followed the decreasing sequence 100 75 75 50 the exception was the 2nd cut which showed an inversion between the irrigation levels of 75 and 75 this probably occurred because the 75 treatment only became equal to 50 after the 2nd cut this procedure was adopted in order to match the volumes applied for the 75 and 75 irrigation levels as detailed in item 2 1 the ctc17 variety was the most productive which fact had already been verified in the joint analysis of the two crop cycles however the highest yields for this cultivar during the 1st ratoon cycle were only verified after the 3rd cut in the 1st and 2nd cuts the highest yields were of the varieties ctc15 and rb867515 respectively iac 5000 was the least productive variety returning the lowest yields over the four sampling periods in the analysis of the two crop cycles however rb966929 had the smallest yields tdba was partitioned in the four sampling times along the 1 st ratoon cycle and the biomass ratios were allocated among the different structures that make up the plant table 3 in the first cut there was a greater allocation of dry matter in the leaves which received about 48 of all photoassimilates produced up to 106 days after cutting the plant cane the sheaths and stalks received 29 and 22 respectively according to machado et al 1982 during the initial stage of sugarcane development leaf growth is the most important factor in the accumulation of biomass showing preference in the partition of dry matter above ground rather than in stalks the varieties na 56 79 and cb 41 14 showed greater than 70 accumulation of dry matter in leaves up to 100 days after planting in our study iac 5000 gave results most similar to those of machado et al 1982 with a greater proportions of leaves in relation to biomass accumulated up to 106 days higher than the other varieties under all conditions of water availability 61 contrary conditions were verified for rb966928 in comparing the effects of irrigation on the leaf fractions and adopting the 100 treatment as representing the potential partitioning of the varieties for that age the lowest irrigation level 50 had a similar proportion to that of the reference with the remaining treatments being 9 and 11 smaller when compared to the adopted standard 100 this low variability in the leaf effect has already been discussed and is probably a function of the establishment period of the crop shortly after the cane harvest the milder temperatures during the first sampling and the high coefficient of variation in this phase with regard to the 2nd cut there were two other components of the plant that were included as representative of the tdba the pointers 18 and the dead or unproductive tillers 11 there was a significant decrease in the leaf fraction in the second cut compared to the first with a general average of 15 and there was a comparable increase in the stalks from 22 in the first cut to 45 in the second among the varieties rb966929 had the highest proportion in the stalks and iac 5000 in the leaf fraction regarding the effect of irrigation on the five fractions those plants grown without water restriction had the highest proportions of biomass in the stalks while we verified an inverse behavior for the other components of the plant for the 3rd and 4th cuts we observed a gradual reduction in the biomass of the sheath pointers and dead tillers which were reallocated to the leaves and stalks specifically in relation to the leaves we noticed that in the fourth cut there was an increase in the proportion of biomass directed to this component in relation to the previous cuts where a decreasing gradient had been observed 3 2 water use efficiency and harvest index water use efficiency for the sugarcane varieties under various conditions of soil water availability and cropping cycles plant cane and 1 st ratoon ranged from 5 1 6 6 kg m 3 with an average for all experimental periods of 5 71 kg m 3 also none of the factors studied showed any isolated effects table 4 in relation to the combined factors cycle vs irrigation levels cycle vs genotype irrigation levels vs genotype and cycle vs irrigation levels vs genotype we observed correlation between irrigation level and genotype p 0 05 with varieties ctc15 ctc17 and nco376 showing different responses for the irrigation levels fig 7 these three varieties also showed a significant increase p 0 05 in water use efficiency wue when water availability was restricted to complement the analysis of biomass partitioning we also measured the total recoverable sugar allocation under different conditions of soil water availability which is known as the harvest index hi we found that the hi did not respond to irrigation levels p 0 05 and the same result was observed for the two crop cycles with a mean of 26 6 table 4 statistical differences were observed among the genotypes however with rb966928 having 30 9 of its dry weight represented by sucrose fig 8 nco376 rb931011 and iac5000 had the lowest percentages with values of 25 0 25 0 and 25 4 respectively the intermediate hi values of ctc15 26 4 rb867515 26 6 rb92579 26 9 and ctc17 27 0 were similar to the experimental average 4 discussion several studies have been conducted on the effects of water stress on the accumulation and partitioning of biomass robertson et al 1996a singels et al 2000 inman bamber et al 2002 barbosa et al 2015 leite et al 2016 and also on how efficiently water is used by sugarcane singh et al 2007 silva et al 2013a b olivier and singels 2015 however there are few studies that used this approach with different genotypes and growing seasons under conditions where soil water was strictly controlled in this research we used large volume plots protected from rain to investigate the impact of water restriction on eight commercial sugarcane varieties seven brazilian and one south african during two growing seasons plant cane and 1 st ratoon 4 1 water consumption biomass accumulation and partitioning we observed that the irrigation depths accumulated during the two growth cycles were within the usual range for this crop which according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 and steduto et al 2012 can range from 800 to 2500 mm in field conditions the only variety with demand outside this range was the south african nco376 specifically for the plant cane cycle however the plants were protected from rain under a plastic roof which reduced evapotranspiration by about 30 fernandes et al 2003 m√∂ller and assouline 2007 fern√°ndez et al 2010 with regard to the total accumulated biomass aboveground tdba we showed that water restriction reduced biomass yield of all sugarcane varieties with reductions of 14 5 23 6 and 39 8 for the fractions of 75 75 and 50 of the wdp respectively despite the water restrictions the mean tdba 5954 g m 2 remained within the ranges obtained in similar studies conducted with irrigated cane inman bamber et al 2002 silva 2009 and ferreira et al 2015 during plant cane and ratoon cycles the values obtained by these authors ranged from 5000 g m 2 for the australian varieties q96 and q117 to 6800 g m 2 for the brazilian rb92579 and rb98710 in our study considering only yields after full irrigation 100 wdp for which we observed a mean of 7394 g m 2 we can infer that this difference may be a result of varietal characteristics and the high frequency and uniformity of the irrigation system in the analysis of only the intermediate irrigation levels 75 and 75 we observed that although the plants conducted under these water regimes had similar water replenishment volumes there was a yield difference between them of about 12 the probable cause for this was that the 75 treatment during the stalk growth phase was more stressful than the 75 treatment this was also observed by rossler et al 2013 and suggests that the elongation phase of the stalks is more sensitive to water stress our results indicate that the brazilian variety ctc17 and the south african nco376 were the only ones to produce high biomass yields comparable to those reached under full irrigation when grown with mild water stress however a caveat must be stated that despite receiving restricted volumes of water the plants in this study were irrigated with high frequency an unusual situation in most sugarcane fields which generally irrigate no more than once every five days another fact verified in this study was the non observance of the predominance of higher values of tdba in a single growing season crop cycles since yield values alternated between plant cane and 1 st ratoon for most genotypes regardless of the irrigation regimen table 2 this result although relevant for breeding programs and simulation models of crop growth is of secondary importance within the genotype vs environment interactions because soil type climatic factors and soil water availability can all affect cane growth and productivity to a greater extent jackson and hogarth 1992 liu et al 2016 as regards the partitioning of biomass it is known that it is a consequence of the duration of growth of the leaves sheaths stalks tillers and roots and of the source sink relationship established between these and the plant s environment mckinley et al 2016 in this study we found no marked variability in biomass allocation due to irrigation levels particularly at the 4th sampling indicating that these sugarcane varieties are not very responsive in the different allocation of photoassimilates this suggests that the partitioning of biomass is an inherent characteristic of genotype which is in agreement with singels et al 2000 inman bamber et al 2002 silva and costa 2004 and singels 2011 however our full irrigation 100 treatment resulted in the smallest proportion of leaves with a comparable increase in the stalks fraction this preferential relationship became more obvious in the final stage of the sugarcane cycle due to the maturation process which supports a strong drain attributed to the stalks marcelis et al 2004 mccormick et al 2009 that has its magnitude determined by environmental temperature and water availability the stalks obviously are the main commercial component of the sugarcane plant and the value in our study for this fraction averaged 0 53 which is low compared to published results robertson et al 1996b inman bamber et al 2002 silva et al 2014 in a review by singels et al 2005 these authors showed great variability for this component with values ranging from 0 59 to 0 91 according to them the discrepancy in the results is due to different measurement methods and biomass determinations in the present study we were careful not to collect senescent leaves sheaths or tillers that would eventually detach from the cane plants during the cycle so we performed three pre harvestings of dry dead components throughout each growing season storing them properly for later accounting in the final biomass it is not clear what promoted the lower fractionation of the stalk component but we suspect that the irrigation method may have been the cause the high frequency of irrigation in our experiments may have promoted greater development of vegetative structures which acted as sinks slowing the stems growth 4 2 water use efficiency wue and harvest index three of the genotypes evaluated in this study ctc15 ctc17 and nco376 showed improvement in wue under mild water restriction 75 of wdp which proves the hypothesis behind this work that there are sugarcane varieties that when grown under controlled water deficit conditions produce as well as plants with full irrigation 100 of wdp the varieties ctc17 and nco376 for example subjected to a 75 of dwp water restriction did not show significant differences in biomass compared to plants given full irrigation fig 4 we believe that the high performance of varieties ctc15 ctc17 and nco376 results from the fact that these genotypes when cultivated under moderate water stress induced physiological changes such as only a discrete closure of the stomata which reduced transpiration more than photosynthesis and consequently increased wue this conclusion is supported by the findings of kang et al 2000 and cantore et al 2014 who investigated wue in potato and maize respectively under conditions of controlled water deficit however we understand that parameters of physiological order can endorse this illation although our results clearly confirmed the existence of sugarcane varieties able to use water more efficiently the range of wues was relatively narrow ranging from 5 1 6 6 kg m 3 dry basis which is in agreement with steduto et al 2007 that improvements in wue could only come from genetic changes altering the photosynthetic efficiency of sugarcane however we believe that more studies of diverse genotypes under controlled irrigation conditions would help to identify genotypes that use water more efficiently and contribute progenies for breeding programs however these types of studies are expensive and as far as we know basnayake et al 2012 and liu et al 2016 have been the only ones to use an approach similar to ours to evaluate the effect of water restriction on sugarcane clones under field conditions as for hi which in this study is restricted to only the fraction of sucrose present in the total biomass above ground we obtained an average value of 26 6 which is in agreement with doorenbos and kassam 1979 who showed 20 30 sucrose in the dry biomass similar results were obtained by thangavelu 2006 who studied the sugar yield of 30 sugarcane clones belonging to distinct maturation groups in southern india we did not observe significant effects of growth seasons and irrigation regimens on this variable table 4 particularly for irrigation levels this behavior diverges from those reported by inman bamber and smith 2005 and inman bamber et al 2008 where these authors argue that there was influence of the irrigation management adopted on the sucrose content in the final biomass the disagreement in our findings probably stems from differences in irrigation frequency of the plants under water restriction in the study by inman bamber et al 2008 the water restriction treatment only allowed irrigation when the growth rate of the plants reached a fraction of the leaf growth rate of the full irrigation treatment without deficit we believe that this criterion subjected cane plants to restrictive irrigation levels with an intensity higher than that allowed in our study which provided water to the plants at average intervals of two days even at reduced volumes with regard to the differences in sucrose content seen in our study this may be due to the fact that the imposed water restrictions were not sufficient to attenuate the strong potential of the leaves to act as a sink this conclusion may be supported from the dynamics of photoassimilate allocation by this organ from the four harvestings of the plants during the of the 1 st ratoon cycle table 3 where the accumulation of dry matter in the leaves increased again after the third cut at the expense of the stalks where it continued to decline this evidence coupled with the high temperatures recorded during the maturation stage of the crop supports our conclusions which are in line with those reported by glasziou and gayler 1972 and inman bamber et al 2008 in addition to the results from the growth cycle and irrigation level data we determined the effect of sugarcane genotype on hi in which the cultivar rb966928 had a sucrose content equivalent to 30 9 of its dry weight fig 8 since hi is a measure of the transport efficiency of photoassimilates to the stalks the high hi achieved by rb966928 suggested that this cultivar had a higher conversion efficiency than the others however since hi is a relative measure this can lead to misjudgments if the variety chosen by the farmer is solely based on this information rather than combining it with stalk yield for example rb966928 which had the highest hi among the eight tested varieties ranked only 5th in terms of gross sugar yield per hectare since the production of stalks by this variety was not as impressive as the accumulation of sucrose this result added to what has been observed in studies on hi conducted in other crops such as rice huang et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 and maize lorenz et al 2010 suggest that the upper limit of hi has probably already been reached and that future gains in sugar yield will have to be obtained by increases in biomass production this can be inferred from the low variability of hi in the varieties evaluated in this study even though they were developed at different times for example despite having the highest stalks yields the ctc17 cultivar launched in 2008 showed only a modest improvement over the nco376 south african cultivar developed in 1955 for sugarcane however the increase in sugar yield per unit area associated with increases in the yield of total biomass above ground serves two notable purposes for the sugar alcohol and bioenergy industries i the increase of sugar and ethanol productivity of the first generation and ii the increase in biomass for use in second generation ethanol production and in the co generation of electricity 5 conclusions we investigated the influence of different soil water availability conditions on the accumulation and partition of total biomass above ground as well as the efficiency of water use in eight commercial varieties of sugarcane our results indicate that sugarcane biomass yield is reduced by lack of sufficient water but that combining moderate decreases in irrigation water with varieties that are more tolerant to water deprivation can afford savings in irrigation cost without sacrificing sugar and biomass yield the brazilian varieties ctc15 and ctc17 in addition to the south african nco376 increased their water use efficiency when conducted under water replacement levels equal to 75 of the usual water demand without compromising biomass yield there were no major changes in biomass allocation under controlled water deficit but some of the varieties studied showed variable biomass partitioning rb966928 for example had the largest biomass fraction allocated in the stalks 0 59 and the iac5000 variety had the lowest 0 51 we verified that under controlled drip irrigation the harvest index hi for sucrose was not affected by water stress the observed variability was attributed to the genetic inheritance from traditional breeding programs which have not been very successful in increasing yield over the past several decades in conclusion based on our findings it should be possible to increase the sugar yield per unit area in sugarcane cultivation by increasing biomass productivity using highly efficient irrigation methods to minimize water stress during

11004,studies of sugarcane varieties grown under water restrictive conditions are necessary because climate changes may result in insufficient rain for agriculture and selecting or breeding drought tolerant cultivars will become more and more important this study aimed to quantify the accumulation and partitioning of biomass as well as water use efficiency of commercial sugarcane varieties under different soil water availability conditions throughout the growing season the study was conducted during two cropping cycles in southeast brazil 22 7 s 47 6 w four soil moisture availability regimens were set up to provide 100 75 75 and 50 of the water demand of eight commercial varieties of sugarcane ctc15 ctc17 rb867515 rb92579 rb931011 rb966928 iac5000 and nco376 the total aboveground biomass was measured in both crop cycles our results indicate that two brazilian varieties ctc15 and ctc17 and one south african variety nco376 canegrow dssat reference increased their water use efficiency when grown under an irrigation deficit of 75 of normal without yielding less biomass we did not observe any change in sucrose content under controlled water deficits however the studied varieties showed different biomass partitioning rb966928 had the largest biomass fraction allocated in the stalks 0 59 while iac5000 showed the lowest fraction 0 51 we verified that the harvest index for sucrose was not altered by reduced irrigation but that its variability was attributed to the genotype inherited from traditional breeding programs thus we conclude from these results that increased sugar yield per unit area is only possible nowadays by increasing sugarcane biomass productivity under highly efficient irrigation conditions to minimize the loss of yield from water stress keywords saccharum sp growth analysis water deficit water use efficiency harvest index 1 introduction sugarcane saccharum spp is an important commercial crop throughout the world being the source of about 75 of the world s production of table sugar sucrose commodity research bureau 2015 demand for sugar has grown largely in the past decade because of its use in the production of ethanol as a renewable fuel and for co generation of electricity from residual biomass it is cultivated in more than 120 countries fao 2016 with brazil being the leading producer with a cultivated area of approximately nine million hectares producing almost 633 million tons of sugarcane in the 2017 2018 harvest conab 2018 sugarcane has a high demand for water and drought can seriously retard its development lakshmanan and robinson 2014 silva et al 2018 according to several authors robertson et al 1999 ramesh 2000 basnayake et al 2012 gentile et al 2015 productivity losses can reach up to 60 depending on the magnitude and duration of the water stress which makes it impossible to grow sugarcane commercially in regions with uneven rainfall in brazil sugarcane is concentrated in the south central and northeast regions of the country where it depends on rain fed or salvation irrigation at planting time or after harvesting however farmers have expanded the crop to other regions of the country looking for lower land costs which has subjected the crop to climatic instability these areas with periods of decreased rainfall or uneven distribution may reduce sugarcane productivity or even make it impracticable in view of these problems it is necessary to study new methods of irrigation technology to retain economic productivity according to dalri and cruz 2002 irrigation has always been the preferred agricultural method for generating higher yields better product quality and security against drought providing crops with a sort of weather insurance however water for irrigation is limited and it must be carefully managed to minimize waste and to reduce the cost in order to maintain the economic sustainability of the system silva et al 2007 mansour et al 2017 among the tools available to minimize water use for agriculture deficit irrigation is a good option since several authors cirillo et al 2014 davies et al 2016 bell et al 2018 comas et al 2019 have concurred that its use not only reduces water demand in certain crops but also allows farmers to control crop quality this technique can be used most efficiently with drip irrigation el hendawy et al 2008 like other species sugarcane responds differently to a water deficit during different phenological phases studies conducted by robertson and donaldson 1998 inman bamber and smith 2005 and olivier et al 2006 clearly showed that reducing irrigation during the maturation phase saved water and increased the sucrose content for this reason it is common practice in irrigated crops to suspend irrigation before harvesting obtaining as an additional advantage a reduction in moisture content and biomass that will be taken to the sugar mill and lower transportation costs inman bamber and smith 2005 there are also opportunities to save water in the early stages of sugarcane growth roberts et al 1990 robertson et al 1999 and machado et al 2009 a period of water deficit in the early stage of the crop results in compensatory growth of the plants when normal water levels are restored in contrast to the initial and final stages of sugarcane development the intermediate stages where the stem elongates and the plants leaf out have not shown a clear response to irrigation chaudhry and leme 1996 pene and edi 1999 silva and costa 2004 and rossler et al 2013 for example wiedenfeld 2000 did not see any reduction in the fresh stalk yield when irrigation was suspended for six weeks during the growing season it is evident that there is a wide range of sensitivity to water deficit for sugarcane and it is probable that production loss due to drought varies among genotypes inman bamber and smith 2005 silva et al 2007 and silva et al 2013a b thus comparative studies of the responses of different varieties to water restriction are essential good data are needed to understand the growth variables of sugarcane and the allocation of dry matter among the different plant structures with the purpose of identifying the most efficient conversion of water to biomass in this work we conducted a controlled experiment to investigate the effects of soil water availability on the accumulation and partitioning of biomass in eight commercial sugarcane varieties seven brazilian and one south african over two growing seasons plant cane and first ratoon aiming to determine the relative sensitivity of these varieties to soil water restriction conditions and the most efficient use of irrigation water 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and general data experiments were conducted between february 2013 and february 2015 in piracicaba s√£o paulo located in southwestern brazil 22 42 32 s 47 37 45 w elevation 546 m during two growing cycles of sugarcane plant cane and 1 st ratoon under conditions that prevented rainwater from reaching the plants a total of 384 plots were cultivated each with a soil volume of 0 33 m3 and dimensions of 1 04 0 41 x 0 76 m length width and depth filled

characteristics of the soil are given in table 1 each plot was planted at 0 52 m spacing with two sugarcane seedlings clumps as the experimental units in this study during the growing seasons plants were constantly inspected and pests were controlled with thiametoxan 1000 g ha 1 triflumuron 0 8 l ha 1 and abamectin 0 4 l ha 1 for the control of aphids caterpillars and mites respectively weeding was done by hand plants were fertilized monthly through fertigation and leaf spraying with totals applied during the cycles of plant cane 93 kg n 92 kg k 2 kg b 0 3 kg cu 0 6 kg mn 0 7 kg mo and 6 2

minimum and average air temperature and solar radiation were made with sensors installed inside the greenhouse pyranometers and vaisala sensors with variable height accompanying sugarcane canopy growth for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto we used the method of priestley and taylor 1972 because wind readings were not necessary the meteorological data are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design experiments were done in triplicate and the design utilized randomized blocks treatments were composed of two types in a split plot scheme the first treatment variable was four watering levels and the second was the eight sugarcane varieties totaling 4 8 32 treatments irrigation was administered at100 75 and 50 of the potential water demand wdp of the varieties and a variable level 75 with a final volume similar to the 75 treatment but variable in time 125 100 75 and 50 was included the eight sugarcane varieties included seven brazilian ctc15 ctc17 rb867515 rb92579 rb931011 rb966928 iac 5000 and one south african nco376 we also considered an additional factor four sampling times of the plants specifically for the ratoon crop 1 st ratoon where 25 of the plants were cut at intervals of about 90 days 2 3 irrigation each of the 384 experimental plots was irrigated individually controlled through the opening and closing of micro taps installed in a control panel irrigation was by drip with self compensating emitters anti siphons and ant drainage each dripper had a flow rate of 1 6 l h 1 and five emitters per experimental plot were installed spaced at 0 20 m thus totaling a flow of 8 l h 1 per plot drip tube feeding used a microtube network irrigation was managed according to soil moisture matric potential to restore the volume of water consumed by each variety individually soil tension data were obtained from 24 tensiometer batteries 3 24 72 tensiometers units installed in the plots that received the l100 irrigation treatment reference level field capacity the installation depth of each of the tensiometer batteries was 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 and 0 4 to 0 6 m the interval between the readings was no more than 2 days and after obtaining the soil water potential data œàm the average value was calculated between replications thus obtaining a pressure value for each layer and for each of the varieties these values were used to

and œàm matric potential in kpa the reference irrigation depth 100 of each variety was calculated independently and the irrigation time necessary for the actual soil moisture to be replenishment at field capacity every other day was calculated for each variety fig 2 for the other irrigation treatments 50 75 and 75 the fractions of the irrigation time l100 that needed to be used for each treatment were calculated before the imposition of irrigation reduction plants were given 100 irrigation until establishment of the crop this phase lasted 110 days during the plant crop and 44 days in the ratoon crop 2 4 biomass accumulation and partitioning for growing cycle 1 plant canes the total biomass was measured only by harvesting time which was done 12 months after seedlings were transplanted for growing cycle 2 we measured the accumulation and partitioning of total aerial biomass in four sampling periods cutting the plants each of which was performed every 90 days after the harvesting plant cane cycle the plants were cut at ground level five aerial biomass partitions of the plants were analyzed leaves sheaths stalks pointers and dead stalks the top of a sugarcane plant was defined as the portion of the stalk above a breaking point where the internode in maturation starts internode formation this point was easily identified by the ease of manual breakage in addition to the follow up of the immature stem samples were also taken from the pointers of the plants the leaves and the sheaths in expansion the fraction corresponding to dead stalks consisted of obviously dead stalks and those considered as unproductive specifically for the first cut due to the absence of dead stalks and pointers we took only the other fractions leaves sheaths and stalks after each cutting of the above ground biomass the samples were packed in paper bags and their fresh mass was measured followed by determination of the dry mass after drying in an oven with forced air circulation at a temperature of 65 c until constant weight was reached 2 5 water use efficiency wue the water use efficiency was determined from the accumulated dry biomass of the aerial part kg and the water transpired by the crop during each growing season m3 eq 2 2 wue total aboveground biomass accumulated total water transpired 2 6 determination of sugar in the total aerial biomass the method of consecana 2006 was used for determining total recoverable sugar trs at the end of both growing cycles plant cane and first ratoon the fresh stalks were broken up and homogenized obtaining a representative sample of each plot a 500 g aliquot of each homogenate was subjected to a pressure of 25 mpa for 60 s using a hydraulic press ma098 cana marconi after pressing both the juice and the wet cake were used to measure the trs to the juice was added 6 0 g of an aluminum based clarifying mixture which after stirring and filtering the filtrate was read in a polarimeter autopol i rudolph to determine the trs content as described in consecana 2006 the ratio of trs to total dry biomass yields the sugar content which is commonly known as the harvest index hi 2 7 statistical analysis the experimental plot contained two plantings that were measured individually and the sum of these two values was representative of the total plot sampled before performing the analysis of variance the experimental data were subjected to the shapiro wilk and levene tests both p 0 05 to verify residual normality and homoscedasticity respectively after this step anova was performed with variables having significant f values at least 0 05 probability their means submitted to the scott knott test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water demand accumulation and partitioning of dry biomass above ground water consumption of the sugarcane varieties both plant cane and 1 st ratoon cycles are presented in fig 3 the average potential water demand ranged from 914 to 1025 mm for plant cane and 1 st ratoon cycles respectively the difference between the highest and lowest consumption varieties was 355 plant cane and 450 mm 1 st ratoon there was no significant difference p 0 05 between the two crop cycles for the accumulation of total dry biomass above ground tdba with the mean value obtained for both periods being 5954 g m 2 table 2 considering the effect of irrigation on tdba we verified a highly significant p 0 01 effect within the cycles showing an increase of dry biomass as the volume of water available to the varieties increased the mean value for the 50 wdp condition was 4454 g m 2 which represented only 60 of tdba verified in the treatment without water restriction wdp of 100 which was 7394 g m 2 as for treatments of 75 and 75 these produced intermediate yields with values of 6321 and 5646 g m 2 respectively in comparing the irrigation responses of the varieties we observed highly significant effects p 0 01 and interaction between irrigation levels and cycles was verified over the two cultivation cycles of the experimental period we found that the ctc17 variety was the most productive with an average tdba value of 7062 g m 2 38 higher than that presented by variety rb966928 when we extrapolated the tdba values to the usual unit for evaluation of yield we found that the productivity of ctc17 was 85 t ha 1 wdp 100 which according to van heerden et al 2010 is close to the potential maximum yield of the crop 88 t ha 1 dry basis we also observed that ctc15 rb867515 and rb92579 defined a second group of tdba production of the four that were created from the categorization with the scott knott average test these varieties had yields of 6450 6450 and 6400 g m 2 respectively the variety rb931011 which alone formed the third group and the varieties nco376 iac 5000 and rb966928 which comprised the fourth and last group had yields of 5887 5483 5339 and 5371 g m 2 respectively fig 4 which shows the interaction between irrigation and variety in addition we also verified that the ctc17 and south african nco376 varieties were the only ones with statistically equal yields for irrigation treatments of 100 and 75 of wdp the cultivar iac5000 had the lowest yields of tdba and the dry biomass productivity for this material was directly proportional to the volume of water demand in the tdba comparison of the two crop cycles fig 5 we observed that only the varieties rb966928 and rb931011 did not show statistical differences p 0 05 between cycles in the 1 st ratoon cycle in which the tdba was measured over four sampling periods fig 6 we observed that the effect of irrigation was not verified only in the 1 st cut with three probable causes i the period of 44 days after the cutting of the plant cane during which unrestricted irrigation was allowed in every experiment for plants to recover ii the milder temperatures recorded in the cut off month and iii the high coefficient of variation 36 5 that may have prevented seeing a statistical difference as for the other cuts there was a significant difference between irrigation levels even more pronounced at the 3rd evaluation when the growth occurred more sharply for the cuts with a statistical difference p 0 05 tdba values generally followed the decreasing sequence 100 75 75 50 the exception was the 2nd cut which showed an inversion between the irrigation levels of 75 and 75 this probably occurred because the 75 treatment only became equal to 50 after the 2nd cut this procedure was adopted in order to match the volumes applied for the 75 and 75 irrigation levels as detailed in item 2 1 the ctc17 variety was the most productive which fact had already been verified in the joint analysis of the two crop cycles however the highest yields for this cultivar during the 1st ratoon cycle were only verified after the 3rd cut in the 1st and 2nd cuts the highest yields were of the varieties ctc15 and rb867515 respectively iac 5000 was the least productive variety returning the lowest yields over the four sampling periods in the analysis of the two crop cycles however rb966929 had the smallest yields tdba was partitioned in the four sampling times along the 1 st ratoon cycle and the biomass ratios were allocated among the different structures that make up the plant table 3 in the first cut there was a greater allocation of dry matter in the leaves which received about 48 of all photoassimilates produced up to 106 days after cutting the plant cane the sheaths and stalks received 29 and 22 respectively according to machado et al 1982 during the initial stage of sugarcane development leaf growth is the most important factor in the accumulation of biomass showing preference in the partition of dry matter above ground rather than in stalks the varieties na 56 79 and cb 41 14 showed greater than 70 accumulation of dry matter in leaves up to 100 days after planting in our study iac 5000 gave results most similar to those of machado et al 1982 with a greater proportions of leaves in relation to biomass accumulated up to 106 days higher than the other varieties under all conditions of water availability 61 contrary conditions were verified for rb966928 in comparing the effects of irrigation on the leaf fractions and adopting the 100 treatment as representing the potential partitioning of the varieties for that age the lowest irrigation level 50 had a similar proportion to that of the reference with the remaining treatments being 9 and 11 smaller when compared to the adopted standard 100 this low variability in the leaf effect has already been discussed and is probably a function of the establishment period of the crop shortly after the cane harvest the milder temperatures during the first sampling and the high coefficient of variation in this phase with regard to the 2nd cut there were two other components of the plant that were included as representative of the tdba the pointers 18 and the dead or unproductive tillers 11 there was a significant decrease in the leaf fraction in the second cut compared to the first with a general average of 15 and there was a comparable increase in the stalks from 22 in the first cut to 45 in the second among the varieties rb966929 had the highest proportion in the stalks and iac 5000 in the leaf fraction regarding the effect of irrigation on the five fractions those plants grown without water restriction had the highest proportions of biomass in the stalks while we verified an inverse behavior for the other components of the plant for the 3rd and 4th cuts we observed a gradual reduction in the biomass of the sheath pointers and dead tillers which were reallocated to the leaves and stalks specifically in relation to the leaves we noticed that in the fourth cut there was an increase in the proportion of biomass directed to this component in relation to the previous cuts where a decreasing gradient had been observed 3 2 water use efficiency and harvest index water use efficiency for the sugarcane varieties under various conditions of soil water availability and cropping cycles plant cane and 1 st ratoon ranged from 5 1 6 6 kg m 3 with an average for all experimental periods of 5 71 kg m 3 also none of the factors studied showed any isolated effects table 4 in relation to the combined factors cycle vs irrigation levels cycle vs genotype irrigation levels vs genotype and cycle vs irrigation levels vs genotype we observed correlation between irrigation level and genotype p 0 05 with varieties ctc15 ctc17 and nco376 showing different responses for the irrigation levels fig 7 these three varieties also showed a significant increase p 0 05 in water use efficiency wue when water availability was restricted to complement the analysis of biomass partitioning we also measured the total recoverable sugar allocation under different conditions of soil water availability which is known as the harvest index hi we found that the hi did not respond to irrigation levels p 0 05 and the same result was observed for the two crop cycles with a mean of 26 6 table 4 statistical differences were observed among the genotypes however with rb966928 having 30 9 of its dry weight represented by sucrose fig 8 nco376 rb931011 and iac5000 had the lowest percentages with values of 25 0 25 0 and 25 4 respectively the intermediate hi values of ctc15 26 4 rb867515 26 6 rb92579 26 9 and ctc17 27 0 were similar to the experimental average 4 discussion several studies have been conducted on the effects of water stress on the accumulation and partitioning of biomass robertson et al 1996a singels et al 2000 inman bamber et al 2002 barbosa et al 2015 leite et al 2016 and also on how efficiently water is used by sugarcane singh et al 2007 silva et al 2013a b olivier and singels 2015 however there are few studies that used this approach with different genotypes and growing seasons under conditions where soil water was strictly controlled in this research we used large volume plots protected from rain to investigate the impact of water restriction on eight commercial sugarcane varieties seven brazilian and one south african during two growing seasons plant cane and 1 st ratoon 4 1 water consumption biomass accumulation and partitioning we observed that the irrigation depths accumulated during the two growth cycles were within the usual range for this crop which according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 and steduto et al 2012 can range from 800 to 2500 mm in field conditions the only variety with demand outside this range was the south african nco376 specifically for the plant cane cycle however the plants were protected from rain under a plastic roof which reduced evapotranspiration by about 30 fernandes et al 2003 m√∂ller and assouline 2007 fern√°ndez et al 2010 with regard to the total accumulated biomass aboveground tdba we showed that water restriction reduced biomass yield of all sugarcane varieties with reductions of 14 5 23 6 and 39 8 for the fractions of 75 75 and 50 of the wdp respectively despite the water restrictions the mean tdba 5954 g m 2 remained within the ranges obtained in similar studies conducted with irrigated cane inman bamber et al 2002 silva 2009 and ferreira et al 2015 during plant cane and ratoon cycles the values obtained by these authors ranged from 5000 g m 2 for the australian varieties q96 and q117 to 6800 g m 2 for the brazilian rb92579 and rb98710 in our study considering only yields after full irrigation 100 wdp for which we observed a mean of 7394 g m 2 we can infer that this difference may be a result of varietal characteristics and the high frequency and uniformity of the irrigation system in the analysis of only the intermediate irrigation levels 75 and 75 we observed that although the plants conducted under these water regimes had similar water replenishment volumes there was a yield difference between them of about 12 the probable cause for this was that the 75 treatment during the stalk growth phase was more stressful than the 75 treatment this was also observed by rossler et al 2013 and suggests that the elongation phase of the stalks is more sensitive to water stress our results indicate that the brazilian variety ctc17 and the south african nco376 were the only ones to produce high biomass yields comparable to those reached under full irrigation when grown with mild water stress however a caveat must be stated that despite receiving restricted volumes of water the plants in this study were irrigated with high frequency an unusual situation in most sugarcane fields which generally irrigate no more than once every five days another fact verified in this study was the non observance of the predominance of higher values of tdba in a single growing season crop cycles since yield values alternated between plant cane and 1 st ratoon for most genotypes regardless of the irrigation regimen table 2 this result although relevant for breeding programs and simulation models of crop growth is of secondary importance within the genotype vs environment interactions because soil type climatic factors and soil water availability can all affect cane growth and productivity to a greater extent jackson and hogarth 1992 liu et al 2016 as regards the partitioning of biomass it is known that it is a consequence of the duration of growth of the leaves sheaths stalks tillers and roots and of the source sink relationship established between these and the plant s environment mckinley et al 2016 in this study we found no marked variability in biomass allocation due to irrigation levels particularly at the 4th sampling indicating that these sugarcane varieties are not very responsive in the different allocation of photoassimilates this suggests that the partitioning of biomass is an inherent characteristic of genotype which is in agreement with singels et al 2000 inman bamber et al 2002 silva and costa 2004 and singels 2011 however our full irrigation 100 treatment resulted in the smallest proportion of leaves with a comparable increase in the stalks fraction this preferential relationship became more obvious in the final stage of the sugarcane cycle due to the maturation process which supports a strong drain attributed to the stalks marcelis et al 2004 mccormick et al 2009 that has its magnitude determined by environmental temperature and water availability the stalks obviously are the main commercial component of the sugarcane plant and the value in our study for this fraction averaged 0 53 which is low compared to published results robertson et al 1996b inman bamber et al 2002 silva et al 2014 in a review by singels et al 2005 these authors showed great variability for this component with values ranging from 0 59 to 0 91 according to them the discrepancy in the results is due to different measurement methods and biomass determinations in the present study we were careful not to collect senescent leaves sheaths or tillers that would eventually detach from the cane plants during the cycle so we performed three pre harvestings of dry dead components throughout each growing season storing them properly for later accounting in the final biomass it is not clear what promoted the lower fractionation of the stalk component but we suspect that the irrigation method may have been the cause the high frequency of irrigation in our experiments may have promoted greater development of vegetative structures which acted as sinks slowing the stems growth 4 2 water use efficiency wue and harvest index three of the genotypes evaluated in this study ctc15 ctc17 and nco376 showed improvement in wue under mild water restriction 75 of wdp which proves the hypothesis behind this work that there are sugarcane varieties that when grown under controlled water deficit conditions produce as well as plants with full irrigation 100 of wdp the varieties ctc17 and nco376 for example subjected to a 75 of dwp water restriction did not show significant differences in biomass compared to plants given full irrigation fig 4 we believe that the high performance of varieties ctc15 ctc17 and nco376 results from the fact that these genotypes when cultivated under moderate water stress induced physiological changes such as only a discrete closure of the stomata which reduced transpiration more than photosynthesis and consequently increased wue this conclusion is supported by the findings of kang et al 2000 and cantore et al 2014 who investigated wue in potato and maize respectively under conditions of controlled water deficit however we understand that parameters of physiological order can endorse this illation although our results clearly confirmed the existence of sugarcane varieties able to use water more efficiently the range of wues was relatively narrow ranging from 5 1 6 6 kg m 3 dry basis which is in agreement with steduto et al 2007 that improvements in wue could only come from genetic changes altering the photosynthetic efficiency of sugarcane however we believe that more studies of diverse genotypes under controlled irrigation conditions would help to identify genotypes that use water more efficiently and contribute progenies for breeding programs however these types of studies are expensive and as far as we know basnayake et al 2012 and liu et al 2016 have been the only ones to use an approach similar to ours to evaluate the effect of water restriction on sugarcane clones under field conditions as for hi which in this study is restricted to only the fraction of sucrose present in the total biomass above ground we obtained an average value of 26 6 which is in agreement with doorenbos and kassam 1979 who showed 20 30 sucrose in the dry biomass similar results were obtained by thangavelu 2006 who studied the sugar yield of 30 sugarcane clones belonging to distinct maturation groups in southern india we did not observe significant effects of growth seasons and irrigation regimens on this variable table 4 particularly for irrigation levels this behavior diverges from those reported by inman bamber and smith 2005 and inman bamber et al 2008 where these authors argue that there was influence of the irrigation management adopted on the sucrose content in the final biomass the disagreement in our findings probably stems from differences in irrigation frequency of the plants under water restriction in the study by inman bamber et al 2008 the water restriction treatment only allowed irrigation when the growth rate of the plants reached a fraction of the leaf growth rate of the full irrigation treatment without deficit we believe that this criterion subjected cane plants to restrictive irrigation levels with an intensity higher than that allowed in our study which provided water to the plants at average intervals of two days even at reduced volumes with regard to the differences in sucrose content seen in our study this may be due to the fact that the imposed water restrictions were not sufficient to attenuate the strong potential of the leaves to act as a sink this conclusion may be supported from the dynamics of photoassimilate allocation by this organ from the four harvestings of the plants during the of the 1 st ratoon cycle table 3 where the accumulation of dry matter in the leaves increased again after the third cut at the expense of the stalks where it continued to decline this evidence coupled with the high temperatures recorded during the maturation stage of the crop supports our conclusions which are in line with those reported by glasziou and gayler 1972 and inman bamber et al 2008 in addition to the results from the growth cycle and irrigation level data we determined the effect of sugarcane genotype on hi in which the cultivar rb966928 had a sucrose content equivalent to 30 9 of its dry weight fig 8 since hi is a measure of the transport efficiency of photoassimilates to the stalks the high hi achieved by rb966928 suggested that this cultivar had a higher conversion efficiency than the others however since hi is a relative measure this can lead to misjudgments if the variety chosen by the farmer is solely based on this information rather than combining it with stalk yield for example rb966928 which had the highest hi among the eight tested varieties ranked only 5th in terms of gross sugar yield per hectare since the production of stalks by this variety was not as impressive as the accumulation of sucrose this result added to what has been observed in studies on hi conducted in other crops such as rice huang et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 and maize lorenz et al 2010 suggest that the upper limit of hi has probably already been reached and that future gains in sugar yield will have to be obtained by increases in biomass production this can be inferred from the low variability of hi in the varieties evaluated in this study even though they were developed at different times for example despite having the highest stalks yields the ctc17 cultivar launched in 2008 showed only a modest improvement over the nco376 south african cultivar developed in 1955 for sugarcane however the increase in sugar yield per unit area associated with increases in the yield of total biomass above ground serves two notable purposes for the sugar alcohol and bioenergy industries i the increase of sugar and ethanol productivity of the first generation and ii the increase in biomass for use in second generation ethanol production and in the co generation of electricity 5 conclusions we investigated the influence of different soil water availability conditions on the accumulation and partition of total biomass above ground as well as the efficiency of water use in eight commercial varieties of sugarcane our results indicate that sugarcane biomass yield is reduced by lack of sufficient water but that combining moderate decreases in irrigation water with varieties that are more tolerant to water deprivation can afford savings in irrigation cost without sacrificing sugar and biomass yield the brazilian varieties ctc15 and ctc17 in addition to the south african nco376 increased their water use efficiency when conducted under water replacement levels equal to 75 of the usual water demand without compromising biomass yield there were no major changes in biomass allocation under controlled water deficit but some of the varieties studied showed variable biomass partitioning rb966928 for example had the largest biomass fraction allocated in the stalks 0 59 and the iac5000 variety had the lowest 0 51 we verified that under controlled drip irrigation the harvest index hi for sucrose was not affected by water stress the observed variability was attributed to the genetic inheritance from traditional breeding programs which have not been very successful in increasing yield over the past several decades in conclusion based on our findings it should be possible to increase the sugar yield per unit area in sugarcane cultivation by increasing biomass productivity using highly efficient irrigation methods to minimize water stress during
