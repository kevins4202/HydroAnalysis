22845,the increasing attention to the improvement of navigational safety and autonomous navigation has led to the emergence of various tools and methods for collision risk assessment in ship navigation an extensive systematic literature review has been carried out in this paper it focuses on the parameters and methods of individual collision risk assessment providing input for navigational safety and autonomous navigation we thoroughly assessed and analysed a number of papers on this topic according to two dimensions a model based analysis and a parametric clarification through this review we seek to provide a greater understanding of the use and integration of parameters and methods in individual navigational collision risk assessments additionally the information obtained through systematic literature review not only makes it possible to identify current circumstances trends and deficiencies but also helps to focus future efforts the results of the systematic literature review also indicate a literature gap regarding navigational collision risk assessment keywords systematic literature review individual collision risk maritime traffic 1 introduction in recent years ship manoeuvrings in congested waters have become more complex with the emergence of specialized vessels and increasingly larger ships therefore collision avoidance in congested waters has turned into one of the most important concerns in providing navigational safety the international maritime organization imo s standardization efforts and the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colreg have introduced useful practical and reliable methods to ensure navigational safety additionally manoeuvring decision support systems constitute an essential facilitating device to enhance collision avoidance capability and increase navigation safety as a basic and significant concept in ship navigation collision risk assessment is a fundamental pillar of these supporting systems hence an effective and systematic model for continually assessing collision risk by monitoring parameter states is necessary it is possible to find numerous examples of collision risk assessment in the literature each method has its advantages and disadvantages however due to the large number of feature parameters the inherently complex marine environment uncertainty and a lack of information there is no common ground to define collision risk furthermore no references have been made to the foundation of risk analysis in the maritime application area goerlandt and montewka 2015 the selection of appropriate and consistent collision risk assessment methods generally depends on each unique situation collision probability models evaluating potential collision occurrence are rooted in the research carried out by macduff 1974 and fujii et al 1974 these studies assumed that the number of vessels is randomly distributed on the waterway considered that is they employed the frequency of vessels navigation on the specific water area this approach emphasizes potential accident candidates allowing the evaluation of any given waterway such as the gulf of finland montewka et al 2010 the yangtze river zhang et al 2013 and the strait of istanbul ulus√ßu et al 2009 unlike collision probability individual collision risk represents the degree of collision only in respect to specific parameters there exist also other characteristics of individual collision risk for instance individual collision risk models are independent from the frequency data of any waterway they allow for an evaluation of any type of waterway open sea restricted waters and so on in a macroscopic way furthermore individual collision risk models serve as foundation for collision avoidance models and can feed them with a navigational collision risk ncr degree therefore in the remainder of this paper ncr refers to individual navigational collision risk a basic graphical representation of the relation of the ncr assessment collision avoidance and maritime transportation risk analysis assumed in this study is presented in fig 1 the scope of this study is determined by the classification of risk definitions of goerlandt and montewka 2015 this allows us to reveal not only the risk definitions of ncr assessment studies but also the parameters utilized in the risk approach some authors szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 analysed ship domain based parameters in ship collision in order to overcome the limitation of navigation specific parameters xu and wang 2014 reviewed ship collision risk evaluation studies according to their own parameters however the aim of the present paper is to investigate individual collision risk models the parameters featured in these models and the application of methods and tools in the literature this analysis aims to provide broader insight and knowledge of perceived trends and existing difficulties furthermore it can provide greater focus to the future efforts by training the lens on collision risk models in a macroscopic way as additional support to this analysis we present the feature parameters that feed the models and information flow this paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the research methodology and the results of the systematic literature review in section 2 we conduct a classification of ncr assessment models section 3 discusses the applications of ncr assessments in collision avoidance systems in section 4 we evaluate the parameter analysis results section 5 presents a discussion followed by the conclusion 2 research context we reviewed ncr studies based on the characteristics defined in table 1 these characteristics were firstly presented by goerlandt and montewka 2015 in order to figure out the research context of the literature review in risk analysis the classification of the characteristic adopted approach to risk analysis science shown in table 1 is determined in reference to studies by bradbury 1989 rosa 1998 and goerlandt and montewka 2015 according to bradbury 1989 and rosa 1998 realist constructivist and proceduralist approaches are accepted as three common views on risk analysis however goerlandt and montewka 2015 modified these approaches for maritime transportation and presented eight scientific risk analysis approaches i strong realist ii moderate realist iii moderate realist with uncertainty quantification iv scientific proceduralist v precautionary proceduralist vi moderate constructivist with uncertainty evaluation vii moderate constructivist and viii strong constructivist the authors clearly explained the characteristics of each risk analysis approach goerlandt and montewka 2015 p 118 an overview of the adopted scientific approaches to risk analysis shows that three approaches are the most common in the application of maritime transportation risk analysis strong realist moderate realist and moderate constructivist based on this insight the studies reviewed here are classified in respect to these three approaches we conducted our literature review according to the review protocol illustrated in table 2 a search of the selected databases resulted in a list of a total of 237 studies then these studies were analysed based on whether they fit into the scope of our research finally 34 studies were selected to be reviewed the selected papers were grouped into different categories according to year of publication journal and adopted scientific approach to risk analysis as seen in figs 2 4 respectively according to fig 2 the number of studies on ncr shows an increase starting in 2005 the years 2010 2015 and 2016 featured the highest number of studies published fig 3 represents the number of publications in respect to journals and conferences accordingly approximately 46 per cent of ncr studies were published in three journals namely ocean engineering journal of navigation and safety science as a final categorization illustrated in fig 4 ncr studies were classified based on the adopted approaches to risk analysis science although the parameters employed in the studies resemble each other and are correlated with one another a strong realist risk analysis approach was most commonly found with a percentage of 56 3 classification of individual collision risk models ncr assessment applications in maritime transportation are lacking in clarity when it comes to foundational issues and key terminology in the scientific methods of risk analysis goerlandt and montewka 2015 the reason behind this deficiency may be found in the wide variety of data sources approaches and unclear boundaries of safety limits in ncr for example ncr assessment studies are generally based on data sets obtained through expert views via surveys chin and debnath 2009 inoue 2000 lopez santander and lawry 2017 results of simulator experiments ahn et al 2012 or data of automatic identification system debnath et al 2011 mou et al 2010 moreover some ncr studies include mathematical functions exponential trigonometrical logarithmic and so on fuzzy membership functions or statistical methods the outcomes of the functions have generally been classified according to rule based methods or limit values provided by the perennial experience of the maritime environment however interpreting the limit critical values constitutes the most controversial step of ncr assessment studies for example the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs does not provide any standards for the safe passing distance of two encountering ships in diversified states of maritime traffic this finding is also supported by various other authors he et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 thus many authors preferred to use mathematical functions to formulate the limits of the ship domain kijima and furukawa 2003 wang 2010 safe distance and other critical factors to fill the gap of safety limit standards on which ncr assessment models have been built there also exist navigation specific terminologies such as ship domain which can reflect differently on the interpretation of risk analysis the term ship domain was first introduced by fujii and tanaka 1971 as a two dimensional area surrounding a ship which a navigator must avoid it may be considered as the area of evasion subsequently goodwin 1975 defined ship domain as the effective area around a ship which a navigator would like to keep free with respect to other ships and stationary obstacles however determining a ship domain includes many unsolved problems and as of yet no ship domain model has been widely accepted although a wide variety of ship domain models exists in the literature szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 there are several limitations such as an insufficient training sample zhu et al 2001 leaving out human and environmental factors wang et al 2009 and complex shapes pietrzykowski 2008 because the ship domain approach and the ncr approach can be nested in this study we consider the concept of the ship domain a navigation specific tool of ncr therefore studies calculating the collision risk index with the help of the ship domain are also examined here in order to clarify uncertain points of ncr terminology we have employed the classification system proposed by goerlandt and montewka 2015 for scientific approaches to risk analysis based on their classification system the ncr assessment models proposed in the reviewed studies were grouped under three categories strong realist moderate realist and moderate constructivist the motivation behind this classification is to provide insight into which risk approach the various ncr assessment models have adopted in this section we scrutinized several ncr assessment models one by one and grouped them in respect to their approaches and parameters which separately highlight the various features of the models table 3 presents an initial review of the aims and risk assessment models of the ncr studies 3 1 strong realist models the characteristics of strong realist models are defined by goerlandt and montewka 2015 as follows i risk is considered to exist objectively as a physical attribute of a system and the analysis is presented as an estimate of this underlying true risk ii it exclusively relies on data collected from the system or on engineering science model iii expert judgment is not considered a source of evidence iv evidence uncertainty is not considered v stakeholders are not involved in the process of analysis vi there exists a strict separation between facts and non epistemic values vii contextual risk attributes are not considered viii there exists a strong relation to established risk decision criteria based on these characteristics the specific studies proposing strong realist models for ncr assessment were ascertained as an initial study hilgert and baldauf 1997 proposed a rule based collision risk model of ship to ship encounters for open sea waterways this study formulated a four level risk based on cpa closest point of approach and proposed critical limits hydrodynamic safe passing distance c h safe passing distance c a safe range r a critical range r c and manoeuvring range r m the safe passing distance spd indicating the acceptable safe distance in a ship to ship encounter and its formulation are presented in eq 1 below 1 c a f x l m a x c g in this equation f x is a factor determined by visibility and encounter situation l m a x is the maximum ship length and c g is the maximum positioning and evaluation error c h and r c indicate the limit of an unacceptable dcpa and distance in a two ship encounter respectively the authors assume danger of collision when the cpa and the distance between the two ships are smaller than c h and r c respectively however the calculation of c h was not determined because of the impracticability of measuring the real distance between two encountering ships therefore the authors preferred to determine c h from a practical point of view another important study featuring a strong realist model was authored by smierzchalski 2005 proposed a hexagon shaped area of danger to state ncr the author formulated six distances from the center of the ship to establish the safe navigation manoeuvring area with the help of tcpa dcpa own speed relative speed ship length and ship breadth parameters stern and port side safe distances were assumed to be no less than 0 5 miles also the author suggests that the safe distance in front of the bow should be 2 to 3 miles anything below this distance results in collision risk accordingly ncr is directly related to distance therefore safe threshold distances have been calculated based on other parameters for example the longitudinal dimension l d of the proposed domain is presented in eq 2 2 l d l v 1 26 30 v u where l is the own ship length v and u are ship speed and error in estimating ship length respectively smierzchalski 2005 has proposed a definition of risk degree as a mathematical function of tcpa and dcpa as shown in eq 3 3 min r a e d c p a d b 2 b 0 1 t b t c p a c d d c p a d b t c p a n t b 0 d c p a d b t c p a n t b where d b and t b are the safe distance and time to safe distance defined by the proposed hexagon shaped area a b c d are the regulated parameters as can be seen in equation 2 this hexagon shaped area is based on speed allowing to set critical limits d b and t b dynamically however employing the parameters of tcpa and dcpa has been considered useless by szlapczynski 2006 thereafter the temporary approach factor f m i n that is the ratio of the distance between the two encountering ships to minimum acceptable distance was proposed for integrating various ship domain models when appropriate this factor was proposed due to the misleading obscure aspect of dcpa in ship domain violation as discussed in section 3 2 this study proposed a modified ncr model of lisowski 2004 as shown in eq 4 4 r a 1 f m i n 2 a 2 t f m i n t s 2 a 3 f t 1 2 while a 1 a 2 and a 3 are coefficients dependent on the state of visibility ship length and a kind of water area t f m i n and t s are the time to reaching the temporary approach f min value and the time necessary to plan and perform a collision avoidance manoeuvre respectively f t is the instantaneous scale factor of ship domain and f m i n the minimum value of f t which utilizes the minimum distance between two ships on any given course in fact the difference between these two parameters is the position of the target ship this approach substitutes dcpa and tcpa with f m i n and f t which take into account the ship itself rather than the safe distance from the ship fig 5 illustrates the graphical representation of f t and f m i n furthermore szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 have further extend the former study szlapczynski 2006 by introducing two new parameter called degree of domain violation and time to domain violation liu and liu 2006 have defined collision risk as a function of dcpa and tcpa as shown in eq 5 5 r i s k t 0 d c p a t Œª d c p a 1 e 2 d c p a t Œª d c p a 2 2 e 2 t c p a t 2 2 d c p a t Œª d c p a here the parameter Œª dcpa was introduced determined by restricted visibility and the condition of sight the proposed risk definition was employed to evaluate the trainees manoeuvrings in collision avoidance situations the study has introduced a feasible methodology allowing to learn cases by recording important data balmat et al 2009 introduced the maritime risk assessment marisa model with the adoption of a fuzzy approach this model combined static and dynamic risk factors year of construction flag state gross tonnage the number of companies duration and type of detentions were determined as static factors while sea state wind speed visibility and night or day time were determined as dynamic factors with this study balmat et al 2009 modified the work of degr√© 2003 with the contribution of weather conditions pointing to the dynamic nature of ship navigation in 2011 balmat et al 2011 revised the marisa model by including speed fuzzy and shipping evaluation non fuzzy while the marisa model does not exactly portray the ncr and focuses on oil pollution prevention at sea the modified version illustrates the individual risk of vessels for all situations including collision the risk assessment architecture of the study is presented in fig 6 speed evolution in this study considers zigzags or successive acceleration decelerations as suspect manoeuvrings these suspect manoeuvrings are detected by calculating the orthorhombic distance with the last and instantaneous geographic positions wang 2010 introduced a new ncr model based on the dynamic calculation of the ship domain this study determines the size of the ship domain by means of four radii fore aft starboard and port which can be elliptical or convex the determined ship domain is then transformed into a fuzzy environment to assess the individual ncr with the help of eq 6 6 r e x p 2 x 1 s g n x œÉ f o r e 1 s i g n x œÉ a f t k 2 y 1 s g n y œÉ s t a r 1 s i g n y œÉ p o r t k where œÉ f o r e œÉ a f t œÉ s t a r œÉ p o r t are related to the proposed ship domain radius x and y are longitudinal and lateral distances between the ships respectively the power k determines the shape of the ship domain s g n x and s g n y are either negative or positive depending on the sign of the distances this equation proposes the spatial collision risk of the navigating ship whose ship domain changes dynamically comparison of the proposed model with existing ship domain models in simulation presents more coherent in reaction time collision risk awareness for each encounter situation modifying existing ship domain models is a distinguished perspective although it can lead to heavy dependency on preferred ship domain model thanks to this insight the proposed model enables overcoming the limitation of traffic geometry in addition to commonly known parameters such as dcpa and tcpa several authors have introduced navigation specific variables in order to take ncr assessment further for instance bukhari et al 2013 proposed the parameter of the variance of compass degree vcd which is the difference between two consecutive bearings in this study the parameters vcd dcpa and tcpa were used to construct an ncr assessment model these parameters were transformed into fuzzy membership functions illustrated in fig 7 and the ncr assessment model was structured as a fuzzy rule based model in fact vcd is the difference between two consecutive bearings representing the degree of the change of the bearing the aim of this study was to construct an automatic collision risk assessment interface lightning the workload of vts officers smolarek and ≈õniegocki 2013 accepted wind speed as an important determinant for safe manoeuvring in restricted waters the authors analysed the risk by taking into consideration the parameters of ship speed wind speed and wind direction with a generalized linear model the fitted model was validated by a chi square approach the proposed ncr model assumes a higher risk degree when the ship position is far from the centreline although the relation between the parameters and the risk degree has not been examined it can be pointed out that the speed parameter clearly has the highest linear relationship with the risk degree in addition to the above mentioned models nonlinear support vector machines svm were employed by gang et al 2016 in order to estimate the collision risk index the collision risk estimation model proposed in this study is similar to that of ahn et al 2012 however gang et al used fuzzy comprehensive evaluation theory without expert knowledge instead of the fuzzy inference rules acquired from the knowledge of watching officers the membership function formulations of the parameters of dcpa tcpa distance relative bearing and velocity ratio are presented in eqs 7 11 respectively these membership functions are similar to those presented in chen et al 2015 7 u d c p a 1 d c p a 1 d 2 d c p a d 2 d 1 2 d 1 d c p a d 2 0 d c p a d 2 8 u t c p a 1 t c p a 1 t 2 t c p a t 2 t 1 2 t 1 t c p a t 2 0 t c p a t 2 9 u d r 1 0 d r 1 d 2 d r d 2 d 1 2 d 1 d r d 2 0 d r d 2 10 u Œ∏ t 1 2 c o s Œ∏ t 19 440 289 c o s 2 Œ∏ t 19 5 17 11 u k 1 1 2 k k 2 1 2 k s i n c where d 1 and d 2 are the minimal safe encounter distance and absolute safe encounter distance t 1 and t 2 are defined as a function of speed and d 1 and d 2 Œ∏ t are the relative position of the target ship from the own ship k is the velocity ratio of the two vessels here ncr is defined as the weighted product of these membership functions the output of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is employed as the collision risk label of a support vector machine model utilizing own ship speed target ship speed own ship position target ship position the distance between the two ships and relative bearing however details about the data selection and the determination of collision risk for training and testing data are equivocal and the authors recommend actual vessel data for applicability in addition to the proposed limits of hilgert and baldauf 1997 such as hydrodynamic safe passing distance c h safe passing distance c a and safe range r a wen et al 2016 evaluated the safe passing distance spd as safe distance of approach sda regarding colreg rule 8 and proposed limit values for ship to ship encounters the authors defined ncr as the multiplication of dcpa and tcpa based fuzzy functions as shown in eq 12 and 13 12 u d c p a 1 d c p a d 1 d 2 d c p a d 2 d 1 3 03 d 1 d c p a d 2 0 d c p a d 2 13 u t c p a 1 t c p a t 1 t 2 t c p a t 2 t 1 3 03 t 1 t c p a t 2 0 t c p a t 2 where d 1 and d 2 constitute parameters concerning sda and are determined by the relative bearing of the target ship t 1 and t 2 are time parameters indicating the time remaining to the last collision avoidance manoeuvring in fact the authors assume the existence of a collision risk when the distance of two ships is 8 nautical miles yet they also consider 12 ship lengths as the distance of last minute avoidance 3 2 moderate realist models moderate realist models are quite similar to the strong realist approach with only a few dissimilarities the characteristics of moderate realist models were defined by goerlandt and montewka 2015 as follows i it heavily relies on data collected from the system or on engineering natural science models ii expert judgment is considered a source of evidence but knowledge generated by experts is seen as a last resort and or is seen as truth approaching iii evidence uncertainty is not considered or only sporadically mentioned at harbour entrances vts systems can be overloaded when assessing the danger of navigation if the waterway is too congested therefore kao et al 2007 proposed a fuzzy logic method to alleviate this problem three fuzzy membership functions speed length of ship and sea state were proposed to determine the radius of a guarding ring the fuzzy guarding ring was derived from the concept of the ship domain and based on the idea that the vessel s collision risk increases when the ship domains become closer as shown in fig 8 the length of the radical axis a b of the two circles o 1 and o 2 considered the ship domains increases whenever two ships are approaching according to the pythagorean theorem however the interaction between the two guarding rings was evaluated with the help of the membership functions of the proposed parameters instead of any mathematical calculation a total of 27 fuzzy rules were proposed for the degree of the guarding ring without any expert judgement furthermore the study proposed a calculation of the degree of collision risk u d a n g e r as can be seen in equation 14 14 u d a n g e r 1 Œ¥ t 0 1 2 Œ¥ t œÑ 2 0 Œ¥ t œÑ 2 2 Œ¥ t œÑ œÑ 2 œÑ 2 Œ¥ t œÑ 0 Œ¥ t œÑ the parameter œÑ is the safety time interval obtained by the membership function of speed and Œ¥ t is the discrepancy of two collision points while the definitions of œÑ and Œ¥ t were not clear it was assumed that œÑ is the time to make the minimum safe distance described as 0 9 nautical miles according to goodwin 1975 the authors recommended this model as a tool for monitoring all ships in a congested harbour entrance however the author did not take into consideration the effect of multi ship encounters another important example of a moderate realist model was proposed by mou et al 2010 this model made use of the safety assessment model for shipping and offshore on the north sea samson s accident number estimation model to define collision risk in busy waters the authors added the tcpa cpa and encounter angle parameters as multipliers to samson s model the equation of the proposed collision risk model is as follows 15 r c o l l i r b a s i c r t c p a r c p a r a n g l e in the equation r b a s i c stands for basic risk static risk factors ship type size and so on and r t c p a and r c p a represent the exponential function of tcpa and cpa respectively r t c p a and r c p a are determined based on expert opinion r a n g l e is a predetermined factor based on the course difference between the own and the target ship the unique characteristic of this model is the estimation of cpa by using course difference length of ship speed and relative difference separately with linear regression and ais database this model which includes a maritime accident data set was proposed as a helpful tool for monitoring risk due to severity of maritime traffic since questionnaires incorporating perceived risk level can be quite subjective ahn et al 2012 proposed an interviewee independent method which can be deemed a pioneering work this is achieved with the help of the rule based collision risk table modified from the study by hara and hammer 1993 as well as the fuzzy membership functions of dcpa koyama and yan 1987 and tcpa hara and hammer 1993 acquired the knowledge of watching officers from experimental results using a ship handling simulator because the number of rules obtained from hara and hammer 1993 was insufficient to represent the degree of the collision risk the study by ahn at al 2012 employed an adaptive network based fuzzy inference system to increase the number of membership functions of dcpa and tcpa the modified membership functions of dcpa and tcpa and the modified fuzzy inference table are presented in fig 9 and table 4 respectively the output of the fuzzy inference system was employed as the collision risk label of a neural network model utilizing the own ship s speed target ship speed the own ship s heading target ship heading the distance between the two ships and ship domain zhao et al 1996 as input vector restricted visibility cockcroft et al 2012 topographical characteristics lee and rhee 2001 and high speed constraints were also adopted in this ncr evaluation in order to approximate a complex maritime environment simulation results show that a neural network based model is more realistic than the fuzzy inference system ahn et al 2012 also designated different ship domains for restricted and open sea areas having particular idiosyncrasies the ncr assessment methodology of this study is quite feasible for the maritime environment while the severity of navigation can be evaluated on the basis of navigation specific parameters such as dcpa tcpa and vcd the actual parameters affecting the severity of navigation are system parameters such as speed heading and distance zhang et al 2016 pushed their previous study zhang et al 2015 forward by including in the model a new parameter called minimum distance to collision montewka et al 2010 vessel size was also employed in the model together with a ship domain concept instead of the distance between the two ships as shown in eq 16 16 v c r o x y z l Œ± c m d t c k x l Œ± 1 y c m d t c in this equation c m d t c is the minimum distance to collision derived from another study montewka et al 2010 l Œ± is the distance between the own ship and the ship domain in the line of the other ship conducted scenarios shown that the model is not valid near harbours because of the close distances in fact the study did not define the risk degree in encounters of less than one nautical mile the authors also stated that the vcro values of scenarios were in line with the expert judgments utilized as a source of evidence zhao et al 2016 proposed an ncr assessment approach based on evidential reasoning for autonomous navigation in unmanned surface vessels the authors pointed out that ncr assessment is the foundation for autonomous navigation and has three significant characteristics ambiguity uncertainty and instantaneity the dcpa tcpa the distance between the two vessels relative bearing and relative velocity based fuzzy membership functions derived from other studies li and pang 2013 zhou and wu 2004 were employed to assess the ncr zhao et al defined the ncr as a weighted multiplication of fuzzy membership functions utilized in the calculation of the belief degrees for evidential reasoning as shown in eq 17 17 n c r n 1 n Œª l n Œ± l n Œª u n n n 1 n Œ± l n 0 25 0 5 Œ± l n is the risk representation value of grade l n with belief degree Œª l n is the confidence degree of risk grade and Œª u n is the representation of the overall uncertainty that brings together all factors basically belief degree is formulated as in eq 18 18 Œ± n i Œ≥ i Œ≤ d o w n Œ≤ u p Œ≤ d o w n Œ≥ i is the value of the membership function between 0 and 1 Œ≤ d o w n and Œ≤ u p are the risk interval into which Œ≥ i falls here the ncr assessment is not basically the weighted multiplication of membership functions as in other studies chen et al 2015 2014 xu et al 2010 but a combination of belief degrees furthermore this study calculates the ncr in order to activate the prompt alert of collision avoidance for an unmanned surface vehicle because the previous model zhang et al 2016 employed a static ship domain and was not capable of giving any information about the dynamic state of the ship zhang et al 2017 applied a different domain model kijima and furukawa 2003 to display the dynamic ncr of ship navigation the proposed model combines the merged vcro average vcro rank of two encountered ships the vcro change rate and the ship pair size and classified them with the help of fuzzy clusters fuzzy rules were established with the fuzzy k means method together with expert knowledge to assess ncr utilizing the ship domain model of kijima and furukawa 2003 enabled the integration of ship manoeuvring characteristics into the system distinguishing the new vcro model from prior studies the ship manoeuvring characteristics of the model include the time to a 90 degree heading and the tactical diameter indicating the response time and pattern of a ship when changing direction in case of emergency another advantage of this over prior vcro models is its dynamic state enabling one to monitor dynamic changes in ship to ship encounters 3 3 moderate constructivist models unlike strong and moderate realist models moderate constructive models assume risk to be the mental construct of an expert while the data come from the system the risk degree is extracted from the expert s knowledge according to the system data the main characteristics of the moderate constructivist model are described by goerlandt and montewka 2015 as follows i the analysis is presented as the reflection of an assessor s mental construct ii it relies on data collected from the system engineering natural science models as well as expert judgment iii evidence uncertainty is not considered iv stakeholders are not involved in analysis process v non epistemic values are excluded from the risk characterization vi contextual risk attributes are not considered vii there exists a clear link to decision making in terms of a managerial review where other decision criteria are considered along with the risk analysis the study by inoue 2000 constitutes one example of a moderate constructivist model the author proposed an environmental stress model based on linear regression employing the time to collision ttc parameter to estimate ship handling difficulty in restricted and congested waterways the ttc parameter can be assumed to consist of the time needed to reach any obstacle or ship the proposed model is written as follows 19 s j l i s j s i Œ± Œ≤ t t c the linear relationship between ttc and stress level of officer on watch oow is introduced by the Œ± and Œ≤ coefficients s j l i and s j s i are perceived stress values according to the regression model on the relative bearing of i th degree of the own ship from land objects and other ships respectively this environmental stress model was used for the comparison of two navigational aids arpa and recommended collision danger presentation by pedersen et al 2003 subsequently chin and debnath 2009 utilized ordered probit regression model to formulate collision risk in port waters the model was fitted with survey results of the perceived collision risk from 160 pilots based on the tcpa and dcpa variables for night day condition and four different vessel classes the regression model of the study is presented as follows 20 t m Œ≤ 1 d c p a Œ≤ 2 t c p a while t m indicates ordered risk level Œ≤ 1 and Œ≤ 2 are regression coefficients the results obtained from the study show that dcpa is more prone to affect perceived collision risk than is tcpa this ncr model was utilized in the navigational traffic conflict technique debnath and chin 2010 to overcome the limitation of the number of collision records in any given waterway such as port anchorages debnath and chin 2016 the navigational traffic conflict technique based on the ncr model presents a practical way to overcome the limitations of the dependent variables of ncr assessments in port waters the same methodology may be applicable and useful for other spaces of maritime transportation however perera et al 2011 introduced a fuzzy rule based decision making system to improve the safety of oceangoing vessels the ncr degree is based on distance relative bearing of the target vessel encounter angle and relative speed fig 10 offers a graphical representation of encounter situations own ship and target ship t collision regions are divided into eight regions in accordance which collision avoidance decisions and an ncr is formulated the boundary and limits of the regions i ii ii iv and so on distances r v d r a etc and other parameters are defined as a fuzzy membership functions although the study has focused on extracting all encounter situation for collision avoidance the colreg rules and regulations have been considered for the critical collision condition situation in near proximity the authors applied expert knowledge in order to fill this gap however the steps behind the expert knowledge extraction have not been presented even so their ncr assessment approach can provide evidence for near proximity encounters where regulation improvements can be made within colreg however several studies goerlandt et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 criticized the parameters dcpa and tcpa as they lead to obscure risk interpretation this criticism is premised on the idea that a low cpa value does not signify a risky encounter if the bow cross range the distance at which the second vessel passes ahead of the bow of the first vessel is wide in other words port to port or starboard to starboard encounter types can be safe even though the cpa value is low to overcome this deficiency zhang et al 2015 proposed a vessel conflict ranking operator vcro to evaluate the severity of two ship encounters the mathematical function of the model was built based on the distance between the two ships x the relative speed y and the difference between their headings z as follows 21 v c r o x y z k x 1 y m sin z n sin 2 z k m n represents the coefficients estimated by the least square method and these coefficients have been determined based on expert judgement harbour approaches were excluded from the application of the model this exclusion emphasizes the idiosyncrasies of different waterways the focus of the study was to extract the near miss collision data to evaluate the maritime transportation safety rather than to assess ncr in addition to employing tcpa and dcpa which do not fully state the ship encounters level of severity lopez santander and lawry 2017 also adopted relative situation head on crossing overtaking color red green and trajectory variability erratic not erratic as ncr estimation parameters the results of this ordered probit model revealed that dcpa has the most significant effect on the perceived risk with the highest absolute coefficient value 0 395 by contrast the estimate of the tcpa coefficient constitutes the lowest value 0 0249 which is a surprising result for the maritime environment the performance of the model was evaluated based on the data set of the original questionnaire s responses assuming that collision avoidance is the ultimate objective of assessing risk the study was proposed a pathfinding algorithm employing the risk distribution of any given vessel since it is not feasible to examine all ncr studies in equal detail we introduce information on other ncr assessment studies chen et al 2014 perera and guedes soares 2015 ren et al 2011 etc in tables 3 and 5 4 application of ncr assessments with collision avoidance this section reviews navigational collision avoidance studies that have adopted ncr assessment procedures in these studies ncr assessment processes have been presented as a complementary part of navigational collision avoidance systems however collision avoidance can be also achieved with the help of any established method lopez santander and lawry 2017 other than ncr assessment the studies discussing collision avoidance systems with ncr assessment include those presented here a pioneering work szlapczynski 2006 proposed a numerical algorithm mainly based on finding a safe value f min for any course in the case of domain violation f m i n 1 provoking the ship domain s rotation rotating the ship domain leads to a new ship domain this new ship domain is determined by a new course in the case of domain violation also ahn et al 2012 employed the ncr threshold value of 0 6 to provoke collision avoidance action with speed and course alteration in this study an expert system tool was utilized to determine the proper order for safe manoeuvring particularly for those complex encounter situations where the colreg regulations are insufficient furthermore pietrzykowski et al 2012 introduced an integrated navigational decision support system navdec to meet the trend of converting navigational information systems into decision support systems the collision risk estimation approach was implemented with the help of colreg the principles of good sea practice and criteria used by marine officer experts in the navdec thereafter tam and bucknall 2013 employed proxy metric based collision risk values to determine the colreg compliant collision avoidance manoeuvre including a standard change in heading 30 another course alteration procedure was proposed by wen et al 2016 in case the ncr exceeds a level of 0 5 the proposed course alteration occurs in 0 1 increments a further colreg compliant real time collision avoidance model was introduced by zhao et al 2016 the authors utilized a generalized orca algorithm for their real time collision avoidance model since then lopez santander and lawry 2017 introduced their ncr estimation model to avoid collision situations by adopting an optimization algorithm safe navigation routes can be obtained with the application of the risk cost function of the optimization algorithm in a multi ship encounter environment the above mentioned studies altogether demonstrate that the ncr assessment process facilitates not only a risk threshold value at which the avoidance manoeuvre is initiated but also the timing of when to stop the precautions substantiating the ncr and the collision avoidance relationship moreover ncr assessments were also adopted for trajectory planning ≈õmierzchalski 2005 maritime traffic monitoring mou et al 2010 near miss risk zhang et al 2017 vts support bukhari et al 2013 preventing oil pollution balmat et al 2011 and performance evaluation pedersen et al 2003 5 parameter analysis this section will review the studies from the perspective of the parameters used in ncr assessment studies in a comprehensive manner as a first finding of this section the number and rate of occurrence of the parameters used in these studies are presented in table 5 table 5 reveals that more than half of the ncr studies have adopted dcpa and tcpa in their risk assessment model also relative bearing distance speed and length feature as the other most commonly used parameters the distribution of the most commonly employed twenty parameters m1 to m20 is introduced in table 6 it is virtually impossible to capture any trend of the number of parameters increasing or decreasing by year additionally most studies prefer to employ dcpa and tcpa in spite of their proposed alternatives the relative bearing parameter has not featured in studies after 2010 it is also noteworthy that there exists no significant discrimination between the parameters presented in table 5 from the perspective of area specific application for the open seas or restricted waters as seen in table 6 the distribution of the other twenty parameters m21 to m40 are presented in appendix a as a matter of fact mariners judgment about collision risk is also heavily dependent on these parameters also some of these parameters are clearly laid out in colreg for example colreg rule 7 b recommends the use of radar equipment which determines tcpa and dcpa as early warning of collision risk moreover rule 7 d assumes collision risk in a steady relative bearing however environmental parameters sea state wind water depth day night visibility have rarely been employed although they are major factors affecting ship dynamics and mariners judgment we have analysed the distribution of the ten most frequent parameters m1 m10 in respect to the risk approaches the results obtained are illustrated in fig 11 in order to clarify parameter preference as seen in fig 11 the parameters tcpa dcpa relative bearing distance speed and length are used in each risk approach while the visibility and breadth parameters only occur in the strong realist approach the day night parameter is not employed in moderate realist risk approaches the general tendency of risk approaches regarding the parameter selection may give insight for future research not only to criticize as in the studies of goerlandt et al 2015 and zhang et al 2015 but also to support the parameters 6 discussion in this section we emphasize both current and complemental issues of ncr assessments in order to support the consistency of ncr assessments with the findings of our literature review firstly although the parameters clearly underlined by colreg have been widely employed hydro meteorological data such as wind current and wave height which colreg disregards have rarely received attention in ncr assessment studies furthermore the current speed affecting the ship movement especially in narrow channels did not directly figure in any of the ncr studies as seen in table 5 however several authors kijima and furukawa 2003 pietrzykowski et al 2017 in their studies on collision avoidance manoeuvring stress the necessity of hydro meteorological data in fact hydro meteorological conditions affect the severity of encounter situations in the eye of the oow there may be three reasons behind the limited attention given to hydro meteorological data the first may be the shortcoming of the limit values or recommendations of the hydro meteorological conditions for safe navigation in colreg the second may be the dominance of several navigation specific parameters such as tcpa and dcpa not only in colreg but also in the maritime industry furthermore dcpa and tcpa remain an industry standard in collision risk and collision avoidance systems chin and debnath 2009 the third may be the difficulty to calculate hydro meteorological effects on the ship yet there exist established standards for calculating wind current and wave height force on the ship for example the recommendations set by the british standard institution and the ocimf sigtto oil companies international marine forum society of international gas tanker and terminal operators ltd 1995 present applicable formulas for the calculation of hydro meteorological effects as example the wind force calculation formulas on any given ship are presented in eq 22 24 bsi 2016 22 f t w c t w œÅ a a l v w 2 10 4 23 f l w c l w œÅ a a l v w 2 10 4 24 f w i n d f t w f l w f t w and f l w are transverse and longitudinal wind forces in kilonewton respectively œÅ a is density of the air in k g m 3 a l is the longitudinal projected area of the vessel above the waterline and v w is the design wind speed m sec c t w and c l w are the transverse and longitudinal wind force coefficients for aft and bow respectively this calculation is more complex than the calculation of tcpa and dcpa however the inclusion of hydro meteorological forces may increase the reliability of the ncr assessment in terms of the above mentioned standards therefore it seems to be of value to incorporate hydro meteorological limit recommendations for each type of ship in colreg secondly in the literature there are no specific standards for critical limits safe distance or time distance of last minute avoidance for ncr as mentioned above different authors have attempted to define these limits within their formulations or assumptions based on their experience however critical limits spd sda and time distance of last minute avoidance can change based on environmental and dynamic factors as well as the area navigated furthermore limits can be interpreted differently by each mariner for instance while wen et al 2016 defined the distance of last minute avoidance as 12 times the ship length xu et al 2010 proposed it as the multiplication of visibility water area status human factor and distance of last minute action moreover tam and bucknall 2013 and xu et al 2010 assumed an spd of 0 25 and 1 nautical miles respectively yet smierzchalski and michalewicz 1998 stated that spd depends on weather conditions sailing area and ship speed undoubtedly the reason behind the attempts to come up with different critical limits can be found in the fact that there exist no established limit values for safe navigation to be incorporated in ncr assessment furthermore reliance on good seamanship in the case of collision avoidance which colreg recommends in ample time may foster this tendency until more concrete limits are established however in addition to critical limits some distance limits specifications can be incorporated in ncr assessment studies for example imo regulations imo 2002 limit the maximum admissible tactical diameter and advance of newly built ships to 5 and 4 5 ship length respectively also the stopping ability of the vessel in case of a full astern crash stop should generally not exceed 15 ship lengths according to imo imo 2002 although these are not limits concerning safe distance they can provide information about the manoeuvring capability of ships and may be incorporated in last minute avoidance actions thirdly ncr studies are lacking in terms of reliable validation regardless of this deficiency strong realist models not considering expert judgment prevail among the ncr assessment studies due to the fact that the severity judgment concerning ncr is more complex than in any other transportation mode validation of the ncr assessment models is subjective rather than objective therefore goerlandt and kujala 2014 proposed a comparative approach to evaluate the reliability of any ship collision risk analysis the proposed approach can reveal the consistency and accuracy of models by re running them with different inputs data method frequency and so on therefore employing the comparative approach of goerlandt and kujala 2014 may improve the reliability of ncr assessment models the current literature on ncr assessment discusses only open and congested restricted sea areas as shown in table 6 the studies on port approach manoeuvring has not been given adequate consideration in the literature port approach manoeuvrings include not only navigation in port areas but also berthing at the pier until the ship stops as ports constitute the gateways of the maritime transportation network ncr assessments that consider port approach manoeuvring will offer a most valuable contribution to maritime transportation risk analysis 7 conclusion this study has attempted to classify ncr assessment studies based on a systematic approach and to examine in detail several of these studies according to their unique characteristics this approach has revealed not only the great variety of studies but also the gaps to be filled by future research trends in parameter selection from which future ncr studies can benefit have also been evaluated as a result this literature review may support navigational decision support system proposal studies in maritime transportation with the aim of enhancement of autonomous ship concept such that researchers may attach more importance to parameter selection in the context of colreg and the model they employ as recommendation for future work we suggest that considering wind current and wave height effects on a ship s dynamic as well as establishing concrete safety limits in spite of colreg s lack of emphasis on these factors can promote the coherence of ncr assessment models in addition all studies examine the open sea and congested restricted sea areas as shown in table 6 it is also found that the lack of studies concerning port approach manoeuvring can be considered as an important gap in the literature as ports constitute the gateways of the maritime transportation network we also recommend that future studies address ncr assessments considering port approach manoeuvring furthermore the validation of ncr assessment models should be conducted in a systematic way as proposed by goerlandt and montewka 2015 this approach will improve ncr assessment studies in the domain of maritime transportation appendix a employed parameters other parameters not mentioned in the study have been presented in table a1 table a1 distribution of other parameters m21 m41 in ncr studies table a1 authors m21 m22 m23 m24 m25 m26 m27 m28 m29 m30 m31 m32 m33 m34 m35 m36

22845,the increasing attention to the improvement of navigational safety and autonomous navigation has led to the emergence of various tools and methods for collision risk assessment in ship navigation an extensive systematic literature review has been carried out in this paper it focuses on the parameters and methods of individual collision risk assessment providing input for navigational safety and autonomous navigation we thoroughly assessed and analysed a number of papers on this topic according to two dimensions a model based analysis and a parametric clarification through this review we seek to provide a greater understanding of the use and integration of parameters and methods in individual navigational collision risk assessments additionally the information obtained through systematic literature review not only makes it possible to identify current circumstances trends and deficiencies but also helps to focus future efforts the results of the systematic literature review also indicate a literature gap regarding navigational collision risk assessment keywords systematic literature review individual collision risk maritime traffic 1 introduction in recent years ship manoeuvrings in congested waters have become more complex with the emergence of specialized vessels and increasingly larger ships therefore collision avoidance in congested waters has turned into one of the most important concerns in providing navigational safety the international maritime organization imo s standardization efforts and the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colreg have introduced useful practical and reliable methods to ensure navigational safety additionally manoeuvring decision support systems constitute an essential facilitating device to enhance collision avoidance capability and increase navigation safety as a basic and significant concept in ship navigation collision risk assessment is a fundamental pillar of these supporting systems hence an effective and systematic model for continually assessing collision risk by monitoring parameter states is necessary it is possible to find numerous examples of collision risk assessment in the literature each method has its advantages and disadvantages however due to the large number of feature parameters the inherently complex marine environment uncertainty and a lack of information there is no common ground to define collision risk furthermore no references have been made to the foundation of risk analysis in the maritime application area goerlandt and montewka 2015 the selection of appropriate and consistent collision risk assessment methods generally depends on each unique situation collision probability models evaluating potential collision occurrence are rooted in the research carried out by macduff 1974 and fujii et al 1974 these studies assumed that the number of vessels is randomly distributed on the waterway considered that is they employed the frequency of vessels navigation on the specific water area this approach emphasizes potential accident candidates allowing the evaluation of any given waterway such as the gulf of finland montewka et al 2010 the yangtze river zhang et al 2013 and the strait of istanbul ulus√ßu et al 2009 unlike collision probability individual collision risk represents the degree of collision only in respect to specific parameters there exist also other characteristics of individual collision risk for instance individual collision risk models are independent from the frequency data of any waterway they allow for an evaluation of any type of waterway open sea restricted waters and so on in a macroscopic way furthermore individual collision risk models serve as foundation for collision avoidance models and can feed them with a navigational collision risk ncr degree therefore in the remainder of this paper ncr refers to individual navigational collision risk a basic graphical representation of the relation of the ncr assessment collision avoidance and maritime transportation risk analysis assumed in this study is presented in fig 1 the scope of this study is determined by the classification of risk definitions of goerlandt and montewka 2015 this allows us to reveal not only the risk definitions of ncr assessment studies but also the parameters utilized in the risk approach some authors szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 analysed ship domain based parameters in ship collision in order to overcome the limitation of navigation specific parameters xu and wang 2014 reviewed ship collision risk evaluation studies according to their own parameters however the aim of the present paper is to investigate individual collision risk models the parameters featured in these models and the application of methods and tools in the literature this analysis aims to provide broader insight and knowledge of perceived trends and existing difficulties furthermore it can provide greater focus to the future efforts by training the lens on collision risk models in a macroscopic way as additional support to this analysis we present the feature parameters that feed the models and information flow this paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the research methodology and the results of the systematic literature review in section 2 we conduct a classification of ncr assessment models section 3 discusses the applications of ncr assessments in collision avoidance systems in section 4 we evaluate the parameter analysis results section 5 presents a discussion followed by the conclusion 2 research context we reviewed ncr studies based on the characteristics defined in table 1 these characteristics were firstly presented by goerlandt and montewka 2015 in order to figure out the research context of the literature review in risk analysis the classification of the characteristic adopted approach to risk analysis science shown in table 1 is determined in reference to studies by bradbury 1989 rosa 1998 and goerlandt and montewka 2015 according to bradbury 1989 and rosa 1998 realist constructivist and proceduralist approaches are accepted as three common views on risk analysis however goerlandt and montewka 2015 modified these approaches for maritime transportation and presented eight scientific risk analysis approaches i strong realist ii moderate realist iii moderate realist with uncertainty quantification iv scientific proceduralist v precautionary proceduralist vi moderate constructivist with uncertainty evaluation vii moderate constructivist and viii strong constructivist the authors clearly explained the characteristics of each risk analysis approach goerlandt and montewka 2015 p 118 an overview of the adopted scientific approaches to risk analysis shows that three approaches are the most common in the application of maritime transportation risk analysis strong realist moderate realist and moderate constructivist based on this insight the studies reviewed here are classified in respect to these three approaches we conducted our literature review according to the review protocol illustrated in table 2 a search of the selected databases resulted in a list of a total of 237 studies then these studies were analysed based on whether they fit into the scope of our research finally 34 studies were selected to be reviewed the selected papers were grouped into different categories according to year of publication journal and adopted scientific approach to risk analysis as seen in figs 2 4 respectively according to fig 2 the number of studies on ncr shows an increase starting in 2005 the years 2010 2015 and 2016 featured the highest number of studies published fig 3 represents the number of publications in respect to journals and conferences accordingly approximately 46 per cent of ncr studies were published in three journals namely ocean engineering journal of navigation and safety science as a final categorization illustrated in fig 4 ncr studies were classified based on the adopted approaches to risk analysis science although the parameters employed in the studies resemble each other and are correlated with one another a strong realist risk analysis approach was most commonly found with a percentage of 56 3 classification of individual collision risk models ncr assessment applications in maritime transportation are lacking in clarity when it comes to foundational issues and key terminology in the scientific methods of risk analysis goerlandt and montewka 2015 the reason behind this deficiency may be found in the wide variety of data sources approaches and unclear boundaries of safety limits in ncr for example ncr assessment studies are generally based on data sets obtained through expert views via surveys chin and debnath 2009 inoue 2000 lopez santander and lawry 2017 results of simulator experiments ahn et al 2012 or data of automatic identification system debnath et al 2011 mou et al 2010 moreover some ncr studies include mathematical functions exponential trigonometrical logarithmic and so on fuzzy membership functions or statistical methods the outcomes of the functions have generally been classified according to rule based methods or limit values provided by the perennial experience of the maritime environment however interpreting the limit critical values constitutes the most controversial step of ncr assessment studies for example the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs does not provide any standards for the safe passing distance of two encountering ships in diversified states of maritime traffic this finding is also supported by various other authors he et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 thus many authors preferred to use mathematical functions to formulate the limits of the ship domain kijima and furukawa 2003 wang 2010 safe distance and other critical factors to fill the gap of safety limit standards on which ncr assessment models have been built there also exist navigation specific terminologies such as ship domain which can reflect differently on the interpretation of risk analysis the term ship domain was first introduced by fujii and tanaka 1971 as a two dimensional area surrounding a ship which a navigator must avoid it may be considered as the area of evasion subsequently goodwin 1975 defined ship domain as the effective area around a ship which a navigator would like to keep free with respect to other ships and stationary obstacles however determining a ship domain includes many unsolved problems and as of yet no ship domain model has been widely accepted although a wide variety of ship domain models exists in the literature szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 there are several limitations such as an insufficient training sample zhu et al 2001 leaving out human and environmental factors wang et al 2009 and complex shapes pietrzykowski 2008 because the ship domain approach and the ncr approach can be nested in this study we consider the concept of the ship domain a navigation specific tool of ncr therefore studies calculating the collision risk index with the help of the ship domain are also examined here in order to clarify uncertain points of ncr terminology we have employed the classification system proposed by goerlandt and montewka 2015 for scientific approaches to risk analysis based on their classification system the ncr assessment models proposed in the reviewed studies were grouped under three categories strong realist moderate realist and moderate constructivist the motivation behind this classification is to provide insight into which risk approach the various ncr assessment models have adopted in this section we scrutinized several ncr assessment models one by one and grouped them in respect to their approaches and parameters which separately highlight the various features of the models table 3 presents an initial review of the aims and risk assessment models of the ncr studies 3 1 strong realist models the characteristics of strong realist models are defined by goerlandt and montewka 2015 as follows i risk is considered to exist objectively as a physical attribute of a system and the analysis is presented as an estimate of this underlying true risk ii it exclusively relies on data collected from the system or on engineering science model iii expert judgment is not considered a source of evidence iv evidence uncertainty is not considered v stakeholders are not involved in the process of analysis vi there exists a strict separation between facts and non epistemic values vii contextual risk attributes are not considered viii there exists a strong relation to established risk decision criteria based on these characteristics the specific studies proposing strong realist models for ncr assessment were ascertained as an initial study hilgert and baldauf 1997 proposed a rule based collision risk model of ship to ship encounters for open sea waterways this study formulated a four level risk based on cpa closest point of approach and proposed critical limits hydrodynamic safe passing distance c h safe passing distance c a safe range r a critical range r c and manoeuvring range r m the safe passing distance spd indicating the acceptable safe distance in a ship to ship encounter and its formulation are presented in eq 1 below 1 c a f x l m a x c g in this equation f x is a factor determined by visibility and encounter situation l m a x is the maximum ship length and c g is the maximum positioning and evaluation error c h and r c indicate the limit of an unacceptable dcpa and distance in a two ship encounter respectively the authors assume danger of collision when the cpa and the distance between the two ships are smaller than c h and r c respectively however the calculation of c h was not determined because of the impracticability of measuring the real distance between two encountering ships therefore the authors preferred to determine c h from a practical point of view another important study featuring a strong realist model was authored by smierzchalski 2005 proposed a hexagon shaped area of danger to state ncr the author formulated six distances from the center of the ship to establish the safe navigation manoeuvring area with the help of tcpa dcpa own speed relative speed ship length and ship breadth parameters stern and port side safe distances were assumed to be no less than 0 5 miles also the author suggests that the safe distance in front of the bow should be 2 to 3 miles anything below this distance results in collision risk accordingly ncr is directly related to distance therefore safe threshold distances have been calculated based on other parameters for example the longitudinal dimension l d of the proposed domain is presented in eq 2 2 l d l v 1 26 30 v u where l is the own ship length v and u are ship speed and error in estimating ship length respectively smierzchalski 2005 has proposed a definition of risk degree as a mathematical function of tcpa and dcpa as shown in eq 3 3 min r a e d c p a d b 2 b 0 1 t b t c p a c d d c p a d b t c p a n t b 0 d c p a d b t c p a n t b where d b and t b are the safe distance and time to safe distance defined by the proposed hexagon shaped area a b c d are the regulated parameters as can be seen in equation 2 this hexagon shaped area is based on speed allowing to set critical limits d b and t b dynamically however employing the parameters of tcpa and dcpa has been considered useless by szlapczynski 2006 thereafter the temporary approach factor f m i n that is the ratio of the distance between the two encountering ships to minimum acceptable distance was proposed for integrating various ship domain models when appropriate this factor was proposed due to the misleading obscure aspect of dcpa in ship domain violation as discussed in section 3 2 this study proposed a modified ncr model of lisowski 2004 as shown in eq 4 4 r a 1 f m i n 2 a 2 t f m i n t s 2 a 3 f t 1 2 while a 1 a 2 and a 3 are coefficients dependent on the state of visibility ship length and a kind of water area t f m i n and t s are the time to reaching the temporary approach f min value and the time necessary to plan and perform a collision avoidance manoeuvre respectively f t is the instantaneous scale factor of ship domain and f m i n the minimum value of f t which utilizes the minimum distance between two ships on any given course in fact the difference between these two parameters is the position of the target ship this approach substitutes dcpa and tcpa with f m i n and f t which take into account the ship itself rather than the safe distance from the ship fig 5 illustrates the graphical representation of f t and f m i n furthermore szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 have further extend the former study szlapczynski 2006 by introducing two new parameter called degree of domain violation and time to domain violation liu and liu 2006 have defined collision risk as a function of dcpa and tcpa as shown in eq 5 5 r i s k t 0 d c p a t Œª d c p a 1 e 2 d c p a t Œª d c p a 2 2 e 2 t c p a t 2 2 d c p a t Œª d c p a here the parameter Œª dcpa was introduced determined by restricted visibility and the condition of sight the proposed risk definition was employed to evaluate the trainees manoeuvrings in collision avoidance situations the study has introduced a feasible methodology allowing to learn cases by recording important data balmat et al 2009 introduced the maritime risk assessment marisa model with the adoption of a fuzzy approach this model combined static and dynamic risk factors year of construction flag state gross tonnage the number of companies duration and type of detentions were determined as static factors while sea state wind speed visibility and night or day time were determined as dynamic factors with this study balmat et al 2009 modified the work of degr√© 2003 with the contribution of weather conditions pointing to the dynamic nature of ship navigation in 2011 balmat et al 2011 revised the marisa model by including speed fuzzy and shipping evaluation non fuzzy while the marisa model does not exactly portray the ncr and focuses on oil pollution prevention at sea the modified version illustrates the individual risk of vessels for all situations including collision the risk assessment architecture of the study is presented in fig 6 speed evolution in this study considers zigzags or successive acceleration decelerations as suspect manoeuvrings these suspect manoeuvrings are detected by calculating the orthorhombic distance with the last and instantaneous geographic positions wang 2010 introduced a new ncr model based on the dynamic calculation of the ship domain this study determines the size of the ship domain by means of four radii fore aft starboard and port which can be elliptical or convex the determined ship domain is then transformed into a fuzzy environment to assess the individual ncr with the help of eq 6 6 r e x p 2 x 1 s g n x œÉ f o r e 1 s i g n x œÉ a f t k 2 y 1 s g n y œÉ s t a r 1 s i g n y œÉ p o r t k where œÉ f o r e œÉ a f t œÉ s t a r œÉ p o r t are related to the proposed ship domain radius x and y are longitudinal and lateral distances between the ships respectively the power k determines the shape of the ship domain s g n x and s g n y are either negative or positive depending on the sign of the distances this equation proposes the spatial collision risk of the navigating ship whose ship domain changes dynamically comparison of the proposed model with existing ship domain models in simulation presents more coherent in reaction time collision risk awareness for each encounter situation modifying existing ship domain models is a distinguished perspective although it can lead to heavy dependency on preferred ship domain model thanks to this insight the proposed model enables overcoming the limitation of traffic geometry in addition to commonly known parameters such as dcpa and tcpa several authors have introduced navigation specific variables in order to take ncr assessment further for instance bukhari et al 2013 proposed the parameter of the variance of compass degree vcd which is the difference between two consecutive bearings in this study the parameters vcd dcpa and tcpa were used to construct an ncr assessment model these parameters were transformed into fuzzy membership functions illustrated in fig 7 and the ncr assessment model was structured as a fuzzy rule based model in fact vcd is the difference between two consecutive bearings representing the degree of the change of the bearing the aim of this study was to construct an automatic collision risk assessment interface lightning the workload of vts officers smolarek and ≈õniegocki 2013 accepted wind speed as an important determinant for safe manoeuvring in restricted waters the authors analysed the risk by taking into consideration the parameters of ship speed wind speed and wind direction with a generalized linear model the fitted model was validated by a chi square approach the proposed ncr model assumes a higher risk degree when the ship position is far from the centreline although the relation between the parameters and the risk degree has not been examined it can be pointed out that the speed parameter clearly has the highest linear relationship with the risk degree in addition to the above mentioned models nonlinear support vector machines svm were employed by gang et al 2016 in order to estimate the collision risk index the collision risk estimation model proposed in this study is similar to that of ahn et al 2012 however gang et al used fuzzy comprehensive evaluation theory without expert knowledge instead of the fuzzy inference rules acquired from the knowledge of watching officers the membership function formulations of the parameters of dcpa tcpa distance relative bearing and velocity ratio are presented in eqs 7 11 respectively these membership functions are similar to those presented in chen et al 2015 7 u d c p a 1 d c p a 1 d 2 d c p a d 2 d 1 2 d 1 d c p a d 2 0 d c p a d 2 8 u t c p a 1 t c p a 1 t 2 t c p a t 2 t 1 2 t 1 t c p a t 2 0 t c p a t 2 9 u d r 1 0 d r 1 d 2 d r d 2 d 1 2 d 1 d r d 2 0 d r d 2 10 u

defined as a function of speed and d 1 and d 2 Œ∏ t are the relative position of the target ship from the own ship k is the velocity ratio of the two vessels here ncr is defined as the weighted product of these membership functions the output of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is employed as the collision risk label of a support vector machine model utilizing own ship speed target ship speed own ship position target ship position the distance between the two ships and relative bearing however details about the data selection and the determination of collision risk for training and testing data are equivocal and the authors recommend actual vessel data for applicability in addition to the proposed limits of hilgert and baldauf 1997 such as hydrodynamic safe passing distance c h safe passing distance c a and safe range r a wen et al 2016 evaluated the safe passing distance spd as safe distance of approach sda regarding colreg rule 8 and proposed limit values for ship to ship

t 1 and t 2 are time parameters indicating the time remaining to the last collision avoidance manoeuvring in fact the authors assume the existence of a collision risk when the distance of two ships is 8 nautical miles yet they also consider 12 ship lengths as the distance of last minute avoidance 3 2 moderate realist models moderate realist models are quite similar to the strong realist approach with only a few dissimilarities the characteristics of moderate realist models were defined by goerlandt and montewka 2015 as follows i it heavily relies on data collected from the system or on engineering natural science models ii expert judgment is considered a source of evidence but knowledge generated by experts is seen as a last resort and or is seen as truth approaching iii evidence uncertainty is not considered or only sporadically mentioned at harbour entrances vts systems can be overloaded when assessing the danger of navigation if the waterway is too congested therefore kao et al 2007 proposed a fuzzy logic method to alleviate this problem three fuzzy membership functions speed length of ship and sea state were proposed to determine the radius of a guarding ring the fuzzy guarding ring was derived from the concept of the ship domain and based on the idea that the vessel s collision risk increases when the ship domains become closer as shown in fig 8 the length of the radical axis a b of the two circles o 1 and o 2 considered the ship domains increases whenever two ships are approaching according to the pythagorean theorem however the interaction between the two guarding rings was evaluated with the help of the membership functions of the proposed parameters instead of any mathematical calculation a total of 27 fuzzy rules were proposed for the degree of the guarding ring without any expert judgement furthermore the study proposed a calculation of the degree of collision risk u d a n g e r as can be seen in equation 14 14 u d a n g e r 1 Œ¥ t 0 1 2 Œ¥ t œÑ 2 0 Œ¥ t œÑ 2 2 Œ¥ t œÑ œÑ 2 œÑ 2 Œ¥ t œÑ 0 Œ¥ t œÑ the parameter œÑ is the safety time interval obtained by the membership function of speed and Œ¥ t is the discrepancy of two collision points while the definitions of œÑ and Œ¥ t were not clear it was assumed that œÑ is the time to make the minimum safe distance described as 0 9 nautical miles according to goodwin 1975 the authors recommended this model as a tool for monitoring all ships in a congested harbour entrance however the author did not take into consideration the effect of multi ship encounters another important example of a moderate realist model was proposed by mou et al 2010 this model made use of the safety assessment model for shipping and offshore on the north sea samson s accident number estimation model to define collision risk in busy waters the authors added the tcpa cpa and encounter angle parameters as multipliers to samson s model the equation of the proposed collision risk model is as follows 15 r c o l l i r b a s i c r t c p a r c p a r a n g l e in the equation r b a s i c stands for basic risk static risk factors ship type size and so on and r t c p a and r c p a represent the exponential function of tcpa and cpa respectively r t c p a and r c p a are determined based on expert opinion r a n g l e is a predetermined factor based on the course difference between the own and the target ship the unique characteristic of this model is the estimation of cpa by using course difference length of ship speed and relative difference separately with linear regression and ais database this model which includes a maritime accident data set was proposed as a helpful tool for monitoring risk due to severity of maritime traffic since questionnaires incorporating perceived risk level can be quite subjective ahn et al 2012 proposed an interviewee independent method which can be deemed a pioneering work this is achieved with the help of the rule based collision risk table modified from the study by hara and hammer 1993 as well as the fuzzy membership functions of dcpa koyama and yan 1987 and tcpa hara and hammer 1993 acquired the knowledge of watching officers from experimental results using a ship handling simulator because the number of rules obtained from hara and hammer 1993 was insufficient to represent the degree of the collision risk the study by ahn at al 2012 employed an adaptive network based fuzzy inference system to increase the number of membership functions of dcpa and tcpa the modified membership functions of dcpa and tcpa and the modified fuzzy inference table are presented in fig 9 and table 4 respectively the output of the fuzzy inference system was employed as the collision risk label of a neural network model utilizing the own ship s speed target ship speed the own ship s heading target ship heading the distance between the two ships and ship domain zhao et al 1996 as input vector restricted visibility cockcroft et al 2012 topographical characteristics lee and rhee 2001 and high speed constraints were also adopted in this ncr evaluation in order to approximate a complex maritime environment simulation results show that a neural network based model is more realistic than the fuzzy inference system ahn et al 2012 also designated different ship domains for restricted and open sea areas having particular idiosyncrasies the ncr assessment methodology of this study is quite feasible for the maritime environment while the severity of navigation can be evaluated on the basis of navigation specific parameters such as dcpa tcpa and vcd the actual parameters affecting the severity of navigation are system parameters such as speed heading and distance zhang et al 2016 pushed their previous study zhang et al 2015 forward by including in the model a new parameter called minimum distance to collision montewka et al 2010 vessel size was also employed in the model together with a ship domain concept instead of the distance between the two ships as shown in eq 16 16 v c r o x y z l Œ± c m d t c k x l Œ± 1 y c m d t c in this equation c m d t c is the minimum distance to collision derived from another study montewka et al 2010 l Œ± is the distance between the own ship and the ship domain in the line of the other ship conducted scenarios shown that the model is not valid near harbours because of the close distances in fact the study did not define the risk degree in encounters of less than one nautical mile the authors also stated that the vcro values of scenarios were in line with the expert judgments utilized as a source of evidence zhao et al 2016 proposed an ncr assessment approach based on evidential reasoning for autonomous navigation in unmanned surface vessels the authors pointed out that ncr assessment is the foundation for autonomous navigation and has three significant characteristics ambiguity uncertainty and instantaneity the dcpa tcpa the distance between the two vessels relative bearing and relative velocity based fuzzy membership functions derived from other studies li and pang 2013 zhou and wu 2004 were employed to assess the ncr zhao et al defined the ncr as a weighted multiplication of fuzzy membership functions utilized in the calculation of the belief degrees for evidential reasoning as shown in eq 17 17 n c r n 1 n Œª l n Œ± l n Œª u n n n 1 n Œ± l n 0 25 0 5 Œ± l n is the risk representation value of grade l n with belief degree Œª l n is the confidence degree of risk grade and Œª u n is the representation of the overall uncertainty that brings together all factors basically belief degree is formulated as in eq 18 18 Œ± n i Œ≥ i Œ≤ d o w n Œ≤ u p Œ≤ d o w n Œ≥ i is the value of the membership function between 0 and 1 Œ≤ d o w n and Œ≤ u p are the risk interval into which Œ≥ i falls here the ncr assessment is not basically the weighted multiplication of membership functions as in other studies chen et al 2015 2014 xu et al 2010 but a combination of belief degrees furthermore this study calculates the ncr in order to activate the prompt alert of collision avoidance for an unmanned surface vehicle because the previous model zhang et al 2016 employed a static ship domain and was not capable of giving any information about the dynamic state of the ship zhang et al 2017 applied a different domain model kijima and furukawa 2003 to display the dynamic ncr of ship navigation the proposed model combines the merged vcro average vcro rank of two encountered ships the vcro change rate and the ship pair size and classified them with the help of fuzzy clusters fuzzy rules were established with the fuzzy k means method together with expert knowledge to assess ncr utilizing the ship domain model of kijima and furukawa 2003 enabled the integration of ship manoeuvring characteristics into the system distinguishing the new vcro model from prior studies the ship manoeuvring characteristics of the model include the time to a 90 degree heading and the tactical diameter indicating the response time and pattern of a ship when changing direction in case of emergency another advantage of this over prior vcro models is its dynamic state enabling one to monitor dynamic changes in ship to ship encounters 3 3 moderate constructivist models unlike strong and moderate realist models moderate constructive models assume risk to be the mental construct of an expert while the data come from the system the risk degree is extracted from the expert s knowledge according to the system data the main characteristics of the moderate constructivist model are described by goerlandt and montewka 2015 as follows i the analysis is presented as the reflection of an assessor s mental construct ii it relies on data collected from the system engineering natural science models as well as expert judgment iii evidence uncertainty is not considered iv stakeholders are not involved in analysis process v non epistemic values are excluded from the risk characterization vi contextual risk attributes are not considered vii there exists a clear link to decision making in terms of a managerial review where other decision criteria are considered along with the risk analysis the study by inoue 2000 constitutes one example of a moderate constructivist model the author proposed an environmental stress model based on linear regression employing the time to collision ttc parameter to estimate ship handling difficulty in restricted and congested waterways the ttc parameter can be assumed to consist of the time needed to reach any obstacle or ship the proposed model is written as follows 19 s j l i s j s i Œ± Œ≤ t t c the linear relationship between ttc and stress level of officer on watch oow is introduced by the Œ± and Œ≤ coefficients s j l i and s j s i are perceived stress values according to the regression model on the relative bearing of i th degree of the own ship from land objects and other ships respectively this environmental stress model was used for the comparison of two navigational aids arpa and recommended collision danger presentation by pedersen et al 2003 subsequently chin and debnath 2009 utilized ordered probit regression model to formulate collision risk in port waters the model was fitted with survey results of the perceived collision risk from 160 pilots based on the tcpa and dcpa variables for night day condition and four different vessel classes the regression model of the study is presented as follows 20 t m Œ≤ 1 d c p a Œ≤ 2 t c p a while t m indicates ordered risk level Œ≤ 1 and Œ≤ 2 are regression coefficients the results obtained from the study show that dcpa is more prone to affect perceived collision risk than is tcpa this ncr model was utilized in the navigational traffic conflict technique debnath and chin 2010 to overcome the limitation of the number of collision records in any given waterway such as port anchorages debnath and chin 2016 the navigational traffic conflict technique based on the ncr model presents a practical way to overcome the limitations of the dependent variables of ncr assessments in port waters the same methodology may be applicable and useful for other spaces of maritime transportation however perera et al 2011 introduced a fuzzy rule based decision making system to improve the safety of oceangoing vessels the ncr degree is based on distance relative bearing of the target vessel encounter angle and relative speed fig 10 offers a graphical representation of encounter situations own ship and target ship t collision regions are divided into eight regions in accordance which collision avoidance decisions and an ncr is formulated the boundary and limits of the regions i ii ii iv and so on distances r v d r a etc and other parameters are defined as a fuzzy membership functions although the study has focused on extracting all encounter situation for collision avoidance the colreg rules and regulations have been considered for the critical collision condition situation in near proximity the authors applied expert knowledge in order to fill this gap however the steps behind the expert knowledge extraction have not been presented even so their ncr assessment approach can provide evidence for near proximity encounters where regulation improvements can be made within colreg however several studies goerlandt et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 criticized the parameters dcpa and tcpa as they lead to obscure risk interpretation this criticism is premised on the idea that a low cpa value does not signify a risky encounter if the bow cross range the distance at which the second vessel passes ahead of the bow of the first vessel is wide in other words port to port or starboard to starboard encounter types can be safe even though the cpa value is low to overcome this deficiency zhang et al 2015 proposed a vessel conflict ranking operator vcro to evaluate the severity of two ship encounters the mathematical function of the model was built based on the distance between the two ships x the relative speed y and the difference between their headings z as follows 21 v c r o x y z k x 1 y m sin z n sin 2 z k m n represents the coefficients estimated by the least square method and these coefficients have been determined based on expert judgement harbour approaches were excluded from the application of the model this exclusion emphasizes the idiosyncrasies of different waterways the focus of the study was to extract the near miss collision data to evaluate the maritime transportation safety rather than to assess ncr in addition to employing tcpa and dcpa which do not fully state the ship encounters level of severity lopez santander and lawry 2017 also adopted relative situation head on crossing overtaking color red green and trajectory variability erratic not erratic as ncr estimation parameters the results of this ordered probit model revealed that dcpa has the most significant effect on the perceived risk with the highest absolute coefficient value 0 395 by contrast the estimate of the tcpa coefficient constitutes the lowest value 0 0249 which is a surprising result for the maritime environment the performance of the model was evaluated based on the data set of the original questionnaire s responses assuming that collision avoidance is the ultimate objective of assessing risk the study was proposed a pathfinding algorithm employing the risk distribution of any given vessel since it is not feasible to examine all ncr studies in equal detail we introduce information on other ncr assessment studies chen et al 2014 perera and guedes soares 2015 ren et al 2011 etc in tables 3 and 5 4 application of ncr assessments with collision avoidance this section reviews navigational collision avoidance studies that have adopted ncr assessment procedures in these studies ncr assessment processes have been presented as a complementary part of navigational collision avoidance systems however collision avoidance can be also achieved with the help of any established method lopez santander and lawry 2017 other than ncr assessment the studies discussing collision avoidance systems with ncr assessment include those presented here a pioneering work szlapczynski 2006 proposed a numerical algorithm mainly based on finding a safe value f min for any course in the case of domain violation f m i n 1 provoking the ship domain s rotation rotating the ship domain leads to a new ship domain this new ship domain is determined by a new course in the case of domain violation also ahn et al 2012 employed the ncr threshold value of 0 6 to provoke collision avoidance action with speed and course alteration in this study an expert system tool was utilized to determine the proper order for safe manoeuvring particularly for those complex encounter situations where the colreg regulations are insufficient furthermore pietrzykowski et al 2012 introduced an integrated navigational decision support system navdec to meet the trend of converting navigational information systems into decision support systems the collision risk estimation approach was implemented with the help of colreg the principles of good sea practice and criteria used by marine officer experts in the navdec thereafter tam and bucknall 2013 employed proxy metric based collision risk values to determine the colreg compliant collision avoidance manoeuvre including a standard change in heading 30 another course alteration procedure was proposed by wen et al 2016 in case the ncr exceeds a level of 0 5 the proposed course alteration occurs in 0 1 increments a further colreg compliant real time collision avoidance model was introduced by zhao et al 2016 the authors utilized a generalized orca algorithm for their real time collision avoidance model since then lopez santander and lawry 2017 introduced their ncr estimation model to avoid collision situations by adopting an optimization algorithm safe navigation routes can be obtained with the application of the risk cost function of the optimization algorithm in a multi ship encounter environment the above mentioned studies altogether demonstrate that the ncr assessment process facilitates not only a risk threshold value at which the avoidance manoeuvre is initiated but also the timing of when to stop the precautions substantiating the ncr and the collision avoidance relationship moreover ncr assessments were also adopted for trajectory planning ≈õmierzchalski 2005 maritime traffic monitoring mou et al 2010 near miss risk zhang et al 2017 vts support bukhari et al 2013 preventing oil pollution balmat et al 2011 and performance evaluation pedersen et al 2003 5 parameter analysis this section will review the studies from the perspective of the parameters used in ncr assessment studies in a comprehensive manner as a first finding of this section the number and rate of occurrence of the parameters used in these studies are presented in table 5 table 5 reveals that more than half of the ncr studies have adopted dcpa and tcpa in their risk assessment model also relative bearing distance speed and length feature as the other most commonly used parameters the distribution of the most commonly employed twenty parameters m1 to m20 is introduced in table 6 it is virtually impossible to capture any trend of the number of parameters increasing or decreasing by year additionally most studies prefer to employ dcpa and tcpa in spite of their proposed alternatives the relative bearing parameter has not featured in studies after 2010 it is also noteworthy that there exists no significant discrimination between the parameters presented in table 5 from the perspective of area specific application for the open seas or restricted waters as seen in table 6 the distribution of the other twenty parameters m21 to m40 are presented in appendix a as a matter of fact mariners judgment about collision risk is also heavily dependent on these parameters also some of these parameters are clearly laid out in colreg for example colreg rule 7 b recommends the use of radar equipment which determines tcpa and dcpa as early warning of collision risk moreover rule 7 d assumes collision risk in a steady relative bearing however environmental parameters sea state wind water depth day night visibility have rarely been employed although they are major factors affecting ship dynamics and mariners judgment we have analysed the distribution of the ten most frequent parameters m1 m10 in respect to the risk approaches the results obtained are illustrated in fig 11 in order to clarify parameter preference as seen in fig 11 the parameters tcpa dcpa relative bearing distance speed and length are used in each risk approach while the visibility and breadth parameters only occur in the strong realist approach the day night parameter is not employed in moderate realist risk approaches the general tendency of risk approaches regarding the parameter selection may give insight for future research not only to criticize as in the studies of goerlandt et al 2015 and zhang et al 2015 but also to support the parameters 6 discussion in this section we emphasize both current and complemental issues of ncr assessments in order to support the consistency of ncr assessments with the findings of our literature review firstly although the parameters clearly underlined by colreg have been widely employed hydro meteorological data such as wind current and wave height which colreg disregards have rarely received attention in ncr assessment studies furthermore the current speed affecting the ship movement especially in narrow channels did not directly figure in any of the ncr studies as seen in table 5 however several authors kijima and furukawa 2003 pietrzykowski et al 2017 in their studies on collision avoidance manoeuvring stress the necessity of hydro meteorological data in fact hydro meteorological conditions affect the severity of encounter situations in the eye of the oow there may be three reasons behind the limited attention given to hydro meteorological data the first may be the shortcoming of the limit values or recommendations of the hydro meteorological conditions for safe navigation in colreg the second may be the dominance of several navigation specific parameters such as tcpa and dcpa not only in colreg but also in the maritime industry furthermore dcpa and tcpa remain an industry standard in collision risk and collision avoidance systems chin and debnath 2009 the third may be the difficulty to calculate hydro meteorological effects on the ship yet there exist established standards for calculating wind current and wave height force on the ship for example the recommendations set by the british standard institution and the ocimf sigtto oil companies international marine forum society of international gas tanker and terminal operators ltd 1995 present applicable formulas for the calculation of hydro meteorological effects as example the wind force calculation formulas on any given ship are presented in eq 22 24 bsi 2016 22 f t w c t w œÅ a a l v w 2 10 4 23 f l w c l w œÅ a a l v w 2 10 4 24 f w i n d f t w f l w f t w and f l w are transverse and longitudinal wind forces in kilonewton respectively œÅ a is density of the air in k g m 3 a l is the longitudinal projected area of the vessel above the waterline and v w is the design wind speed m sec c t w and c l w are the transverse and longitudinal wind force coefficients for aft and bow respectively this calculation is more complex than the calculation of tcpa and dcpa however the inclusion of hydro meteorological forces may increase the reliability of the ncr assessment in terms of the above mentioned standards therefore it seems to be of value to incorporate hydro meteorological limit recommendations for each type of ship in colreg secondly in the literature there are no specific standards for critical limits safe distance or time distance of last minute avoidance for ncr as mentioned above different authors have attempted to define these limits within their formulations or assumptions based on their experience however critical limits spd sda and time distance of last minute avoidance can change based on environmental and dynamic factors as well as the area navigated furthermore limits can be interpreted differently by each mariner for instance while wen et al 2016 defined the distance of last minute avoidance as 12 times the ship length xu et al 2010 proposed it as the multiplication of visibility water area status human factor and distance of last minute action moreover tam and bucknall 2013 and xu et al 2010 assumed an spd of 0 25 and 1 nautical miles respectively yet smierzchalski and michalewicz 1998 stated that spd depends on weather conditions sailing area and ship speed undoubtedly the reason behind the attempts to come up with different critical limits can be found in the fact that there exist no established limit values for safe navigation to be incorporated in ncr assessment furthermore reliance on good seamanship in the case of collision avoidance which colreg recommends in ample time may foster this tendency until more concrete limits are established however in addition to critical limits some distance limits specifications can be incorporated in ncr assessment studies for example imo regulations imo 2002 limit the maximum admissible tactical diameter and advance of newly built ships to 5 and 4 5 ship length respectively also the stopping ability of the vessel in case of a full astern crash stop should generally not exceed 15 ship lengths according to imo imo 2002 although these are not limits concerning safe distance they can provide information about the manoeuvring capability of ships and may be incorporated in last minute avoidance actions thirdly ncr studies are lacking in terms of reliable validation regardless of this deficiency strong realist models not considering expert judgment prevail among the ncr assessment studies due to the fact that the severity judgment concerning ncr is more complex than in any other transportation mode validation of the ncr assessment models is subjective rather than objective therefore goerlandt and kujala 2014 proposed a comparative approach to evaluate the reliability of any ship collision risk analysis the proposed approach can reveal the consistency and accuracy of models by re running them with different inputs data method frequency and so on therefore employing the comparative approach of goerlandt and kujala 2014 may improve the reliability of ncr assessment models the current literature on ncr assessment discusses only open and congested restricted sea areas as shown in table 6 the studies on port approach manoeuvring has not been given adequate consideration in the literature port approach manoeuvrings include not only navigation in port areas but also berthing at the pier until the ship stops as ports constitute the gateways of the maritime transportation network ncr assessments that consider port approach manoeuvring will offer a most valuable contribution to maritime transportation risk analysis 7 conclusion this study has attempted to classify ncr assessment studies based on a systematic approach and to examine in detail several of these studies according to their unique characteristics this approach has revealed not only the great variety of studies but also the gaps to be filled by future research trends in parameter selection from which future ncr studies can benefit have also been evaluated as a result this literature review may support navigational decision support system proposal studies in maritime transportation with the aim of enhancement of autonomous ship concept such that researchers may attach more importance to parameter selection in the context of colreg and the model they employ as recommendation for future work we suggest that considering wind current and wave height effects on a ship s dynamic as well as establishing concrete safety limits in spite of colreg s lack of emphasis on these factors can promote the coherence of ncr assessment models in addition all studies examine the open sea and congested restricted sea areas as shown in table 6 it is also found that the lack of studies concerning port approach manoeuvring can be considered as an important gap in the literature as ports constitute the gateways of the maritime transportation network we also recommend that future studies address ncr assessments considering port approach manoeuvring furthermore the validation of ncr assessment models should be conducted in a systematic way as proposed by goerlandt and montewka 2015 this approach will improve ncr assessment studies in the domain of maritime transportation appendix a employed parameters other parameters not mentioned in the study have been presented in table a1 table a1 distribution of other parameters m21 m41 in ncr studies table a1 authors m21 m22 m23 m24 m25 m26 m27 m28 m29 m30 m31 m32 m33 m34 m35 m36

22846,autonomous recovery technology utilized by autonomous underwater vehicles auv is facing enormous challenges resulting from rapid development in this paper the current research status of static and dynamic auv docking is first introduced then two styles of underwater dynamic docking devices captured style and guided style are designed in accordance with two commonly used underwater docking devices the two types of docking devices focusing on their respective constitution characteristics and working principles are introduced the analysis is conducted on kinematics and movement stability the two docking devices dynamic characteristics are analyzed using computational fluid dynamics cfd software known as star ccm the simulation results of the dynamic characteristics of the two docking devices are then compared finally a preliminary lake test for the stable wing is carried out through the analysis of the two underwater dynamic docking devices dynamic characteristics we obtain conclusions 1 the docking s stability is related to the relative position of hydrodynamic center point 2 the relationship between the hydrodynamic characteristics of these two underwater docking devices and the velocity and attack angle is not exactly the same 3 the velocity is an important factor affecting underwater dynamic docking or recycling an auv keywords docking stability analysis computational fluid dynamics cfd hydrodynamics mathematical model 1 introduction the vast unknowns presented by the ocean have always attracted attention from mankind and auv technology has been rapidly developed and widely applied in the marine science and military fields nouri et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2013 nicholson and healey 2008 however with its own limitations on energy and communications capabilities auv requires frequent recovery to supplement the energy to perform other missions in recent years many agencies have developed underwater fixed base stations in order to solve both of these problems jantapremjit and wilson 2007 stokey austinet al 2001 if an auv needs to supplement energy or transmit data the auv first needs to sail to the fixed base station s location to complete a docking mission before it performs the next task at present this static docking technology is relatively mature mainly consisting of three forms the first form is called captured style docking which requires the auv to have a mechanism capable of capturing a target such as a rope or a rod the advantage is that it can achieve omnidirectional docking has strong anti current and anti magnetic interference capability and exhibits a high success rate the disadvantage is that the structure of the docking base station is relatively complicated and some changes to auv s structure is required at the same time the typical representative case for this docking method is the odyssey ii underwater docking system meng et al 2017 the second form is known as guided style docking which requires the underwater docking device to have a guide cover to enable the auv to enter the docking pipe or docking cage device to complete the docking the advantage is that after the docking task is completed the docking device itself protects the auv from the impact of ocean currents further the underwater docking device is relatively simple the disadvantage is that the auv needs higher manipulation and motion control capabilities the typical representative case is the remus100 underwater docking system zhang et al 2017 the third form is called seated style docking which requires the docking device to have a platform suited to auv being located then captured by a positioning device on the platform this docking form is similar to aircraft landing on an aircraft carrier the advantage is that it has a relatively simple structure and high docking success rate the disadvantage is that it requires the auv to have strong self guidance and power systems the typical representative case is the marine bird underwater docking system of japan s kawasaki heavy industries fukasawa et al 2003 although fixed base stations can solve energy and data transmission problems for auvs they require the auv to reach a certain fixed position every time when an auv works in a wide area the round trip will waste a lot of time and energy besides this kind of fixed underwater base station also cannot finish the maintenance and repair work to an auv in order to solve the problems of fixed base station underwater dynamic docking technology is proposed yan and wu 2007a which works a bit like air refueling underwater dynamic docking technology is also one of the key technologies in the auv s recovery process with its widespread and growing use auv s recovery technology also faces tremendous challenges the traditional recovery technology is inefficient risky unable to work non stop and cannot be applied in dangerous areas which will be unable to meet the recovery performance requirements of modern underwater robots in recent years the research for auv recovery by usv has been prompted sarda 2016 brizzolara and chryssostomidis 2012 sarda et al 2014 especially due to the rapid development of unmanned surface vehicles usv zaghi et al 2016 peng et al 2017 however one of the key technologies of autonomous recovery is underwater dynamic docking at present underwater dynamic docking is mainly an improvement upon the first two methods of static docking yan and wu 2007b hanumant et al 2001 kim and lee 2011 allen et al 2006 captured style and guided style respectively in captured style dynamic docking the auv uses a v shaped device to capture ropes or rods towed by usv then moves along the guidance device to complete the recovery singh et al 2001 wu et al 2014 zhang 2013 the advantages of this dynamic capture approach are similar to those of the corresponding static capture approach in the recovery process in order to ensure the stability of the ropes or rods a stable wing is usually fixed below them which can greatly improve the recovery process s success rate guided style dynamic docking is where the auv docks with the guiding docking device towed by usv then enters a pipe or cage the advantages of this dynamic capture approach are similar to those of the corresponding static capture approach the concept design for autonomous recovery of remus100 from a selected catamaran usv named wam v was designed by florida atlantic university sarda and dhanak 2016 an unmanned launch recovery system and onboard manipulation and servicing system for different sizes of torpedoed auv from a monohull usv was designed by advanced technology research corporation a submerged docking cone towed by an usv mating with remus 100 was designed by kongsberg company circle 2012 the underwater dynamic docking technology is the prerequisite for successful autonomous recovery for auv therefore it is of great significance to study underwater dynamic docking technology in this paper section 1 introduces the underwater docking technology and recovery technology section 2 describes the mechanical design of captured style and guided style docking device in section 3 the stability analysis including static stability and dynamic stability of the docking device is discussed section 4 is the hydrodynamic analysis of the two types of docking devices the dynamic modeling analysis of the docking device is carried out in section 5 a simple test of the designed docking device is introduced in section 6 the numerical value of each force in section 5 is obtained through numerical simulation in section 4 the math model in section 5 provides some guidance for the stability and the control of the docking device section 6 is simply to test and verify the docking device 2 mechanical design referencing today s best dynamic docking devices two alternate underwater dynamic docking devices are designed in this paper captured style and guided style whose three dimensional diagrams are shown in fig 1 the captured style docking device is relatively simple in structure and consists of only one rope and a stable wing the capture device is usually mounted on front of auv there are different towing points on the upper portion of the stable wing and there is a fixed vertical board to increase the stability there are two rudders on the rear side of the stable wing to adjust attitude the guided style docking device has a relatively complex structure mainly including the stable wing guide cover and pressure tank the main function of stable wing is to increase the stability of the docking device the function of the guide cover is to guide the auv to enter the pipe or cage and then complete the connection with the auv the function of the pressure tank is mainly to provide a reliable working environment for the sensors controller which guides the auv to complete the docking task among them the captured style docking device can dock with different kinds of auvs as long as the auv has a v shaped clamping device and the guided style docking device generally docks with the torpedo shaped auv however the stable wing of the captured style docking device designed in this paper is consistent with the stable wing of the guided style docking device the relative sizes of the two docking devices are shown in table 1 3 stability analysis during the recovery process the docking device s stability is one of the key factors for success if the docking device s stability is good it will reduce the auv s sailing performance requirements otherwise it will increase the auv s sailing performance correspondingly taking the guided style docking device as an example its stability is divided into static stability and dynamic stability in general the underwater docking device is usually symmetrical about the vertical plane and the following is an example of the guided style docking device s sailing stability in the vertical plane the force analysis of the docking device in the towing process is shown in fig 2 through the force analysis we see that the main forces on the docking device include gravity buoyancy drag lift and towing force the drag lift and towing force usually vary depending on the velocity and the towing point s location normally the towing point will not coincide with the docking device s center of gravity as shown in fig 2 the distance from the center of gravity g to the towing force line is s the distance between the hydrodynamic point f and the center of gravity g is a the distance between the buoyancy point b and the center of gravity g is l f d is the docking device s drag f l is the docking device s lift f g is the docking device s gravity f b is the docking device s buoyancy f t is the towing force and the angle between f t and v is Œ∏ 3 1 static stability static stability is relatively simple similar to the floating body s stability in static state it has a certain practical value and a certain relationship with dynamic stability static stability is the dynamic stability under certain conditions when the docking device is exhibiting constant movement only one motion parameter changes assuming that the other parameters remain unchanged and only the movement tendency of the initial moment after the removal of the disturbance force is considered after the docking device deviates from the equilibrium position it is called static stability if the docking device tends to return to its previous equilibrium position otherwise it is called static instability to assess the docking device s stability here we just consider the trend of fluid dynamics caused by the attack angle Œ¥ Œ± if it is to promote the attack angle back to the original state then the docking device is stable vice versa is unstable when the docking device is disturbed instantaneously the fluid force and torque acting on the docking device will also change producing the corresponding attack angle Œ¥ Œ± force z and torque m respectively which can be expressed as 1 Œ¥ z œâ z œâ œâ 1 2 œÅ v l 2 z œâ œâ 2 Œ¥ m œâ m œâ œâ 1 2 œÅ v l 3 m œâ œâ and 3 Œ¥ m Œ¥ z Œ¥ Œ± where œâ is the vertical velocity of the docking device z œñ z œñ m œñ and m œñ are the hydrodynamic coefficients as shown in fig 2 when the hydrodynamic center point f is behind the center of gravity g a 0 the effect of m makes Œ¥ Œ± decrease the docking device s state is stable on the contrary if the hydrodynamic center point f is before the center of gravity g a 0 the effect of m makes Œ¥ Œ± increase the docking device s state is unstable state we can see that the attack angle s stability of docking device can be judged by the hydrodynamic point s location or the sign of the distance a between the hydrodynamic point f and the center of gravity which is also called the hydrodynamic center arm or called the static instability coefficient and a m z a 0 unstable state a 0 intermediate state a 0 stable state 3 2 dynamic stability while the dynamic stability is relatively in terms of static stability that is usually referred to as the movement stability chen et al 2017 dynamic stability refers to the stability of the docking device in dynamic external force moment under the action of acceleration and moment of inertia the docking device s dynamic stability of attack angle is the change of the attack angle with time after the interference is removed for the stable wing s stability the focus is to study the attack angle s stability if t Œ¥ Œ± 0 then the docking device is dynamic stable on the contrary it is unstable according to the linear equation of vertical motion of underwater vehicle the corresponding equations of attack angle are deduced as equation 4 where a3 a2 a1 and a0 are constant coefficients composed of hydrodynamic coefficients m Œ∏ and z Œ¥ are the hydrodynamic coefficients Œ¥ is the rudder angle and p is the dimensionless gravity of the docking device 4 a 3 Œ± a 2 Œ± a 1 Œ± a 0 Œ± m Œ∏ z Œ¥ Œ¥ m Œ∏ p when Œ¥ Œ± increases after the docking device is disturbed due to discuss the docking device s stability no steering no change of the static load so Œ¥ p m p 0 so the perturbation motion equation is simplified to equation 5 5 a 3 Œ± a 2 Œ± a 1 Œ± a 0 Œ± 0 the free perturbation motion equation of attack angle is a constant coefficient third order linear differential equation and its characteristic equation is equation 6 6 a 3 Œª 3 a 2 Œª 2 a 1 Œª a 0 Œª 0 the stability characteristics of docking device can be determined by the characteristics of the characteristic root of the free disturbance equation for example if Œªi i 1 2 3 are negative real numbers or complex numbers with negative real parts then when t Œ¥ Œ± 0 the attack angle has automatic stability after the docking device is disturbed and during a period of oscillation attenuation docking device will eventually return to the stable state if one of Œªi is a positive real number or a complex number with a real part the perturbation motion will not attenuate or oscillate and the motion is unstable it can be seen that the positive and negative of the real part of Œªi determines whether the docking device has motion stability and the magnitude of the negative value of the real part of Œªi determines the speed of the disturbance motion attenuation the process of analyzing the static stability and dynamic stability of docking device at the horizontal plane is similar to the analysis process of the vertical plane so it will not be introduced here in addition when the strong disturbances such as currents is encountered during the docking process the two rudders on the docking device will automatically adjust the state to keep the docking device stable during the recovery process the usv usually sails at a low velocity or at a certain point and the auv will sail to the usv at a greater velocity than usv besides when there is current the usv and auv should adjust their own heading according to the flow direction of the current that is the usv dragged the docking device to sail counter currently the auv should chase the usv at a faster velocity the counter current sail can improve the attitude control stability of the usv and the auv itself 4 cfd simulation analysis for underwater equipment especially underwater mobile equipment its hydrodynamic performance must be considered during the design stage and dynamic characteristics analysis stage wu et al 2010 with the rapid development of computer technology and cfd theory cfd technology is more and more widely used in various hydrodynamic performance research efforts compared with the traditional model test method and the semi empirical formula cfd technology is low cost rapid access to the hydrodynamic value of the underwater mobile equipment and can get the flow details easily so the cfd method has become an effective way to study the performance of various kinds of auv s drag propulsion manipulation and anti wave hu 2013 jagadeesh et al 2009 gu 2011 the cfd numerical software star ccm stoll and aviation 2015 is used in this paper to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics and to understand its stability and dynamics of the stable wing and the guided style docking device respectively in order to illustrate the credibility of star ccm s simulation results the star ccm s simulation accuracy is verified table 2 shows the result comparison of remus100 s drag by using the star ccm simulation and real test it can be seen from table 2 that the error between star ccm s simulation results and the model test results is only 1 which shows that the star ccm hydrodynamic calculation accuracy is high and meets the numerical simulation accuracy requirements therefore star ccm is chosen to use to simulate underwater docking devices 4 1 numerical simulation of stable wing the stable wing plays a crucial role both in captured style and guided style docking devices which can enhance the stability of the rope or guide cover next the dynamics characteristics of stable wing is analyzed including the sailing characteristics of stable wing at different velocities 0 5 m s 1 0 m s 1 5 m s 2 0 m s and different attack angles 0 3 6 9 12 4 1 1 velocity and attack angle s effect on the drag of stable wing generally the drag on the underwater equipment can be expressed as equation 7 where f d is the drag of underwater equipment œÅ is the density of water v is the velocity of the underwater equipment s is the reference area cd is drag coefficient 7 f d 1 2 c d œÅ s v 2 as shown in fig 4 under the same attack angle the drag on stable wing increases concurrently with velocity which is consistent with equation 7 and the hydrodynamic theory when the attack angle is 3 and the velocity is different the surface pressure profile of the stable wing is shown in fig 3 as seen in fig 3 as the velocity increases the high pressure area in front of the stable wing gradually increases resulting in a corresponding increase of the stable wing s drag under the case of other attack angles the drag on stable wing also has a similar relationship with the velocity similarly the stable wing s drag also increases correspondingly with the attack angle a larger attack angle means reference area s is relatively larger therefore according to equation 7 the drag on the stable wing will be correspondingly larger which is also consistent with the hydrodynamic theory we can see from fig 4 that when the attack angle is 3 or 0 the stable wing s drag is very close the corresponding drag of the stable wing is similar when the attack angle is 3 or 6 it is also a similar situation when the attack angle is 6 or 9 9 or 12 this means that when the velocity is the same the drag of stable wing sailing at a negative attack angle is greater than that at the corresponding positive attack angle the larger the attack angle the more obvious the drag increases with the velocity 4 1 2 velocity and attack angle s effect on the lift of stable wing similar to the drag calculation formula there is an empirical calculation formula for the lift where f l is the force of lift œÅ is the density of water v is the velocity of the underwater equipment s is the reference area cl is lift coefficient 8 f l 1 2 c l œÅ s v 2 the lift s simulation results show that the lift on the stable wing increases as the velocity increases as shown in fig 5 which is also consistent with equation 8 and the hydrodynamic theory since the stable wing is not horizontally symmetrical the stable wing s lift is not the same magnitude even in the case of a positive or negative attack angle as seen in fig 5 the lift on the stable wing increases as the attack angle increases and it varies greatly as attack angle fluctuates when the attack angle is 0 the lift on the stable wing is negative rather than 0 n which is good for the stable wing s stability similar to the drag the lift on the stable wing at the negative attack angle is greater than that at the corresponding positive attack angle the magnitude of the downward pressure generated by the stable wing at 0 3 6 and 9 is equal to the magnitude of the lift generated by the stable wing at 3 6 9 and 12 in addition the lift on stable wing is also related to its shape when the stable wing sails at 1 m s and at different attack angles the surface pressure profile of stable wing is shown in fig 6 when the attack angle is 3 6 9 and 12 the pressure on the lower surface of the stable wing is higher than that on the upper surface therefore the stable wing has the lift when it sails in the positive attack angle with the increase of attack angle the high pressure area red and orange area on front lower surface of the stable wing gradually increases the low pressure area on the upper edge surface of stable wing also gradually increases so the lift increases along with attack angle as seen in fig 6 when the attack angle is negative the high pressure area on the upper surface and the pressure difference between the upper surface and the bottom surface gradually increase with the increase of the attack angle this will produce a downward pressure which has the tendency to move the stable wing forward and downward and makes the rope more tensioned and tightened which makes the stable wing more stable through the simulation analysis we can see that the lift when stable wing sails at different attack angles is mainly caused by the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the stable wing 4 2 numerical simulation of guided style docking device the guided style docking device is based on the stable wing to increase the guide cover pressure tank and other structures so its hydrodynamic characteristics are different with only stable wing the following is some simulation when the guided style docking device moves at different velocities and different attack angles 4 2 1 velocity and attack angle s effect on the drag of guided style docking device fig 7 is a curve of the drag versus velocities when the guided style docking device moves at different velocities and the stable wing is in different attack angles similar to the change tendency of the stable wing s drag versus velocity the guided style docking device s drag also increases correspondingly with velocity which also complies with equation 7 and hydrodynamics theory as the guided style docking device has more structure than the stable wing it can be seen from the comparison between figs 7 and 4 that the guided type capture device s drag at different velocities is much greater than the stable wing s drag when the stable wing sails at the same velocity for example the stable wing s drag is 36 n when it moves at the attack angle of 12 and the velocity of 1 m s however the guided style docking device s drag is 96 n under the same conditions and when the velocity is different the change of the guided type docking device s drag is larger than that of the single stable wing different from the single stable wing the guided type docking device s drag changes little with the stable wing s attack angle as can be seen from fig 7 under the same velocity the changes of guided type docking device s drag are not obvious when stable wing is at the attack angles of 0 3 6 and 9 for example when the velocity is 0 5 m s the stable wing s drag is 2 n at the attack angle of 0 and the drag is 9 n at the attack angle of 12 the drag increases by 350 however under the same conditions the guided type docking device s drag is 24 n when the stable wing is at the attack angle of 0 and the drag is 25 n when the stable wing is at the attack angle of 12 the drag increases by 4 at other velocities the guided type docking device s drag has a similar relationship with the stable wing s attack angle 4 2 2 velocity and attack angle s effect on the lift of guided style docking device fig 8 is a curve of the lift versus velocities when the guided style docking device moves with the stable wing at different attack angles similar to the single stable wing s lift the guided style docking devices lift also increases with increased velocity but it does not change as obviously as the single stable wing s lift in addition the tendency of the guided style docking device s lift is quite different from that of the single stable wing as seen in fig 8 the guided style docking device s lift is positive when the stable wing s attack angle is 0 and even the stable wing s attack angle is 6 the guided style docking device s lift is still positive when the stable wing s attack angle is 9 the guided style docking device s lift becomes negative ie downward pressure which is desirable and stabilizes the docking device when the guided style docking device moves at 1 m s and at different attack angles the surface pressure profile of the guided style docking device is shown in fig 9 the pressure on the lower surface of the stable wing is low and the pressure on the upper surface is high this is because there are some components below the stable wing which create a barrier to water flow so it is consistent with the bernoulli equation therefore that is why the guided style docking device still has lift even if the stable wing has a small positive attack angle however as the stable wing s attack angle increases the high pressure area on the upper surface of the stable wing gradually increases and the high pressure area on the lower surface gradually decreases which reduces the guided style docking device s lift when the stable wing s attack angle is 9 the guided style docking device s lift becomes negative that is a downward pressure this is also the difference in lift between the captured style docking device and the guided style docking device for the captured style docking device under the same velocity its drag is relatively small when it is sailing at a negative attack angle and the stable wing can provide a certain downforce to increase the stability of the cable and itself therefore in the underwater dynamic docking process and the choice of the towing point the stable wing should be installed at a negative attack angle for the guided style docking device when the attack angle of the stable wing is about 0 9 the drag does not change significantly with the attack angle however for its lift the stable wing will provide downforce when the attack angle is greater than 9 therefore for the guided style docking device in order to increase the success rate of underwater dynamic docking the installation angle of the stable wing should be as large as possible negative attack angle but this will increase its sailing drag 5 mathematical model through the analysis of the docking device s force we can see that the main forces on docking device include gravity buoyancy drag lift and towing force towing force varies depending on the location of the towing point and the velocity normally the towing point will not coincide with the center of gravity of the stable wing just as shown in fig 2 during the auv recovery process the usv normally tows the underwater docking device in a direct motion at constant depth and the docking device is usually symmetrical about the vertical plane so the direct motion s stability is relatively easy to achieve therefore the constant deep motion is very important for the docking device the constant deep motion belongs to the vertical plane motion which means the vertical plane motion is particularly important xu 2013 ensuring stability of the vertical plane motion can increase the success rate of recovery the vertical plane motion refers to the movement that changes or maintains pitch and depth without changing the sailing direction in general the vertical plane motion for underwater moving objects includes two basic forms fixed depth motion and variable depth motion for the auv recovery process we only need to study the fixed depth motion s characteristics according to newton s second law when the underwater docking s coordinate is at the center of gravity the equation of motion in vertical plane is as follows dajka 2006 9 m u g w g q x œÉ m w g u g q z œÉ j y g q m g œÉ where x œÉ z œÉ and m g œÉ denote the total force in x axis z axis and total torque for the y axis respectively u g and u g denote the acceleration and velocity of the origin of body fixed coordinate system in x axis respectively w g and w g denote the acceleration and velocity of the origin of body fixed coordinate system in z axis respectively q and q denote the angular acceleration and velocity of the origin of body fixed coordinate system respectively j y g denotes the moment of inertia of the y axis the following equations can be obtained from fig 2 10 x f t cos Œ∏ f d z f t sin Œ∏ f b f l f g m g œÉ f l a f t s putting equation 10 into equation 9 the dynamic equation of stable wing in the vertical plane can be obtained 11 m u g w g q f t cos Œ∏ f d m w g u g q f t sin Œ∏ f b f l f g j y g q f l a f t s where f d and f l can be obtained by equation 7 and equation 8 when the docking device moves steadily u g w g q q 0 equation 11 is converted to equation 12 and the docking device s velocity is a constant f d and f l can also be obtained through the empirical formula then putting f d and f l into equation 12 we can get f t a and Œ∏ 12 f t cos Œ∏ f d 0 f t sin Œ∏ f b f l f g 0 f l a f t s 0 geometric relational auxiliary equations are as follows 13 d s sin Œ∏ c d b cot Œ∏ 6 tests both types of docking devices all use the stable wing so the stable wing s characteristics are very important in order to verify the stable wing s characteristics a portable usv is used to drag the stable wing for testing the stable wing s characteristics in xiu lake in june 2017 the tests focus on velocity s effect on the stable wing and the stable wing s stability a pressure sensor is connected at the end of the rope near the stable wing to obtain the depth information as is shown in fig 10 during the tests a towing process was carried out for both cases with the stable wing and without the stable wing the tests data analysis is shown in fig 11 when the velocity is constant the pressure sensor s value is larger in the case of with a stable wing than without a stable wing which indicates that the stable wing provides a certain downward pressure to tighten the rope to facilitate the successful capture besides the depth values measured by the pressure sensor are not the same under different velocities the depth value of stable wing decreases with the increase of velocity according to equation 12 we can see that once the velocity changes each force will change and eventually the stable wing will reach a new equilibrium state 7 conclusion two kinds of underwater dynamic docking devices are designed and their hydrodynamic characteristics at different velocities and different attack angles are analyzed by using the cfd software star ccm in addition static stability and dynamic stability of the docking device are carried out and the mathematical modeling in the vertical plane is carried out and finally the preliminary lake test of stable wing was tested through the above analysis the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the stable wing s stability is related to the relative position of hydrodynamic center point center of gravity and the towing point the stable wing s stability is higher when the hydrodynamic center is behind the center of gravity and the towing point is before the center of gravity 2 the captured style docking device and guided style docking device s drag increases with the velocity increasing the captured style docking device s lift also increases with increasing attack angle and the drag on stable wing at the negative attack angle is greater than that at the corresponding positive attack angle however the guided style docking device s drag does not change obviously with the increase of the stable wing s attack angle 3 the captured style docking device and guided style docking device s lift or downward pressure increases with the velocity increasing the captured style docking device provides the downward force when the stable wing s attack angle is 0 and the lift on stable wing at the negative attack angle is greater than that at the corresponding positive attack angle for the guided style docking device it suffers a downward force when the stable wing s attack angle is around 9 4 as the capture device s drag and lift are related to velocity the docking device s stability is also related to the velocity the steady sailing depth of the docking device corresponds to the different velocity in the process of recycling an auv all aspects of factors should be taken into account to determine a reasonable towing velocity acknowledgments grateful acknowledgement is given to the financial supports from the national natural science

22846,autonomous recovery technology utilized by autonomous underwater vehicles auv is facing enormous challenges resulting from rapid development in this paper the current research status of static and dynamic auv docking is first introduced then two styles of underwater dynamic docking devices captured style and guided style are designed in accordance with two commonly used underwater docking devices the two types of docking devices focusing on their respective constitution characteristics and working principles are introduced the analysis is conducted on kinematics and movement stability the two docking devices dynamic characteristics are analyzed using computational fluid dynamics cfd software known as star ccm the simulation results of the dynamic characteristics of the two docking devices are then compared finally a preliminary lake test for the stable wing is carried out through the analysis of the two underwater dynamic docking devices dynamic characteristics we obtain conclusions 1 the docking s stability is related to the relative position of hydrodynamic center point 2 the relationship between the hydrodynamic characteristics of these two underwater docking devices and the velocity and attack angle is not exactly the same 3 the velocity is an important factor affecting underwater dynamic docking or recycling an auv keywords docking stability analysis computational fluid dynamics cfd hydrodynamics mathematical model 1 introduction the vast unknowns presented by the ocean have always attracted attention from mankind and auv technology has been rapidly developed and widely applied in the marine science and military fields nouri et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2013 nicholson and healey 2008 however with its own limitations on energy and communications capabilities auv requires frequent recovery to supplement the energy to perform other missions in recent years many agencies have developed underwater fixed base stations in order to solve both of these problems jantapremjit and wilson 2007 stokey austinet al 2001 if an auv needs to supplement energy or transmit data the auv first needs to sail to the fixed base station s location to complete a docking mission before it performs the next task at present this static docking technology is relatively mature mainly consisting of three forms the first form is called captured style docking which requires the auv to have a mechanism capable of capturing a target such as a rope or a rod the advantage is that it can achieve omnidirectional docking has strong anti current and anti magnetic interference capability and exhibits a high success rate the disadvantage is that the structure of the docking base station is relatively complicated and some changes to auv s structure is required at the same time the typical representative case for this docking method is the odyssey ii underwater docking system meng et al 2017 the second form is known as guided style docking which requires the underwater docking device to have a guide cover to enable the auv to enter the docking pipe or docking cage device to complete the docking the advantage is that after the docking task is completed the docking device itself protects the auv from the impact of ocean currents further the underwater docking device is relatively simple the disadvantage is that the auv needs higher manipulation and motion control capabilities the typical representative case is the remus100 underwater docking system zhang et al 2017 the third form is called seated style docking which requires the docking device to have a platform suited to auv being located then captured by a positioning device on the platform this docking form is similar to aircraft landing on an aircraft carrier the advantage is that it has a relatively simple structure and high docking success rate the disadvantage is that it requires the auv to have strong self guidance and power systems the typical representative case is the marine bird underwater docking system of japan s kawasaki heavy industries fukasawa et al 2003 although fixed base stations can solve energy and data transmission problems for auvs they require the auv to reach a certain fixed position every time when an auv works in a wide area the round trip will waste a lot of time and energy besides this kind of fixed underwater base station also cannot finish the maintenance and repair work to an auv in order to solve the problems of fixed base station underwater dynamic docking technology is proposed yan and wu 2007a which works a bit like air refueling underwater dynamic docking technology is also one of the key technologies in the auv s recovery process with its widespread and growing use auv s recovery technology also faces tremendous challenges the traditional recovery technology is inefficient risky unable to work non stop and cannot be applied in dangerous areas which will be unable to meet the recovery performance requirements of modern underwater robots in recent years the research for auv recovery by usv has been prompted sarda 2016 brizzolara and chryssostomidis 2012 sarda et al 2014 especially due to the rapid development of unmanned surface vehicles usv zaghi et al 2016 peng et al 2017 however one of the key technologies of autonomous recovery is underwater dynamic docking at present underwater dynamic docking is mainly an improvement upon the first two methods of static docking yan and wu 2007b hanumant et al 2001 kim and lee 2011 allen et al 2006 captured style and guided style respectively in captured style dynamic docking the auv uses a v shaped device to capture ropes or rods towed by usv then moves along the guidance device to complete the recovery singh et al 2001 wu et al 2014 zhang 2013 the advantages of this dynamic capture approach are similar to those of the corresponding static capture approach in the recovery process in order to ensure the stability of the ropes or rods a stable wing is usually fixed below them which can greatly improve the recovery process s success rate guided style dynamic docking is where the auv docks with the guiding docking device towed by usv then enters a pipe or cage the advantages of this dynamic capture approach are similar to those of the corresponding static capture approach the concept design for autonomous recovery of remus100 from a selected catamaran usv named wam v was designed by florida atlantic university sarda and dhanak 2016 an unmanned launch recovery system and onboard manipulation and servicing system for different sizes of torpedoed auv from a monohull usv was designed by advanced technology research corporation a submerged docking cone towed by an usv mating with remus 100 was designed by kongsberg company circle 2012 the underwater dynamic docking technology is the prerequisite for successful autonomous recovery for auv therefore it is of great significance to study underwater dynamic docking technology in this paper section 1 introduces the underwater docking technology and recovery technology section 2 describes the mechanical design of captured style and guided style docking device in section 3 the stability analysis including static stability and dynamic stability of the docking device is discussed section 4 is the hydrodynamic analysis of the two types of docking devices the dynamic modeling analysis of the docking device is carried out in section 5 a simple test of the designed docking device is introduced in section 6 the numerical value of each force in section 5 is obtained through numerical simulation in section 4 the math model in section 5 provides some guidance for the stability and the control of the docking device section 6 is simply to test and verify the docking device 2 mechanical design referencing today s best dynamic docking devices two alternate underwater dynamic docking devices are designed in this paper captured style and guided style whose three dimensional diagrams are shown in fig 1 the captured style docking device is relatively simple in structure and consists of only one rope and a stable wing the capture device is usually mounted on front of auv there are different towing points on the upper portion of the stable wing and there is a fixed vertical board to increase the stability there are two rudders on the rear side of the stable wing to adjust attitude the guided style docking device has a relatively complex structure mainly including the stable wing guide cover and pressure tank the main function of stable wing is to increase the stability of the docking device the function of the guide cover is to guide the auv to enter the pipe or cage and then complete the connection with the auv the function of the pressure tank is mainly to provide a reliable working environment for the sensors controller which guides the auv to complete the docking task among them the captured style docking device can dock with different kinds of auvs as long as the auv has a v shaped clamping device and the guided style docking device generally docks with the torpedo shaped auv however the stable wing of the captured style docking device designed in this paper is consistent with the stable wing of the guided style docking device the relative sizes of the two docking devices are shown in table 1 3 stability analysis during the recovery process the docking device s stability is one of the key factors for success if the docking device s stability is good it will reduce the auv s sailing performance requirements otherwise it will increase the auv s sailing performance correspondingly taking the guided style docking device as an example its stability is divided into static stability and dynamic stability in general the underwater docking device is usually symmetrical about the vertical plane and the following is an example of the guided style docking device s sailing stability in the vertical plane the force analysis of the docking device in the towing process is shown in fig 2 through the force analysis we see that the main forces on the docking device include gravity buoyancy drag lift and towing force the drag lift and towing force usually vary depending on the velocity and the towing point s location normally the towing point will not coincide with the docking device s center of gravity as shown in fig 2 the distance from the center of gravity g to the towing force line is s the distance between the hydrodynamic point f and the center of gravity g is a the distance between the buoyancy point b and the center of gravity g is l f d is the docking device s drag f l is the docking device s lift f g is the docking device s gravity f b is the docking device s buoyancy f t is the towing force and the angle between f t and v is Œ∏ 3 1 static stability static stability is relatively simple similar to the floating body s stability in static state it has a certain practical value and a certain relationship with dynamic stability static stability is the dynamic stability under certain conditions when the docking device is exhibiting constant movement only one motion parameter changes assuming that the other parameters remain unchanged and only the movement tendency of the initial moment after the removal of the disturbance force is considered after the docking device deviates from the equilibrium position it is called static stability if the docking device tends to return to its previous equilibrium position otherwise it is called static instability to assess the docking device s stability here we just consider the trend of fluid dynamics caused by the attack angle Œ¥ Œ± if it is to promote the attack angle back to the original state then the docking device is stable vice versa is unstable when the docking device is disturbed instantaneously the fluid force and torque acting on the docking device will also change producing the corresponding attack angle Œ¥ Œ± force z and torque m respectively which can be expressed as 1 Œ¥ z œâ z œâ œâ 1 2 œÅ v l 2 z œâ œâ 2 Œ¥ m œâ m œâ œâ 1 2 œÅ v l 3 m œâ œâ and 3 Œ¥ m Œ¥ z Œ¥ Œ± where œâ is the vertical velocity of the docking device z œñ z œñ m œñ and m œñ are the hydrodynamic coefficients as shown in fig 2 when the hydrodynamic center point f is behind the center of gravity g a 0 the effect of m makes Œ¥ Œ± decrease the docking device s state is stable on the contrary if the hydrodynamic center point f is before the center of gravity g a 0 the effect of m makes Œ¥ Œ± increase the docking device s state is unstable state we can see that the attack angle s stability of docking device can be judged by the hydrodynamic point s location or the sign of the distance a between the hydrodynamic point f and the center of gravity which is also called the hydrodynamic center arm or called the static instability coefficient and a m z a 0 unstable state a 0 intermediate state a 0 stable state 3 2 dynamic stability while the dynamic stability is relatively in terms of static stability that is usually referred to as the movement stability chen et al 2017 dynamic stability refers to the stability of the docking device in dynamic external force moment under the action of acceleration and moment of inertia the docking device s dynamic stability of attack angle is the change of the attack angle with time after the interference is removed for the stable wing s stability the focus is to study the attack angle s stability if t Œ¥ Œ± 0 then the docking device is dynamic stable on the contrary it is unstable according to the linear equation of vertical motion of underwater vehicle the corresponding equations of attack angle are deduced as equation 4 where a3 a2 a1 and a0 are constant coefficients composed of hydrodynamic coefficients m Œ∏ and z Œ¥ are the hydrodynamic coefficients Œ¥ is the rudder angle and p is the dimensionless gravity of the docking device 4 a 3 Œ± a 2 Œ± a 1 Œ± a 0 Œ± m Œ∏ z Œ¥ Œ¥ m Œ∏ p when Œ¥ Œ± increases after the docking device is disturbed due to discuss the docking device s stability no steering no change of the static load so Œ¥ p m p 0 so the perturbation motion equation is simplified to equation 5 5 a 3 Œ± a 2 Œ± a 1 Œ± a 0 Œ± 0 the free perturbation motion equation of attack angle is a constant coefficient third order linear differential equation and its characteristic equation is equation 6 6 a 3 Œª 3 a 2 Œª 2 a 1 Œª a 0 Œª 0 the stability characteristics of docking device can be determined by the characteristics of the characteristic root of the free disturbance equation for example if Œªi i 1 2 3 are negative real numbers or complex numbers with negative real parts then when t Œ¥ Œ± 0 the attack angle has automatic stability after the docking device is disturbed and during a period of oscillation attenuation docking device will eventually return to the stable state if one of Œªi is a positive real number or a complex number with a real part the perturbation motion will not attenuate or oscillate and the motion is unstable it can be seen that the positive and negative of the real part of Œªi determines whether the docking device has motion stability and the magnitude of the negative value of the real part of Œªi determines the speed of the disturbance motion attenuation the process of analyzing the static stability and dynamic stability of docking device at the horizontal plane is similar to the analysis process of the vertical plane so it will not be introduced here in addition when the strong disturbances such as currents is encountered during the docking process the two rudders on the docking device will automatically adjust the state to keep the docking device stable during the recovery process the usv usually sails at a low velocity or at a certain point and the auv will sail to the usv at a greater velocity than usv besides when there is current the usv and auv should adjust their own heading according to the flow direction of the current that is the usv dragged the docking device to sail counter currently the auv should chase the usv at a faster velocity the counter current sail can improve the attitude control stability of the usv and the auv itself 4 cfd simulation analysis for underwater equipment especially underwater mobile equipment its hydrodynamic performance must be considered during the design stage and dynamic characteristics analysis stage wu et al 2010 with the rapid development of computer technology and cfd theory cfd technology is more and more widely used in various hydrodynamic performance research efforts compared with the traditional model test method and the semi empirical formula cfd technology is low cost rapid access to the hydrodynamic value of the underwater mobile equipment and can get the flow details easily so the cfd method has become an effective way to study the performance of various kinds of auv s drag propulsion manipulation and anti wave hu 2013 jagadeesh et al 2009 gu 2011 the cfd numerical software star ccm stoll and aviation 2015 is used in this paper to analyze the hydrodynamic characteristics and to understand its stability and dynamics of the stable wing and the guided style docking device respectively in order to illustrate the credibility of star ccm s simulation results the star ccm s simulation accuracy is verified table 2 shows the result comparison of remus100 s drag by using the star ccm simulation and real test it can be seen from table 2 that the error between star ccm s simulation results and the model test results is only 1 which shows that the star ccm hydrodynamic calculation accuracy is high and meets the numerical simulation accuracy requirements therefore star ccm is chosen to use to simulate underwater docking devices 4 1 numerical simulation of stable wing the stable wing plays a crucial role both in captured style and guided style docking devices which can enhance the stability of the rope or guide cover next the dynamics characteristics of stable wing is analyzed including the sailing characteristics of stable wing at different velocities 0 5 m s 1 0 m s 1 5 m s 2 0 m s and different attack angles 0 3 6 9 12 4 1 1 velocity and attack angle s effect on the drag of stable wing generally the drag on the underwater equipment can be expressed as equation 7 where f d is the drag of underwater equipment œÅ is the density of water v is the velocity of the underwater equipment s is the reference area cd is drag coefficient 7 f d 1 2 c d œÅ s v 2 as shown in fig 4 under the same attack angle the drag on stable wing increases concurrently with velocity which is consistent with equation 7 and the hydrodynamic theory when the attack angle is 3 and the velocity is different the surface pressure profile of the stable wing is shown in fig 3 as seen in fig 3 as the velocity increases the high pressure area in front of the stable wing gradually increases resulting in a corresponding increase of the stable wing s drag under the case of other attack angles the drag on stable wing also has a similar relationship with the velocity similarly the stable wing s drag also increases correspondingly with the attack angle a larger attack angle means reference area s is relatively larger therefore according to equation 7 the drag on the stable wing will be correspondingly larger which is also consistent with the hydrodynamic theory we can see from fig 4 that when the attack angle is 3 or 0 the stable wing s drag is very close the corresponding drag of the stable wing is similar when the attack angle is 3 or 6 it is also a similar situation when the attack angle is 6 or 9 9 or 12 this means that when the velocity is the same the drag of stable wing sailing at a negative attack angle is greater than that at the corresponding positive attack angle the larger the attack angle the more obvious the drag increases with the velocity 4 1 2 velocity and attack angle s effect on the lift of stable wing similar to the drag calculation formula there is an empirical calculation formula for the lift where f l is the force of lift œÅ is the density of water v is the velocity of the underwater equipment s is the reference area cl is lift coefficient 8 f l 1 2 c l œÅ s v 2 the lift s simulation results show that the lift on the stable wing increases as the velocity increases as shown in fig 5 which is also consistent with equation 8 and the hydrodynamic theory since the stable wing is not horizontally symmetrical the stable wing s lift is not the same magnitude even in the case of a positive or negative attack angle as seen in fig 5 the lift on the stable wing increases as the attack angle increases and it varies greatly as attack angle fluctuates when the attack angle is 0 the lift on the stable wing is negative rather than 0 n which is good for the stable wing s stability similar to the drag the lift on the stable wing at the negative attack angle is greater than that at the corresponding positive attack angle the magnitude of the downward pressure generated by the stable wing at 0 3 6 and 9 is equal to the magnitude of the lift generated by the stable wing at 3 6 9 and 12 in addition the lift on stable wing is also related to its shape when the stable wing sails at 1 m s and at different attack angles the surface pressure profile of stable wing is shown in fig 6 when the attack angle is 3 6 9 and 12 the pressure on the lower surface of the stable wing is higher than that on the upper surface therefore the stable wing has the lift when it sails in the positive attack angle with the increase of attack angle the high pressure area red and orange area on front lower surface of the stable wing gradually increases the low pressure area on the upper edge surface of stable wing also gradually increases so the lift increases along with attack angle as seen in fig 6 when the attack angle is negative the high pressure area on the upper surface and the pressure difference between the upper surface and the bottom surface gradually increase with the increase of the attack angle this will produce a downward pressure which has the tendency to move the stable wing forward and downward and makes the rope more tensioned and tightened which makes the stable wing more stable through the simulation analysis we can see that the lift when stable wing sails at different attack angles is mainly caused by the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of the stable wing 4 2 numerical simulation of guided style docking device the guided style docking device is based on the stable wing to increase the guide cover pressure tank and other structures so its hydrodynamic characteristics are different with only stable wing the following is some simulation when the guided style docking device moves at different velocities and different attack angles 4 2 1 velocity and attack angle s effect on the drag of guided style docking device fig 7 is a curve of the drag versus velocities when the guided style docking device moves at different velocities and the stable wing is in different attack angles similar to the change tendency of the stable wing s drag versus velocity the guided style docking device s drag also increases correspondingly with velocity which also complies with equation 7 and hydrodynamics theory as the guided style docking device has more structure than the stable wing it can be seen from the comparison between figs 7 and 4 that the guided type capture device s drag at different velocities is much greater than the stable wing s drag when the stable wing sails at the same velocity for example the stable wing s drag is 36 n when it moves at the attack angle of 12 and the velocity of 1 m s however the guided style docking device s drag is 96 n under the same conditions and when the velocity is different the change of the guided type docking device s drag is larger than that of the single stable wing different from the single stable wing the guided type docking device s drag changes little with the stable wing s attack angle as can be seen from fig 7 under the same velocity the changes of guided type docking device s drag are not obvious when stable wing is at the attack angles of 0 3 6 and 9 for example when the velocity is 0 5 m s the stable wing s drag is 2 n at the attack angle of 0 and the drag is 9 n at the attack angle of 12 the drag increases by 350 however under the same conditions the guided type docking device s drag is 24 n when the stable wing is at the attack angle of 0 and the drag is 25 n when the stable wing is at the attack angle of 12 the drag increases by 4 at other velocities the guided type docking device s drag has a similar relationship with the stable wing s attack angle 4 2 2 velocity and attack angle s effect on the lift of guided style docking device fig 8 is a curve of the lift versus velocities when the guided style docking device moves with the stable wing at different attack angles similar to the single stable wing s lift the guided style docking devices lift also increases with increased velocity but it does not change as obviously as the single stable wing s lift in addition the tendency of the guided style docking device s lift is quite different from that of the single stable wing as seen in fig 8 the guided style docking device s lift is positive when the stable wing s attack angle is 0 and even the stable wing s attack angle is 6 the guided style docking device s lift is still positive when the stable wing s attack angle is 9 the guided style docking device s lift becomes negative ie downward pressure which is desirable and stabilizes the docking device when the guided style docking device moves at 1 m s and at different attack angles the surface pressure profile of the guided style docking device is shown in fig 9 the pressure on the lower surface of the stable wing is low and the pressure on the upper surface is high this is because there are some components below the stable wing which create a barrier to water flow so it is consistent with the bernoulli equation therefore that is why the guided style docking device still has lift even if the stable wing has a small positive attack angle however as the stable wing s attack angle increases the high pressure area on the upper surface of the stable wing gradually increases and the high pressure area on the lower surface gradually decreases which reduces the guided style docking device s lift when the stable wing s attack angle is 9 the guided style docking device s lift becomes negative that is a downward pressure this is also the difference in lift between the captured style docking device and the guided style docking device for the captured style docking device under the same velocity its drag is relatively small when it is sailing at a negative attack angle and the stable wing can provide a certain downforce to increase the stability of the cable and itself therefore in the underwater dynamic docking process and the choice of the towing point the stable wing should be installed at a negative attack angle for the guided style docking device when the attack angle of the stable wing is about 0 9 the drag does not change significantly with the attack angle however for its lift the stable wing will provide downforce when the attack angle is greater than 9 therefore for the guided style docking device in order to increase the success rate of underwater dynamic docking the installation angle of the stable wing should be as large as possible negative attack angle but this will increase its sailing drag 5 mathematical model through the analysis of the docking device s force we can see that the main forces on docking device include gravity buoyancy drag lift and towing force towing force varies depending on the location of the towing point and the velocity normally the towing point will not coincide with the center of gravity of the stable wing just as shown in fig 2 during the auv recovery process the usv normally tows the underwater docking device in a direct motion at constant depth and the docking device is usually symmetrical about the vertical plane so the direct motion s stability is relatively easy to achieve therefore the constant deep motion is very important for the docking device the constant deep motion belongs to the vertical plane motion which means the vertical plane motion is particularly important xu 2013 ensuring stability of the vertical plane motion can increase the success rate of recovery the vertical plane motion refers to the movement that changes or maintains pitch and depth without changing the sailing direction in general the vertical plane motion for underwater moving objects includes two basic forms fixed depth motion and variable depth motion for the auv recovery process we only need to study the fixed depth motion s characteristics according to newton s second law when the underwater docking s coordinate is at the center of gravity the equation of motion in vertical plane is as follows dajka 2006 9 m u g w g q x œÉ m w g u g q z œÉ j y g q m g œÉ where x œÉ z œÉ and m g œÉ denote the total force in x axis z axis and total torque for the y axis respectively u g and u g denote the acceleration and velocity of the origin of body fixed coordinate system in x axis respectively w g and w g denote the acceleration and velocity of the origin of body fixed coordinate system in z axis respectively q and q denote the angular acceleration and velocity of the origin of body fixed coordinate system respectively j y g denotes the moment of inertia of the y axis the following equations can be obtained from fig 2 10 x f t cos Œ∏ f d z f t sin Œ∏ f b f l f g m g œÉ f l a f t s putting equation 10 into equation 9 the dynamic equation of stable wing in the vertical plane can be obtained 11 m u g w g q f t cos Œ∏ f d m w g u g q f t sin Œ∏ f b f l f g j y g q f l a f t s where f d and f l can be obtained by equation 7 and equation 8 when the docking device moves steadily u g w g q q 0 equation 11 is converted to equation 12 and the docking device s velocity is a constant f d and f l can also be obtained through the empirical formula then putting f d and f l into equation 12 we can get f t a and Œ∏ 12 f t cos Œ∏ f d 0 f t sin Œ∏ f b f l f g 0 f l a f t s 0 geometric relational auxiliary equations are as follows 13 d s sin Œ∏ c d b cot Œ∏ 6 tests both types of docking devices all use the stable wing so the stable wing s characteristics are very important in order to verify the stable wing s characteristics a portable usv is used to drag the stable wing for testing the stable wing s characteristics in xiu lake in june 2017 the tests focus on velocity s effect on the stable wing and the stable wing s stability a pressure sensor is connected at the end of the rope near the stable wing to obtain the depth information as is shown in fig 10 during the tests a towing process was carried out for both cases with the stable wing and without the stable wing the tests data analysis is shown in fig 11 when the velocity is constant the pressure sensor s value is larger in the case of with a stable wing than without a stable wing which indicates that the stable wing provides a certain downward pressure to tighten the rope to facilitate the successful capture besides the depth values measured by the pressure sensor are not the same under different velocities the depth value of stable wing decreases with the increase of velocity according to equation 12 we can see that once the velocity changes each force will change and eventually the stable wing will reach a new equilibrium state 7 conclusion two kinds of underwater dynamic docking devices are designed and their hydrodynamic characteristics at different velocities and different attack angles are analyzed by using the cfd software star ccm in addition static stability and dynamic stability of the docking device are carried out and the mathematical modeling in the vertical plane is carried out and finally the preliminary lake test of stable wing was tested through the above analysis the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the stable wing s stability is related to the relative position of hydrodynamic center point center of gravity and the towing point the stable wing s stability is higher when the hydrodynamic center is behind the center of gravity and the towing point is before the center of gravity 2 the captured style docking device and guided style docking device s drag increases with the velocity increasing the captured style docking device s lift also increases with increasing attack angle and the drag on stable wing at the negative attack angle is greater than that at the corresponding positive attack angle however the guided style docking device s drag does not change obviously with the increase of the stable wing s attack angle 3 the captured style docking device and guided style docking device s lift or downward pressure increases with the velocity increasing the captured style docking device provides the downward force when the stable wing s attack angle is 0 and the lift on stable wing at the negative attack angle is greater than that at the corresponding positive attack angle for the guided style docking device it suffers a downward force when the stable wing s attack angle is around 9 4 as the capture device s drag and lift are related to velocity the docking device s stability is also related to the velocity the steady sailing depth of the docking device corresponds to the different velocity in the process of recycling an auv all aspects of factors should be taken into account to determine a reasonable towing velocity acknowledgments grateful acknowledgement is given to the financial supports from the national natural science

institute of concrete construction leibniz universit√§t hannover appelstra√üe 9a hannover 30167 germany corresponding author the misalignment of wind and waves is of special interest for various engineering applications i e for structural fatigue load analyses for work vessel operations for offshore construction or maintenance and for floating wind turbines in addition to the normal or frequent boundary conditions the combination of extreme loads and their directions is essential for coastal and offshore designs these aspects are addressed by analyzing ten years of field measurements in the german bight of the north sea which is intensively used for offshore wind energy production this paper focuses on the occurrence and amount of wind and wave misalignment as well as the direction dependency of the wind wave correlation for normal conditions and extreme storms subsequently the influence of statistical distribution functions for the estimation of extreme wind and wave values is presented based on these results a method is developed to combine direction dependent extreme wind and wave incidents for return periods of several decades keywords wind wave misalignment wind wave correlation storm incidents extreme values combination factor 1 introduction developing wind waves in open waters are primarily generated due to momentum exchanges by wind action related to fetch length wind speed and wind duration cavaleri et al 2012 these are direction dependent due to influences of nearby land masses and the topographic shape of the sea floor atmospheric air circulation and marine current systems hasselmann et al 1973 zielke et al 2007 emeis and t√ºrk 2009 while wind can rapidly change its direction and intensity the inert water waves react delayed in relation to the wind profile as analysed and described by van vledder 1990 and van vledder and holthuijsen 1993 as a consequence wind speed and propagating waves occur to some extent from different directions donelan et al 1985 philippe et al 2013 which is of special interest for normal conditions and extreme events regarding design and operation of offshore and coastal structures barj et al 2014 welzel et al 2016 usually co directional load combinations of extreme wind and wave incidents are applied and thus resulting in conservative designs however the directionality has an important role with regard to several offshore and coastal issues it is for instance the design of mechanical connections and structural members which can be optimized by considering variable load directions since material stresses are more equally distributed in structural cross sections leading to efficient designs hildebrandt 2013 st√ºmpel et al 2017 furthermore fatigue damage is intensified especially for fixed offshore wind converters by wind and wave loads simultaneously acting from different directions due to the misaligned aerodynamic damping of the rotor regarding the wave loads from lateral directions koukoura et al 2016 while for floating offshore wind converters increased motions are observed for wind wave misalignment rather than crucial fatigue contributions bachynski et al 2014 barj et al 2014 in addition to the design aspects offshore logistics marine operations construction time and costs are mainly driven by the operational times of the working vessels which strongly depend on the wind and wave occurrence and correlation the environmental parameters wind speed and significant wave height are direction dependent and could therefore lead to different load directions on a structure for extreme incidents for the same return periods which leads to reduced loads in comparison to the afore mentioned conservative approach measurements show that increasing wind speeds lead to converging wind and wave directions however based on the findings of this study the following hypothesis is formulated a location dependent extreme wind speed i e once in 50 years does not necessarily occur from the same direction as the extreme wave for the same return period thus the extreme wind could be combined with a reduced extreme wave and vice versa this hypothesis will be verified and quantified for the southern north sea by means of direction dependent extreme value analyses based on measurement data and the following objectives 1 to characterize the amount and occurrence of wind and wave misalignment in the north sea at the german bight on the basis of ten years measurements 2 to determine the direction dependency of the wind wave correlation for normal conditions and extreme storms 3 to present the influence of distribution functions for the estimation of extreme wind and wave values 4 and finally show direction dependent combinations of extreme wind and wave incidents for return periods of several decades 2 review of existing work 2 1 wind wave misalignment and correlation load estimations for various offshore structures due to directional wind and waves have been frequently investigated see also van vledder and holthuijsen 1993 van vledder 2013 and k√ºhn 2001 however information about observed wind wave misalignments and their load combinations are still scarce in literature even though numerous studies emphasize the importance i e trumars et al 2006 wei et al 2016 koukoura et al 2016 existing literature focuses primarily on directional analysis of frequent occurring incidents mittendorf 2006 bachynski et al 2014 van vledder 2013 and based on that the scope of this work primarily focuses on aligned extreme wind and wave incidents and their direction dependent combination t√ºrk 2008 describes the spatial and temporal development of wind speeds and corresponding changes in wave parameters i e increasing wave heights for stronger wind speeds and the postponed reaction of the waves k√ºhn 2001 reports prevailing south westerly winds for the dutch north sea and a co directed main wave direction in addition to a second main wave direction from the northern direction it is observed that approximately 65 of the waves are aligned to the wind direction within a range of 22 5 fischer et al 2011 present absolute values of wind and wave misalignment for the same region with regard to wind speed and wind speed probability interestingly large wind and wave misalignments of nearly 120 are observed for wind speeds below 10 m s and the misalignment narrows down to approximately 30 for wind speeds above 20 m s van vledder 2013 observes that wind wave misalignment becomes narrower with increasing wind speed and significant wave height and further takes into account the directionality of wind and waves van vledder and holthuijsen 1993 young 2006 as well as a detailed study on interfering effects on local wave systems from radiating waves white capping and wave wave interactions doong et al 2007 performed a regression analysis for the correlation of wind and wave energy in the north of taiwan and observed nearly linear relations for wind speeds greater than 6 m s the correlation and simultaneous occurrence of environmental impacts is a major concern not only for engineering problems in this case it is important for the calculation of the hydraulic impact of sea waves to have exact knowledge of the significant wave parameters which are usually derived from measurements and numerical models or in combination with statistic models ar g√ºner et al 2013 cover the development of a statistical wave model for the karaburun coastal zone located at the south west coast of the black sea with the help of wind and wave measurements they use long term wind data to predict the development of waves as well as to derive wind wave correlation parameters and showed that the height of the waves is directly correlating with the duration of the wind for the last four hours zielke et al 2006 investigate the correlation for the mean wind speed and significant wave height independently of the wind direction for the southern german north sea the analysis reveals good regression fittings by empirical formulations in terms of fetch length dependent tma and jonswap spectra and exponential functions were proven as best regression fit for the wind wave correlation t√ºrk 2008 investigates the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer in the german bight its correlation to wind speed and its influence on waves the data for the wind direction shows that the most commonly direction in the german bight is south west and investigations of wind directions of wind speeds 20 m s in different measurement heights confirm this result as also shown by schmidt et al 2015 2 2 wind wave distribution functions for extreme incidents since the early 1990s joint probability models were developed to describe simultaneously occurring environmental parameters with a long averaged return period of several decades haver and winterstein 2008 use reliability methods for long term response predictions of simultaneously occurring significant wave heights and spectral peak periods by inverse first order reliability method iform to develop environmental contour lines an extension of the environmental contour line procedure based on direct monte carlo simulations is described in huseby et al 2013 compared to fetch diagrams and empirical spectral formulations sverdrup and munk 1947 bretschneider 1958 pierson and moskowitz 1963 hasselmann et al 1973 the environmental contour line approach is not only useful for describing common but also extreme local wind and wave conditions dowell et al 2014 used fino 1 data from january 2004 to october 2010 and focus on the probability of time windows for repair maintenance and installations of offshore wind farms the results of the study show the right skewed distributions of wind speed and significant wave height and a best fit by a weibull distribution for the wind speeds and a gamma distribution for the wave both estimated with the maximum likelihood method bredmose et al 2012 show that wind speed distributions are mostly well approximated by weibull distributions for investigated sites in the north and baltic sea however the study shows that these distributions are less satisfactory for extreme incidents and gumbel distributions are recommended another approach to describe the joint density probability distribution of several random variables is the use of copulas see also genest and favre 2007 and salvadori et al 2007 a copula function is able to model the dependency structure between the marginal distributions of the considered random variables and eventually construct a multivariate distribution function when using the copula approach the copula is a cumulative distribution by itself whereby the copula can be chosen independently from the choice of the marginal distribution the application of different types of copulas to measure data of the significant wave height peak period and wind speed is shown in zhang et al 2015 the above mentioned studies summarize that research on wind wave misalignment their correlation as well as corresponding load combinations and distribution functions are in progress and of much relevance for engineering purposes and beyond however and as mentioned by passon 2015 accurate wind wave correlation methods do not exist and guidance is also missing in all relevant design guidelines local wind and wave interactions are in general driven by complex shear stress and pressure interactions at the air water interface and are additionally affected by currents water depths and varying boundary conditions along the fetch against that background this study focuses on the misalignment of wind and wind generated waves according to the objectives given above and to derive a method for load combinations based on field data 3 observations from 10 years wind and wave measurements in the german bight 3 1 measurements and data basis wind and wave data are used from the research platform fino 1 for the following investigations the research platform fino 1 is located approximately 45 km in the north of the island borkum in the southern north sea n 54 0 86 e6 35 26 the water depth at fino 1 is about 30 m a database including simultaneously measured wind speeds and wind directions as well as simultaneously measured significant wave heights and wave directions was created from records over ten years beginning on 1st of january 2004 until 31st december 2013 the wind data consists of 10 min averaged values from anemometers and wind vanes while the significant wave heights and wave directions are derived from directional wave rider buoy datawell dwr mkiii measurements every 30 min wind data for the analysis of the wind wave correlation is taken at the lowest measuring position 33 m above lat lowest astronomical tide so as close to the water surface as possible furthermore wind data in approximately 100 m above lat which corresponds to the hub height of current offshore wind converters are taken into account for the stochastic analysis the wind conditions at hub height are used in regulations for the design of wind converters the data cover of the parameters is listed in table 1 and basically amounts for 67 of the wave records and for 92 96 of the wind data further details of the measurement technology and the data preparation is given in schmidt 2017 in addition three hour averaged values are used for the stochastically analysis a tolerance time of nine minutes is allowed for the temporal assignment of the sea state measurements to wind speed records to account for time offsets of the wind and wave recording interval after occasional equipment failure the three hour interval is based on the rather stationary behavior of the short term wave conditions for a period of three hours according to dnv rp 205 2010 and iec 61400 3 2009 consequently the 30 min sea state values are averaged over a period of three hours for this purpose the directional data is converted into cartesian coordinates in order to account for the instant change of directional values around north from 0 to 360 and afterwards transferred back into polar coordinates 3 2 misalignment and correlation of wind and waves table 1 lists the characteristic wind and wave parameters used in this study from ten years data the maximum wind speed 100 m above lat exceeds the one at 33 m by 5 while the mean wind speed at 100 m exceeds the one at 33 m by 15 and amounts to 9 83 m s the median values at both heights are slightly reduced in comparison to the corresponding mean values on the same level the differences of the mean and median values though are less pronounced for the wind direction at both heights regarding the waves the mean value of the significant wave height amounts 1 47 m and the mean value tm is 6 9 s which is the average of the mean wave periods estimated from the spectral moment s m0 m1 per measuring interval the minimum and maximum measurement values are supplemented by the 1 and 99 quantiles in table 1 in order to emphasize the characteristic at the boundaries of the data range the 1 quantile of the significant wave height is 0 27 m for the 30 min measurement intervals while the 99 quantile value reaches 4 6 m the direct comparison of the mean wind Œ∏wi and mean wave direction Œ∏wa averaged from the mean wind and wave direction per measuring interval results in a shift of approximately 70 however it should be pointed out that the mean values of the wind and wave directions do not account for the instantaneous wind wave misalignment over the years since the directions are not compared for each point in time this is rather expressed by the given mean value of the wind wave misalignment in table 1 which is the average of all simultaneous misalignments of the wind direction at 33 m above lat and the wave direction for this reason the wind data is averaged over three 10 min intervals during the 30 min wave data intervals the data cover of wind and wave direction 92 and 67 respectively results in 60 of overlapping data for the ten years the median value of the misalignment regarding wind and wave direction amounts 37 estimated from the available six years 60 records out of ten years fig 1 shows the duration curves of the measured wind and wave parameters 10 min and 30 min intervals respectively over ten years and indicates their relative frequency of occurrence on the ordinate each time series of the wind and wave parameters is normalized by the corresponding maximum data point which is given in the legend for reference on the abscissa each duration curve is normalized and subsequently sorted by their rank by the period of available measurement data which is 3314 days 91 in ten years for the wind speed 3328 days 92 for the wind direction and 2438 days 66 8 for the wave height direction and period the 1 and 99 quantiles of the measurements listed in table 1 are picked from the 0 01 and 0 99 data points on the abscissa and provide an impression about the strong gradients of the duration curves close to the data limits furthermore the graphs reveal several properties about the wind and wave characteristics at the fino 1 location the wind and wave direction distribution is remarkable in comparison to a theoretical uniform directional distribution indicated by the straight dashed line this is due to the fact that they progress with rather pronounced sections of steep or flat curves therefore it becomes clear that the more evenly inclined or the closer the graph fits to the theoretical line the more evenly distributed the parameter which applies the most for the wind direction nevertheless the wave direction is more dominated by western directions than the wind which is expressed by the graph progressing above the theoretical straight line and the values above 0 75 indicating 0 75 360 270 however the directional frequency of wind occurrence disregarding the wind speed is relatively uniform in comparison to the wave direction progressing significantly above the straight uniform distribution and above the wind distribution due to the location of fino 1 close to the german coastline the duration curve of the wave direction is characterized by a steep slope for southern directions which corresponds to a low number of wave events from this direction due to the upwind fetch restrictions as also noted by kuik and holthuijsen 1981 and portilla yand√∫n et al 2015 fig 1 shows the low frequency of occurrence for values between 0 33 and 0 66 120 240 which ranges about 5 of the time furthermore the graph progresses significantly above the wind direction and shows three flat sloped sections on a level at 0 25 0 75 and 0 94 this corresponds to east 90 west 270 and close to north 340 for the wave directions the frequency of occurrence of the eastern directions is about 15 while the western directions cover 50 while 30 are approaching from northern directions similar characteristics can be observed from other parameters for example wind speeds above 3 m s and below 25 m s which are typical for offshore wind usage correspond to the data between 0 08 and 0 68 fig 1 and occur more than 93 of the time wind speeds below 10 m s occur approximately 65 of the time which is i e a common requirement for the installation of rotor blades wave heights below 1 5 m are crucial for jack up vessels to jack the working deck which occurs approximately at 60 of the sea states at fino 1 however regarding the correlation of wind and wave direction the bold line shows the misalignment of the wind and wave direction as described above in most cases the main horizontal wave loads on structures are positively and negatively in line with the direction of wave propagation for structures sensitive to wind and wave loads e g offshore wind converters the most distinct misalignment of wind and wave action occurs at perpendicular directions due to the missing aerodynamic damping in contrast to aligned wind and wave action this is the case for 10 of the time if the perpendicular angle is chosen 15 from 90 likewise wind and waves act in the same direction about 23 of the time if the alignment is categorized by angles 15 while opposing wind and waves 180 15 cover only 2 5 of the time this leads to a wind and wave misalignment 15 for about 75 of the time if the threshold for aligned directions is however increased to 30 the misalignment amounts 53 of the time as a result of 42 in line and 5 opposing times based on the frequency of occurrence of simultaneous wind and wave records fig 2 shows the relation of wind speeds and wave heights arranged by 30 sectors starting off north at zero degrees each sectional scatter plot shows the simultaneous 10 min wind speeds averaged over half an hour and 30 min significant wave heights on the ordinate and abscissa of the ten year data basis the scatter points are colored equivalent to the frequency of occurrence which is normalized by the corresponding maximum frequency of occurrence the red lines show the quadratic regression curves x2c x b a of the simultaneously occurring data points in order to illustrate the extent of the linear correlation of the wind speeds and wave heights the functions of the regression curves are estimated from the minimum residuals by the method of least squares while the extent of linear correlation is estimated by the pearson correlation coefficient rxy for the wind x and wave y incidents 1 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the correlation coefficient for each sector is plotted in the middle of fig 2 and indicates a strong rxy 1 or weak rxy 0 linear correlation of wind speeds and wave heights as expected all coefficients are positive due to the physical connection of wind induced waves however the lowest linear correlation rxy 0 56 is observed for south eastern directions ranging from 120 to 150 which is seen by the low significant wave heights around 3 m connected to the strong winds of nearly 20 m s for opposite directions around north west a strong pronounced and almost linear correlation rxy 0 77 of increasing wind speeds and wave heights is observed by a relatively straight regression curve a similar high correlation is also observed for the western sections even though the coefficients are slightly reduced and the regressions are more curved in comparison to the 300 330 sector moreover the north west sections show the highest frequency of occurrence of high waves even for moderate winds around 10 15 m s see section 300 330 however the strongest winds 30 m s are observed from the south west directions besides the sectional wind characteristics the directional correlations of wind and wave heights are clearly connected to the geographical properties of the measurement location the relatively small wave heights for south eastern directions can be explained by the close coastline and a therefore very limited fetch as described above and shown in fig 1 there is a steep slope of the wind wave misalignment near 0 5 360 180 on the ordinate indicating a very low frequency of occurrence of opposing wind and wave directions this could cause the small fraction of relatively high waves for southern wind incidents beyond the obvious connection of strong wind and high waves for the northern direction due to the long fetch length approaching swells from north west and turning wind situations are the basis for the simultaneous occurring of high waves and moderate wind speeds which could dominate the local wave system or shift energy between remote and local by wave systems as investigated by van vledder 1990 as a consequence of the noticeable observations for occurring strong winds and waves the following section presents the characteristics of storm incidents and focuses on individual wind and wave correlations for extreme events 4 characteristics of storm incidents and long term statistics 4 1 wind wave misalignment of storm incidents the wind speed is used to identify individual storm incidents of the ten year data basis in terms of wind speeds 16 m s duration 6 h of strong winds and available concurrent wind and wave data figs 3 and 4 illustrate two examples out of 82 detected storms in ten years and show the time series of wind speed and direction as well as significant wave height and direction these time series are plotted against time in hours and the vertical dashed lines mark the selected onset and the end of the storm incident the time windows and durations of the storms are picked by visual inspection in order to define individual and closed events with regard to noticeable developments of the wind speed and wind direction the storm in january 2005 is characterized by steadily increasing wind for two days until reaching peak values 30 m s the significant wave height of the 30 min measurement intervals increases up to 6 3 m and both the wind and the wave direction are predominantly approaching from western directions while the waves are coming from west the wind is approaching more southerly from 210 until both directions unite for nearly three hours during the peak wind speed interestingly the wave direction seems to respond to the changing wind direction of 60 during the peak wind and follows the orientation of the wind by maintaining a more or less constant misalignment of 30 50 after the peak wind speed in direct comparison the storm in october 2013 is shorter and contains lower wind speeds up to 24 m s and significant wave heights of 4 8 m however the rate of changing wind speed is more than doubled and amounts 0 88 m s per hour in contrast to 0 3 m s per hour for the storm in 2005 likewise an increased rate of changing wave height can be observed for the storm in 2013 which might be reasoned by the previously low wave heights around 0 6 m combined with a high rate of increasing wind speeds in addition the northern wind changes to south eastern directions during the onset providing a very limited fetch length which results in the interim drop of wave heights even though the wind speed is increasing subsequently the wind direction changes almost constantly from 120 up to 360 and the wave direction aligns nearly instantaneously without a pronounced shift in this case characteristic properties of 82 identified storms are illustrated in fig 5 showing the maximum wind speed duration and mean wind direction of each incident in total 103 storms are identified on the basis of the data cover of the fino 1 measurements leading to an average occurrence frequency of 10 storms per year however only 82 time windows provide both wind and wave data the storms are sorted by their averaged wind direction during the onset and the end of the assigned time windows the majority of the storms are as expected dominated by western directions which can be seen by 50 mean direction values number 10 to 60 between 200 and 270 if the mean wind directions are categorized into the compass directions 11 are coming from northern directions 315 45 6 from the east 45 135 23 from the south 135 225 and 60 from western directions 225 315 moreover the standard deviation of the mean wind direction is given by the error bars for each storm in order to point out the change of wind direction as described above the plotted storm in fig 3 is storm number 32 in fig 5 and shows the very low standard deviation of 15 which is mainly due to the nearly constant wind direction in comparison the continuously changing wind direction in fig 4 is storm number 59 in fig 5 and reveals the highest observed standard deviation of 100 a systematic pattern of the standard deviation is hard to observe since the size of the error bars does not obviously vary with maximum wind speed or storm duration however the rather high variations of the wind directions correspond to the western directions while the five eastern storms and most of the northern storms above 300 show a rather small range of standard deviations in accordance with the observed mean wind characteristics fig 6 illustrates the same identified storms arranged in the same order on the abscissa by increasing mean wind directions of the whole storm duration the ordinates represent the directional angles of wind and waves while the third plot provides the directional shift in degrees of the instantaneous wind and wave values in the first plot the colors of the data points provide the frequency of occurrence of the wind directions for each storm the directional frequencies for each storm sum up to 100 while the second plot shows the frequency of occurrence for the wave directions and the third plot for the misalignment of the wind and wave direction for each storm accordingly as expected from the findings described above the data points in fig 6 left show a very similar progression like the mean wind directions in fig 5 outlined by the high frequencies of occurrence furthermore the vertical range of occurring data points corresponds to the extent of the standard deviations additional findings can be observed from the wave directions which show after five eastern storms a less steep progression along the ranked storms in comparison to the wind directions furthermore the color intensity along the ordinate represents the probability distribution for each storm while the wind directions show rather broad distributions with a bandwidth of around 60 the wave directions reveal more concentrated distributions that are characterized by a rather narrow bandwidth of 30 finally the instantaneous misalignment of the wind and wave directions in fig 6 right reveal a general progression of decreasing misalignments for more and more northern mean wind directions this can be observed by the increasing frequency of occurrence green and red colors of smaller directional shifts for the upper segment of the ranked storms i e storms 60 82 nearly all storms contain a broad range of directional shifts however the probability distributions show an obvious progression of the decreasing misalignment this is illustrated by red yellow and cyan colors depending on the mean wind direction after five eastern storm events no 1 5 in fig 6 the highest frequencies of occurrence of the instantaneous directional shifts reduce from approximately 60 90 down to 20 30 for the northern wind directions thus directional dependency and wind wave misalignment exist remarkably for storm incidents and is further considered by the following long term statistics 4 2 long term statistics of aligned wind and wave events 4 2 1 method for extreme value analyses for the direction dependent investigations of extreme wind speeds and significant wave heights in the southern north sea are two sector sizes of 30 and 60 initially set different effects are expected for different sector or sample sizes on the one hand small sectors lead to a high directional resolution on the other hand small sectors lead to more unreliable results of extreme value analysis due to smaller sample sizes and vice versa the sector size of 30 is related to common sector sizes for directional fatigue tests of offshore wind turbines cf iec 61400 3 2009 in addition 60 sectors are investigated to obtain larger sample sizes in order to implement more extreme measurement values in each sector for the direction dependent extreme value analyses the investigations are carried out with overlapping sectors to ensure a higher direction resolution for the investigations described above the number of sectors was doubled by an overlap of half a sector wide thus the wind speed and significant wave height in 24 directional sectors of 30 and 12 directional sectors of 60 were analysed independently of each other to ensure the comparability of the direction dependent results a uniform approach is used in the extreme value analysis in schmidt 2017 numerous extreme value analyses were performed and evaluated based on the measurement data described in chapter 3 1 numerous assumptions influence the results of extreme value analyses see also van vledder et al 1993 thus the sampling method the assumed distribution function and the estimation method for the distribution parameters so called point estimation methods influence each other mutually however the investigations show that the point estimation method does influence the result of the extreme value analyses less than the considered distribution functions fig 7 shows the scatter of 50 year events for different point estimation methods for the distribution parameters method of moments least square method and maximum likelihood estimation and distribution functions gumbel i max weibull iii max weibull iii min rayleigh gamma and frechet ii max these sensitivity analyses of the extreme values are carried out using the methods shown in table 2 whereby either the point estimation method for the distribution parameters or the distribution function is varied the approximated extreme values of wind speed v ref and significant wave height h s50 by using different distribution functions and point estimation methods are displayed in figs 8 and 9 the wind speed v ref represent the 10 min mean of the extreme wind speed with a recurrence period of 50 years at hub height the significant wave height hs50 represent the significant wave height with the recurrence period of 50 years both parameters are described in iec 61400 3 2009 the goodness of fit determined by the chi square test œá2 test and the kolmogorow smirnow test k s test is displayed by the grey scales for the purpose of comparison the results of t√ºrk 2008 emeis and t√ºrk 2009 and mittendorf 2006 are also listed based on these results the approach shown in table 2 is used for all subsequent extreme value analyses 4 2 2 direction dependent extreme value analysis method for the direction dependent sample analysis two procedures are feasible the first possibility is the application of the block maxima method to all direction independent data in order to identify extreme values for the subsequent classification into the directional sectors the block maxima method is a general formulation of the annual maxima method and is valid for arbitrarily long time intervals block sizes such a procedure leads to a different number of extreme values in the different directional sectors and requires a sector specific adaptation of the quantiles the second possibility is the classification of the measurement data into the different directional sectors and the subsequent application of the block maxima method the directional subdivision and subsequent analysis of the samples ensures a constant number of measured values in each sector the extreme value analysis in this study is carried out based on eight week extreme values the reference period of eight weeks ensure a sufficiently large sample combined with a long reference period whereby reliable results of the extreme value analysis are to be expected schmidt 2017 notes that the results of the two described procedures are in good agreement to each other especially in extreme value analyses based on measurements with a long reference period for the subsequent shown direction based combination approach the measured values are firstly classified in directional sectors and extreme values are determined secondly for each sector by the block maxima method thereby the displayed model estimates the intensity of aligned extreme load parameters which do not occur necessarily at the same time extreme value analyses are performed for wind speeds and significant wave heights in each directional sector in order to be able to estimate the intensity of aligned wind speeds and significant wave heights with return periods of several decades the probability of occurrence expressed by the quantiles p Œª is calculated for each sector eq 2 thereby Œª specifies the averaged return period of the measurement data in years which are the basis of the extreme value analyses 2 p Œª 1 1 Œª r the extreme values x r with a defined return period r are calculated with a suitable inverse distribution function depending on the quantile p Œª eq 3 3 x r f 1 p Œª according to the results of the comparative studies in schmidt 2017 the 3 parameter weibull distribution for maxima weibull iii max given in eq 4 is used for the extreme value analyses 4 f x x exp œâ x œâ w k the direction independent extreme values x r as well as direction dependent extreme values x r Œ∏ with the return period r are estimated using eq 3 and the inverse of eq 4 subsequently the extreme values x r Œ∏ and x r are related to each other eq 5 5 œà i Œ∏ x i r Œ∏ x i r in this way direction dependent combination factors œà i Œ∏ are determined for wind speeds and significant wave heights in each directional sector the direction dependent extreme value analysis can either lead to lower or to higher extreme values than the direction independent extreme value analysis which is mainly due to the different underlying fractions of the data basis therefore the range of values 0 œà i Œ∏ 1 is t not necessarily correct in the analysis concerned the deviation between the extreme value of the maximum directional 30 sector and the direction independent extreme value is 2 for the wind speed and 5 for the significant wave height to ensure the reliability of a direction independent extreme value analysis the direction dependent combination factors œà i Œ∏ are normalized to the direction independent extreme value x i r eq 6 the parameter rel œà i Œ∏ corresponds to the maximum œà i Œ∏ according to eq 5 of all directional sectors 6 œà i Œ∏ x i r Œ∏ x i r r e l œà i Œ∏ 1 as a result of the normalization the characteristic extreme event from the maximum directional sector corresponds to direction independent characteristic extreme event consequently the value range 0 œà i Œ∏ 1 applies to the combination factors of aligned extreme wind speeds and significant wave heights whereby the evaluation is based on time independent measured values at the fino 1 location the direction dependent extreme value analysis confirms the assumption of different main directions of wind and wave action the values œà vref Œ∏ and œà hs50 Œ∏ according to eq 6 for differently oriented 30 sectors are shown in fig 12 according to the performed investigations the wind speed v ref is to be expected from 240 to 300 see fig 12 left respectively from 255 to 285 in fig 12 right in other sectors the 50 year wind speed decreases to about half of the wind speed v ref i e 0 30 in fig 12 left the significant wave height h s50 changes even more for different directions the significant wave height h s50 is to be expected from 300 to 330 fig 12 left respectively from 315 to 345 fig 12 right in other sectors the 50 year significant wave height decreases to about a quarter of the significant wave height h s50 i e from 90 to 120 in fig 12 left overall a higher directional dependency can be stated for significant wave heights than the wind speeds extreme wind and sea state events from the west to the north will be decisive for the design of rotationally symmetrical offshore structures at the investigated site the combination factors œà vref Œ∏ and œà hs50 Œ∏ according to eq 6 on the basis of the offset 30 and 60 sectors are listed in table 3 for the relevant loading directions between 240 and 360 table 3 also shows the deviation of the combination factors for sectors of different sizes the combination factors based on different sector sizes differ considerably in some cases as seen for loading direction 360 in table 3 these deviations result from a small number of extreme measurement values within a subsector which exert a strong influence on the result of the extreme value analyses of the considered sector the significant wave height h s50 of the northern 60 sector is mainly determined by the extreme significant wave heights from 330 to 345 fig 10 the measured values of this subsector are much higher than the values of the sector 345 15 which form the data basis for the h s50 of the northern 30 sector consequently the combination factor for h s50 of the northern 60 sector is 43 higher than the factor for h s50 of the northern 30 sector this effect leads to increasingly conservative results with an increasing sector size a rough subdivision into sectors though does not provide a difference from a direction independent analysis at a site with similar main load directions therefore smaller directional sectors are preferable provided that the number of samples is sufficiently large 4 2 3 location dependency of direction dependent extreme wind and waves the location dependency and the influence of a smaller sample size are analysed by applying the direction based combination approach to data from the fino 3 research platform the research platform fino 3 is located several kilometers northwards approximately 80 km off the island of sylt n 55 11 7 e 7 9 5 in a water depth of 23 m the observation period at fino 3 consist of four years beginning on 1st of january 2010 until 31st december 2013 the measured values of the four years are divided into 30 directional sectors starting at 0 and 15 as before the combination factors œà vref Œ∏ and œà hs50 Œ∏ according to eq 6 for the 30 directional sectors and sectors offset by 15 are shown in fig 11 generally speaking the load direction of maximum wind speeds at the fino 3 site are similar to those at fino 1 the wind speed v ref œà vref Œ∏ 1 0 is to be expected from 240 to 270 fig 11 left and from 285 to 315 respectively fig 11 right depending on the orientation of the 30 sectors in contrast the load direction of the maximum significant wave height h s50 differs significantly from the load direction at fino 1 the significant wave height h s50 for sector offsets of 15 is expected from 255 to 285 fig 11 right and 270 300 for sector without initial shifts fig 11 left this means that the extreme significant wave height h s50 can be expected from similar directions as the wind speed v ref the direct comparison of the combination factors from the overlapping directional sectors from 210 to 330 according to eq 6 confirms this result table 4 5 discussion approaches to describe the combination of extreme incidents with return periods of several decades are usually based on simultaneously acquired measurements and use reliability methods like haver and winterstein 2008 or copula approaches like zhang et al 2015 extreme conditions due to storms hurricanes or tropical cyclones were investigated by various studies e g van vledder et al 1993 young and vinoth 2013 meucci et al 2018 and further studies also take into account the directionality of wind and waves e g van vledder 1990 van vledder and holthuijsen 1993 young 2006 van vledder 2013 in this context and as pointed out in chapter 3 2 and 4 1 the wind wave misalignment is observed for in the southern north sea to estimate combination factors for aligned extreme wind speeds and significant wave heights in this study the strongest misalignments of perpendicular wind and wave action 15 are observed 10 of the time at fino 1 and only 25 of the time the wind and waves are aligned 15 while 65 are in between k√ºhn 2001 observed 65 alignment of wind and waves 15 from a nine year record close to the dutch coastline near ijmuiden which demonstrates the strong influence of the location in terms of fetch restrictions and wave propagation effects fischer et al 2011 observed large wind wave misalignments up to 120 in the dutch north sea for lower wind speeds 10 m s while the misalignment narrows down to approximately 30 for wind speeds 20 m s van vledder 2013 also concludes that wind wave misalignment becomes narrower with increasing wind speed and underlines the significant effect of upwind fetch restrictions on the wind wave misalignment likewise the upwind fetch restrictions dominate the correlation of wind and wave heights at fino i as well as illustrated by the regression curves of wind and wave occurrence in fig 2 regarding extreme wind and wave incidents the narrowing alignment is predominantly observed for western and northern directions fig 6 while storm incidents with southern and eastern mean wind directions show relatively large wind wave misalignments around 60 this observation might be relevant for direction dependent engineering and nautical applications since the strongest storm incidents with wind speeds 30 m s are observed from south west directions there are several contributions of effects which might influence the wind wave misalignment a major reason could be the superimposed effect of fetch restriction and swell or propagating waves from former or remote wind sources since waves from northern and western directions radiate into the local wave field after the wind has turned thereby wave energy of the new wave system is partly transferred to the counteracting wave system by white capping and non linear wave wave interaction van vledder 1990 and van vledder and holthuijsen 1993 performed intensive studies on the directional response of waves to turning winds and observed by modelling that white capping can play a major role in this matter and that the non linear wave wave interactions are of minor importance another interesting aspect is proposed by young and vinoth 2013 in terms of extended fetch by taking into account the pathway of tropical cyclones and the amplification of wave components propagating along with the rotating storm system this might be relevant for storm incidents characterized by more or less continuously turning winds as shown in fig 4 which is currently taken into account for the analysis and classification of the response time of the storm incidents the wind wave correlation is addressed by several studies and various perspectives zielke et al 2006 reveal good regression fittings by empirical formulations in terms of fetch length dependent tma and jonswap spectra for waves in the german north sea however exponential functions were proven as best regression fit for the wind wave correlation doong et al 2007 observed nearly linear relations from regression analysis for wind speeds greater than 6 m s and especially in the range of 6 15 m s while no significant relation was found for lower wind speeds for the pacific ocean north of taiwan this study uses the pearson correlation to reveal the direction dependency of wind and wave incidents and the lowest linear correlation is observed for south eastern directions 120 150 however similar to the results of doong et al 2007 the northern directions show nearly linear and steeper correlations fig 2 this is also observed by k√ºhn 2001 for the dutch north sea and two wave directions k√ºhn compares the neuman pierson relation valid for fully developed sea states with own relations for north western and south eastern waves both directions show significant less steep progressions in comparison to the neumann pierson curve moreover the south east related curve progresses clearly below the north west related curve which underlines the influence of fetch restrictions similar to this study nevertheless the characteristics of frequently occurring joint environmental incidents do not necessarily describe joint extreme events mittendorf 2006 in emeis and t√ºrk 2009 the dependence of the significant wave height on wind speed is analysed for four different wind direction sectors representing different fetch and stability conditions at the fino 1 research platform based on this rather rough subdivision into different directions extreme significant wave heights are estimated for each direction sector showing different effective directions for the significant wave height and the wind speed and thus supporting the hypothesis of the directional dependency of extreme events emeis and t√ºrk 2009 results of the direction independent values of the 50 year wind speed are in very good agreement with the results of t√ºrk 2008 t√ºrk s research is based on data from the same location even though he uses a smaller sample and a different statistical model the direction independent result of the significant wave height h s50 is 17 respectively 24 over the results of mittendorf 2006 mittendorf uses hindcast data based on 12 years wind records simulated with wavewatch iii and swan as well as formerly available measurement data of an observation period of 20 months as database for his extreme value analyses however the main reason for the divergent results will be the use of the total sample method for sampling in van vledder et al 1993 a clear influence of the total sample method on the result of the extreme value analysis can be found according to the performed investigations in chapter 4 it becomes clear that large sectors lead to increasingly conservative results since few extreme measurement values in a subsector are able to influence the result of the sector significantly small and overlapping sectors are to be preferred in order to achieve a high resolution of the directionality in particular in the case of minor deviations of the main load directions the design wind speed v ref occurs with an aligned significant wave height of h s 0 77 h s50 and h s50 occurs with an aligned wind speed v 0 92 v ref at fino 1 the results for h s50 are in the range given by emeis and t√ºrk 2009 in addition the direction dependent extreme value analysis for a more northerly location in the german north sea fino 3 shows a pronounced location dependency of the directional combination approach possible reasons for the strong dependence on the location are i e fetch restrictions refraction effects and variations in the wind field holthuijsen 1983 investigated directional wave spectra in the same area in front of the german wadden island sylt and found a connection between the upwind coastline and the directional wave spectrum a directionally decoupled wave growth is partly observed since wave spectra are often composed of various contributions of waves coming from different directions furthermore k√ºhn 2001 points out that not too much disturbance from the bottom is to be expected in case of water depths 20 m which is the case at fino 3 van vledder 2013 investigated the above mentioned effects on wind wave misalignments for various sites i e the black sea lake ijssel australian continental shelf he observed that refraction affects the amount of wind wave misalignment but the refraction is less significant than the spreading of the sea state and the influence of waves origin from various remote sites in this case the fetch restrictions are presumably the main reason for the location dependency since the directional fetch length at fino 3 differs remarkably in comparison to the fetch length at fino 1 wind from south west has a rather long fetch and wind from the north a rather short fetch at fino 3 while fino 1 shows almost none fetch length from south west but rather long fetch length for northern directions 6 conclusions the findings of this study show the extent of directional extreme wind and sea states and their different main load directions for the german north sea the occurrence of extreme wind and wave incidents is estimated by the developed method to analyze directional extreme values and to derive combination load factors the method can be transferred to other direction dependent events the analyses were performed on the basis of wind and wave field data at two sites in the german north sea and allows the following conclusions regarding the above mentioned objectives a perpendicular misalignment of wind and waves with respect to 15 appear for 10 of the data at fino 1 while 25 of measurements are aligned 15 if the threshold value is increased to 30 the alignment amounts 47 of the data as a result of 42 in line and 5 opposing times the median of the misalignment of ten years field data is 37 the storm incidents of the 10 year database are characterized by a decreasing wind and wave misalignment with regard to the mean wind direction of the individual storms the observed misalignment of wind and wave direction is approximately 60 for storms from southern directions and the misalignment angle decreases more or less gradually down to 30 for storms from north western directions fig 6 the load direction and combination of wind and wave incidents with return periods of several decades are clearly location dependent at fino 1 the load direction of the wind speed v ref and the significant wave height h s50 differs between 45 and 60 at fino 3 located 140 km north east with regard to fino 1 the wind speed v ref and the significant wave height h s50 are almost aligned large sectors lead to increasingly conservative results since few extreme measurement values in a subsector are able to influence the result of the sector significantly a larger number of small sectors allows a more differentiated directional analysis and thus more economical load assumptions this requires a sufficiently large number of elements in the considered samples combination factors can be and are determined for aligned extreme wind speeds and significant wave heights based on direction dependent extreme value analyses at fino 1 the maximum v ref appears with an aligned h s 0 77 h s50 and h s50 aligns with a maximum wind speed of 0 92 v ref it should be noted that the investigations refers only to 10 min averaged values of wind and 3 h averaged values of wave direction scattering load directions within these time intervals were not taken into consideration and should be taken into account for detailed designs by distribution functions for load direction see also gr√ºnberg and

institute of concrete construction leibniz universit√§t hannover appelstra√üe 9a hannover 30167 germany corresponding author the misalignment of wind and waves is of special interest for various engineering applications i e for structural fatigue load analyses for work vessel operations for offshore construction or maintenance and for floating wind turbines in addition to the normal or frequent boundary conditions the combination of extreme loads and their directions is essential for coastal and offshore designs these aspects are addressed by analyzing ten years of field measurements in the german bight of the north sea which is intensively used for offshore wind energy production this paper focuses on the occurrence and amount of wind and wave misalignment as well as the direction dependency of the wind wave correlation for normal conditions and extreme storms subsequently the influence of statistical distribution functions for the estimation of extreme wind and wave values is presented based on these results a method is developed to combine direction dependent extreme wind and wave incidents for return periods of several decades keywords wind wave misalignment wind wave correlation storm incidents extreme values combination factor 1 introduction developing wind waves in open waters are primarily generated due to momentum exchanges by wind action related to fetch length wind speed and wind duration cavaleri et al 2012 these are direction dependent due to influences of nearby land masses and the topographic shape of the sea floor atmospheric air circulation and marine current systems hasselmann et al 1973 zielke et al 2007 emeis and t√ºrk 2009 while wind can rapidly change its direction and intensity the inert water waves react delayed in relation to the wind profile as analysed and described by van vledder 1990 and van vledder and holthuijsen 1993 as a consequence wind speed and propagating waves occur to some extent from different directions donelan et al 1985 philippe et al 2013 which is of special interest for normal conditions and extreme events regarding design and operation of offshore and coastal structures barj et al 2014 welzel et al 2016 usually co directional load combinations of extreme wind and wave incidents are applied and thus resulting in conservative designs however the directionality has an important role with regard to several offshore and coastal issues it is for instance the design of mechanical connections and structural members which can be optimized by considering variable load directions since material stresses are more equally distributed in structural cross sections leading to efficient designs hildebrandt 2013 st√ºmpel et al 2017 furthermore fatigue damage is intensified especially for fixed offshore wind converters by wind and wave loads simultaneously acting from different directions due to the misaligned aerodynamic damping of the rotor regarding the wave loads from lateral directions koukoura et al 2016 while for floating offshore wind converters increased motions are observed for wind wave misalignment rather than crucial fatigue contributions bachynski et al 2014 barj et al 2014 in addition to the design aspects offshore logistics marine operations construction time and costs are mainly driven by the operational times of the working vessels which strongly depend on the wind and wave occurrence and correlation the environmental parameters wind speed and significant wave height are direction dependent and could therefore lead to different load directions on a structure for extreme incidents for the same return periods which leads to reduced loads in comparison to the afore mentioned conservative approach measurements show that increasing wind speeds lead to converging wind and wave directions however based on the findings of this study the following hypothesis is formulated a location dependent extreme wind speed i e once in 50 years does not necessarily occur from the same direction as the extreme wave for the same return period thus the extreme wind could be combined with a reduced extreme wave and vice versa this hypothesis will be verified and quantified for the southern north sea by means of direction dependent extreme value analyses based on measurement data and the following objectives 1 to characterize the amount and occurrence of wind and wave misalignment in the north sea at the german bight on the basis of ten years measurements 2 to determine the direction dependency of the wind wave correlation for normal conditions and extreme storms 3 to present the influence of distribution functions for the estimation of extreme wind and wave values 4 and finally show direction dependent combinations of extreme wind and wave incidents for return periods of several decades 2 review of existing work 2 1 wind wave misalignment and correlation load estimations for various offshore structures due to directional wind and waves have been frequently investigated see also van vledder and holthuijsen 1993 van vledder 2013 and k√ºhn 2001 however information about observed wind wave misalignments and their load combinations are still scarce in literature even though numerous studies emphasize the importance i e trumars et al 2006 wei et al 2016 koukoura et al 2016 existing literature focuses primarily on directional analysis of frequent occurring incidents mittendorf 2006 bachynski et al 2014 van vledder 2013 and based on that the scope of this work primarily focuses on aligned extreme wind and wave incidents and their direction dependent combination t√ºrk 2008 describes the spatial and temporal development of wind speeds and corresponding changes in wave parameters i e increasing wave heights for stronger wind speeds and the postponed reaction of the waves k√ºhn 2001 reports prevailing south westerly winds for the dutch north sea and a co directed main wave direction in addition to a second main wave direction from the northern direction it is observed that approximately 65 of the waves are aligned to the wind direction within a range of 22 5 fischer et al 2011 present absolute values of wind and wave misalignment for the same region with regard to wind speed and wind speed probability interestingly large wind and wave misalignments of nearly 120 are observed for wind speeds below 10 m s and the misalignment narrows down to approximately 30 for wind speeds above 20 m s van vledder 2013 observes that wind wave misalignment becomes narrower with increasing wind speed and significant wave height and further takes into account the directionality of wind and waves van vledder and holthuijsen 1993 young 2006 as well as a detailed study on interfering effects on local wave systems from radiating waves white capping and wave wave interactions doong et al 2007 performed a regression analysis for the correlation of wind and wave energy in the north of taiwan and observed nearly linear relations for wind speeds greater than 6 m s the correlation and simultaneous occurrence of environmental impacts is a major concern not only for engineering problems in this case it is important for the calculation of the hydraulic impact of sea waves to have exact knowledge of the significant wave parameters which are usually derived from measurements and numerical models or in combination with statistic models ar g√ºner et al 2013 cover the development of a statistical wave model for the karaburun coastal zone located at the south west coast of the black sea with the help of wind and wave measurements they use long term wind data to predict the development of waves as well as to derive wind wave correlation parameters and showed that the height of the waves is directly correlating with the duration of the wind for the last four hours zielke et al 2006 investigate the correlation for the mean wind speed and significant wave height independently of the wind direction for the southern german north sea the analysis reveals good regression fittings by empirical formulations in terms of fetch length dependent tma and jonswap spectra and exponential functions were proven as best regression fit for the wind wave correlation t√ºrk 2008 investigates the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer in the german bight its correlation to wind speed and its influence on waves the data for the wind direction shows that the most commonly direction in the german bight is south west and investigations of wind directions of wind speeds 20 m s in different measurement heights confirm this result as also shown by schmidt et al 2015 2 2 wind wave distribution functions for extreme incidents since the early 1990s joint probability models were developed to describe simultaneously occurring environmental parameters with a long averaged return period of several decades haver and winterstein 2008 use reliability methods for long term response predictions of simultaneously occurring significant wave heights and spectral peak periods by inverse first order reliability method iform to develop environmental contour lines an extension of the environmental contour line procedure based on direct monte carlo simulations is described in huseby et al 2013 compared to fetch diagrams and empirical spectral formulations sverdrup and munk 1947 bretschneider 1958 pierson and moskowitz 1963 hasselmann et al 1973 the environmental contour line approach is not only useful for describing common but also extreme local wind and wave conditions dowell et al 2014 used fino 1 data from january 2004 to october 2010 and focus on the probability of time windows for repair maintenance and installations of offshore wind farms the results of the study show the right skewed distributions of wind speed and significant wave height and a best fit by a weibull distribution for the wind speeds and a gamma distribution for the wave both estimated with the maximum likelihood method bredmose et al 2012 show that wind speed distributions are mostly well approximated by weibull distributions for investigated sites in the north and baltic sea however the study shows that these distributions are less satisfactory for extreme incidents and gumbel distributions are recommended another approach to describe the joint density probability distribution of several random variables is the use of copulas see also genest and favre 2007 and salvadori et al 2007 a copula function is able to model the dependency structure between the marginal distributions of the considered random variables and eventually construct a multivariate distribution function when using the copula approach the copula is a cumulative distribution by itself whereby the copula can be chosen independently from the choice of the marginal distribution the application of different types of copulas to measure data of the significant wave height peak period and wind speed is shown in zhang et al 2015 the above mentioned studies summarize that research on wind wave misalignment their correlation as well as corresponding load combinations and distribution functions are in progress and of much relevance for engineering purposes and beyond however and as mentioned by passon 2015 accurate wind wave correlation methods do not exist and guidance is also missing in all relevant design guidelines local wind and wave interactions are in general driven by complex shear stress and pressure interactions at the air water interface and are additionally affected by currents water depths and varying boundary conditions along the fetch against that background this study focuses on the misalignment of wind and wind generated waves according to the objectives given above and to derive a method for load combinations based on field data 3 observations from 10 years wind and wave measurements in the german bight 3 1 measurements and data basis wind and wave data are used from the research platform fino 1 for the following investigations the research platform fino 1 is located approximately 45 km in the north of the island borkum in the southern north sea n 54 0 86 e6 35 26 the water depth at fino 1 is about 30 m a database including simultaneously measured wind speeds and wind directions as well as simultaneously measured significant wave heights and wave directions was created from records over ten years beginning on 1st of january 2004 until 31st december 2013 the wind data consists of 10 min averaged values from anemometers and wind vanes while the significant wave heights and wave directions are derived from directional wave rider buoy datawell dwr mkiii measurements every 30 min wind data for the analysis of the wind wave correlation is taken at the lowest measuring position 33 m above lat lowest astronomical tide so as close to the water surface as possible furthermore wind data in approximately 100 m above lat which corresponds to the hub height of current offshore wind converters are taken into account for the stochastic analysis the wind conditions at hub height are used in regulations for the design of wind converters the data cover of the parameters is listed in table 1 and basically amounts for 67 of the wave records and for 92 96 of the wind data further details of the measurement technology and the data preparation is given in schmidt 2017 in addition three hour averaged values are used for the stochastically analysis a tolerance time of nine minutes is allowed for the temporal assignment of the sea state measurements to wind speed records to account for time offsets of the wind and wave recording interval after occasional equipment failure the three hour interval is based on the rather stationary behavior of the short term wave conditions for a period of three hours according to dnv rp 205 2010 and iec 61400 3 2009 consequently the 30 min sea state values are averaged over a period of three hours for this purpose the directional data is converted into cartesian coordinates in order to account for the instant change of directional values around north from 0 to 360 and afterwards transferred back into polar coordinates 3 2 misalignment and correlation of wind and waves table 1 lists the characteristic wind and wave parameters used in this study from ten years data the maximum wind speed 100 m above lat exceeds the one at 33 m by 5 while the mean wind speed at 100 m exceeds the one at 33 m by 15 and amounts to 9 83 m s the median values at both heights are slightly reduced in comparison to the corresponding mean values on the same level the differences of the mean and median values though are less pronounced for the wind direction at both heights regarding the waves the mean value of the significant wave height amounts 1 47 m and the mean value tm is 6 9 s which is the average of the mean wave periods estimated from the spectral moment s m0 m1 per measuring interval the minimum and maximum measurement values are supplemented by the 1 and 99 quantiles in table 1 in order to emphasize the characteristic at the boundaries of the data range the 1 quantile of the significant wave height is 0 27 m for the 30 min measurement intervals while the 99 quantile value reaches 4 6 m the direct comparison of the mean wind Œ∏wi and mean wave direction Œ∏wa averaged from the mean wind and wave direction per measuring interval results in a shift of approximately 70 however it should be pointed out that the mean values of the wind and wave directions do not account for the instantaneous wind wave misalignment over the years since the directions are not compared for each point in time this is rather expressed by the given mean value of the wind wave misalignment in table 1 which is the average of all simultaneous misalignments of the wind direction at 33 m above lat and the wave direction for this reason the wind data is averaged over three 10 min intervals during the 30 min wave data intervals the data cover of wind and wave direction 92 and 67 respectively results in 60 of overlapping data for the ten years the median value of the misalignment regarding wind and wave direction amounts 37 estimated from the available six years 60 records out of ten years fig 1 shows the duration curves of the measured wind and wave parameters 10 min and 30 min intervals respectively over ten years and indicates their relative frequency of occurrence on the ordinate each time series of the wind and wave parameters is normalized by the corresponding maximum data point which is given in the legend for reference on the abscissa each duration curve is normalized and subsequently sorted by their rank by the period of available measurement data which is 3314 days 91 in ten years for the wind speed 3328 days 92 for the wind direction and 2438 days 66 8 for the wave height direction and period the 1 and 99 quantiles of the measurements listed in table 1 are picked from the 0 01 and 0 99 data points on the abscissa and provide an impression about the strong gradients of the duration curves close to the data limits furthermore the graphs reveal several properties about the wind and wave characteristics at the fino 1 location the wind and wave direction distribution is remarkable in comparison to a theoretical uniform directional distribution indicated by the straight dashed line this is due to the fact that they progress with rather pronounced sections of steep or flat curves therefore it becomes clear that the more evenly inclined or the closer the graph fits to the theoretical line the more evenly distributed the parameter which applies the most for the wind direction nevertheless the wave direction is more dominated by western directions than the wind which is expressed by the graph progressing above the theoretical straight line and the values above 0 75 indicating 0 75 360 270 however the directional frequency of wind occurrence disregarding the wind speed is relatively uniform in comparison to the wave direction progressing significantly above the straight uniform distribution and above the wind distribution due to the location of fino 1 close to the german coastline the duration curve of the wave direction is characterized by a steep slope for southern directions which corresponds to a low number of wave events from this direction due to the upwind fetch restrictions as also noted by kuik and holthuijsen 1981 and portilla yand√∫n et al 2015 fig 1 shows the low frequency of occurrence for values between 0 33 and 0 66 120 240 which ranges about 5 of the time furthermore the graph progresses significantly above the wind direction and shows three flat sloped sections on a level at 0 25 0 75 and 0 94 this corresponds to east 90 west 270 and close to north 340 for the wave directions the frequency of occurrence of the eastern directions is about 15 while the western directions cover 50 while 30 are approaching from northern directions similar characteristics can be observed from other parameters for example wind speeds above 3 m s and below 25 m s which are typical for offshore wind usage correspond to the data between 0 08 and 0 68 fig 1 and occur more than 93 of the time wind speeds below 10 m s occur approximately 65 of the time which is i e a common requirement for the installation of rotor blades wave heights below 1 5 m are crucial for jack up vessels to jack the working deck which occurs approximately at 60 of the sea states at fino 1 however regarding the correlation of wind and wave direction the bold line shows the misalignment of the wind and wave direction as described above in most cases the main horizontal wave loads on structures are positively and negatively in line with the direction of wave propagation for structures sensitive to wind and wave loads e g offshore wind converters the most distinct misalignment of wind and wave action occurs at perpendicular directions due to the missing aerodynamic damping in contrast to aligned wind and wave action this is the case for 10 of the time if the perpendicular angle is chosen 15 from 90 likewise wind and waves act in the same direction about 23 of the time if the alignment is categorized by angles 15 while opposing wind and waves 180 15 cover only 2 5 of the time this leads to a wind and wave misalignment 15 for about 75 of the time if the threshold for aligned directions is however increased to 30 the misalignment amounts 53 of the time as a result of 42 in line and 5 opposing times based on the frequency of occurrence of simultaneous wind and wave records fig 2 shows the relation of wind speeds and wave heights arranged by 30 sectors starting off north at zero degrees each sectional scatter plot shows the simultaneous 10 min wind speeds averaged over half an hour and 30 min significant wave heights on the ordinate and abscissa of the ten year data basis the scatter points are colored equivalent to the frequency of occurrence which is normalized by the corresponding maximum frequency of occurrence the red lines show the quadratic regression curves x2c x b a of the simultaneously occurring data points in order to illustrate the extent of the linear correlation of the wind speeds and wave heights the functions of the regression curves are estimated from the minimum residuals by the method of least squares while the extent of linear correlation is estimated by the pearson correlation coefficient rxy for the wind x and wave y incidents 1 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the correlation coefficient for each sector is plotted in the middle of fig 2 and indicates a strong rxy 1 or weak rxy 0 linear correlation of wind speeds and wave heights as expected all coefficients are positive due to the physical connection of wind induced waves however the lowest linear correlation rxy 0 56 is observed for south eastern directions ranging from 120 to 150 which is seen by the low significant wave heights around 3 m connected to the strong winds of nearly 20 m s for opposite directions around north west a strong pronounced and almost linear correlation rxy 0 77 of increasing wind speeds and wave heights is observed by a relatively straight regression curve a similar high correlation is also observed for the western sections even though the coefficients are slightly reduced and the regressions are more curved in comparison to the 300 330 sector moreover the north west sections show the highest frequency of occurrence of high waves even for moderate winds around 10 15 m s see section 300 330 however the strongest winds 30 m s are observed from the south west directions besides the sectional wind characteristics the directional correlations of wind and wave heights are clearly connected to the geographical properties of the measurement location the relatively small wave heights for south eastern directions can be explained by the close coastline and a therefore very limited fetch as described above and shown in fig 1 there is a steep slope of the wind wave misalignment near 0 5 360 180 on the ordinate indicating a very low frequency of occurrence of opposing wind and wave directions this could cause the small fraction of relatively high waves for southern wind incidents beyond the obvious connection of strong wind and high waves for the northern direction due to the long fetch length approaching swells from north west and turning wind situations are the basis for the simultaneous occurring of high waves and moderate wind speeds which could dominate the local wave system or shift energy between remote and local by wave systems as investigated by van vledder 1990 as a consequence of the noticeable observations for occurring strong winds and waves the following section presents the characteristics of storm incidents and focuses on individual wind and wave correlations for extreme events 4 characteristics of storm incidents and long term statistics 4 1 wind wave misalignment of storm incidents the wind speed is used to identify individual storm incidents of the ten year data basis in terms of wind speeds 16 m s duration 6 h of strong winds and available concurrent wind and wave data figs 3 and 4 illustrate two examples out of 82 detected storms in ten years and show the time series of wind speed and direction as well as significant wave height and direction these time series are plotted against time in hours and the vertical dashed lines mark the selected onset and the end of the storm incident the time windows and durations of the storms are picked by visual inspection in order to define individual and closed events with regard to noticeable developments of the wind speed and wind direction the storm in january 2005 is characterized by steadily increasing wind for two days until reaching peak values 30 m s the significant wave height of the 30 min measurement intervals increases up to 6 3 m and both the wind and the wave direction are predominantly approaching from western directions while the waves are coming from west the wind is approaching more southerly from 210 until both directions unite for nearly three hours during the peak wind speed interestingly the wave direction seems to respond to the changing wind direction of 60 during the peak wind and follows the orientation of the wind by maintaining a more or less constant misalignment of 30 50 after the peak wind speed in direct comparison the storm in october 2013 is shorter and contains lower wind speeds up to 24 m s and significant wave heights of 4 8 m however the rate of changing wind speed is more than doubled and amounts 0 88 m s per hour in contrast to 0 3 m s per hour for the storm in 2005 likewise an increased rate of changing wave height can be observed for the storm in 2013 which might be reasoned by the previously low wave heights around 0 6 m combined with a high rate of increasing wind speeds in addition the northern wind changes to south eastern directions during the onset providing a very limited fetch length which results in the interim drop of wave heights even though the wind speed is increasing subsequently the wind direction changes almost constantly from 120 up to 360 and the wave direction aligns nearly instantaneously without a pronounced shift in this case characteristic properties of 82 identified storms are illustrated in fig 5 showing the maximum wind speed duration and mean wind direction of each incident in total 103 storms are identified on the basis of the data cover of the fino 1 measurements leading to an average occurrence frequency of 10 storms per year however only 82 time windows provide both wind and wave data the storms are sorted by their averaged wind direction during the onset and the end of the assigned time windows the majority of the storms are as expected dominated by western directions which can be seen by 50 mean direction values number 10 to 60 between 200 and 270 if the mean wind directions are categorized into the compass directions 11 are coming from northern directions 315 45 6 from the east 45 135 23 from the south 135 225 and 60 from western directions 225 315 moreover the standard deviation of the mean wind direction is given by the error bars for each storm in order to point out the change of wind direction as described above the plotted storm in fig 3 is storm number 32 in fig 5 and shows the very low standard deviation of 15 which is mainly due to the nearly constant wind direction in comparison the continuously changing wind direction in fig 4 is storm number 59 in fig 5 and reveals the highest observed standard deviation of 100 a systematic pattern of the standard deviation is hard to observe since the size of the error bars does not obviously vary with maximum wind speed or storm duration however the rather high variations of the wind directions correspond to the western directions while the five eastern storms and most of the northern storms above 300 show a rather small range of standard deviations in accordance with the observed mean wind characteristics fig 6 illustrates the same identified storms arranged in the same order on the abscissa by increasing mean wind directions of the whole storm duration the ordinates represent the directional angles of wind and waves while the third plot provides the directional shift in degrees of the instantaneous wind and wave values in the first plot the colors of the data points provide the frequency of occurrence of the wind directions for each storm the directional frequencies for each storm sum up to 100 while the second plot shows the frequency of occurrence for the wave directions and the third plot for the misalignment of the wind and wave direction for each storm accordingly as expected from the findings described above the data points in fig 6 left show a very similar progression like the mean wind directions in fig 5 outlined by the high frequencies of occurrence furthermore the vertical range of occurring data points corresponds to the extent of the standard deviations additional findings can be observed from the wave directions which show after five eastern storms a less steep progression along the ranked storms in comparison to the wind directions furthermore the color intensity along the ordinate represents the probability distribution for each storm while the wind directions show rather broad distributions with a bandwidth of around 60 the wave directions reveal more concentrated distributions that are characterized by a rather narrow bandwidth of 30 finally the instantaneous misalignment of the wind and wave directions in fig 6 right reveal a general progression of decreasing misalignments for more and more northern mean wind directions this can be observed by the increasing frequency of occurrence green and red colors of smaller directional shifts for the upper segment of the ranked storms i e storms 60 82 nearly all storms contain a broad range of directional shifts however the probability distributions show an obvious progression of the decreasing misalignment this is illustrated by red yellow and cyan colors depending on the mean wind direction after five eastern storm events no 1 5 in fig 6 the highest frequencies of occurrence of the instantaneous directional shifts reduce from approximately 60 90 down to 20 30 for the northern wind directions thus directional dependency and wind wave misalignment exist remarkably for storm incidents and is further considered by the following long term statistics 4 2 long term statistics of aligned wind and wave events 4 2 1 method for extreme value analyses for the direction dependent investigations of extreme wind speeds and significant wave heights in the southern north sea are two sector sizes of 30 and 60 initially set different effects are expected for different sector or sample sizes on the one hand small sectors lead to a high directional resolution on the other hand small sectors lead to more unreliable results of extreme value analysis due to smaller sample sizes and vice versa the sector size of 30 is related to common sector sizes for directional fatigue tests of offshore wind turbines cf iec 61400 3 2009 in addition 60 sectors are investigated to obtain larger sample sizes in order to implement more extreme measurement values in each sector for the direction dependent extreme value analyses the investigations are carried out with overlapping sectors to ensure a higher direction resolution for the investigations described above the number of sectors was doubled by an overlap of half a sector wide thus the wind speed and significant wave height in 24 directional sectors of 30 and 12 directional sectors of 60 were analysed independently of each other to ensure the comparability of the direction dependent results a uniform approach is used in the extreme value analysis in schmidt 2017 numerous extreme value analyses were performed and evaluated based on the measurement data described in chapter 3 1 numerous assumptions influence the results of extreme value analyses see also van vledder et al 1993 thus the sampling method the assumed distribution function and the estimation method for the distribution parameters so called point estimation methods influence each other mutually however the investigations show that the point estimation method does influence the result of the extreme value analyses less than the considered distribution functions fig 7 shows the scatter of 50 year events for different point estimation methods for the distribution parameters method of moments least square method and maximum likelihood estimation and distribution functions gumbel i max weibull iii max weibull iii min rayleigh gamma and frechet ii max these sensitivity analyses of the extreme values are carried out using the methods shown in table 2 whereby either the point estimation method for the distribution parameters or the distribution function is varied the approximated extreme values of wind speed v ref and significant wave height h s50 by using different distribution functions and point estimation methods are displayed in figs 8 and 9 the wind speed v ref represent the 10 min mean of the extreme wind speed with a recurrence period of 50 years at hub height the significant wave height hs50 represent the significant wave height with the recurrence period of 50 years both parameters are described in iec 61400 3 2009 the goodness of fit determined by the chi square test œá2 test and the kolmogorow smirnow test k s test is displayed by the grey scales for the purpose of comparison the results of t√ºrk 2008 emeis and t√ºrk 2009 and mittendorf 2006 are also listed based on these results the approach shown in table 2 is used for all subsequent extreme value analyses 4 2 2 direction dependent extreme value analysis method for the direction dependent sample analysis two procedures are feasible the first possibility is the application of the block maxima method to all direction independent data in order to identify extreme values for the subsequent classification into the directional sectors the block maxima method is a general formulation of the annual maxima method and is valid for arbitrarily long time intervals block sizes such a procedure leads to a different number of extreme values in the different directional sectors and requires a sector specific adaptation of the quantiles the second possibility is the classification of the measurement data into the different directional sectors and the subsequent application of the block maxima method the directional subdivision and subsequent analysis of the samples ensures a constant number of measured values in each sector the extreme value analysis in this study is carried out based on eight week extreme values the reference period of eight weeks ensure a sufficiently large sample combined with a long reference period whereby reliable results of the extreme value analysis are to be expected schmidt 2017 notes that the results of the two described procedures are in good agreement to each other especially in extreme value analyses based on measurements with a long reference period for the subsequent shown direction based combination approach the measured values are firstly classified in directional sectors and extreme values are determined secondly for each sector by the block maxima method thereby the displayed model estimates the intensity of aligned extreme load parameters which do not occur necessarily at the same time extreme value analyses are performed for wind speeds and significant wave heights in each directional sector in order to be able to estimate the intensity of aligned wind speeds and significant wave heights with return periods of several decades the probability of occurrence expressed by the quantiles p Œª is calculated for each sector eq 2 thereby Œª specifies the averaged return period of the measurement data in years which are the basis of the extreme value analyses 2 p Œª 1 1 Œª r the extreme values x r with a defined return period r are calculated with a suitable inverse distribution function depending on the quantile p Œª eq 3 3 x r f 1 p Œª according to the results of the comparative studies in schmidt 2017 the 3 parameter weibull distribution for maxima weibull iii max given in eq 4 is used for the extreme value analyses 4 f x x exp œâ x œâ w k the direction independent extreme values x r as well as direction dependent extreme values x r Œ∏ with the return period r are estimated using eq 3 and the inverse of eq 4 subsequently the extreme values x r Œ∏ and x r are related to each other eq 5 5 œà i Œ∏ x i r Œ∏ x i r in this way direction dependent combination factors œà i Œ∏ are determined for wind speeds and significant wave heights in each directional sector the direction dependent extreme value analysis can either lead to lower or to higher extreme values than the direction independent extreme value analysis which is mainly due to the different underlying fractions of the data basis therefore the range of values 0 œà i Œ∏ 1 is t not necessarily correct in the analysis concerned the deviation between the extreme value of the maximum directional 30 sector and the direction independent extreme value is 2 for the wind speed and 5 for the significant wave height to ensure the reliability of a direction independent extreme value analysis the direction dependent combination factors œà i Œ∏ are normalized to the direction independent extreme value x i r eq 6 the parameter rel œà i Œ∏ corresponds to the maximum œà i Œ∏ according to eq 5 of all directional sectors 6 œà i Œ∏ x i r Œ∏ x i r r e l œà i Œ∏ 1 as a result of the normalization the characteristic extreme event from the maximum directional sector corresponds to direction independent characteristic extreme event consequently the value range 0 œà i Œ∏ 1 applies to the combination factors of aligned extreme wind speeds and significant wave heights whereby the evaluation is based on time independent measured values at the fino 1 location the direction dependent extreme value analysis confirms the assumption of different main directions of wind and wave action the values œà vref Œ∏ and œà hs50 Œ∏ according to eq 6 for differently oriented 30 sectors are shown in fig 12 according to the performed investigations the wind speed v ref is to be expected from 240 to 300 see fig 12 left respectively from 255 to 285 in fig 12 right in other sectors the 50 year wind speed decreases to about half of the wind speed v ref i e 0 30 in fig 12 left the significant wave height h s50 changes even more for different directions the significant wave height h s50 is to be expected from 300 to 330 fig 12 left respectively from 315 to 345 fig 12 right in other sectors the 50 year significant wave height decreases to about a quarter of the significant wave height h s50 i e from 90 to 120 in fig 12 left overall a higher directional dependency can be stated for significant wave heights than the wind speeds extreme wind and sea state events from the west to the north will be decisive for the design of rotationally symmetrical offshore structures at the investigated site the combination factors œà vref Œ∏ and œà hs50 Œ∏ according to eq 6 on the basis of the offset 30 and 60 sectors are listed in table 3 for the relevant loading directions between 240 and 360 table 3 also shows the deviation of the combination factors for sectors of different sizes the combination factors based on different sector sizes differ considerably in some cases as seen for loading direction 360 in table 3 these deviations result from a small number of extreme measurement values within a subsector which exert a strong influence on the result of the extreme value analyses of the considered sector the significant wave height h s50 of the northern 60 sector is mainly determined by the extreme significant wave heights from 330 to 345 fig 10 the measured values of this subsector are much higher than the values of the sector 345 15 which form the data basis for the h s50 of the northern 30 sector consequently the combination factor for h s50 of the northern 60 sector is 43 higher than the factor for h s50 of the northern 30 sector this effect leads to increasingly conservative results with an increasing sector size a rough subdivision into sectors though does not provide a difference from a direction independent analysis at a site with similar main load directions therefore smaller directional sectors are preferable provided that the number of samples is sufficiently large 4 2 3 location dependency of direction dependent extreme wind and waves the location dependency and the influence of a smaller sample size are analysed by applying the direction based combination approach to data from the fino 3 research platform the research platform fino 3 is located several kilometers northwards approximately 80 km off the island of sylt n 55 11 7 e 7 9 5 in a water depth of 23 m the observation period at fino 3 consist of four years beginning on 1st of january 2010 until 31st december 2013 the measured values of the four years are divided into 30 directional sectors starting at 0 and 15 as before the combination factors œà vref Œ∏ and œà hs50 Œ∏ according to eq 6 for the 30 directional sectors and sectors offset by 15 are shown in fig 11 generally speaking the load direction of maximum wind speeds at the fino 3 site are similar to those at fino 1 the wind speed v ref œà vref Œ∏ 1 0 is to be expected from 240 to 270 fig 11 left and from 285 to 315 respectively fig 11 right depending on the orientation of the 30 sectors in contrast the load direction of the maximum significant wave height h s50 differs significantly from the load direction at fino 1 the significant wave height h s50 for sector offsets of 15 is expected from 255 to 285 fig 11 right and 270 300 for sector without initial shifts fig 11 left this means that the extreme significant wave height h s50 can be expected from similar directions as the wind speed v ref the direct comparison of the combination factors from the overlapping directional sectors from 210 to 330 according to eq 6 confirms this result table 4 5 discussion approaches to describe the combination of extreme incidents with return periods of several decades are usually based on simultaneously acquired measurements and use reliability methods like haver and winterstein 2008 or copula approaches like zhang et al 2015 extreme conditions due to storms hurricanes or tropical cyclones were investigated by various studies e g van vledder et al 1993 young and vinoth 2013 meucci et al 2018 and further studies also take into account the directionality of wind and waves e g van vledder 1990 van vledder and holthuijsen 1993 young 2006 van vledder 2013 in this context and as pointed out in chapter 3 2 and 4 1 the wind wave misalignment is observed for in the southern north sea to estimate combination factors for aligned extreme wind speeds and significant wave heights in this study the strongest misalignments of perpendicular wind and wave action 15 are observed 10 of the time at fino 1 and only 25 of the time the wind and waves are aligned 15 while 65 are in between k√ºhn 2001 observed 65 alignment of wind and waves 15 from a nine year record close to the dutch coastline near ijmuiden which demonstrates the strong influence of the location in terms of fetch restrictions and wave propagation effects fischer et al 2011 observed large wind wave misalignments up to 120 in the dutch north sea for lower wind speeds 10 m s while the misalignment narrows down to approximately 30 for wind speeds 20 m s van vledder 2013 also concludes that wind wave misalignment becomes narrower with increasing wind speed and underlines the significant effect of upwind fetch restrictions on the wind wave misalignment likewise the upwind fetch restrictions dominate the correlation of wind and wave heights at fino i as well as illustrated by the regression curves of wind and wave occurrence in fig 2 regarding extreme wind and wave incidents the narrowing alignment is predominantly observed for western and northern directions fig 6 while storm incidents with southern and eastern mean wind directions show relatively large wind wave misalignments around 60 this observation might be relevant for direction dependent engineering and nautical applications since the strongest storm incidents with wind speeds 30 m s are observed from south west directions there are several contributions of effects which might influence the wind wave misalignment a major reason could be the superimposed effect of fetch restriction and swell or propagating waves from former or remote wind sources since waves from northern and western directions radiate into the local wave field after the wind has turned thereby wave energy of the new wave system is partly transferred to the counteracting wave system by white capping and non linear wave wave interaction van vledder 1990 and van vledder and holthuijsen 1993 performed intensive studies on the directional response of waves to turning winds and observed by modelling that white capping can play a major role in this matter and that the non linear wave wave interactions are of minor importance another interesting aspect is proposed by young and vinoth 2013 in terms of extended fetch by taking into account the pathway of tropical cyclones and the amplification of wave components propagating along with the rotating storm system this might be relevant for storm incidents characterized by more or less continuously turning winds as shown in fig 4 which is currently taken into account for the analysis and classification of the response time of the storm incidents the wind wave correlation is addressed by several studies and various perspectives zielke et al 2006 reveal good regression fittings by empirical formulations in terms of fetch length dependent tma and jonswap spectra for waves in the german north sea however exponential functions were proven as best regression fit for the wind wave correlation doong et al 2007 observed nearly linear relations from regression analysis for wind speeds greater than 6 m s and especially in the range of 6 15 m s while no significant relation was found for lower wind speeds for the pacific ocean north of taiwan this study uses the pearson correlation to reveal the direction dependency of wind and wave incidents and the lowest linear correlation is observed for south eastern directions 120 150 however similar to the results of doong et al 2007 the northern directions show nearly linear and steeper correlations fig 2 this is also observed by k√ºhn 2001 for the dutch north sea and two wave directions k√ºhn compares the neuman pierson relation valid for fully developed sea states with own relations for north western and south eastern waves both directions show significant less steep progressions in comparison to the neumann pierson curve moreover the south east related curve progresses clearly below the north west related curve which underlines the influence of fetch restrictions similar to this study nevertheless the characteristics of frequently occurring joint environmental incidents do not necessarily describe joint extreme events mittendorf 2006 in emeis and t√ºrk 2009 the dependence of the significant wave height on wind speed is analysed for four different wind direction sectors representing different fetch and stability conditions at the fino 1 research platform based on this rather rough subdivision into different directions extreme significant wave heights are estimated for each direction sector showing different effective directions for the significant wave height and the wind speed and thus supporting the hypothesis of the directional dependency of extreme events emeis and t√ºrk 2009 results of the direction independent values of the 50 year wind speed are in very good agreement with the results of t√ºrk 2008 t√ºrk s research is based on data from the same location even though he uses a smaller sample and a different statistical model the direction independent result of the significant wave height h s50 is 17 respectively 24 over the results of mittendorf 2006 mittendorf uses hindcast data based on 12 years wind records simulated with wavewatch iii and swan as well as formerly available measurement data of an observation period of 20 months as database for his extreme value analyses however the main reason for the divergent results will be the use of the total sample method for sampling in van vledder et al 1993 a clear influence of the total sample method on the result of the extreme value analysis can be found according to the performed investigations in chapter 4 it becomes clear that large sectors lead to increasingly conservative results since few extreme measurement values in a subsector are able to influence the result of the sector significantly small and overlapping sectors are to be preferred in order to achieve a high resolution of the directionality in particular in the case of minor deviations of the main load directions the design wind speed v ref occurs with an aligned significant wave height of h s 0 77 h s50 and h s50 occurs with an aligned wind speed v 0 92 v ref at fino 1 the results for h s50 are in the range given by emeis and t√ºrk 2009 in addition the direction dependent extreme value analysis for a more northerly location in the german north sea fino 3 shows a pronounced location dependency of the directional combination approach possible reasons for the strong dependence on the location are i e fetch restrictions refraction effects and variations in the wind field holthuijsen 1983 investigated directional wave spectra in the same area in front of the german wadden island sylt and found a connection between the upwind coastline and the directional wave spectrum a directionally decoupled wave growth is partly observed since wave spectra are often composed of various contributions of waves coming from different directions furthermore k√ºhn 2001 points out that not too much disturbance from the bottom is to be expected in case of water depths 20 m which is the case at fino 3 van vledder 2013 investigated the above mentioned effects on wind wave misalignments for various sites i e the black sea lake ijssel australian continental shelf he observed that refraction affects the amount of wind wave misalignment but the refraction is less significant than the spreading of the sea state and the influence of waves origin from various remote sites in this case the fetch restrictions are presumably the main reason for the location dependency since the directional fetch length at fino 3 differs remarkably in comparison to the fetch length at fino 1 wind from south west has a rather long fetch and wind from the north a rather short fetch at fino 3 while fino 1 shows almost none fetch length from south west but rather long fetch length for northern directions 6 conclusions the findings of this study show the extent of directional extreme wind and sea states and their different main load directions for the german north sea the occurrence of extreme wind and wave incidents is estimated by the developed method to analyze directional extreme values and to derive combination load factors the method can be transferred to other direction dependent events the analyses were performed on the basis of wind and wave field data at two sites in the german north sea and allows the following conclusions regarding the above mentioned objectives a perpendicular misalignment of wind and waves with respect to 15 appear for 10 of the data at fino 1 while 25 of measurements are aligned 15 if the threshold value is increased to 30 the alignment amounts 47 of the data as a result of 42 in line and 5 opposing times the median of the misalignment of ten years field data is 37 the storm incidents of the 10 year database are characterized by a decreasing wind and wave misalignment with regard to the mean wind direction of the individual storms the observed misalignment of wind and wave direction is approximately 60 for storms from southern directions and the misalignment angle decreases more or less gradually down to 30 for storms from north western directions fig 6 the load direction and combination of wind and wave incidents with return periods of several decades are clearly location dependent at fino 1 the load direction of the wind speed v ref and the significant wave height h s50 differs between 45 and 60 at fino 3 located 140 km north east with regard to fino 1 the wind speed v ref and the significant wave height h s50 are almost aligned large sectors lead to increasingly conservative results since few extreme measurement values in a subsector are able to influence the result of the sector significantly a larger number of small sectors allows a more differentiated directional analysis and thus more economical load assumptions this requires a sufficiently large number of elements in the considered samples combination factors can be and are determined for aligned extreme wind speeds and significant wave heights based on direction dependent extreme value analyses at fino 1 the maximum v ref appears with an aligned h s 0 77 h s50 and h s50 aligns with a maximum wind speed of 0 92 v ref it should be noted that the investigations refers only to 10 min averaged values of wind and 3 h averaged values of wave direction scattering load directions within these time intervals were not taken into consideration and should be taken into account for detailed designs by distribution functions for load direction see also gr√ºnberg and

22848,in this paper a cloud computing based damage prevention system for marine structures during berthing consisting of a speed camera module and a cloud computing based web server is presented the speed camera module consists of a laser distance sensor a camera unit and an lte modem these were installed on the marine structure to monitor the speed of ships during berthing when the ship exceeds the berthing speed limit enacted by the ministry of oceans and fisheries an image of the ship and its speed data are transmitted to the web server via the lte modem this system was successfully tested at maryang harbor in korea to confirm its feasibility the web server activates an alert system when the image file is received and the manager or other appropriate personnel can prevent or minimize damage from the berthing by responding immediately all data were visualized and the berthing energy was calculated through the web server approved personnel can monitor the structure via the web server at any time and from anywhere the system is effective in preventing and inspecting damages by berthing that can be used as an application of structural health monitoring for marine structures keywords marine structure cloud computing damage prevention system berthing structural health monitoring 1 introduction marine structures have different structural design requirements than buildings because loads from berthing operational loadings and other loadings must be considered during berthing a large force is applied to the entire marine structure and protective fenders are installed to absorb the bulk of the energy the remainder is absorbed by the resistance of the seawater deformation of the ship and the edge structure cha 2012 liu and amdahl 2010 although the fenders are installed to protect both ship and marine structure during berthing sometimes the impact can be larger than the fenders can absorb resulting in damage to the fender or the structure neser and √ºnsalan 2006 sakakibara and kubo 2007 furthermore berthing with too much force can cause the dock to separate from the land when the marine structure is damaged serious problems can arise that compromise the safety of those who work on the structure and on the ship thus a monitoring system for berthing is essential to prevent or minimize damage huang and chen 2003 versteegt 2013 according to komatsu and salman 1972 personnel in the marine structure are often unable to observe when damage occurs from berthing since the damaged portion of the structure may be immersed in the ocean if the damage is not repaired it may escalate and cause eventual collapse of the structure ueda et al 2002 data driven monitoring of berthing as suggested in this paper can prevent this type of damage from going undetected the speed of the ship is the most important factor determining berthing energy although there are other factors at play these factors include berthing method berth speed marine structure type and environmental influences such as waves wind and tide kong et al 2004 metzger et al 2014 in this research a cloud computing based damage prevention system for marine structures during berthing was developed to avoid and minimize damage we combined cloud computing and an on site monitoring system equipped with a speed camera module this system detects the speed of the ship during berthing and with certain variables manually entered calculates the berthing energy the web server receives input from the speed camera module and automatically alerts the manager via a smartphone when the ship exceeds the berthing speed limit by monitoring the situation and employing a rapid alert system such as the one proposed in this study it is possible to minimize casualties and economic damage related to berthing 2 materials in this study speed camera module was developed for detecting the ships during berthing to transmit the data to cloud computing based web server furthermore amazon web

cloud computing based web server php was used as a web programming language for the web server while mysql was used as the database for the system a system diagram of the damage prevention system is shown in fig 3 the camera module is to be installed on the marine structure surface at a location where ships can be detected during berthing the camera module detects the speed of the ship and if the ship exceeds the berthing speed limit the module sends an image of the ship via the lte modem when the image file is received the web server sends an alarm alert to managers and assigned personnel via smartphone based sms and popup alarms 3 1 cloud computing based web server the web server is used to alert managers of the marine structure and other appropriate personnel of the need to prevent or minimize damages due to ships berthing at dangerous speeds with the web server and smart devices berthing ships can be monitored anytime anywhere furthermore the web server provides an application that allows the manager to calculate the berthing energy of the detected ship by inserting specific information about the ship manually when the calculated berthing energy exceeds the allowable berthing energy of the fenders or the structure the manager or related personnel can be aware of the location of potential damage and can use the data for inspection maintenance and repair 3 2 berthing speed limit the most important goal of the system is to prevent or minimize damage to fenders or marine structures by detecting berthing speed and providing an early warning system according to the port and fishing port design standards provided by the ministry of oceans and fisheries 2014 the berthing speed limit is determined by the allowable berthing impact of the fenders and marine structures the berthing speed limit is calculated based on observation data of berthing which varies depending on deadweight tonnage dwt of the ship the dwt is the maximum weight of cargo that can be carried on board the vessel during sea transport in most cases the standards state that the berthing speed limit is 15 cm s for ships with dwt below 10 000 and 10 cm s for ships with dwt above 10 000 ministry of land transport and maritime affairs 2011 however the limit can be changed due to many aspects including the type of marine structures the type of fenders and the condition of the marine environment roubos et al 2018 therefore it is important to check with the regulating authority before setting the berthing speed limit 3 2 1 sending alerts as mentioned earlier the web server is designed to alert the manager and other assigned personnel when an image file of the ship is received from the speed camera module via sms alert through a smart phone and a pop up message through a web page aws provides the sms and pop up message services from its open library 3 2 2 berthing energy when the ship exceeds the speed limit damage can result for the ship or the structure or both therefore the calculated berthing energy of the ship is useful to the manager or related personnel since such data can be used as a reference for inspection or restoration chegenizadeh et al 2015 mostofi and bargi 2012 calculating the berthing energy can help the manager to compare the impact of actual berthing energy to allowable berthing energies when the value of calculated berthing energy exceeds that of the allowable energy the manger can inspect the structure and ship right after berthing according to the ministry of oceans and fisheries 2014 there are many methods of calculating berthing energy such as statistical methods hydraulic model tests and the use of hydrodynamic models however the kinematic method is widely used because the data required to calculate the energy via other methods are often insufficient or because various constants required for calculation are not sufficiently provided thus the berthing energy e b is calculated by the following equation 2 2 e b m s v b 2 2 c e c m c p c s where m s is the mass of the ship v b is the berthing speed of the ship c e is the coefficient of an eccentricity c m is the coefficient of virtual mass c p is the coefficient of pliability and c s is the coefficient of shape a standard for the coefficient of pliability and shape is 1 0 the coefficients of eccentricity and virtual mass are calculated by equation

structures during berthing the harbor has a pier type structure that was constructed in 1999 the installation was comprised of the speed camera module and the cloud computing based web server 4 1 installation the watershed area and land area for maryang harbor are 105 000 square meters and 20 733 square meters respectively this is a relatively small harbor with a limited number of ships to berth two speed camera modules were installed for monitoring one on the berthing area and another where the ship is entering for berthing as shown in fig 4 also the web server for maryang harbor was enabled after connecting the speed camera module with the lte modem and the web address is http 4dcon kr portmgt cctv1 html 4 2 berthing speed limit according to the regulations of maryang harbor and the port and fishing port design standards the design berthing speed for the fenders in the structure is 15 cm s and the regulated berthing speed limit is 10 cm s therefore the speed camera module was designed to take a photograph and send an image file when the ship exceeds 10 cm s 4 3 method after installing the system in the harbor an experiment was performed on the data detection and transmission thus the experiment was designed to have a ship to exceed the berthing speed limit however the ministry only approved to use a rubber dinghy to test the system because of accidents and damages that can occur during the experiments and it is easy to control the speed furthermore a setting for the berthing speed limit was altered to 9 0 cm s to minimize the risk of the accidents by exceeding actual berthing speed limit because the experiment was focused on the data detection and visualization therefore the experiment was performed with the ship berthing with the speed between 9 0 cm s and 10 cm s 5 results the goal of the experiment was to perform an initial implementation of the proposed system in a real pier type harbor structure since the limit was set to 9 0 cm s the speed camera module successfully detected a ship with berthing speed of 9 7 cm s and sent an image file to the web server via lte modem along with the ship s speed data as shown in fig 5 after the data were received from the camera module the alert application was executed to notify the manager and the web server displayed the data properly in addition berthing energy was calculated by clicking the section for berthing energy as shown in fig 6 below although the system requires the remaining variables to be entered manually from the registry to calculate the berthing energy the web server automatically inputs the berthing speed of the ship in the case of an unknown ship or foreign ship with no registration in the local registry person who is using the system can obtain the variables by inquiring the manager of the ship and input them manually furthermore this calculation is used as a reference for comparison with the designed external force for inspecting damage among the structure and ships the system successfully detected a ship exceeding the set berthing speed limit and noticed the manager or related personnel of the harbor thus they were able to monitor the situation anytime and anywhere to prevent or minimize damages from the berthing in addition the file and data were saved in the server for future reference or an inspection considering the nature of the system it is important to proceed qualitative analysis based on user s experience we conducted interviews with the facility manager and supervisors who actually used the system to monitor their journey from their experience with the calculation application and alert system to after alert repair interviewees were very pleased especially with real time alert feature they were able to take an action right away to minimize the damages and further prevent accidents they were satisfied with the berthing energy calculation application which helped them to calculate the energy when the speed exceeded excessively they were able to inspect the structure immediately and repair or reinforce the damaged part which would prevent a secondary accident as receiving positive praise from the users it was proven that the

22848,in this paper a cloud computing based damage prevention system for marine structures during berthing consisting of a speed camera module and a cloud computing based web server is presented the speed camera module consists of a laser distance sensor a camera unit and an lte modem these were installed on the marine structure to monitor the speed of ships during berthing when the ship exceeds the berthing speed limit enacted by the ministry of oceans and fisheries an image of the ship and its speed data are transmitted to the web server via the lte modem this system was successfully tested at maryang harbor in korea to confirm its feasibility the web server activates an alert system when the image file is received and the manager or other appropriate personnel can prevent or minimize

server at any time and from anywhere the system is effective in preventing and inspecting damages by berthing that can be used as an application of structural health monitoring for marine structures keywords marine structure cloud computing damage prevention system berthing structural health monitoring 1 introduction marine structures have different structural design requirements than buildings because loads from berthing operational loadings and other loadings must be considered during berthing a large force is applied to the entire marine structure and protective fenders are installed to absorb the bulk of the energy the remainder is absorbed by the resistance of the seawater deformation of the ship and the edge structure cha 2012 liu and amdahl 2010 although the fenders are installed to protect both ship and marine structure during berthing sometimes the impact can be larger than the fenders can absorb resulting in damage to the fender or the structure neser and √ºnsalan 2006 sakakibara and kubo 2007 furthermore berthing with too much force can cause the dock to separate from the land when the marine structure is damaged serious problems can arise that compromise the safety of those who work on the structure and on the ship thus a monitoring system for berthing is essential to prevent or minimize damage huang and chen 2003 versteegt 2013 according to komatsu and salman 1972 personnel in the marine structure are often unable to observe when damage occurs from berthing since the damaged portion of the structure may be immersed in the ocean if the damage is not repaired it may escalate and cause eventual collapse of the structure ueda et al 2002 data driven monitoring of berthing as suggested in this paper can prevent this type of damage from going undetected the speed of the ship is the most important factor determining berthing energy although there are other factors at play these factors include berthing method berth speed marine structure type and environmental influences such as waves wind and tide kong et al 2004 metzger et al 2014 in this research a cloud computing based damage prevention system for marine structures during berthing was developed to avoid and minimize damage we combined cloud computing and an on site monitoring system equipped with a speed camera module this system detects the speed of the ship during berthing and with certain variables manually entered calculates the berthing energy the web server receives input from the speed camera module and automatically alerts the manager via a smartphone when the ship exceeds the berthing speed limit by monitoring the situation and employing a rapid alert system such as the one proposed in this study it is possible to minimize casualties and economic damage

22849,a high pressure chamber is the main equipment required for simulating deep sea operational environment and used for evaluating the performances of underwater equipment such as underwater vehicles under a preset pressure so that the possible malfunctions could be alarmed before deep sea commissioning in this paper due to its current unavailability a high pressure chamber with the maximum working pressure of 60 mpa was designed which has the inner diameter of 3 m and the height of 4 m possesses the video transmission function and allows most of the small scale underwater vehicle s overall stability and capacity to be tested possible to tackle the leakage and ensure the stability of the chamber this paper proposes a novel sealing method which adopts the combination of anti shear block device and four o ring seals and has the advantage of no need of manual pre tightening and of sufficient shear resistance the performance and strength analysis of the chamber were carried out by ansys workbench finite element analysis software furthermore the high pressure chamber was manufactured and its experiment verification results indicate that with larger containment volume and more advanced control system it could work reliably which made it feasible for its engineering application keywords deep sea environment simulation high pressure chamber structure design finite element analysis pressure experiment 1 introduction the total area of the oceans worldwide accounts for approximately 71 of the earth s total surface area with the maximum depth of over 10 000 m the ocean is rich in medical mineral and marine living resources dong et al 2005 charette and smith 2010 and can contribute toward the future development of human society by providing extensive and valuable resources however ocean exploration is a laborious task in deep sea environments the first challenge faced is that of high pressure which needs to be solved for developing underwater equipment and devices for each additional 100 m of ocean depth the pressure increases by 1 mpa therefore to guarantee the operational success of underwater equipment and devices they must first be subjected to a pressure test a high pressure chamber is a device that simulates the underwater pressure environment with its pressure resistant structure kawaguchi et al 2002 fathallah et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 su et al 2016 it mainly undertakes the performance test of deep sea equipment currently a variety of deep sea environment simulators and deep water high pressure chamber systems have been developed in domestic and international research studies liu and wang 2012 lee et al 2013 prakash and raphael 2014 lianget al 2015 to the authors knowledge it is found that the existing deep sea high pressure environment simulation devices still have space to improve for example wang designed devices that have relatively single function wang et al 2009 they can only measure the pressure resistance or the water tightness of the tested device or they can only detect leaks etc others proposed devices that the pressure is not enough or the volume of the inner chamber is small and the sealing performance is not ideal praneeth and rao 2012 tian 2013 yu proposed the device without video transmission function so it is impossible to monitor the internal situation in real time and adjust it in time yu et al 2014 in this paper a high pressure chamber is designed the chamber can simulate up to 6000 m deep 60 mpa underwater pressure environment which accounts for over 95 of the earth s deep ocean area at present the size of existing deep sea small scale underwater vehicles does not exceed 3 m in diameter and weighs no more than 100 kg ma and zhai 2004 with an inner diameter of 3 m and a height of 4 m the designed high pressure chamber allows most of the small scale submersibles to be put inside and to have their overall performance tested the chamber body weighs 320 tons

and thinned due to the factors such as corrosion and mechanical wear the chamber body thickness was rounded to 445 mm it is worth noting that the design stress intensity is 235 mpa and this is the minimum of both the yield strength and the tensile strength of the material 20mnmonb according to jb4732 1995 steel pressure vessel analytical design standards gb 2011 based on the above calculation the principle dimensions and the thickness of 60 mpa high pressure chamber are listed in table 2 2 3 structural stress calculation of high pressure chamber to determine the structural stress of the equipment operation the theoretical calculation was carried out to verify and evaluate the typical structure of the 60 mpa high pressure chamber the calculation results are displayed in table 3 and they show that the calculated stress are all within the allowable stress range so the strength requirements could be met k in the table denotes the ratio of the outer diameter to the inner diameter

pressure chamber designed in this paper is mainly composed of three parts i e the cylinder body the anti shear block disassembly and locking device the control system for loading unloading the pipelines their detailed description would be introduced in the rest of the section 2 5 1 design of the cylinder body to reduce manufacturing costs and make full use of the limited space in the chamber thus to facilitate the emplacement and removal of test models and the maintenance the upper half of the cylinder body adopts a large opening according to jb4732 1995 steel pressure vessels analytical design standard in fig 1 the designed chamber consists of a flat cover with an anti shear block structure a ball bottom head chamber body sealed bracket flat cover and o shaped nitrile rubber seals etc the chamber body is placed vertically 2 5 2 design of the seal structure due to the large opening structure of the cylinder body its sealing is one of the most critical challenges in the design of the entire system here a concave shear groove is formed on the upper chamber and a combination of a flat cover and an anti shear block is used to facilitate the upper seal to ensure the sealing effect o rings is chosen due to its self sealing and good corrosion resistance the seal between the lower part of the end of the flat cover and the cylinder body adopts four o ring seals shown in fig 2 of which ring 1 and ring 2 are set at the contact part of the flat cover and the high pressure chamber along the circumferential direction and ring 3 and ring 4 are arranged on the sealed bracket positioned below the flat cover the sealing ring 1 2 and 4 are radial seals and ring 3 is a flat seals the four seal rings have a shore hardness of 75 80hs and are made of nitrile rubber the sealed bracket is forged with the material 16mn compared with the traditional wood type seal structure this anti shear ring seal structure has the following advantages 1 it is simpler without bolts easy to install 2 the application of o rings solves the problem of machining accuracy and has the advantages of simple structure convenient installation and disassembling 3 arc transitions are provided above and below the annular groove at the barrel end to reduce the stress concentration and to optimize the stress of the groove structure 2 5 3 design of the flat cover to satisfy the requirements of the testing equipment a flat cover with eight through holes was designed and displayed in fig 3 the through holes are used for video communication power supply intake and exhaust channels and other physical interfaces the through holes diameter is 60 mm which is compatible with different specifications of the watertight electrical connector xue et al 2016 when the interface is not used the through holes can be sealed with watertight electrical connectors and there are two o ring nitrile rubber sealing rings between each through hole and its corresponding watertight electrical connector in addition similar to the upper part of the flat cover m90 6 threaded interfaces are designed at its lower part for fitting the watertight electrical connector the thread size on the connectors can be customized according to their types 2 5 4 design of the anti shear block disassembling and locking device we have specially designed a set of hydraulic loading unloading and locking devices to install and remove the anti shear blocks as shown in fig 4 the hydraulic cylinder system is used for automatic loading and unloading the anti shear block and for locking the anti shear blocks by limiting their radial displacement during test pressurization due to the increase of test pressure in the experiment the high pressure chamber cover is expected to bear a large amount of axial force for example under the maximum working pressure of 60 mpa its axial force could reach as high as 42390 tons which may lead to a certain deformation and displacement in the vertical direction of the chamber flat cover and may cause the anti shear block to slip from the shear groove this device could prevent this problem 2 5 5 design of control system for loading unloading the pipelines a set of relatively independent piping systems including high pressure power source loading and unloading control valve group and high pressure pipes were designed for achieving the loading and unloading the pressure of the cylinders the average speed of loading and unloading of the pressure cylinder is between 0 1 and 0 6 mpa min and can be adjusted the pressure fluctuation deviation during the pressure maintaining stage is 0 2 mpa its control system uses a relatively independent electrical control module plc module of which the host computer monitoring software is applied to control the automatic loading and unloading of the chamber pressure the modular design of the control system is displayed in fig 5 besides an independent manual control valves are also arranged for the chamber pressure control in emergency cases 3 finite element performance analysis in order to ensure the safety and rationality of the theoretical calculation in section 2 the finite element analysis of the deep sea high pressure chamber was carried out the software used is ansys workbench which provides a new collaborative environment with cad cae of ansys in this paper the mathematical modeling meshing and stress testing of the high pressure chamber were performed the reliability of the entire design of the high pressure chamber is analyzed by stress assessment 3 1 finite element model as the deep sea high pressure chamber is an axisymmetric structure the application of an axisymmetric element is considered in the chamber for the finite element model calculation according to the mechanical design manual cheng 2010 the contact friction coefficient between steel interfaces is 0 10 with the consideration of the model suitable for irregular meshing we use the plane axisymmetric element plane 183 to establish a finite element model of a 60 mpa high pressure chamber the model is divided by a quadrilateral mesh set the overall size to 10 mm especially the mesh size of the anti shear block and the flat cover is set to 5 mm the mesh size of the sealed bracket is set to 1 mm and the mesh of the contact edge of each component is refined in total the meshed finite element model of the high pressure chamber consists of 36070 nodes and 11513 elements as shown in fig 6 the boundary conditions are added to the model after meshing the internal pressure of 60 mpa is applied on the inner surface of the chamber body and the flat cover in order to prevent the rigid displacement of the chamber body a fixed boundary condition is applied to the outer curved surface of the ball bottom head a symmetric boundary is applied to the nodes on the central symmetry line of the chamber finally the model is established and the finite element analysis results are obtained 3 2 deformation analysis the deformation and stress analysis of the chamber were also performed to ensure its structural safety figs 7 9 are the high pressure chamber deformation diagram axial deformation diagram and radial deformation diagram respectively fig 7 is the total deformation diagram of the high pressure chamber as can be seen from the figure the maximum deformation of the entire high pressure chamber occurs at the center of the flat cover this is because the bottom of the flat cover is subjected to the experimental pressure and the surrounding anti shear block limits its upward movement this leads to the flat cover in an upwardly bent state therefore the upper surface is pulled the lower surface is compressed and the maximum deformation is 5 932 mm fig 8 is the axial deformation diagram of the high pressure chamber it shows that for the flat cover the axial displacement of its center area is larger than that of its circumference the maximum deformation appears at the center of the flat cover with the value of 5 932 mm since the circumference of the outer surface of the flat cover is squeezed by the anti shear blocks it has the smallest axial displacement in the flat cover fig 9 displays the radial deformation of the high pressure chamber under 60 mpa experimental pressure the chamber body has a certain degree of volume expansion outward the anti shear block ring is subjected to both the large axial pressure transmitted by the flat cover and the restraining force from the chamber body this causes it to have axial displacement and to rotate itself its lower surface is deflected toward the chamber body with the maximum radial displacement of 1 321 mm while its upper surface is expanded outward with the maximum radial displacement of 1 916 mm 3 3 stress analysis figs 10 13 are the high pressure chamber s synthesis stress distribution axial stress cloud circumferential stress cloud and radial stress cloud respectively it is observed from fig 10 that due to the test pressure in the chamber there is stress concentration at the groove of the chamber body this is the peak stress and the maximum is 1298 8 mpa appearing at the extrusion point of the contact face between the anti shear block and the end of the groove this value exceeds the yield limit of the material 490 mpa cheng 2010 and produces the local small plastic deformation in addition the stress at the end of the flat cover in contact with the anti shear block is also large and the synthetic stress has reached 1206 mpa although the local small plastic deformation would not affect the use of the high pressure chamber more efforts should be made in the design to strengthen the rounded corner transition and to minimize the stress concentration here as shown in fig 11 the maximum axial stress is mainly concentrated in the anti shear block groove with the value of 826 5mpa in fig 12 the maximum circumferential stress appears in the middle of the chamber due to the internal pressure of 60 mpa the chamber body expands outward and generates the stretching in the circumferential direction as observed in fig 13 the internal wall of the chamber is subjected to the radial stress of compression in addition it is found that at the connection section of the ball bottom head and the chamber body stress concentration may occur due to the discontinuous structure in the subsequent work the length of the chamfer edge may be optimized and the rounded corners may be redesigned 3 4 comparison and discussion of the calculation results to verify the accuracy of the calculation the theoretical calculated numerical values of the deep sea high pressure chamber were compared with the corresponding finite element analysis results as shown in table 4 the maximum error rate is 7 26 in terms of the axial stress on the outer surface however both the theoretical value and the numerical one are less than the allowable stress of 114 5 mpa shown in tab 3and could meet the requirements of the strength control standard this demonstrates that the strength design of the deep sea high pressure chamber is reasonable and reliable 3 5 sealing performance analysis in this paper since the pressure load was applied to the flat cover a flat seal was chosen to illustrate the sealing performance of the o ring seal ring 3 in fig 2 which is in contact with the flat cover and the fixed groove and would receive a possible displacement from the flat cover its displacement and stress were recorded and displayed through the diagrams of figs 14 to 16 in addition there seems a certain gap between the cover and the sealing bracket in the diagrams this is because in the finite element modeling of o ring the compression experienced by the o ring can be regarded as being caused by a specified displacement of a certain constraint boundary fig 14 shows that the o ring is deformed when the pressure is 60 mpa and the maximum deformation is 4 mm where it comes into contact with the groove and the cover thus the compression ratio of o ring with its diameter of 25 mm is 4 25 i e 16 the flat cover shows red because a displacement is caused fig 15 indicates that the maximum contact stress with 172 38 mpa is greater than the given pressure of 60 mpa and the sealing condition of the o ring is satisfied and the normal sealing performance of the o ring is ensured in fig 16 the contact stress distribution of the o ring is not uniform and the two maximum contact pressures appear on the contact surface of o ring and the groove and the contact surface of o ring and the flat cover respectively the maximum value œÉ max is 263 52 mpa much larger than value p of 60 mpa referring to the sealing criteria in section 2 4 which satisfies the sealing condition 4 system integration and experimental verification the theoretical analysis of section 2 and the finite element simulation analysis of section 3 indicate that the deep sea high pressure simulation system designed in this paper is safe and reasonable in theory and we have tackled the critical challenges such as the large opening sealing to better apply this proposal to engineering practices the high pressure chamber has been manufactured according to the previous described design the main part of the physical diagrams is shown in fig 17 the experiments to verify the reliability of the whole system were conducted on the working site of the chamber shown in fig 18 first the equipment was hydrostatically tested at a testing pressure of 75 mpa 1 25 times of the designed pressure which was kept for 30 min the test results show that the sealing performance of the cylinder structure is maintained well in the whole process which further confirms that the seal structure design is feasible then the performance of the system at a pressure of 20 mpa was tested before a full pressure test of 60 mpa the actual experimental pressure is 20 2 mpa due to the system deviation range of 0 2 mpa during the test the cameras lights and frames as simulated test pieces were also deployed so that the inside chamber could be clearly visualized on the computer screen in real time as shown in fig 19 the main adjusted parameters include the maximum test pressure 20 2 mpa the number of cycle tests the allowable deviation range 0 2 mpa and the percentage of crush 100 they could be set by the system the number of pressure gradients set by the test parameter settings interface depends on the real application and up to 25 pressure gradients can be set shown in fig 20 during the experiment 1 first discharge the air with an air vent valve and fill the chamber with water keep the outside surface of the chamber body dry during the whole experiment process 2 slowly approach to the working pressure step by step a total of four pressure gradients are set for this experiment the testing pressure is loaded uploaded in two steps first the pressure is raised to 10 mpa and after ensuring that no leakage occurs the pressure would then be further increased to a prescribed pressure of 20 2 mpa the pressure of each gradient is maintained for 1 min per stage in the depressurization process first unload the pressure to 10 mpa lasting for 1 min and then drop to zero the above process is accomplished automatically 3 after the pressure test is completed first open the top air vent valve and the drain valve then the water discharge treatment is carried out before the chamber ventilated and dried as can be seen from fig 21 the blue line and the red line substantially coincide indicating that the actual pressurization depressurization process is consistent with the preset pressure process the underwater camera system with cameras and lightings placed inside of the high pressure chamber could work reliably under the pressure of 20 2 mpa environment finally an identical experiment was carried out under 60 mpa pressure the pressure was increased from 0 to 60 mpa maintained for 2000 s and then unloaded to 0 mpa the entire experimental process lasted for 15120 s as shown in fig 22 it could be observed that the pressure curves fluctuates due to the over modulation of the automatic control system for example after the pressure was set to 60 mpa the test pressure indeed rose to 60 mpa then the system stops pressurization but the valve switch lags resulting in the drop with the pressure less than 60 mpa and followed by a rise again it is expected to be a couple of oscillations and the system would stabilize at 60 mpa pressure for about 2160 s apart from the oscillation period the preset pressure value and the actual pressure are the same which further indicate that chamber operates well in 60 mpa experiment 5 conclusions in this paper a deep sea large volume high pressure chamber is designed it could simulate up to 6000 m deep water high pressure environment after the theoretical calculation of the overall structure the finite element software ansys workbench was used to analyze the strength and the sealing performance of the high pressure chamber finally the simulation experiments were carried out and the following conclusions were obtained 1 the pressure test and the cylinder body strength analysis are basically the same as those of the theoretical calculations the difference between the results obtained by the design formula and the finite element analysis is less than 7 26 therefore the structural analysis of finite element analysis confirms the rationality of the design formula 2 the results show that it is feasible for large volume high pressure chamber uses the combination of anti shear block device and four o ring seals to achieve the seal its sealing effect is reliable 3 the high pressure simulation system designed in this paper has the following advantages the large pressure range that can be simulated the large volume of the cylinder body that can accommodate large sized test pieces and the video transmission device with high degree of automation able to acquire and display the pressure in the cylinder in real time finally the deep sea high pressure simulation system designed in this paper serves to provide the reference for other types of deep sea simulators in terms of the overall design methods the sealing structures and the automation systems in the future work we consider to deploy the temperature acoustic sensors to collect the temperature inside the cylinder and to simulate the deep sea environment more accurately acknowledgments the authors would like to thank china ship scientific research center for their great help in the design manufacture installation and the use of the high pressure chamber and we are thankful to the colleagues from the experimental equipment department of ocean college at zhejiang university for assisting with the experiments and for providing data 
22849,a high pressure chamber is the main equipment required for simulating deep sea operational environment and used for evaluating the performances of underwater equipment such as underwater vehicles under a preset pressure so that the possible malfunctions could be alarmed before deep sea commissioning in this paper due to its current unavailability a high pressure chamber with the maximum working pressure of 60 mpa was designed which has the inner diameter of 3 m and the height of 4 m possesses the video transmission function and allows most of the small scale underwater vehicle s overall stability and capacity to be tested possible to tackle the leakage and ensure the stability of the chamber this paper proposes a novel sealing method which adopts the combination of anti shear block device and four o ring seals and has the advantage of no need of manual pre tightening and of sufficient shear resistance the performance and strength analysis of the chamber were carried out by ansys workbench finite element analysis software furthermore the high pressure chamber was manufactured and its experiment verification results indicate that with larger containment volume and more advanced control system it could work reliably which made it feasible for its engineering application keywords deep sea environment simulation high pressure chamber structure design finite element analysis pressure experiment 1 introduction the total area of the oceans worldwide accounts for approximately 71 of the earth s total surface area with the maximum depth of over 10 000 m the ocean is rich in medical mineral and marine living resources dong et al 2005 charette and smith 2010 and can contribute toward the future development of human society by providing extensive and valuable resources however ocean exploration is a laborious task in deep sea environments the first challenge faced is that of high pressure which needs to be solved for developing underwater equipment and devices for each additional 100 m of ocean depth the pressure increases by 1 mpa therefore to guarantee the operational success of underwater equipment and devices they must first be subjected to a pressure test a high pressure chamber is a device that simulates the underwater pressure environment with its pressure resistant structure kawaguchi et al 2002 fathallah et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 su et al 2016 it mainly undertakes the performance test of deep sea equipment currently a variety of deep sea environment simulators and deep water high pressure chamber systems have been developed in domestic and international research studies liu and wang 2012 lee et al 2013 prakash and raphael 2014 lianget al 2015 to the authors knowledge it is found that the existing deep sea high pressure environment simulation devices still have space to improve for example wang designed devices that have relatively single function wang et al 2009 they can only measure the pressure resistance or the water tightness of the tested device or they can only detect leaks etc others proposed devices that the pressure is not enough or the volume of the inner chamber is small and the sealing performance is not ideal praneeth and rao 2012 tian 2013 yu proposed the device without video transmission function so it is impossible to monitor the internal situation in real time and adjust it in time yu et al 2014 in this paper a high pressure chamber is designed the chamber can simulate up to 6000 m deep 60 mpa underwater pressure environment which accounts for over 95 of the earth s deep ocean area at present the size of existing deep sea small scale underwater vehicles does not exceed 3 m in diameter and weighs no more than 100 kg ma and zhai 2004 with an inner diameter of 3 m and a height of 4 m the designed high pressure chamber allows most of the small scale submersibles to be put inside and to have their overall performance tested the chamber body weighs 320 tons

parameters of high pressure chamber according to the requirements mentioned above the main features of the deep sea chamber designed in this paper are the large volume and high pressure its critical technical parameters are designed and shown in table 1 according to the requirements of technical specifications referring to jb4732 1995 steel pressure vessels analytical design standards and gb150 2011 pressure vessels gb 2011 this paper carried out the overall design of the chamber and the calculation of its structures 20mnmonb was chosen to be the material of the high pressure chamber body and the chamber head it has good heat resistance corrosion resistance low temperature strength and mechanical properties and thus is able to meet the manufacturing requirements such as welding forging and the working environment requirements of experimental devices 2 2 wall thickness calculation of high pressure chamber the high pressure chamber wall thickness is determined based on the design rule

and thinned due to the factors such as corrosion and mechanical wear the chamber body thickness was rounded to 445 mm it is worth noting that the design stress intensity is 235 mpa and this is the minimum of both the yield strength and the tensile strength of the material 20mnmonb according to jb4732 1995 steel pressure vessel analytical design standards gb 2011 based on the above calculation the principle dimensions and the thickness of 60 mpa high pressure chamber are listed in table 2 2 3 structural stress calculation of high pressure chamber to determine the structural stress of the

pressure chamber designed in this paper is mainly composed of three parts i e the cylinder body the anti shear block disassembly and locking device the control system for loading unloading the pipelines their detailed description would be introduced in the rest of the section 2 5 1 design of the cylinder body to reduce manufacturing costs and make full use of the limited space in the chamber thus to facilitate the emplacement and removal of test models and the maintenance the upper half of the cylinder body adopts a large opening according to jb4732 1995 steel pressure vessels analytical design standard in fig 1 the designed chamber consists of a flat cover with an anti shear block structure a ball bottom head chamber body sealed bracket flat cover and o shaped nitrile rubber seals etc the chamber body is placed vertically 2 5 2 design of the seal structure due to the large opening structure of the cylinder body its sealing is one of the most critical challenges in the design of the entire system here a concave shear groove is formed on the upper chamber and a combination of a flat cover and an anti shear block is used to facilitate the upper seal to ensure the sealing effect o rings is chosen due to its self sealing and good corrosion resistance the seal between the lower part of the end of the flat cover and the cylinder body adopts four o ring seals shown in fig 2 of which ring 1 and ring 2 are set at the contact part of the flat cover and the high pressure chamber along the circumferential direction and ring 3 and ring 4 are arranged on the sealed bracket positioned below the flat cover the sealing ring 1 2 and 4 are radial seals and ring 3 is a flat seals the four seal rings have a shore hardness of 75 80hs and are made of nitrile rubber the sealed bracket is forged with the material 16mn compared with the traditional wood type seal structure this anti shear ring seal structure has the following advantages 1 it is simpler without bolts easy to install 2 the application of o rings solves the problem of machining accuracy and has the advantages of simple structure convenient installation and disassembling 3 arc transitions are provided above and below the annular groove at the barrel end to reduce the stress concentration and to optimize the stress of the groove structure 2 5 3 design of the flat cover to satisfy the requirements of the testing equipment a flat cover with eight through holes was designed and displayed in fig 3 the through holes are used for video communication power supply intake and exhaust channels and other physical interfaces the through holes diameter is 60 mm which is compatible with different specifications of the watertight electrical connector xue et al 2016 when the interface is not used the through holes can be sealed with watertight electrical connectors and there are two o ring nitrile rubber sealing rings between each through hole and its corresponding watertight electrical connector in addition similar to the upper part of the flat cover m90 6 threaded interfaces are designed at its lower part for fitting the watertight electrical connector the thread size on the connectors can be customized according to their types 2 5 4 design of the anti shear block disassembling and locking device we have specially designed a set of hydraulic loading unloading and locking devices to install and remove the anti shear blocks as shown in fig 4 the hydraulic cylinder system is used for automatic loading and unloading the anti shear block and for locking the anti shear blocks by limiting their radial displacement during test pressurization due to the increase of test pressure in the experiment the high pressure chamber cover is expected to bear a large amount of axial force for example under the maximum working pressure of 60 mpa its axial force could reach as high as 42390 tons which may lead to a certain deformation and displacement in the vertical direction of the chamber flat cover and may cause the anti shear block to slip from the shear groove this device could prevent this problem 2 5 5 design of control system for loading unloading the pipelines a set of relatively independent piping systems including high pressure power source loading and unloading control valve group and high pressure pipes were designed for achieving the loading and unloading the pressure of the cylinders the average speed of loading and unloading of the pressure cylinder is between 0 1 and 0 6 mpa min and can be adjusted the pressure fluctuation deviation during the pressure maintaining stage is 0 2 mpa its control system uses a relatively independent electrical control module plc module of which the host computer monitoring software is applied to control the automatic loading and unloading of the chamber pressure the modular design of the control system is displayed in fig 5 besides an independent manual control valves are also arranged for the chamber pressure control in emergency cases 3 finite element performance analysis in order to ensure the safety and rationality of the theoretical calculation in section 2 the finite element analysis of the deep sea high pressure chamber was carried out the software used is ansys workbench which provides a new collaborative environment with cad cae of ansys in this paper the mathematical modeling meshing and stress testing of the high pressure chamber were performed the reliability of the entire design of the high pressure chamber is analyzed by stress assessment 3 1 finite element model as the deep sea high pressure chamber is an axisymmetric structure the application of an axisymmetric element is considered in the chamber for the finite element model calculation according to the mechanical design manual cheng 2010 the contact friction coefficient between steel interfaces is 0 10 with the consideration of the model suitable for irregular meshing we use the plane axisymmetric element plane 183 to establish a finite element model of a 60 mpa high pressure chamber the model is divided by a quadrilateral mesh set the overall size to 10 mm especially the mesh size of the anti shear block and the flat cover is set to 5 mm the mesh size of the sealed bracket is set to 1 mm and the mesh of the contact edge of each component is refined in total the meshed finite element model of the high pressure chamber consists of 36070 nodes and 11513 elements as shown in fig 6 the boundary conditions are added to the model after meshing the internal pressure of 60 mpa is applied on the inner surface of the chamber body and the flat cover in order to prevent the rigid displacement of the chamber body a fixed boundary condition is applied to the outer curved surface of the ball bottom head a symmetric boundary is applied to the nodes on the central symmetry line of the chamber finally the model is established and the finite element analysis results are obtained 3 2 deformation analysis the deformation and stress analysis of the chamber were also performed to ensure its structural safety figs 7 9 are the high pressure chamber deformation diagram axial deformation diagram and radial deformation diagram respectively fig 7 is the total deformation diagram of the high pressure chamber as can be seen from the figure the maximum deformation of the entire high pressure chamber occurs at the center of the flat cover this is because the bottom of the flat cover is subjected to the experimental pressure and the surrounding anti shear block limits its upward movement this leads to the flat cover in an upwardly bent state therefore the upper surface is pulled the lower surface is compressed and the maximum deformation is 5 932 mm fig 8 is the axial deformation diagram of the high pressure chamber it shows that for the flat cover the axial displacement of its center area is larger than that of its circumference the maximum deformation appears at the center of the flat cover with the value of 5 932 mm since the circumference of the outer surface of the flat cover is squeezed by the anti shear blocks it has the smallest axial displacement in the flat cover fig 9 displays the radial deformation of the high pressure chamber under 60 mpa experimental pressure the chamber body has a certain degree of volume expansion outward the anti shear block ring is subjected to both the large axial pressure transmitted by the flat cover and the restraining force from the chamber body this causes it to have axial displacement and to rotate itself its lower surface is deflected toward the chamber body with the maximum radial displacement of 1 321 mm while its upper surface is expanded outward with the maximum radial displacement of 1 916 mm 3 3 stress analysis figs 10 13 are the high pressure chamber s synthesis stress distribution axial stress cloud circumferential stress cloud and radial stress cloud respectively it is observed from fig 10 that due to the test pressure in the chamber there is stress concentration at the groove of the chamber body this is the peak stress and the maximum is 1298 8 mpa appearing at the extrusion point of the contact face between the anti shear block and the end of the groove this value exceeds the yield limit of the material 490 mpa cheng 2010 and produces the local small plastic deformation in addition the stress at the end of the flat cover in contact with the anti shear block is also large and the synthetic stress has reached 1206 mpa although the local small plastic deformation would not affect the use of the high pressure chamber more efforts should be made in the design to strengthen the rounded corner transition and to minimize the stress concentration here as shown in fig 11 the maximum axial stress is mainly concentrated in the anti shear block groove with the value of 826 5mpa in fig 12 the maximum circumferential stress appears in the middle of the chamber due to the internal pressure of 60 mpa the chamber body expands outward and generates the stretching in the circumferential direction as observed in fig 13 the internal wall of the chamber is subjected to the radial stress of compression in addition it is found that at the connection section of the ball bottom head and the chamber body stress concentration may occur due to the discontinuous structure in the subsequent work the length of the chamfer edge may be optimized and the rounded corners may be redesigned 3 4 comparison and discussion of the calculation results to verify the accuracy of the calculation the theoretical calculated numerical values of the deep sea high pressure chamber were compared with the corresponding finite element analysis results as shown in table 4 the maximum error rate is 7 26 in terms of the axial stress on the outer surface however both the theoretical value and the numerical one are less than the allowable stress of 114 5 mpa shown in tab 3and could meet the requirements of the strength control standard this demonstrates that the strength design of the deep sea high pressure chamber is reasonable and reliable 3 5 sealing performance analysis in this paper since the pressure load was applied to the flat cover a flat seal was chosen to illustrate the sealing performance of the o ring seal ring 3 in fig 2 which is in contact with the flat cover and the fixed groove and would receive a possible displacement from the flat cover its displacement and stress were recorded and displayed through the diagrams of figs 14 to 16 in addition there seems a certain gap between the cover and the sealing bracket in the diagrams this is because in the finite element modeling of o ring the compression experienced by the o ring can be regarded as being caused by a specified displacement of a certain constraint boundary fig 14 shows that the o ring is deformed when the pressure is 60 mpa and the maximum deformation is 4 mm where it comes into contact with the groove and the cover thus the compression ratio of o ring with its diameter of 25 mm is 4 25 i e 16 the flat cover shows red because a displacement is caused fig 15 indicates that the maximum contact stress with 172 38 mpa is greater than the given pressure of 60 mpa and the sealing condition of the o ring is satisfied and the normal sealing performance of the o ring is ensured in fig 16 the contact stress distribution of the o ring is not uniform and the two maximum contact pressures appear on the contact surface of o ring and the groove and the contact surface of o ring and the flat cover respectively the maximum value œÉ max is 263 52 mpa much larger than value p of 60 mpa referring to the sealing criteria in section 2 4 which satisfies the sealing condition 4 system integration and experimental verification the theoretical analysis of section 2 and the finite element simulation analysis of section 3 indicate that the deep sea high pressure simulation system designed in this paper is safe and reasonable in theory and we have tackled the critical challenges such as the large opening sealing to better apply this proposal to engineering practices the high pressure chamber has been manufactured according to the previous described design the main part of the physical diagrams is shown in fig 17 the experiments to verify the reliability of the whole system were conducted on the working site of the chamber shown in fig 18 first the equipment was hydrostatically tested at a testing pressure of 75 mpa 1 25 times of the designed pressure which was kept for 30 min the test results show that the sealing performance of the cylinder structure is maintained well in the whole process which further confirms that the seal structure design is feasible then the performance of the system at a pressure of 20 mpa was tested before a full pressure test of 60 mpa the actual experimental pressure is 20 2 mpa due to the system deviation range of 0 2 mpa during the test the cameras lights and frames as simulated test pieces were also deployed so that the inside chamber could be clearly visualized on the computer screen in real time as shown in fig 19 the main adjusted parameters include the maximum test pressure 20 2 mpa the number of cycle tests the allowable deviation range 0 2 mpa and the percentage of crush 100 they could be set by the system the number of pressure gradients set by the test parameter settings interface depends on the real application and up to 25 pressure gradients can be set shown in fig 20 during the experiment 1 first discharge the air with an air vent valve and fill the chamber with water keep the outside surface of the chamber body dry during the whole experiment process 2 slowly approach to the working pressure step by step a total of four pressure gradients are set for this experiment the testing pressure is loaded uploaded in two steps first the pressure is raised to 10 mpa and after ensuring that no leakage occurs the pressure would then be further increased to a prescribed pressure of 20 2 mpa the pressure of each gradient is maintained for 1 min per stage in the depressurization process first unload the pressure to 10 mpa lasting for 1 min and then drop to zero the above process is accomplished automatically 3 after the pressure test is completed first open the top air vent valve and the drain valve then the water discharge treatment is carried out before the chamber ventilated and dried as can be seen from fig 21 the blue line and the red line substantially coincide indicating that the actual pressurization depressurization process is consistent with the preset pressure process the underwater camera system with cameras and lightings placed inside of the high pressure chamber could work reliably under the pressure of 20 2 mpa environment finally an identical experiment was carried out under 60 mpa pressure the pressure was increased from 0 to 60 mpa maintained for 2000 s and then unloaded to 0 mpa the entire experimental process lasted for 15120 s as shown in fig 22 it could be observed that the pressure curves fluctuates due to the over modulation of the automatic control system for example after the pressure was set to 60 mpa the test pressure indeed rose to 60 mpa then the system stops pressurization but the valve switch lags resulting in the drop with the pressure less than 60 mpa and followed by a rise again it is expected to be a couple of oscillations and the system would stabilize at 60 mpa pressure for about 2160 s apart from the oscillation period the preset pressure value and the actual pressure are the same which further indicate that chamber operates well in 60 mpa experiment 5 conclusions in this paper a deep sea large volume high pressure chamber is designed it could simulate up to 6000 m deep water high pressure environment after the theoretical calculation of the overall structure the finite element software ansys workbench was used to analyze the strength and the sealing performance of the high pressure chamber finally the simulation experiments were carried out and the following conclusions were obtained 1 the pressure test and the cylinder body strength analysis are basically the same as those of the theoretical calculations the difference between the results obtained by the design formula and the finite element analysis is less than 7 26 therefore the structural analysis of finite element analysis confirms the rationality of the design formula 2 the results show that it is feasible for large volume high pressure chamber uses the combination of anti shear block device and four o ring seals to achieve the seal its sealing effect is reliable 3 the high pressure simulation system designed in this paper has the following advantages the large pressure range that can be simulated the large volume of the cylinder body that can accommodate large sized test pieces and the video transmission device with high degree of automation able to acquire and display the pressure in the cylinder in real time finally the deep sea high pressure simulation system designed in this paper serves to provide the reference for other types of deep sea simulators in terms of the overall design methods the sealing structures and the automation systems in the future work we consider to deploy the temperature acoustic sensors to collect the temperature inside the cylinder and to simulate the deep sea environment more accurately acknowledgments the authors would like to thank china ship scientific research center for their
