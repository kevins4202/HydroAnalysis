17855,though sludge foaming often occurs and thus causes serious membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors mbrs the fouling mechanisms related with the foaming phenomenon have not been well addressed hindering better understanding and solving foaming problem in this work it was interestingly found that the foulants during the foaming period possessed extremely high specific filtration resistance sfr over 1016 m kg 1 and strong adhesion ability to membrane surface chemical characterization showed that the proteins 178 57 mg l and polysaccharides 209 21 mg l in the foaming sample were about 6 4 times and 5 4 times of those in the supernatant sample suggesting existence of a mechanism permitting continuous production of these foulants in the mbr during the foaming period it was revealed that the fouling caused by foams was associated with gel layer filtration process and the extremely high sfr can be interpreted by chemical potential change in the gel filtration process depicted in flory huggins theory meanwhile analyses by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory showed that the strong adhesion ability stemmed from the high interaction energy between the foaming foulants and membrane surface in addition 16s rdna gene sequencing identified that the abundance of the foaming related bacteria species in the sludge suspension during the foaming period was more than 10 times of that during the non foaming period this study offered new mechanism insights into foaming fouling in mbrs graphical abstract image 1 keywords foaming soluble microbial products membrane bioreactor membrane fouling filamentous bacteria 1 introduction currently membrane bioreactor mbr has been deemed as an established technology and increasingly applied in large scale applications as indicated by the estimated 5 107 m3 d worldwide treatment capacity of mbr plants in 2019 krzeminski et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 in spite of that more widespread application of mbr is inevitably hindered by some issues among which membrane fouling problem is a significant one lin et al 2014 meng et al 2017 wang et al 2014 2020 calling for more efforts to be devoted into exploring fouling mechanisms and developing efficient fouling control measures mbr operation always encounters biological foaming phenomenon which generally induces serious membrane fouling problem cosenza et al 2013 di bella and torregrossa 2013 zhang et al 2019 the foaming phenomenon not only reduced biological performance but also increased maintenance and operating costs of the sludge system alizad oghyanous et al 2020 cas systems can often suffer foaming problem and introduction of membrane module may make the foaming problem in mbrs even worse due to the increased aeration the low f m ratio and the high retention ability of membrane di bella and torregrossa 2013 therefore investigating membrane fouling caused by foaming in mbrs is of particular importance for real applications however in comparison with the extensive studies on foaming in cas systems study on foaming in mbr systems is quite limited though there may be significant differences between them pursuit of literature showed only several studies regarding foaming issue in mbrs available in the literature early studies focused on identification of bacteria strains causing the biological foaming in mbrs di bella and torregrossa 2013 you and sue 2009 later cosenza et al 2013 investigated roles of extracellular polymeric substances epss in foaming phenomenon in an mbr maza márquez et al 2016 found that the increase of the ratio of active versus total mycolata was related to foaming in an mbr campo et al 2017 investigated effects of proteins and polysaccharides content on the epss foaming and membrane fouling in a mbr zhang et al 2019 compared the characteristics between foaming and non foaming sludge samples in an mbr more recently alizad oghyanous et al 2020 reported that protein content of epss played more important roles in foam formation than carbohydrate and optimizing olr values could control foaming phenomenon in an mbr the main findings and the data related with foaming fouling in mbrs in these studies are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary materials these studies definitely deepened our understanding of foaming phenomenon in mbrs however most of these studies focused on identification of bacteria and factors affecting foaming in mbrs and there is still obvious knowledge gap on relationships between foaming and membrane fouling in other words the exact mechanisms underlying the fouling caused by foaming in mbrs are still unknown this research situation may be ascribed to the complexity of foaming fouling in mbrs and lack of efficient research tools generally membrane fouling occurs by foulant adhesion followed by formation of a foulant layer recent studies have extensively explored foulant adhesion process and foulant layer filtration process and revealed the thermodynamic mechanisms based on the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory chen et al 2020a teng et al 2018a and flory huggins theory chen et al 2016 teng et al 2020b you et al 2020 involved into these processes it was revealed that adhesion process of a foulant on membrane surface was controlled by the short ranged thermodynamic interactions described by the xdlvo theory and filtration resistance during filtration process through a gel layer mainly stemmed from the chemical potential gap between the bound water in gel layer and the permeate described by flory huggins theory although foaming fouling in mbrs may be complex considering that foaming fouling also involves processes of foulant adhesion and filtration through a gel layer it is hypothesized that the xdlvo theory and flory huggins theory may act as useful tools to explore the foaming fouling mechanisms meanwhile 16s rdna gene sequencing technology has been widely used in strain identification and phylogenetic research wagner and cloete 2002 and may provide a useful tool for further investigation of the biological mechanism of foaming fouling therefore this study was carried out to investigate the mechanisms underlying the fouling caused by foaming in a mbr a laboratory scale mbr apparatus was operated and the sludge supernatant and foaming samples during foaming and non foaming periods were characterized and compared the thermodynamic interactions and the filtration resistances for different samples were analyzed by the advanced xdlvo theory and flory huggins theory respectively in addition the foaming phenomenon was explained from the perspective of bacterial diversity based on 16s rdna technology 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental operation and sample preparation a laboratory scale submerged mbr apparatus with an effective volume of 26 l was operated in this study a membrane module consisting four flat polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane elements was vertically submerged in the apparatus there is an aerator underneath the membrane module to provide necessary oxygen for biomass growth and shear force for membrane cleaning the pvdf membrane with a normalized pore size of 0 1 μm was purchased from sinap membrane technology co ltd the inoculated sludge was taken from qiubin sewage treatment plant jinhua the inoculated sludge concentration was about 8 0 g l 1 and gradually grew to 12 g l 1 within 20 d start up period artificially municipal sewage with the composition shown in table 1 was used as the influent the effluent was driven out from the membrane module by using a peristaltic pump operated in an intermittent mode 4 min on 1 min off such a mode was used because adopting higher number of pauses and longer total operation time is favorable to sustain mbr operation hydraulic retention time hrt of about 5 5 h was set for the mbr during the initial operation period of 23 49 d a large amount of foams appeared on the top of the sludge suspension in the reactor which was thick dense and rather stable this period was considered as the foaming period in this study the sludge concentration increase in the start up period led to partial blocking of the aeration diffuser reducing the aeration intensity the reduced aeration further caused the succession of bacterial community this may be the cause of the biological foam generation within the 23 49 days period the foaming layer on the top of the sludge suspension was collected and then subjected to filtration through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane the filtrate was used as the foaming sample for filtration tests for comparison supernatant and sludge floc suspension samples were also prepared as follows the sludge suspension in the reactor was firstly collected and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min the resultant supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane to obtain the supernatant samples considering the easy degradation of the organics in the influent the organics in the supernatant are believed to mainly consist of soluble microbial products smps thereafter the resultant sludge solid was rinsed by a phosphate buffer composition 9 mm nacl 4 mm nah2po4 2 mm na3po4 and 1 mm kcl and then resuspended with the phosphate buffer to obtain the sludge floc samples the mbr system was continuously operated with regular removal of the foaming layer at interval of 1 d accordingly foam generation gradually decreased until no obvious foam generation at 50 d operation since then the mbr system was continuously operated for more than 2 weeks this period was considered as the non foaming period the supernatant and sludge floc suspension samples obtained in this period were prepared by the methods same to those in the foaming period 2 2 batch filtration tests fouling propensity of a foulant can be evaluated by assessing its specific filtration resistance sfr which can be determined by dead end batch filtration tests wisniewski and grasmick 1998 in this study the dead end batch filtration tests were performed in a stirred cell msc 050 shanghai sinap co ltd china with an effective volume of 50 ml where a pvdf membrane with an effective filtration area of 0 00119 m2 and a normalized average pore size of 0 1 μm was equipped a constant operating pressure of 60 kpa provided by a gas cylinder with pressurized nitrogen was used for filtration and 30 ml permeate was recorded by a digital balance in the filtration process the permeate weight was recorded at an interval of 30s according to the literature wisniewski and grasmick 1998 sfr can be calculated by the following equation 1 s f r 2 k a m 2 δ p μ c where a m is the membrane area m2 δp represents the trans membrane pressure tmp kpa c is the foulant concentration kg m3 μ represents the dynamic viscosity of permeate pa s k is the ratio of time to filtration yielded from the slope of the curve plotting the ratio of filtration time to filtration volume t v versus the filtration volume v of the filtration process flux recovery rate frr was measured as follows the prepared supernatant and foaming solution samples were subject to dead end after filtration the fouled pvdf membrane was simply rinsed with the pure water without physical cleaning or ultrasonic cleaning thereafter the rinsed membrane was used to filtrate pure water such a filtration cycle was conducted for 3 times for each foulant solution sample and then the final flux recovery was calculated the cycle time of 600s 300s was used in batch filtration tests because longer operation and pause time in one cycle are beneficial to test the difference in fouling propensity of different samples 2 3 evaluation of membrane fouling the filtration resistance is defined by darcy s law as follows huisman et al 1997 2 r t ol δ p μ j r m r p r f where j is the filtration flux l m 2 h 1 r tol r m r p and r f means total filtration resistance m 1 membrane inherent resistance m 1 pore clogging resistance m 1 and foulant layer resistance m 1 respectively the filtration process is generally controlled by pore clogging and or foulant layer formation pathways which can be described by the following models respectively hermia 1982 3 j j 0 exp k p t 4 j 2 j 0 2 1 j 0 2 k c t where j 0 is the initial filtration flux l m 2 h 1 and k p and k c are the constant of pore blocking model and cake filtration model respectively these models can be further transformed into the following equations by combining darcy s law eq 2 liu et al 2014 5 ln r p ln r m k p t 6 r c 2 r m 2 k c δ p 2 μ 2 t by plotting filtration resistance to filtration time for a filtration process can clearly show the fitness of above models eqs 5 and 6 which indicates the major cause of membrane fouling during filtration process 2 4 xdlvo approach it is generally accepted that final adhesion of a foulant on membrane surface is determined by the short ranged interaction energy between them which can be quantified by the methods provided in the xdlvo theory van oss 1993 accordingly the total interaction energy is comprised of van der waals lw acid base ab and electrostatic double layer el interaction energies the strength of these energies at separation distance h δ g l w h δ g e l h and δ g a b h mj m 2 can be quantified by the following equations van oss 1993 1995 7 δ g l w h δ g h 0 l w h 0 2 h 2 8 δ g e l h ε r ε 0 κ ζ 1 ζ 3 ζ 1 2 ζ 3 2 2 ζ 1 ζ 3 1 coth κ h 1 sinh κ h 9 δ g a b h δ g h 0 a b exp h 0 h λ where h 0 represents the minimum equilibrium cut off distance usually assigned as 0 158 nm meinders et al 1995 ε r ε 0 is the solution dielectric constant c v 1 m 1 κ ζ and λ respectively represent the reciprocal of debye length nm 1 surface zeta potential mv and the attenuation of ab interaction usually assigned as 0 6 the subscripts 1 2 and 3 mean the membrane pure water and foulant respectively δ g h 0 l w δ g h 0 a b and δ g h 0 e l are these interaction energies at separation distance of h 0 mj m 2 which can be quantified by the following equations respectively 10 δ g h 0 l w 2 γ 1 l w γ 2 l w γ 3 l w γ 2 l w 11 δ g h 0 e l ε r ε 0 κ 2 ζ 1 2 ζ 3 2 1 coth κ h 0 2 ζ 1 ζ 3 ζ

and electron donor surface tension γ mj m 2 are needed which can be determined by solving a young s equation group with data of three different probe liquids as inputs adam 1957 brant and childress 2004 13 1 cos ϕ 2 γ l t o l γ l l w γ s l w γ l γ s γ l γ s where the subscripts l and s denote the probe liquid and solid surface respectively 2 5 flory huggins lattice theory flory huggins theory has been commonly used to describe thermodynamic changes when making a polymer solution flory 1942 huggins 1942 since both foaming and supernatants are essentially polymer solutions this theory should be feasible to describe their thermodynamics this theory postulates that the polymer molecules in the solution are arranged in a lattice each of which is a chain segment to form a polymer connected to multiple lattices to form a polymer solution based on this assumption the mixing free energy in a polymer solution can be expressed as 17 δ g m i x r t n 1 ln φ 1 n 2 ln φ 2 n 1 φ 2 χ where t is the absolute temperature k r is the total gas constant j k 1 mol 1 ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the volume fraction of solvent and polymer respectively n 1 and n 2 are the number of moles of solvent and polymer respectively χ represents the flory huggins interaction parameter which is a measure of the interaction between the polymer and the solvent molecules the chemical potential change δμ mix of the mixing process to form a polymer solution can be derived from the partial differential of δg mix flory 1942 huggins 1942 18 δ μ m i x δ g m i x n 1 t p n 2 r t ln 1 φ 2 1 n 1 φ 2 χ φ 2 2 where n is the degree of polymerization which is generally considered infinite 2 6 analytical methods the concentration of the supernatant and foaming sample in terms of polysaccharides and proteins was calorimetrically measured by the methods proposed by dubois et al 1956 and lowery et al 1951 respectively with glucose and bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard materials respectively a nexus 670 ft ir analyzer was used to characterize functional groups in the foaming supernatant and sludge floc samples before characterization they were filtered to form the corresponding foulant layers and then dried in an oven at 40 c for over 24 h to remove the remaining moisture zeta potential of the pvdf membrane and the liquid samples supernatant foaming and sludge floc suspension samples was measured by an anton paar surpass 3 and a malvern zetasizer nano zs analyzer respectively a kino contact angle meter was adopted to measure the contact angle of the pretreated pvdf membrane foaming supernatant and sludge floc samples prior to contact angle measurements the pvdf membrane was cut into small strips and fixed on a glass slide pretreatment of the foaming supernatant and sludge floc samples was conducted by filtration to form a foulant layer followed by drying and flattening the dried layer by two glass slides ultrapure water glycerol and diiodide were selected as the probe liquids for contact angle measurements activated sludge during the foaming and non foaming periods was observed by an optical microscope bx43 olympus japan the characterization operation of some items can refer to the previous studies chen et al 2020b li et al 2020 teng et al 2020a 16s rdna detection can be sequenced by using high throughput sequencing device illumina miseq hiseq to obtain species composition species abundance community comparison and other information of bacteria in specific environments wagner and cloete 2002 shannon wiener diversity index which is more suitable for analysis of macro biomes while less used for sludge bacterial community was not used in this study in this study 16s rdna gene sequencing was performed on the sludge suspension samples during the foaming and non foaming periods to investigate the microbial diversity related with the foaming fouling 3 results and discussion 3 1 fouling behaviors during the foaming and non foaming periods during the foaming period it was found that the foaming phenomenon occurred accompanied by serious membrane fouling the tmp would exceed 50 kpa in one day when a foaming layer formed on the sludge suspension to sustain the operation the formed foaming layer was daily removed and the membrane was physically cleaned by scrubbing the stains down with a sponge whereas during the non foaming period the tmp kept relatively low level of 10 20 kpa with the same membrane flux this contrast clearly demonstrated higher fouling propensity of the sludge suspension during the foaming period than that during the non foaming period in order to quantitatively measure their fouling propensity the foaming samples the supernatant and sludge floc samples were subjected to batch filtration tests and the resultant sfr data are shown in fig 1 it can be seen that for both periods sfr of the supernatant samples is at least three orders of magnitude higher than that of the sludge floc suspension indicating the dominate role of the supernatant in membrane fouling in the mbr filtration of the sludge floc suspension tends to form a cake layer due to the relatively large size and certain rigidity of the sludge flocs there exist some visible connected pores through the cake layer corresponding to the relatively low sfr moreover the sfr of the supernatant sample during the foaming period is over 3 times of that during the non foaming period 1 96 1016 m kg 1 v s 6 41 1015 m kg 1 although the foaming sample collected from the top layer of the sludge suspension didn t directly contact the membrane surface it shows a high sfr of 1 11 1016 m kg 1 comparable to that of the supernatant sample this suggests that the fouling propensity of the foaming sample is similar to that of the supernatant sample it was reported that sfr of the supernatant was about 2 65 1015 m kg 1 during normal operation of a mbr teng et al 2018b ognier et al 2002 reported that the raw suspension in a normally operated mbr possessed an sfr of about 3 0 1015 m kg 1 whereas sfr of the supernatant could reach to 2 66 1016 m kg 1 when a gel layer formed on membrane surface during mbr operation teng et al 2019 the extremely high sfr over 1016 m kg 1 of the supernatant and the foaming solution samples deserves further investigation fig 2 shows normalized flux profiles when filtrating the foaming solution sample and the supernatant during the foaming period and the non foaming period respectively it can be seen that flux recovery rate frr for the foaming period and the non foaming period are 81 55 and 99 19 respectively the lower frr for the foaming solution sample is more likely attributed to two aspects one is the more abundant colloids with small particle size contained in the foaming solution sample which would cause pore blocking fouling the other is the stronger adhesion ability of the foaming foulants to membrane surface facilitating foulant layer either cake layer or gel layer formation on membrane surface in order to explore the filtration mechanisms involved into the filtration process of the foaming solution in this study the batch filtration test data were used to fit the pore blocking model eq 5 and cake filtration model eq 6 respectively and the fitting results are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 in the very short initial stage stage i the filtration process well fits the pore blocking model eq 5 r 2 0 9947 indicating that pore blocking plays a key role in the initial filtration stage however the short duration only 30 s and low percentage only 1 of its filtration resistance to total filtration resistance suggest pore blocking is not the main cause of the fouling in the whole filtration process of the foaming solution since pore blocking is not significant the lower frr for the foaming solution in fig 2 should mainly stem from the stronger adhesion interaction between the foaming foulants and membrane in this study fig 3b and c show that filtration stage ⅱ neither well fits the pore blocking model r 2 0 6557 nor the cake filtration model eq 6 r 2 0 4256 this result suggests that the filtration process of the foaming solution is controlled by other mechanisms rather than pore blocking and cake layer formation direct observation after filtration showed a highly hydrated gel layer rather than cake layer formed on the membrane surface it was generally reported that filtration through a relatively homogeneous gel layer always corresponded to an extremely high sfr teng et al 2019 wang and waite 2008 2009 zhang et al 2013 therefore the foaming fouling mechanisms should be analyzed from the point of view of gel layer filtration in summary the mbr operation and filtration tests revealed two interesting phenomena regarding the foaming fouling the extremely high sfr over 1016 m kg 1 of the supernatant and the foaming solution samples and the stronger adhesion interaction between the foaming foulants and membrane previous studies commonly reported the serious fouling caused by the foams in mbrs but didn t well distinguish or summarize these fouling phenomena obviously these foaming fouling phenomena are interesting and deserve further exploration accordingly the main foulants thermodynamic mechanisms and biological community responsible for the foaming fouling were explored in the following sections 3 2 characteristics of the foulants during the foaming and non foaming periods fig 4 shows ftir spectra of the organics in the sludge floc supernatant and foaming solution samples in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 during the foaming and non foaming periods all the samples show similar spectra profiles the peaks at 1630 cm 1 in the amide i region are primarily attributed to co stretching vibration of the amide group and the peaks at 1520 cm 1 in the amide ii region are mainly associated with n h bending vibration and c n stretching vibration long et al 2020 these two peaks suggest presence of proteins the broad absorption peaks at 3280 cm 1 and peaks at 1020 cm 1 are attributed to stretching vibrations of o h bond and the presence of c o respectively these results are consistent with the previous study teng et al 2018b these peaks indicate presence of polysaccharides the similar ftir spectra suggest that the major foulants affecting membrane fouling are proteins and polysaccharides fig 5 presents the content of proteins and polysaccharides in the foaming solution and supernatant samples during the foaming period and the non foaming period it can be seen that the foaming sample has high content of proteins 178 57 mg l and polysaccharides 209 21 mg l which are about 6 4 times and 5 4 times of those 27 81 mg l proteins and 39 09 mg l polysaccharides in the supernatant sample though the foulants in the foaming sample come from the supernatant their contents are significantly higher than those in the supernatant meanwhile the content of the proteins and polysaccharides in the supernatant during the foaming period is also significantly higher than those 12 85 mg l proteins and 3 94 mg l polysaccharides during the non foaming period these results suggest that there exists a mechanism permitting continuous production of proteins and polysaccharides in the mbr during the foaming period it is hypothesized that proteins and polysaccharides are the predominate foulants which are associated with high adhesion ability and formation of gel layer on membrane surface highly determining membrane fouling level continuous production of them during the foaming period can qualitatively explain the extremely serious fouling phenomenon during this period 3 3 thermodynamic mechanisms of the high foaming fouling table 2 presents the surface properties contact angle and zeta potential of the membrane and foulant samples during the foaming and non foaming periods with these data the profiles of interfacial interaction energies with separation distance for different foulant samples were quantitatively calculated by using the xdlvo theory and the results are presented in fig 6 it can be seen that the strength of all the individual interaction energies monotonously decreases with the separation distance in range of 0 158 12 nm the ab and lw interaction energies are continuously attractive while the el interaction energy is continuously repulsive and the ab interaction dominates the three interactions basically the sludge floc samples during the two periods have comparable total interaction energy strength with the membrane fig 6a in contrast the supernatant foulant sample during the foaming period has significantly higher total interaction energy strength than that during the non foaming period fig 6b the foaming foulant sample has even higher total interaction energy strength than those for the sludge floc and the supernatant foulant samples fig 6c it is generally accepted that the total interaction energy per unit area at the minimum separation distance 0 158 nm δ g h 0 t o l is a quantitative measure of foulant adhesion ability to a substance brant and childress 2002 hong et al 2013 van oss 1995 δ g h 0 t o l for the sludge floc samples during the foaming and non foaming periods are 26 67 mj m 2 and 30 66 mj m 2 respectively δ g h 0 t o l for the supernatant foulant samples during the foaming and non foaming periods are 48 57 mj m 2 and 34 27 mj m 2 respectively moreover δ g h 0 t o l for the foaming foulant sample during the foaming period is 60 29 mj m 2 it is evident that the foaming foulants have significantly higher adhesion ability than the sludge floc and supernatant foulant samples therefore the thermodynamic mechanism can well explain the phenomenon of the stronger adhesion interaction between the foaming foulants and membrane fig 3 indicates that filtration of the foaming solution sample neither well fits the pore blocking model nor the cake filtration model fig 5 shows that the foaming solution sample possesses high content of proteins 178 57 mg l and polysaccharides 209 21 mg l which are about 6 4 times and 5 4 times of those in the supernatant sample direct observation of membrane surface after filtration of the foaming solution sample showed a highly hydrated gel layer rather than cake layer formed on the membrane surface based on above information the following thermodynamic mechanism responsible for the extremely high sfr of the foaming solution is proposed as depicted in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 there is no visible pore throughout a homogeneous gel layer therefore to sustain filtration process through a gel layer it has to drag out the water in gel to the permeate the water in a homogeneous gel is bound water hold by the polymer matrix of the gel and there is a chemical potential gap between the bound water and the free water this chemical potential gap can be described by eq 18 provided in the flory huggins lattice theory filtration through a gel layer needs extra energy to compensate for the chemical potential gap between before and after the mixing polymer solution gel layer state for a filtration process exerting an extra pressure can offset this chemical potential gap δμmix and sustain the filtration process corresponding to the following relationship zhang et al 2013 2018 19 δ μ m i x v b δ p where v b is the molar volume of the solvent m3 mol 1 for a dilute solution v b approximates the molar volume of the solution v by definition sfr of a gel layer can be expressed as 20 s f r r m g where m g represents the dry weight of the gel layer combining eq 2 and eqs 18 20 sfr of a gel layer can be given as follows chen et al 2016 lei et al 2016 21 s f r r t ln 1 φ 1 n 1 φ χ φ 2 m g v j σ eq 21 provides the thermodynamic mechanism for gel layer filtration and the extremely high sfr of the foaming solution and the supernatant during filtration can be quantified and explained herein φ 0 05 and χ 0 50 were set for a gel layer as considering the following three facts 1 the formed gel layer contained above 95 water content 2 proteins and polysaccharides in gel layer are complicated and difficult to obtain their χ values and 3 χ values for most of polymers are in range of 0 4 0 6 a rough estimation by setting φ 0 05 and χ 0 50 of a homogeneous gel layer by using eq 21 showed that its sfr was 1 61 1016 m kg 1 very close to the experimental value 1 96 1016 m kg 1 for the foaming solution sample all above information suggests that the proposed thermodynamic mechanism really occurs in the filtration process of the foaming solution in the mbr and the extremely high sfr of the foaming solution and the supernatant solution could be soundly interpreted 3 4 microbial community related with the foaming fouling fig 8 shows the microscopic images of the sludge suspension samples during the foaming period and the non foaming period it is clear that the sludge flocs during the two periods show significantly different morphologies there are abundant filamentous substances growing around the mycelium during the foaming period fig 8a whereas the filamentous substances around the mycelium are significantly reduced and the sludge flocs show a shrunken morphology during the non foaming period fig 8b therefore the excess growth of filamentous substances in the sludge suspension may be the cause of the foaming problem the average sludge volume index svi for the foaming period and the non foaming period is 85 and 52 respectively indicating the good sludge sedimentation performance and no sludge bulking problem occurring during the non foaming period fig 9 shows the comparison of the relative abundance of the sludge microbial community at phylum level analyzed by 16s rdna gene sequence during the foaming period and the non foaming period it is demonstrated that the bacteria in the sludge suspension during the two operation periods mainly belong to 9 phylums including actinobacteria proteobacteria candidatus saccharibacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi nitrospirae acidobacteria and verrucomicrobia the most abundant bacteria during the two operation periods are actinobacteria it is generally accepted that there are three necessary components requirements to enable forming a stable foam in activated sludge systems hydrophobic cells surfactants and air bubbles petrovski et al 2011a it was reported that hydrophobic actinobacteria were commonly associated with foam stabilization petrovski et al 2011b accordingly the sludge suspension during the two periods meets at least two requirements hydrophobic cells and air bubbles the decisive requirement for foam formation in this study was whether the reactor presented sufficient surfactants obviously the abundant proteins and polysaccharides presented in the supernatant during the foaming period could act as the surfactants fig 5 indicates that there exists a mechanism permitting continuous production of proteins and polysaccharides in the mbr during the foaming period fig 8 clearly suggests the higher level of filamentous bacteria during the foaming period than the non foaming period this can be further supported by fig 9 where more abundant bacteroidetes and chloroflexi during the foaming period than the non foaming period can be observed bacteroidetes and chloroflexi is generally identified as filamentous members eikelboom and geurkink 2002 mielczarek et al 2012 it was reported that filamentous bacteria produced more smps including soluble proteins and polysaccharides in the sludge suspension pan et al 2010 in this context it seems that the more abundant filamentous bacteria provide the mechanism permitting continuous production of proteins and polysaccharides in the mbr during the foaming period table 3 lists the top 20 genera of relative abundance in the sludge suspension during the foaming period and the non foaming period it is evident that the relative abundance of bacteria during the foaming and non foaming periods is different these differences should be caused by the different microenvironments between the two periods bacteria of nocardia mycobacterium and gordonia are generally considered as foaming related bacteria species campo et al 2017 halkjær et al 2009 wang et al 2016 as shown in table 4 the abundance of these foaming related bacteria species is about 0 20 during the foaming period which is more than 10 times of that 0 02 during the non foaming period moreover the dominate foaming bacteria species of nocardia during the foaming period possesses 20 times abundance than that during the non foaming period in addition further analyses show that the total number of bacteria species during the non foaming period 66656 is rather greater than that during the foaming period 34017 the higher total number of bacteria species indicate the more robust ecosystem involved into the sludge suspension during the non foaming period which could benefit to resist the foaming and bulking problems in activated sludge systems these microbial differences should be the biological mechanism responsible for the foaming fouling in this study 4 conclusions serious membrane fouling caused by foams in an mbr was observed which could be further characterized as the extremely high specific filtration resistance sfr over 1016 m kg 1 and strong adhesion ability of the foaming foulants it was found that the foaming sample contained higher contents of proteins 178 57 mg l and polysaccharides 209 21 mg l which were about 6 4 times and 5 4 times of those in the supernatant sample indicating existence of a mechanism permitting continuous production of these foulants in the mbr during the foaming period analyses by flory huggins theory suggested that the foaming fouling was associated with gel layer filtration process and the extremely high sfr stemmed from the chemical potential change in the gel filtration process meanwhile the strong adhesion ability of the foaming foulants could be explained by the high interaction energy quantified by the xdlvo theory in addition it was identified by the 16s rdna gene sequencing that the abundance of the foaming related bacteria species in the sludge suspension during the foaming period was more than 10 times of that during the non foaming period this study offered new mechanism insights into foaming fouling in mbrs declaration of competing

17855,though sludge foaming often occurs and thus causes serious membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors mbrs the fouling mechanisms related with the foaming phenomenon have not been well addressed hindering better understanding and solving foaming problem in this work it was interestingly found that the foulants during the foaming period possessed extremely high specific filtration resistance sfr over 1016 m kg 1 and strong adhesion ability to membrane surface chemical characterization showed that the proteins 178 57 mg l and polysaccharides 209 21 mg l in the foaming sample were about 6 4 times and 5 4 times of those in the supernatant sample suggesting existence of a mechanism permitting continuous production of these foulants in the mbr during the foaming period it was revealed that the fouling caused by foams was associated with gel layer filtration process and the extremely high sfr can be interpreted by chemical potential change in the gel filtration process depicted in flory huggins theory meanwhile analyses by the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory showed that the strong adhesion ability stemmed from the high interaction energy between the foaming foulants and membrane surface in addition 16s rdna gene sequencing identified that the abundance of the foaming related bacteria species in the sludge suspension during the foaming period was more than 10 times of that during the non foaming period this study offered new mechanism insights into foaming fouling in mbrs graphical abstract image 1 keywords foaming soluble microbial products membrane bioreactor membrane fouling filamentous bacteria 1 introduction currently membrane bioreactor mbr has been deemed as an established technology and increasingly applied in large scale applications as indicated by the estimated 5 107 m3 d worldwide treatment capacity of mbr plants in 2019 krzeminski et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 in spite of that more widespread application of mbr is inevitably hindered by some issues among which membrane fouling problem is a significant one lin et al 2014 meng et al 2017 wang et al 2014 2020 calling for more efforts to be devoted into exploring fouling mechanisms and developing efficient fouling control measures mbr operation always encounters biological foaming phenomenon which generally induces serious membrane fouling problem cosenza et al 2013 di bella and torregrossa 2013 zhang et al 2019 the foaming phenomenon not only reduced biological performance but also increased maintenance and operating costs of the sludge system alizad oghyanous et al 2020 cas systems can often suffer foaming problem and introduction of membrane module may make the foaming problem in mbrs even worse due to the increased aeration the low f m ratio and the high retention ability of membrane di bella and torregrossa 2013 therefore investigating membrane fouling caused by foaming in mbrs is of particular importance for real applications however in comparison with the extensive studies on foaming in cas systems study on foaming in mbr systems is quite limited though there may be significant differences between them pursuit of literature showed only several studies regarding foaming issue in mbrs available in the literature early studies focused on identification of bacteria strains causing the biological foaming in mbrs di bella and torregrossa 2013 you and sue 2009 later cosenza et al 2013 investigated roles of extracellular polymeric substances epss in foaming phenomenon in an mbr maza márquez et al 2016 found that the increase of the ratio of active versus total mycolata was related to foaming in an mbr campo et al 2017 investigated effects of proteins and polysaccharides content on the epss foaming and membrane fouling in a mbr zhang et al 2019 compared the characteristics between foaming and non foaming sludge samples in an mbr more recently alizad oghyanous et al 2020 reported that protein content of epss played more important roles in foam formation than carbohydrate and optimizing olr values could control foaming phenomenon in an mbr the main findings and the data related with foaming fouling in mbrs in these studies are summarized in table s1 in the supplementary materials these studies definitely deepened our understanding of foaming phenomenon in mbrs however most of these studies focused on identification of bacteria and factors affecting foaming in mbrs and there is still obvious knowledge gap on relationships between foaming and membrane fouling in other words the exact mechanisms underlying the fouling caused by foaming in mbrs are still unknown this research situation may be ascribed to the complexity of foaming fouling in mbrs and lack of efficient research tools generally membrane fouling occurs by foulant adhesion followed by formation of a foulant layer recent studies have extensively explored foulant adhesion process and foulant layer filtration process and revealed the thermodynamic mechanisms based on the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory chen et al 2020a teng et al 2018a and flory huggins theory chen et al 2016 teng et al 2020b you et al 2020 involved into these processes it was revealed that adhesion process of a foulant on membrane surface was controlled by the short ranged thermodynamic interactions described by the xdlvo theory and filtration resistance during filtration process through a gel layer mainly stemmed from the chemical potential gap between the bound water in gel layer and the permeate described by flory huggins theory although foaming fouling in mbrs may be complex considering that foaming fouling also involves processes of foulant adhesion and filtration through a gel layer it is hypothesized that the xdlvo theory and flory huggins theory may act as useful tools to explore the foaming fouling mechanisms meanwhile 16s rdna gene sequencing technology has been widely used in strain identification and phylogenetic research wagner and cloete 2002 and may provide a useful tool for further investigation of the biological mechanism of foaming fouling therefore this study was carried out to investigate the mechanisms underlying the fouling caused by foaming in a mbr a laboratory scale mbr apparatus was operated and the sludge supernatant and foaming samples during foaming and non foaming periods were characterized and compared the thermodynamic interactions and the filtration resistances for different samples were analyzed by the advanced xdlvo theory and flory huggins theory respectively in addition the foaming phenomenon was explained from the perspective of bacterial diversity based on 16s rdna technology 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental operation and sample preparation a laboratory scale submerged mbr apparatus with an effective volume of 26 l was operated in this study a membrane module consisting four flat polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane elements was vertically submerged in the apparatus there is an aerator underneath the membrane module to provide necessary oxygen for biomass growth and shear force for membrane cleaning the pvdf membrane with a normalized pore size of 0 1 μm was purchased from sinap membrane technology co ltd the inoculated sludge was taken from qiubin sewage treatment plant jinhua the inoculated sludge concentration was about 8 0 g l 1 and gradually grew to 12 g l 1 within 20 d start up period artificially municipal sewage with the composition shown in table 1 was used as the influent the effluent was driven out from the membrane module by using a peristaltic pump operated in an intermittent mode 4 min on 1 min off such a mode was used because adopting higher number of pauses and longer total operation time is favorable to sustain mbr operation hydraulic retention time hrt of about 5 5 h was set for the mbr during the initial operation period of 23 49 d a large amount of foams appeared on the top of the sludge suspension in the reactor which was thick dense and rather stable this period was considered as the foaming period in this study the sludge concentration increase in the start up period led to partial blocking of the aeration diffuser reducing the aeration intensity the reduced aeration further caused the succession of bacterial community this may be the cause of the biological foam generation within the 23 49 days period the foaming layer on the top of the sludge suspension was collected and then subjected to filtration through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane the filtrate was used as the foaming sample for filtration tests for comparison supernatant and sludge floc suspension samples were also prepared as follows the sludge suspension in the reactor was firstly collected and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min the resultant supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm microporous membrane to obtain the supernatant samples considering the easy degradation of the organics in the influent the organics in the supernatant are believed to mainly consist of soluble microbial products smps thereafter the resultant sludge solid was rinsed by a phosphate buffer composition 9 mm nacl 4 mm nah2po4 2 mm na3po4 and 1 mm kcl and then resuspended with the phosphate buffer to obtain the sludge floc samples the mbr system was continuously operated with regular removal of the foaming layer at interval of 1 d accordingly foam generation gradually decreased until no obvious foam generation at 50 d operation since then the mbr system was continuously operated for more than 2 weeks this period was considered as the non foaming period the supernatant and sludge floc suspension samples obtained in this period were prepared by the methods same to those in the foaming period 2 2 batch filtration tests fouling propensity of a foulant can be evaluated by assessing its specific filtration resistance sfr which can be determined by dead end batch filtration tests wisniewski and grasmick 1998 in this study the dead end batch filtration tests were performed in a stirred cell msc 050 shanghai sinap co ltd china with an effective volume of 50 ml where a pvdf membrane with an effective filtration area of 0 00119 m2 and a normalized average pore size of 0 1 μm was equipped a constant operating pressure of 60 kpa provided by a gas cylinder with pressurized nitrogen was used for filtration and 30 ml permeate was recorded by a digital balance in the filtration process the permeate weight was recorded at an interval of 30s according to the literature wisniewski and grasmick 1998 sfr can be calculated by the following equation 1 s f r 2 k a m 2 δ p μ c where a m is the membrane area m2 δp represents the trans membrane pressure tmp kpa c is the foulant concentration kg m3 μ represents the dynamic viscosity of permeate pa s k is the ratio of time to filtration yielded from the slope of the curve plotting the ratio of filtration time to filtration volume t v versus the filtration volume v of the filtration process flux recovery rate frr was measured as follows the prepared supernatant and foaming solution samples were subject to dead end after filtration the fouled pvdf membrane was simply rinsed with the pure water without physical cleaning or ultrasonic cleaning thereafter the rinsed membrane was used to filtrate pure water such a filtration cycle was conducted for 3 times for each foulant solution sample and then the final flux recovery was calculated the cycle time of 600s 300s was used in batch filtration tests because longer operation and pause time in one cycle are beneficial to test the difference in fouling propensity of different samples 2 3 evaluation of membrane fouling the filtration resistance is defined by darcy s law as follows huisman et al 1997 2 r t ol δ p μ j r m r p r f where j is the filtration flux l m 2 h 1 r tol r m r p and r f means total filtration resistance m 1 membrane inherent resistance m 1 pore clogging resistance m 1 and foulant layer resistance m 1 respectively the filtration process is generally controlled by pore clogging and or foulant layer formation pathways which can be described by the following models respectively hermia 1982 3 j j 0 exp k p t 4 j 2 j 0 2 1 j 0 2 k c t where j 0 is the initial filtration flux l m 2 h 1 and k p and k c are the constant of pore blocking model and cake filtration model respectively these models can be further transformed into the following equations by combining darcy s law eq 2 liu et al 2014 5 ln r p ln r m k p t 6 r c 2 r m 2 k c δ p 2 μ 2 t by plotting filtration resistance to filtration time for a filtration process can clearly show the fitness of above models eqs 5 and 6 which indicates the major cause of membrane fouling during filtration process 2 4 xdlvo approach it is generally accepted that final adhesion of a foulant on membrane surface is determined by the short ranged interaction energy between them which can be quantified by the methods provided in the xdlvo theory van oss 1993 accordingly the total interaction energy is comprised of van der waals lw acid base ab and electrostatic double layer el interaction energies the strength of these energies at separation distance h δ g l w h δ g e l h and δ g a b h mj m 2 can be quantified by the following equations van oss 1993 1995 7 δ g l w h δ g h 0 l w h 0 2 h 2 8 δ g e l h ε r ε 0 κ ζ 1 ζ 3 ζ 1 2 ζ 3 2 2 ζ 1 ζ 3 1 coth κ h 1 sinh κ h 9 δ g a b h δ g h 0 a b exp h 0 h λ where h 0 represents the minimum equilibrium cut off distance usually assigned as 0 158 nm meinders et al 1995 ε r ε 0 is the solution dielectric constant c v 1 m 1 κ ζ and λ respectively represent the reciprocal of debye length nm 1 surface zeta potential mv and the attenuation of ab interaction usually assigned as 0 6 the subscripts 1 2 and 3 mean the membrane pure water and foulant respectively δ g h 0 l w δ g h 0 a b and δ g h 0 e l are these interaction energies at separation distance of h 0 mj m 2 which can be quantified by the following equations respectively 10 δ g h 0 l w 2 γ 1 l w γ 2 l w γ 3 l w γ 2 l w 11 δ g h 0 e l ε r ε 0 κ 2 ζ 1 2 ζ 3 2 1 coth κ h 0 2 ζ 1 ζ 3 ζ

and electron donor surface tension γ mj m 2 are needed which can be determined by solving a young s equation group with data of three different probe liquids as inputs adam 1957 brant and childress 2004 13 1 cos ϕ 2 γ l t o l γ l l w γ s l w γ l γ s γ l γ s where the subscripts l and s denote the probe liquid and solid surface respectively 2 5 flory huggins lattice theory flory huggins theory has been commonly used to describe thermodynamic changes when making a polymer solution flory 1942 huggins 1942 since both foaming and supernatants are essentially polymer solutions this theory should be feasible to describe their thermodynamics this theory postulates that the polymer molecules in the solution are arranged in a lattice each of which is a chain segment to form a polymer connected to multiple lattices to form a polymer solution based on this assumption the mixing free energy in a polymer solution can be expressed as 17 δ g m i x r t n 1 ln φ 1 n 2 ln φ 2 n 1 φ 2 χ where t is the absolute temperature k r is the total gas constant j k 1 mol 1 ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are the volume fraction of solvent and polymer respectively n 1 and n 2 are the number of moles of solvent and polymer respectively χ represents the flory huggins interaction parameter which is a measure of the interaction between the polymer and the solvent molecules the chemical potential change δμ mix of the mixing process to form a polymer solution can be derived from the partial differential of δg mix flory 1942 huggins 1942 18 δ μ m i x δ g m i x n 1 t p n 2 r t ln 1 φ 2 1 n 1 φ 2 χ φ 2 2 where n is the degree of polymerization which is generally considered infinite 2 6 analytical methods the concentration of the supernatant and foaming sample in terms of polysaccharides and proteins was calorimetrically measured by the methods proposed by dubois et al 1956 and lowery et al 1951 respectively with glucose and bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard materials respectively a nexus 670 ft ir analyzer was used to characterize functional groups in the foaming supernatant and sludge floc samples before characterization they were filtered to form the corresponding foulant layers and then dried in an oven at 40 c for over 24 h to remove the remaining moisture zeta potential of the pvdf membrane and the liquid samples supernatant foaming and sludge floc suspension samples was measured by an anton paar surpass 3 and a malvern zetasizer nano zs analyzer respectively a kino contact angle meter was adopted to measure the contact angle of the pretreated pvdf membrane foaming supernatant and sludge floc samples prior to contact angle measurements the pvdf membrane was cut into small strips and fixed on a glass slide pretreatment of the foaming supernatant and sludge floc samples was conducted by filtration to form a foulant layer followed by drying and flattening the dried layer by two glass slides ultrapure water glycerol and diiodide were selected as the probe liquids for contact angle measurements activated sludge during the foaming and non foaming periods was observed by an optical microscope bx43 olympus japan the characterization operation of some items can refer to the previous studies chen et al 2020b li et al 2020 teng et al 2020a 16s rdna detection can be sequenced by using high throughput sequencing device illumina miseq hiseq to obtain species composition species abundance community comparison and other information of bacteria in specific environments wagner and cloete 2002 shannon wiener diversity index which is more suitable for analysis of macro biomes while less used for sludge bacterial community was not used in this study in this study 16s rdna gene sequencing was performed on the sludge suspension samples during the foaming and non foaming periods to investigate the microbial diversity related with the foaming fouling 3 results and discussion 3 1 fouling behaviors during the foaming and non foaming periods during the foaming period it was found that the foaming phenomenon occurred accompanied by serious membrane fouling the tmp would exceed 50 kpa in one day when a foaming layer formed on the sludge suspension to sustain the operation the formed foaming layer was daily removed and the membrane was physically cleaned by scrubbing the stains down with a sponge whereas during the non foaming period the tmp kept relatively low level of 10 20 kpa with the same membrane flux this contrast clearly demonstrated higher fouling propensity of the sludge suspension during the foaming period than that during the non foaming period in order to quantitatively measure their fouling propensity the foaming samples the supernatant and sludge floc samples were subjected to batch filtration tests and the resultant sfr data are shown in fig 1 it can be seen that for both periods sfr of the supernatant samples is at least three orders of magnitude higher than that of the sludge floc suspension indicating the dominate role of the supernatant in membrane fouling in the mbr filtration of the sludge floc suspension tends to form a cake layer due to the relatively large size and certain rigidity of the sludge flocs there exist some visible connected pores through the cake layer corresponding to the relatively low sfr moreover the sfr of the supernatant sample during the foaming period is over 3 times of that during the non foaming period 1 96 1016 m kg 1 v s 6 41 1015 m kg 1 although the foaming sample collected from the top layer of the sludge suspension didn t directly contact the membrane surface it shows a high sfr of 1 11 1016 m kg 1 comparable to that of the supernatant sample this suggests that the fouling propensity of the foaming sample is similar to that of the supernatant sample it was reported that sfr of the supernatant was about 2 65 1015 m kg 1 during normal operation of a mbr teng et al 2018b ognier et al 2002 reported that the raw suspension in a normally operated mbr possessed an sfr of about 3 0 1015 m kg 1 whereas sfr of the supernatant could reach to 2 66 1016 m kg 1 when a gel layer formed on membrane surface during mbr operation teng et al 2019 the extremely high sfr over 1016 m kg 1 of the supernatant and the foaming solution samples deserves further investigation fig 2 shows normalized flux profiles when filtrating the foaming solution sample and the supernatant during the foaming period and the non foaming period respectively it can be seen that flux recovery rate frr for the foaming period and the non foaming period are 81 55 and 99 19 respectively the lower frr for the foaming solution sample is more likely attributed to two aspects one is the more abundant colloids with small particle size contained in the foaming solution sample which would cause pore blocking fouling the other is the stronger adhesion ability of the foaming foulants to membrane surface facilitating foulant layer either cake layer or gel layer formation on membrane surface in order to explore the filtration mechanisms involved into the filtration process of the foaming solution in this study the batch filtration test data were used to fit the pore blocking model eq 5 and cake filtration model eq 6 respectively and the fitting results are shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 in the very short initial stage stage i the filtration process well fits the pore blocking model eq 5 r 2 0 9947 indicating that pore blocking plays a key role in the initial filtration stage however the short duration only 30 s and low percentage only 1 of its filtration resistance to total filtration resistance suggest pore blocking is not the main cause of the fouling in the whole filtration process of the foaming solution since pore blocking is not significant the lower frr for the foaming solution in fig 2 should mainly stem from the stronger adhesion interaction between the foaming foulants and membrane in this study fig 3b and c show that filtration stage ⅱ neither well fits the pore blocking model r 2 0 6557 nor the cake filtration model eq 6 r 2 0 4256 this result suggests that the filtration process of the foaming solution is controlled by other mechanisms rather than pore blocking and cake layer formation direct observation after filtration showed a highly hydrated gel layer rather than cake layer formed on the membrane surface it was generally reported that filtration through a relatively homogeneous gel layer always corresponded to an extremely high sfr teng et al 2019 wang and waite 2008 2009 zhang et al 2013 therefore the foaming fouling mechanisms should be analyzed from the point of view of gel layer filtration in summary the mbr operation and filtration tests revealed two interesting phenomena regarding the foaming fouling the extremely high sfr over 1016 m kg 1 of the supernatant and the foaming solution samples and the stronger adhesion interaction between the foaming foulants and membrane previous studies commonly reported the serious fouling caused by the foams in mbrs but didn t well distinguish or summarize these fouling phenomena obviously these foaming fouling phenomena are interesting and deserve further exploration accordingly the main foulants thermodynamic mechanisms and biological community responsible for the foaming fouling were explored in the following sections 3 2 characteristics of the foulants during the foaming and non foaming periods fig 4 shows ftir spectra of the organics in the sludge floc supernatant and foaming solution samples in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 during the foaming and non foaming periods all the samples show similar spectra profiles the peaks at 1630 cm 1 in the amide i region are primarily attributed to co stretching vibration of the amide group and the peaks at 1520 cm 1 in the amide ii region are mainly associated with n h bending vibration and c n stretching vibration long et al 2020 these two peaks suggest presence of proteins the broad absorption peaks at 3280 cm 1 and peaks at 1020 cm 1 are attributed to stretching vibrations of o h bond and the presence of c o respectively these results are consistent with the previous study teng et al 2018b these peaks indicate presence of polysaccharides the similar ftir spectra suggest that the major foulants affecting membrane fouling are proteins and polysaccharides fig 5 presents the content of proteins and polysaccharides in the foaming solution and supernatant samples during the foaming period and the non foaming period it can be seen that the foaming sample has high content of proteins 178 57 mg l and polysaccharides 209 21 mg l which are about 6 4 times and 5 4 times of those 27 81 mg l proteins and 39 09 mg l polysaccharides in the supernatant sample though the foulants in the foaming sample come from the supernatant their contents are significantly higher than those in the supernatant meanwhile the content of the proteins and polysaccharides in the supernatant during the foaming period is also significantly higher than those 12 85 mg l proteins and 3 94 mg l polysaccharides during the non foaming period these results suggest that there exists a mechanism permitting continuous production of proteins and polysaccharides in the mbr during the foaming period it is hypothesized that proteins and polysaccharides are the predominate foulants which are associated with high adhesion ability and formation of gel layer on membrane surface highly determining membrane fouling level continuous production of them during the foaming period can qualitatively explain the extremely serious fouling phenomenon during this period 3 3 thermodynamic mechanisms of the high foaming fouling table 2 presents the surface properties contact angle and zeta potential of the membrane and foulant samples during the foaming and non foaming periods with these data the profiles of interfacial interaction energies with separation distance for different foulant samples were quantitatively calculated by using the xdlvo theory and the results are presented in fig 6 it can be seen that the strength of all the individual interaction energies monotonously decreases with the separation distance in range of 0 158 12 nm the ab and lw interaction energies are continuously attractive while the el interaction energy is continuously repulsive and the ab interaction dominates the three interactions basically the sludge floc samples during the two periods have comparable total interaction energy strength with the membrane fig 6a in contrast the supernatant foulant sample during the foaming period has significantly higher total interaction energy strength than that during the non foaming period fig 6b the foaming foulant sample has even higher total interaction energy strength than those for the sludge floc and the supernatant foulant samples fig 6c it is generally accepted that the total interaction energy per unit area at the minimum separation distance 0 158 nm δ g h 0 t o l is a quantitative measure of foulant adhesion ability to a substance brant and childress 2002 hong et al 2013 van oss 1995 δ g h 0 t o l for the sludge floc samples during the foaming and non foaming periods are 26 67 mj m 2 and 30 66 mj m 2 respectively δ g h 0 t o l for the supernatant foulant samples during the foaming and non foaming periods are 48 57 mj m 2 and 34 27 mj m 2 respectively moreover δ g h 0 t o l for the foaming foulant sample during the foaming period is 60 29 mj m 2 it is evident that the foaming foulants have significantly higher adhesion ability than the sludge floc and supernatant foulant samples therefore the thermodynamic mechanism can well explain the phenomenon of the stronger adhesion interaction between the foaming foulants and membrane fig 3 indicates that filtration of the foaming solution sample neither well fits the pore blocking model nor the cake filtration model fig 5 shows that the foaming solution sample possesses high content of proteins 178 57 mg l and polysaccharides 209 21 mg l which are about 6 4 times and 5 4 times of those in the supernatant sample direct observation of membrane surface after filtration of the foaming solution sample showed a highly hydrated gel layer rather than cake layer formed on the membrane surface based on above information the following thermodynamic mechanism responsible for the extremely high sfr of the foaming solution is proposed as depicted in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 there is no visible pore throughout a homogeneous gel layer therefore to sustain filtration process through a gel layer it has to drag out the water in gel to the permeate the water in a homogeneous gel is bound water hold by the polymer matrix of the gel and there is a chemical potential gap between the bound water and the free water this chemical potential gap can be described by eq 18 provided in the flory huggins lattice theory filtration through a gel layer needs extra energy to compensate for the chemical potential gap between before and after the mixing polymer solution gel layer state for a filtration process exerting an extra pressure can offset this chemical potential gap δμmix and sustain the filtration process corresponding to the following relationship zhang et al 2013 2018 19 δ μ m i x v b δ p where v b is the molar volume of the solvent m3 mol 1 for a dilute solution v b approximates the molar volume of the solution v by definition sfr of a gel layer can be expressed as 20 s f r r m g where m g represents the dry weight of the gel layer combining eq 2 and eqs 18 20 sfr of a gel layer can be given as follows chen et al 2016 lei et al 2016 21 s f r r t ln 1 φ 1 n 1 φ χ φ 2 m g v j σ eq 21 provides the thermodynamic mechanism for gel layer filtration and the extremely high sfr of the foaming solution and the supernatant during filtration can be quantified and explained herein φ 0 05 and χ 0 50 were set for a gel layer as considering the following three facts 1 the formed gel layer contained above 95 water content 2 proteins and polysaccharides in gel layer are complicated and difficult to obtain their χ values and 3 χ values for most of polymers are in range of 0 4 0 6 a rough estimation by setting φ 0 05 and χ 0 50 of a homogeneous gel layer by using eq 21 showed that its sfr was 1 61 1016 m kg 1 very close to the experimental value 1 96 1016 m kg 1 for the foaming solution sample all above information suggests that the proposed thermodynamic mechanism really occurs in the filtration process of the foaming solution in the mbr and the extremely high sfr of the foaming solution and the supernatant solution could be soundly interpreted 3 4 microbial community related with the foaming fouling fig 8 shows the microscopic images of the sludge suspension samples during the foaming period and the non foaming period it is clear that the sludge flocs during the two periods show significantly different morphologies there are abundant filamentous substances growing around the mycelium during the foaming period fig 8a whereas the filamentous substances around the mycelium are significantly reduced and the sludge flocs show a shrunken morphology during the non foaming period fig 8b therefore the excess growth of filamentous substances in the sludge suspension may be the cause of the foaming problem the average sludge volume index svi for the foaming period and the non foaming period is 85 and 52 respectively indicating the good sludge sedimentation performance and no sludge bulking problem occurring during the non foaming period fig 9 shows the comparison of the relative abundance of the sludge microbial community at phylum level analyzed by 16s rdna gene sequence during the foaming period and the non foaming period it is demonstrated that the bacteria in the sludge suspension during the two operation periods mainly belong to 9 phylums including actinobacteria proteobacteria candidatus saccharibacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes chloroflexi nitrospirae acidobacteria and verrucomicrobia the most abundant bacteria during the two operation periods are actinobacteria it is generally accepted that there are three necessary components requirements to enable forming a stable foam in activated sludge systems hydrophobic cells surfactants and air bubbles petrovski et al 2011a it was reported that hydrophobic actinobacteria were commonly associated with foam stabilization petrovski et al 2011b accordingly the sludge suspension during the two periods meets at least two requirements hydrophobic cells and air bubbles the decisive requirement for foam formation in this study was whether the reactor presented sufficient surfactants obviously the abundant proteins and polysaccharides presented in the supernatant during the foaming period could act as the surfactants fig 5 indicates that there exists a mechanism permitting continuous production of proteins and polysaccharides in the mbr during the foaming period fig 8 clearly suggests the higher level of filamentous bacteria during the foaming period than the non foaming period this can be further supported by fig 9 where more abundant bacteroidetes and chloroflexi during the foaming period than the non foaming period can be observed bacteroidetes and chloroflexi is generally identified as filamentous members eikelboom and geurkink 2002 mielczarek et al 2012 it was reported that filamentous bacteria produced more smps including soluble proteins and polysaccharides in the sludge suspension pan et al 2010 in this context it seems that the more abundant filamentous bacteria provide the mechanism permitting continuous production of proteins and polysaccharides in the mbr during the foaming period table 3 lists the top 20 genera of relative abundance in the sludge suspension during the foaming period and the non foaming period it is evident that the relative abundance of bacteria during the foaming and non foaming periods is different these differences should be caused by the different microenvironments between the two periods bacteria of nocardia mycobacterium and gordonia are generally considered as foaming related bacteria species campo et al 2017 halkjær et al 2009 wang et al 2016 as shown in table 4 the abundance of these foaming related bacteria species is about 0 20 during the foaming period which is more than 10 times of that 0 02 during the non foaming period moreover the dominate foaming bacteria species of nocardia during the foaming period possesses 20 times abundance than that during the non foaming period in addition further analyses show that the total number of bacteria species during the non foaming period 66656 is rather greater than that during the foaming period 34017 the higher total number of bacteria species indicate the more robust ecosystem involved into the sludge suspension during the non foaming period which could benefit to resist the foaming and bulking problems in activated sludge systems these microbial differences should be the biological mechanism responsible for the foaming fouling in this study 4 conclusions serious membrane fouling caused by foams in an mbr was observed which could be further characterized as the extremely high specific filtration resistance sfr over 1016 m kg 1 and strong adhesion ability of the foaming foulants it was found that the foaming sample contained higher contents of proteins 178 57 mg l and polysaccharides 209 21 mg l which were about 6 4 times and 5 4 times of those in the supernatant sample indicating existence of a mechanism permitting continuous production of these foulants in the mbr during the foaming period analyses by flory huggins theory suggested that the foaming fouling was associated with gel layer filtration process and the extremely high sfr stemmed from the chemical potential change in the gel filtration process meanwhile the strong adhesion ability of the foaming foulants could be explained by the high interaction energy quantified by the xdlvo theory in addition it was identified by the 16s rdna gene sequencing that the abundance of the foaming related bacteria species in the sludge suspension during the foaming period was more than 10 times of that during the non foaming period this study offered new mechanism insights into foaming fouling in mbrs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this

17856,discharging drinking water treatment sludge dwts to sewers could be an efficient waste management strategy with the potential to replace chemical dosing for pollutant control this study for the first time investigated the fate of 28 different organic micropollutants mps due to the dosing of iron rich and aluminum rich dwts in a pilot rising main sewer nine mps had an initial rapid removal within 1 hr i e 10 80 due to fe dwts dosing the formation of fes particles due to fe dwts dosing was responsible for the removal of dissolved sulfides 80 reduction comparing to control sewer further particle characterization using sem eds xrd and atr ftir confirmed that fes particles formation played an important role in the removal of mps from wastewater adsorption of mps onto the fes particles was likely the possible mechanism for their rapid removal in comparison to iron rich dwts aluminum rich dwts had very limited beneficial effects in removing mps from wastewater the degradability of degradable mps including caffeine paraxanthine paracetamol metformin cyclamate cephalexin and miaa were not affected by the dwts dosing some non degradable mps including cotinine hydroxycotinine tramadol gabapentin desvenlafaxine hydrochlorothiazide carbamazepine fluconazole sulfamethoxazole acesulfame saccharin and sucralose were also not impacted by the dwts dosing this study systematically assessed the additional benefits of discharging fe dwts to the sewer network i e the removal of mps from the liquid phase thereby reducing its load to the treatment plant the results corroborate the discharge of fe rich dwts in sewers as an effective and beneficial way of managing the waste by product graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutants drinking water sludge sewer iron sulfide adsorption pharmaceuticals 1 introduction the production of high quality and safe drinking water requires the removal of turbidity organic matter and pathogens from the source water before being delivered to the consumers jacangelo et al 1995 yu et al 2007 coagulation or flocculation using a chemical coagulant is a common and cost effective technique used in drinking water treatment jacangelo et al 1995 aluminum and iron based inorganic salts are the most widely used coagulants duan and gregory 2003 this process produces the solid by product drinking water treatment sludge dwts based on the coagulant dosed it could be either aluminum rich dwts al dwts or iron rich dwts fe dwts the average production of dwts globally exceeds 3 65 106 dry tons per annum babatunde and zhao 2007 with a single site in australia alone produces about 2000 dry tons per annum ghd 2015 for decades dwts was managed mainly by stockpiling disposal to sewers landfills and lagoons babatunde and zhao 2007 ippolito et al 2011 however due to growing environmental concerns and liabilities the disposal of dwts becomes a greater issue forcing treatment utilities to look for an alternative management strategy a number of constructive attempts and research efforts have been made for the beneficial reuse of dwts the feasibility of reusing dwts as an adsorbent or coagulant was studied in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants babatunde and zhao 2007 keeley et al 2014 indirect benefits include the recovery and reuse of coagulant chemicals from the dwts due to the additional investment for the recovery process and concerns about the purity and efficiency of the recovered coagulant the direct application of the dwts is more feasible keeley et al 2012 the direct discharge of dwts to sewers could be treated together with sewage in the downstream wastewater treatment plant wwtp offering potentially wide ranging economic benefits verrelli 2008 the iron and aluminum content in the dwts varies from 133 to 268 gfe kg 1 fe dwts and 118 242 6 gal kg 1 al dwts of dry sludge respectively ippolito et al 2011 nagar et al 2009 sun et al 2015b zhao et al 2013 considering the high iron and aluminum content these sludge could be repurposed as a replacement chemical for pollutant control at the point of discharge the discharge of al dwts in sewer had the benefit of enhancing the phosphorus removal up to 94 in the downstream wwtp horth et al 1994 similarly fe dwts discharged to the sewers led to a substantial reduction of sulfides in digester gas of the receiving wwtp edwards et al 1997 it was observed that al dwts and fe dwts could be used directly as an adsorbent for the phosphates removal from wastewater the phosphate adsorption capacity of al dwts and fe dwts was reported as 0 30 0 33 and 0 95 mgp g 1 of dried sludge respectively huang and chiswell 2000 leader et al 2005 apart from these discharge of al dwts was also shown to remove hydrophobic dyes in effluent from textile industries chu 2001 and particulate pollutants in the primary settler guan et al 2005 in addition to beneficial uses in wwtps a recent study showed the potential of direct dosing of fe dwts for sulfide removal in the sewer network sun et al 2015b the fe dwts contains ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 or ferric oxy hydroxides feooh that are formed due to the rapid hydrolysis of fe iii salt during coagulation in drinking water treatment cheng 2002 the removal of sulfide due to fe dwts discharge could be explained by the reaction of fe oh 3 or feo oh with sulfide forming iron sulfide

has multiple downstream benefits for instance studies found that fes particles formed in the sewer network can be oxidized in the aerobic activated sludge reactor this enables phosphorus removal at a ratio of 0 44 and 0 37 mg p mg of fe2 and fe3 added to the sewer network gutierrez et al 2010 the iron dosing e g 5 20 mgfe l 1 to the sewer network was also demonstrated to provide iron for h2s emission control in the anaerobic digester by forming iron sulfide particles ge et al 2013 a recent laboratory scale study demonstrated the multiple benefits of dosing fe dwts in sewers on the downstream treatment process rebosura et al 2020 both fe salt and fe dwts dosing in sewers showed negligible negative impact of inorganic deposition on the performance of the sewer the downstream primary settler and activated sludge bioreactor kulandaivelu et al 2020 rebosura et al 2020 additionally iron and alum salts are effective coagulants for the removal of organic mps such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the drinking water treatment systems and wwtps boyd et al 2003 carballa et al 2005 ternes et al 2002 considering the fe and al concentrations in the dwts we hypothesize that there would be increased organic mp removal in sewer networks while discharging dwts the rapid removal of certain mps from the liquid phase in lab scale sewer reactors dosed with ferric chloride was attributed to the formation of fes particles kulandaivelu et al 2019 due to the potential formation of fes with fe dwts discharge to the sewers eqs 1 and 2 fe dwts may work similar to fe salts for the removal of mps in the rising main sewer condition the previous study only investigated a few spiked mp compounds in lab scale reactors dosed with ferric salt kulandaivelu et al 2019 considering the large number of organic mps in wastewater a systematic assessment of intrinsic mps and their fate in sewers due to dwts discharge is essential the main objective of this study is to systematically assess the potential additional benefits of discharging fe dwts and al dwts on the removal of mps from wastewater in a sewer network experiments were carried out in pilot rising main sewer pipes running with real wastewater a wide range of intrinsic pharmaceuticals food additives and an endogenous chemical were measured and the potential removal mechanism of these compounds by dwts were investigated through advanced characterization of biofilms and suspended solids 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot rising main sewer setup the pilot sewer system consists of two rising main sewer pipes one as control and the other as experimental each of 100 mm internal diameter a v 40 m 1 and a length of 300 m that are made of pvc grade pipe fig 1 the pilot system was established in the luggage point wastewater treatment plant wwtp brisbane australia the sewer pipes were supplied with wastewater in a storage tank which was continuously replenished with wastewater from the inlet works of the treatment plant the wastewater was pumped into the rising main pipes using a 3 phase pump she50 16075 7 5 kw equipped with hydrovar variable frequency drive for the flow control an inline magnetic resonance flow meter ifm sm2000 was used to maintain the expected flow range 5 600 l min 1 the pump was programmed to run for 2 min for every 1 hr at a flow rate of 550 l min 1 the characteristics of the feed wastewater is shown in table s2 the dissolved sulfide and sulfate concentration were 4 9 1 8 and 31 4 2 6 mgs l 1 respectively negligible amounts of sulfite thiosulfate 1 mgs l 1 nitrate and nitrite 1 mg l 1 were present the intrinsic organic mps in the feed wastewater were measured before starting the experiment table s4 paracetamol was detected at high concentrations comparing with other mps followed by caffeine metformin and paraxanthine 2 2 chemicals twenty eight intrinsic organic mps present in the wastewater were selected for this study based on their higher human consumption and higher concentrations in wastewater the selected mps include 19 pharmaceuticals 3 analgesics paracetamol codeine tramadol 1 β blocker atenolol 1 antiglycemic metformin 3

molecular weight octanol water partition coefficient and acid dissociation constant are listed in table s1 2 3 dwts dosing experiments in pilot rising main sewers the objective of the experiment is to investigate the impact of dosing dwts on the removal of mps from wastewater in the sewer system when beginning the experiment the sewer pipes were completely replenished with fresh wastewater by maintaining the flow rate of the pump at 275 l min 1 for 15 min after feeding the wastewater was continuously recirculated from a location at 240 m back to a location at 4 m in a closed loop to keep the solids in suspension recirculation was conducted at a flow rate of 110 l min 1 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the experiment was maintained at 6 hr replicating the real life rising main sewer condition for the two parallel 300 m long rising main pipes one was used as the control and another as the experimental line to be dosed with dwts the fe dwts was collected from gold coast desalination plant australia and the al dwts was sourced from mt crosby west bank treatment plant australia the sludge was collected in the slurry fe dwts and dewatered cake form al dwts both the sludge was analyzed for its characteristics and were presented in table s3 the fe content of the fe dwts was 884 mg l 1 and the al content of al dwts was 122 1 4 mg g 1 of dry solids prior dosing to the sewer pipes the sludge were mixed and diluted with subnatant of the dissolved air floatation unit unit to separate liquid from the secondary waste activated sludge of the wwtp samples of diluted dwts were collected from the dilution tank and were analyzed for metal concentrations mps and total solids the diluted dwts was then dosed to the experimental sewer pipe at a flow rate of 12 l min 1 for 20 min the dosing of sludge was optimized to achieve the target total solid concentration of 1 g l 1 inside the sewer pipes the target was selected based on the guidelines for trade waste discharge in sewers queensland urban utilities australia the experiment was conducted on two different days one day with fe dwts trial 1 and another day with al dwts trial 2 wastewater samples were collected at three different locations 15 m 105 m and 210 m of the sewer pipe at an interval of 20 min for the first hour and then hourly during the experiment 6 hr at each time point 2 ml of wastewater was filtered into a vial using 0 22 μm pes membrane syringe filter tullagreen ireland and 20 μl of 2 m hcl was added to acidify each sample to ph 2 for the organic mp analysis the acidified samples were then frozen at 20 c until analysis also hourly wastewater samples were taken for the analysis of sulfur compounds sulfate sulfide thiosulfate and sulfite dissolved methane total and soluble metal total and volatile solids in addition ph and temperature were monitored in real time using an online ph probe easysense 31 mettler toledo united states 2 4 properties of dwts and suspended particles to characterize the suspended particles in the control and experimental sewer line samples were drawn at 15 m point without any air bubbles at the end of the experiment 6 hr and filtered immediately using a vacuum filter to avoid the interference of oxygen during sample preparation the filtered suspended particle and raw dwts samples were dried overnight in a vacuum oven semsa oven 718 at room temperature the vacuum dried particles were coated twice by a carbon coater quorum q150t uk following a three heavy burst model to obtain a carbon thickness of 30 40 nm the microstructure and elemental composition of the particles were examined by sem jeol jsm 6610 america equipped with a detector oxford 50 mm2 x max sdd x ray that enables simultaneous imaging and elemental analysis at high count rates with 125 ev energy resolutions the edax software ametek inc was utilized at a frame resolution of 1024 800 with a dwell time of 200 s frame to collect 16 frames for each region of interest the locations for spot analyses were chosen by examining features of the back scattered electron image the mineral compositions of the particles were tested by xrd bruker

and 20 psi respectively ion spray and entrance potential was set to 5500 4500 and 10 v respectively a ten point calibration curve ranging from 0 05 to 150 μg l 1 was made in milli q water acidified to ph 2 with hcl and used for direct injection quantification using internal standards the lc ms ms run featured a calibration standard check and a blank ph 2 milli q water every seven sample injections and a qaqc sample injection at the beginning and end of each run a full calibration curve was rerun every time the lc ms ms run exceeded approx 15 hr and each wastewater sample was not kept defrosted in the auto sampler for over approx 15 hr the method validation the limit of detection and limit of quantification for each mp is shown in table s5b 2 6 data analysis the removal of different mps were calculated based on the temporal concentration of those compounds at the respective sampling locations 15 m 105 m and 210 m of the sewer pipe against the initial concentration before the dosage of fe dwts or al dwts considering the equilibrium condition maintained throughout the experiment the results at these three sampling locations were considered as triplicates to calculate the average removal and associated standard errors the dilution caused by the addition of 240 l of dwts to the pipe with a volume of 1850 l has been considered for all the parameters measured in the experimental sewer pipe pearson correlation and other statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological activities in the pilot sewer the concentration profiles of sulfide and dissolved methane in the control and experimental sewer line during trial 1 is shown in fig 2 a the total iron concentration in the experimental sewer increased from 1 7 0 2 to 32 16 mgfe l 1 due to fe dwts dosing fig s5 the sulfide concentration in the control sewer increased from 15 7 0 2 to 23 5 1 9 mgs l 1 whereas in the experimental sewer it decreased from 16 2 0 5 to 9 4 0 3 mgs l 1 during the 6 hr cycle period the decrease in the sulfide concentration in the experimental sewer was due to the dosing of fe sludge similar to previous reports in the laboratory sewer reactors sun et al 2015b the sulfide production rate in the control and experimental sewer lines were 1 3 0 6 and 1 2 0 3 mgs l 1 h 1 respectively considering the similar sulfide production rate in both sewer lines the sulfide removal due to fe dwts happened simultaneously with the sulfide production in the experimental sewer the methane production rate in the control and the experimental sewer line were 1 8 0 8 and 1 9 0 9 mgcod l 1 h 1 respectively the similar methane and sulfide production rates in both sewers imply the negligible impact of fe dwts dosing on the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic archaea ma in sewer biofilms the microbial community analysis of the sewer biofilms from the control and experimental sewers showed negligible impact of fe dwts dosing on the relative abundance of srb and ma section s4 however it was previously reported that sulfate reduction and methanogenic activity can be inhibited by fe salt dosing in rising main sewers kulandaivelu et al 2019 zhang et al 2009 it was hypothesized that the deposition of metal sulfides on the surface of srb and ma could cause the inhibition of these cells utgikar et al 2002 this mostly happen after long term dosing of fe salt which is different from the single dosing events tested in this study during trial 2 the impact of dosing al dwts on the dissolved phosphates and sulfide has been demonstrated in fig 2b the total aluminum concentration in the experimental sewer increased from 0 4 0 1 mgal l 1 to 43 6 6 5 mgal l 1 due to the dosing of al dwts fig s6 the dissolved phosphate concentration decreased drastically from 5 24 0 1 mgp l 1 to 0 13 0 02 mgp l 1 leading to the relative decrease of 97 5 0 2 this rapid removal of dissolved phosphates due to al dwts dosing could be attributed to the adsorption of dissolved phosphates to the sludge huang and chiswell 2000 leader et al 2005 similar to trial 1 the al dwts had negligible effect on the methanogenic activity of the biofilm fig s6 the sulfide production rate in both control and experimental sewer were 0 4 0 5 and 0 5 0 6 mgs l 1 h 1 respectively during trial 2 though the sulfide production rate is same in both the pipes a mean difference of dissolved sulfide concentration between the control and the experimental sewer 1 8 0 4 mgs l 1 was observed this difference could be due to the dilution caused by dwts addition that could potentially reduce the dissolved sulfide concentration by 2 5 mgs l 1 the sulfide production rate during trial 2 is comparatively lesser than trial 1 and could be caused by the change in sulfate concentration of the feed wastewater fig s7 similar change in biofilm activity due to the change in wastewater composition has been previously reported sun et al 2015a 2018 3 2 organic mps in the feed wastewater in this study 28 different intrinsic organic mps were selected for investigation and their concentration in the feed wastewater is given in table s4 the results from the organic mps concentration showed the relative high concentrations of 4 artificial sweeteners 2 caffeine related compounds paracetamol and metformin in the influent wastewater paracetamol is detected at the concentration of 62 7 1 8 μg l 1 similar to the range of 13 57 μg l 1 reported in korea wwtps over different seasonal period choi et al 2008 such high concentration of paracetamol is due to the high consumption and over the counter availability caffeine and paraxanthine were at the concentration of 40 6 0 9 and 26 5 0 6 μg l 1 respectively comparable to the reported concentrations in italy wastewater senta et al 2015 and three different wwtps in china zhou et al 2010 among the artificial sweeteners acesulfame had the highest concentration of 23 6 0 5 μg l 1 followed by sucralose 15 8 0 7 μg l 1 saccharin 15 3 0 4 μg l 1 and cyclamate 8 4 0 5 μg l 1 the acesulfame concentration is lower than the previously reported value for australia 40 μg l 1 lai et al 2015 but is comparable to those reported in china and switzerland buerge et al 2009 gan et al 2013 the concentration of saccharin is lower than the reported value in switzerland buerge et al 2009 the sucralose concentration is comparable to that in the united states ferrer and thurman 2010 in the antihistamine therapeutic group investigated fexofenadine was present at high concentration of 12 6 0 3 μg l 1 whereas ranitidine and cetirizine were at the concentrations of 0 6 0 03 and 0 1 0 01 μg l 1 respectively the endogenous compound miaa which is a histamine catabolite product was detected at the concentration of 20 7 0 8 μg l 1 the other investigated compounds were observed at concentrations 3 5 μg l 1 in the feed wastewater table s4 the concentration of mps in the diluted dwts were 100 times less than their concentrations in raw wastewater table s4 some compounds such as tramadol gabapentin amisulpride carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide are comparable to the wastewater whereas some compounds such as sucralose fluconazole and desvenlafaxine are higher in the diluted sludge those high concentrations might be due to the subnatant used to dilute the sludge table s4 considering the much lower dosing volume rate in comparison to the sewage flow in the sewer pipe c a 13 the diluted dwts will not introduce significant changes to concentrations of organic mps in wastewater the compounds affected by the dilution are discussed accordingly in section 3 4 3 3 fate and removal of mps in the rising main sewer 3 3 1 degradable compounds the term removal mentioned in this study could be either completely degraded by microorganism in sewer biofilms or biologically transformed into metabolite s the metabolites are not analyzed in this study or the removal caused by abiotic transformations such as chemical hydrolysis or sorption to wastewater suspended particles eight out of twenty eight compounds i e caffeine paracetamol metformin miaa cephalexin paraxanthine cyclamate and trimethoprim were degraded in the control sewer pipe during both the trials fig 3 out of these compounds paracetamol had the most removal up to 88 5 1 4 trial 1 and 71 1 4 trial 2 at the end of 6 hr in the control sewer this is comparable to reported removal up to 99 1 in a lab reactor gao et al 2017 and up to 40 4 removal in a pilot rising main sewer over 6 hr gao et al 2019 the higher removal observed in this study was likely due to the continuous wastewater recirculation which is a stronger mixing force than the 1 min mixing each hour in the previous study gao et al 2019 trimethoprim had the least removal among the degradable compounds with the ultimate removal of 31 4 3 7 at the end of 6 hr the removal of trimethoprim was attributed to the co metabolism by methanogens in the sewer biofilm gonzalez gil et al 2017 the removal of other compounds were comparable to the previous studies and were discussed in section s1 the removal of these compounds had a strong pearson correlation coefficient 0 9 among each other indicating similar processes might be responsible for their removal in sewers tables s6 and s7 the removal of these compounds also correlates with the sulfate reduction and dissolved methane production correlation coefficient 0 9 tables s6 and s7 in the control sewer pipe suggesting that their removal could be directly or indirectly related to the activity of ma and srb in the sewer biofilm the removal of some compounds like caffeine paraxanthine paracetamol and metformin during trial 2 is lower than trial 1 the lower removal might be due to the lower biofilm activity in trial 2 section 3 1 as a singular case contrary result was observed for miaa in the control sewer during two trials in trial 1 the ultimate removal of miaa in the control sewer was 37 2 3 whereas a negative removal i e 38 7 8 9 of miaa was observed during trial 2 over the 6 hr cycle the removal of miaa in the rising main sewer was previously reported choi et al 2018 although the negative removal was not previously reported this might be caused by the back transformation of histamine a parent compound of miaa which was not measured in this study in the feed wastewater choi et al 2018 the presence of histamine and other metabolites of histamine such as n tele methyl histamine were detected in the urine samples of the patients consuming histamine rich foods or diagnosed with food allergic symptoms raithel et al 2015 the transformation of n tele methyl histamine to miaa similar to human metabolism may have led to the observed increase of miaa pearce 1998 3 3 2 non degradable compounds twenty other compounds including codeine tramadol atenolol venlafaxine desvenlafaxine mirtazapine ranitidine fexofenadine cetirizine sulfamethoxazole fluconazole hydrochlorothiazide carbamazepine gabapentin amisulpride cotinine hydroxycotinine acesulfame saccharin and sucralose were found to be non degradable during the 6 hr cycle period in the control sewer pipe fig 3 the stability of fexofenadine venlafaxine codeine atenolol hydrochlorothiazide hydroxycotinine and cotinine observed in the control sewer of this study were consistent with previous reports in lab reactors or in the pilot sewer choi et al 2018 gao et al 2019 jelic et al 2015 varying removal rates were reported for ranitidine in rising main sewers such as negative removal in a real sewer jelic et al 2015 but 75 removal in a lab scale rising main reactor choi et al 2018 similarly a limited removal of cetirizine i e 5 9 4 3 in this study is contrary to the 70 loss in a lab scale sewer reactor over 12 hr choi et al 2018 likely due to the different a v ratios the fate of amisulpride and mirtazapine in the anaerobic sewer condition was not reported elsewhere amisulpride was reported to be stable in the conventional activated sludge treatment process while mirtazapine had 14 removal bollmann et al 2016 gurke et al 2015 sulfamethoxazole had a negative removal of 9 1 7 6 at the end of 6 hr in comparison to a reported negative removal of sulfamethoxazole 66 15 in a sewer pipe with 21 hr of hrt jelic et al 2015 the lesser formation in this study could be due to the shorter hrt investigated 3 4 impact of dwts dosing on the fate and removal of mps it is clear that the dosing of fe dwts or al dwts did not have any impact on the degradation of seven organic mps marked with in fig 3 inside the sewers though the dosing of fe sludge reduced the dissolved sulfide concentration the abundance and activities of srb and ma in the sewer biofilm were not impacted section s4 the similar removal behavior of these compounds in both control and experimental sewer was evidenced from their similar coefficients table s9 however continuous dosing of fe dwts for a long term could produce more fes particles that deposits on the biofilm and reduce the activities of srb and ma zhang et al 2009 the long term effect of fe dwts dosing on the sewer biofilm microbial community and its impact on the removal of these compounds needs further investigation nine out of 28 investigated compounds including codeine amisulpride venlafaxine ranitidine mirtazapine cetirizine fexofenadine atenolol and trimethoprim had a rapid initial removal within 1 hr in the experimental sewers due to fe dwts dosing marked by in fig 3 these compounds had the initial rapid removal up to 84 7 0 6 mirtazapine 75 8 6 amisulpride 68 9 6 8 ranitidine 67 4 6 1 venlafaxine 59 9 5 3 codeine 59 9 7 5 cetirizine 50 1 14 fexofenadine 36 3 3 8 trimethoprim and 7 1 6 4 atenolol within 1 hr of dosing fe dwts the ultimate removal of these compounds at the end of 6 hr remained the same as the initial removal observed after 1 hr the removal different between the control and the experiment sewer during trial 1 became constant after 1 hr among these compounds codeine venlafaxine mirtazapine fexofenadine and trimethoprim were not impacted by al dwts dosing i e no significant difference between control and experimental sewer a significant difference in the removal of atenolol cetirizine and ranitidine was observed due to al dwts dosing p 0 05 however al dwts enhanced the ultimate removal of these compound by only 5 10 comparing to the control sewer at the end of 6 hr in comparison to fe dwts dosing the removal difference observed for these compounds due to al dwts dosing are limited the remaining compounds 12 compounds that are non degradable in the control sewer had no significant impact due to either fe dwts or al dwts dosing unmarked and marked as underlined in fig 3 among these compounds carbamazepine sucralose and hydrochlorothiazide are significantly higher than the control sewer due to fe dwts dosing this high concentration could be due to the subnatant used for mixing the sludge based on the concentration of these compounds in the fe dwts sludge mix table s4 the dilution inside the sewer might contribute about 13 3 carbamazepine 17 4 sucralose and 10 hydrochlorothiazide increase to the initial mp concentration of wastewater in the experimental sewer pipe similarly during trial 2 the al dwts dosing to the experimental sewer might contribute about 4 2 tramadol 12 5 gabapentin 21 8 desvenlafaxine and 20 fluconazole increase to the initial concentration of wastewater thus the increase of these concentrations in the experimental sewer were mainly due to the dosing of dwts 3 5 role of adsorption to fe dwts in the rapid removal of mps 3 5 1 properties of fe dwts before and after dosed to sewers the raw fe dwts sludge showed lots of irregular shaped particles in clusters on sem image fig s2 similar to observations for fe dwts in previous studies muruganandham et al 2007 zhu et al 2019 after dosing into the sewer the suspended particles collected at the end of the trial 1 experiment showed clustered nanocrystalline partciles with the floc like structures the particles might be mackinawite fes formed by the precipitation of iron with sulfide in wastewater jeong et al 2007 wolthers et al 2005 eds elemental mapping analysis further confirmed that iron and oxygen were the main composition of raw fe dwts before dosing to the sewer lines fig s3 the elemental composition of the particles formed in the experimental line during trial 1 was donimnated by iron and sulfur the calculated fe s atomic ratio was between 0 8 and 1 1 table s8 which suggests the speciation of the particles as fes similar elemental composition of iron and sulfur were not observed in the suspended particles collected from the control line fig s3 xrd analysis also identified the mineral form of particles collected from the experimental line as iron sulfide clearly theta angle positions of the peaks from 10 to 100 corroborate mackinawite fes as one of the particles formed along with some ferric oxy hydroxides and ferrous sulfates fig s4 no fes was observed on the raw fe dwts before dosed into the sewers 3 5 2 adsorption of mps to fes this study finds the additional benefit of dosing fe dwts i e the removal of 9 out of 28 compounds mps from the liquid phase in the sewer network this initial rapid removal could be attributed to the adsorption of mps to fes particles formed due to the dosing of fe dwts in the rising main sewers in this study nearly 67 4 and 64 removal within an hour for venlafaxine and codeine were observed with the dosing of fe dwts this is much higher than the 2 7 12 and 5 sorption of venlafaxine and codeine respectively to the suspended particulate matter in wastewater baker et al 2012 ftir spectrometry of the suspended particles collected in the experimental sewer during trial 1 showed the appearance of a number of characteristic peaks on the surface of iron particles in comparison to the raw fe dwts section s5 these characteristic peaks were the indicative of the aromatic primary and tertiary amine groups interestingly the compounds that showed a rapid removal contain two or three tertiary amine functional groups attached to their structure table s1 this supports the observed mp removal is due to adsorption onto the iron sulfide particles our previous study showed that iron speciation other than fes had negligible effect on the adsorption of mps in sewer reactors kulandaivelu et al 2019 thus the adsorption of mps onto iron sulfide particles is responsible for the initial fast removal of those organic mp compounds with amine functional groups the sorption could be a physical sorption vander walls force or h bond sharing or chemisorption forming covalent or ionic bonds for instance venlafaxine log kow 3 2 mirtazapine log kow 3 0 and fexofenadine log kow 2 8 are slightly non polar and the sorption is mostly due to the physical sorption or surface complexation on the fes particles the other rapidly removed compounds are polar with low log kow value table s1 and hence the sorption could be chemisorption forming chemical bonds on the surface of fes particles also the correlation showed that log kow compared to other properties of the compound correlates positively with the removal observed during trial 1 due to the dosing of fe dwts fig s1 the extent of removal observed in the pilot scale sewers dosed with fe dwts is primarily comparable to that in the lab scale sewer reactors dosed with ferric chloride kulandaivelu et al 2019 however the removal of atenolol carbamazepine and acesulfame in the pilot sewer is lower kulandaivelu et al 2019 the lower removal is likely due to the lower production of fes particles by a single dose of fe dwts in the pilot sewer in contrast to the continuous ferric dosing in the lab scale rising main sewer kulandaivelu et al 2019 it has been shown that the mp removal is proportional to the fes particle concentration kulandaivelu et al 2019 it is reasonable to expect higher removal of atenolol carbamazepine and acesulfame when fe dwts is continuously discharged to sewers 4 implications this study for the first time showed that fe dwts dosing in sewers led to significant removal of some organic mps from the liquid phase within 1 hr many of these mps are reported to be recalcitrant to the conventional wastewater treatment processes and the occurrence of these organic mps in the aquatic environment is well documented kristofco and brooks 2017 van der grinten et al 2010 these mps usually occurring in mixtures have endocrine disrupting effects on the zebra fish liver cells gust et al 2013 pomati et al 2007 toxic effects on oyster larvae due to venlafaxine di poi et al 2018 and algal toxicity on cyanobacteria due to trimethoprim van der grinten et al 2010 the occurrence of ranitidine fexofenadine and cetirizine is also hazardous to the aquatic life kristofco and brooks 2017 the removal of these mps in the sewer network is adding value to the downstream wwtp by removing them from the influent wastewater and has the potential to reduce the discharge of mps to the aquatic environment in addition fe dwts is the waste by product of drinking water production and it demands cost effective treatment and disposal the annual cost of disposing the dwts was reported as 30 40 million in the netherlands horth et al 1994 the cost of sludge disposal varied between 10 and 20 of the total operating cost in a new zealand plant verrelli 2008 discharging this waste by product into the sewers is highly attractive economically the total saving of 20 500 96 500 per annum in a 17 mgd capacity treatment plant excluding the sludge storage and dosing facility was reported while discharging the dwts in sewers edwards et al 1997 furthermore the discharge of dwts to sewers can be exploited for sulfide control in the sewer system sun et al 2015b previous studies showed that the fes produced in the sewer network will be reactivated in the treatment plant for the phosphorus removal and hydrogen sulfide emission control in the anaerobic digester this study revealed one additional benefit in the removal of mps from the wastewater due to adsorption to fes particles the potential formation of fes particles in the sewers and its associated downstream multiple benefits makes the discharge of dwts to the sewers as an economically viable option compared to using it as an secondary or tertiary treatment method also as discussed in section 3 4 the ultimate removal of mps that are adsorbed to fes remained constant after 1 hr indicating the negligible desorption of these mps in sewers hence future research should focus on understanding the fate and degradation of mps attached to fes when entering the downstream wwtp 5 conclusion in this study the impact of dosing fe dwts and al dwts on the removal of 28 intrinsic organic micropollutants from wastewater was investigated in a pilot rising main sewer the key conclusions are the fe dwts dosing in the pilot rising main sewer was efficient in removing the dissolved sulfides whereas al dwts was effective for the removal of dissolved phosphates from wastewater the fe dwts dosed to the pilot sewer had a rapid removal of certain mps in particular the compounds with amine functional groups i e mirtazapine amisulpride ranitidine venlafaxine codeine cetirizine fexofenadine trimethoprim and atenolol within 1 hr in the pilot rising main sewer the rapid removal of these mps with amine functional groups is likely due to the adsorption onto the fes particles formed by the discharging of fe dwts in sewers such a rapid removal of these mps was not observed for the al dwts dosing seven biodegradable mps including paracetamol caffeine metformin paraxanthine cephalexin cyclamate and miaa were not affected by either sludge dosing this is consistent with the negligible impact on the sewer biofilm activity other mps such as cotinine hydroxycotinine tramadol gabapentin desvenlafaxine hydrochlorothiazide carbamazepine fluconazole sulfamethoxazole acesulfame saccharin and sucralose were neither degraded nor impacted by the dosing of both fe dwts and al dwts in the pilot rising main sewer system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17856,discharging drinking water treatment sludge dwts to sewers could be an efficient waste management strategy with the potential to replace chemical dosing for pollutant control this study for the first time investigated the fate of 28 different organic micropollutants mps due to the dosing of iron rich and aluminum rich dwts in a pilot rising main sewer nine mps had an initial rapid removal within 1 hr i e 10 80 due to fe dwts dosing the formation of fes particles due to fe dwts dosing was responsible for the removal of dissolved sulfides 80 reduction comparing to control sewer further particle characterization using sem eds xrd and atr ftir confirmed that fes particles formation played an important role in the removal of mps from wastewater adsorption of mps onto the fes particles was likely the possible mechanism for their rapid removal in comparison to iron rich dwts aluminum rich dwts had very limited beneficial effects in removing mps from wastewater the degradability of degradable mps including caffeine paraxanthine paracetamol metformin cyclamate cephalexin and miaa were not affected by the dwts dosing some non degradable mps including cotinine hydroxycotinine tramadol gabapentin desvenlafaxine hydrochlorothiazide carbamazepine fluconazole sulfamethoxazole acesulfame saccharin and sucralose were also not impacted by the dwts dosing this study systematically assessed the additional benefits of discharging fe dwts to the sewer network i e the removal of mps from the liquid phase thereby reducing its load to the treatment plant the results corroborate the discharge of fe rich dwts in sewers as an effective and beneficial way of managing the waste by product graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutants drinking water sludge sewer iron sulfide adsorption pharmaceuticals 1 introduction the production of high quality and safe drinking water requires the removal of turbidity organic matter and pathogens from the source water before being delivered to the consumers jacangelo et al 1995 yu et al 2007 coagulation or flocculation using a chemical coagulant is a common and cost effective technique used in drinking water treatment jacangelo et al 1995 aluminum and iron based inorganic salts are the most widely used coagulants duan and gregory 2003 this process produces the solid by product drinking water treatment sludge dwts based on the coagulant dosed it could be either aluminum rich dwts al dwts or iron rich dwts fe dwts the average production of dwts globally exceeds 3 65 106 dry tons per annum babatunde and zhao 2007 with a single site in australia alone produces about 2000 dry tons per annum ghd 2015 for decades dwts was managed mainly by stockpiling disposal to sewers landfills and lagoons babatunde and zhao 2007 ippolito et al 2011 however due to growing environmental concerns and liabilities the disposal of dwts becomes a greater issue forcing treatment utilities to look for an alternative management strategy a number of constructive attempts and research efforts have been made for the beneficial reuse of dwts the feasibility of reusing dwts as an adsorbent or coagulant was studied in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants babatunde and zhao 2007 keeley et al 2014 indirect benefits include the recovery and reuse of coagulant chemicals from the dwts due to the additional investment for the recovery process and concerns about the purity and efficiency of the recovered coagulant the direct application of the dwts is more feasible keeley et al 2012 the direct discharge of dwts to sewers could be treated together with sewage in the downstream wastewater treatment plant wwtp offering potentially wide ranging economic benefits verrelli 2008 the iron and aluminum content in the dwts varies from 133 to 268 gfe kg 1 fe dwts and 118 242 6 gal kg 1 al dwts of dry sludge respectively ippolito et al 2011 nagar et al 2009 sun et al 2015b zhao et al 2013 considering the high iron and aluminum content these sludge could be repurposed as a replacement chemical for pollutant control at the point of discharge the discharge of al dwts in sewer had the benefit of enhancing the phosphorus removal up to 94 in the downstream wwtp horth et al 1994 similarly fe dwts discharged to the sewers led to a substantial reduction of sulfides in digester gas of the receiving wwtp edwards et al 1997 it was observed that al dwts and fe dwts could be used directly as an adsorbent for the phosphates removal from wastewater the phosphate adsorption capacity of al dwts and fe dwts was reported as 0 30 0 33 and 0 95 mgp g 1 of dried sludge respectively huang and chiswell 2000 leader et al 2005 apart from these discharge of al dwts was also shown to remove hydrophobic dyes in effluent from textile industries chu 2001 and particulate pollutants in the primary settler guan et al 2005 in addition to beneficial uses in wwtps a recent study showed the potential of direct dosing of fe dwts for sulfide removal in the sewer network sun et al 2015b the fe dwts contains ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 or ferric oxy hydroxides feooh that are formed due to the rapid hydrolysis of fe iii salt during coagulation in drinking water treatment cheng 2002 the removal of sulfide due to fe dwts discharge could be explained by the reaction of fe oh 3 or feo oh with sulfide forming iron sulfide

emission control in the anaerobic digester by forming iron sulfide particles ge et al 2013 a recent laboratory scale study demonstrated the multiple benefits of dosing fe dwts in sewers on the downstream treatment process rebosura et al 2020 both fe salt and fe dwts dosing in sewers showed negligible negative impact of inorganic deposition on the performance of the sewer the downstream primary settler and activated sludge bioreactor kulandaivelu et al 2020 rebosura et al 2020 additionally iron and alum salts are effective coagulants for the removal of organic mps such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the drinking water treatment systems and wwtps boyd et al 2003 carballa et al 2005 ternes et al 2002 considering the fe and al concentrations in the dwts we hypothesize that there would be increased organic mp removal in sewer networks while discharging dwts the rapid removal of certain mps from the liquid phase in lab scale sewer reactors dosed with ferric chloride was attributed to the formation of fes particles kulandaivelu et al 2019 due to the potential formation of fes with fe dwts discharge to the sewers eqs 1 and 2 fe dwts may work similar to fe salts for the removal of mps in the rising main sewer condition the previous study only investigated a few spiked mp compounds in lab scale reactors dosed with ferric salt kulandaivelu et al 2019 considering the large number of organic mps in wastewater a systematic assessment of intrinsic mps and their fate in sewers due to dwts discharge is essential the main objective of this study is to systematically assess the potential additional benefits of discharging fe dwts and al dwts on the removal of mps from wastewater in a sewer network experiments were carried out in pilot rising main sewer pipes running with real wastewater a wide range of intrinsic pharmaceuticals food additives and an endogenous chemical were measured and the potential removal mechanism of these compounds by dwts were investigated through advanced characterization of biofilms and suspended solids 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot rising main sewer setup the pilot sewer system consists of two rising main sewer pipes one as control and the other as experimental each of 100 mm internal diameter a v 40 m 1 and a length of 300 m that are made of pvc grade pipe fig 1 the pilot system was established in the luggage point wastewater treatment plant wwtp brisbane australia the sewer pipes were supplied with wastewater in a storage tank which was continuously replenished with wastewater from the inlet works of the treatment plant the wastewater was pumped into the rising main pipes using a 3 phase pump she50 16075 7 5 kw equipped with hydrovar variable frequency drive for the flow control an inline magnetic resonance flow meter ifm sm2000 was used to maintain the expected flow range 5 600 l min 1 the pump was programmed to run for 2 min for every 1 hr at a flow rate of 550 l min 1 the characteristics of the feed wastewater is shown in table s2 the dissolved sulfide and sulfate concentration were 4 9 1 8 and 31 4 2 6 mgs l 1 respectively negligible amounts of sulfite thiosulfate 1 mgs l 1 nitrate and nitrite 1 mg l 1 were present the intrinsic organic mps in the feed wastewater were measured before starting the experiment table s4 paracetamol was detected at high concentrations comparing with other mps followed by caffeine metformin and paraxanthine 2 2 chemicals twenty eight intrinsic organic mps present in the wastewater were selected for this study based on their higher human consumption and higher concentrations in wastewater the selected mps include 19 pharmaceuticals 3 analgesics paracetamol codeine tramadol 1 β blocker atenolol 1 antiglycemic metformin 3

molecular weight octanol water partition coefficient and acid dissociation constant are listed in table s1 2 3 dwts dosing experiments in pilot rising main sewers the objective of the experiment is to investigate the impact of dosing dwts on the removal of mps from wastewater in the sewer system when beginning the experiment the sewer pipes were completely replenished with fresh wastewater by maintaining the flow rate of the pump at 275 l min 1 for 15 min after feeding the wastewater was continuously recirculated from a location at 240 m back to a location at 4 m in a closed loop to keep the solids in suspension recirculation was conducted at a flow rate of 110 l min 1 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the experiment was maintained at 6 hr replicating the real life rising main sewer condition for the two parallel 300 m long rising main pipes one was used as the control and another as the experimental line to be dosed with dwts the fe dwts was collected from gold coast desalination plant australia and the al dwts was sourced from mt crosby west bank treatment plant australia the sludge was collected in the slurry fe dwts and dewatered cake form al dwts both the sludge was analyzed for its characteristics and were presented in table s3 the fe content of the fe dwts was 884 mg l 1 and the al content of al dwts was 122 1 4 mg g 1 of dry solids prior dosing to the sewer pipes the sludge were mixed and diluted with subnatant of the dissolved air floatation unit unit to separate liquid from the secondary waste activated sludge of the wwtp samples of diluted dwts were collected from the dilution tank and were analyzed for metal concentrations mps and total solids the diluted dwts was then dosed to the experimental sewer pipe at a flow rate of 12 l min 1 for 20 min the dosing of sludge was optimized to achieve the target total solid concentration of 1 g l 1 inside the sewer pipes the target was selected based on the guidelines for trade waste discharge in sewers queensland urban utilities australia the experiment was conducted on two different days one day with fe dwts trial 1 and another day with al dwts trial 2 wastewater samples were collected at three different locations 15 m 105 m and 210 m of the sewer pipe at an interval of 20 min for the first hour and then hourly during the experiment 6 hr at each time point 2 ml of wastewater was filtered into a vial using 0 22 μm pes membrane syringe filter tullagreen ireland and 20 μl of 2 m hcl was added to acidify each sample to ph 2 for the organic mp analysis the acidified samples were then frozen at 20 c until analysis also hourly wastewater samples were taken for the analysis of sulfur compounds sulfate sulfide thiosulfate and sulfite dissolved methane total and soluble metal total and volatile solids in addition ph and temperature were monitored in real time using an online ph probe easysense 31 mettler toledo united states 2 4 properties of dwts and suspended particles to characterize the suspended particles in the control and experimental sewer line samples were drawn at 15 m point without any air bubbles at the end of the experiment 6 hr and filtered immediately using a vacuum filter to avoid the interference of oxygen during sample preparation the filtered suspended particle and raw dwts samples were dried overnight in a vacuum oven semsa oven 718 at room temperature the vacuum dried particles were coated twice by a carbon coater quorum q150t uk following a three heavy burst model to obtain a carbon thickness of 30 40 nm the microstructure and elemental composition of the particles were examined by sem jeol jsm 6610 america equipped with a detector oxford 50 mm2 x max sdd x ray that enables simultaneous imaging and elemental analysis at high count rates with 125 ev energy resolutions the edax software ametek inc was utilized at a frame resolution of 1024 800 with a dwell time of 200 s frame to collect 16 frames for each region of interest the locations for spot analyses were chosen by examining features of the back scattered electron image the mineral compositions of the particles were tested by xrd bruker d8 advance mkii x rays were generated at 40 kv and 40 ma with a scanning speed of 2 0 deg min 1 and a scanning range of 10 100 the composition identifications were carried out using jade software

and 20 psi respectively ion spray and entrance potential was set to 5500 4500 and 10 v respectively a ten point calibration curve ranging from 0 05 to 150 μg l 1 was made in milli q water acidified to ph 2 with hcl and used for direct injection quantification using internal standards the lc ms ms run featured a calibration standard check and a blank ph 2 milli q water every seven sample injections and a qaqc sample injection at the beginning and end of each run a full calibration curve was rerun every time the lc ms ms run exceeded approx 15 hr and each wastewater sample was not kept defrosted in the auto sampler for over approx 15 hr the method validation the limit of detection and limit of quantification for each mp is shown in table s5b 2 6 data analysis the removal of different mps were calculated based on the temporal concentration of those compounds at the respective sampling locations 15 m 105 m and 210 m of the sewer pipe against the initial concentration before the dosage of fe dwts or al dwts considering the equilibrium condition maintained throughout the experiment the results at these three sampling locations were considered as triplicates to calculate the average removal and associated standard errors the dilution caused by the addition of 240 l of dwts to the pipe with a volume of 1850 l has been considered for all the parameters measured in the experimental sewer pipe pearson correlation and other statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological activities in the pilot sewer the concentration profiles of sulfide and dissolved methane in the control and experimental sewer line during trial 1 is shown in fig 2 a the total iron concentration in the experimental sewer increased from 1 7 0 2 to 32 16 mgfe l 1 due to fe dwts dosing fig s5 the sulfide concentration in the control sewer increased from 15 7 0 2 to 23 5 1 9 mgs l 1 whereas in the experimental sewer it decreased from 16 2 0 5 to 9 4 0 3 mgs l 1 during the 6 hr cycle period the decrease in the sulfide concentration in the experimental sewer was due to the dosing of fe sludge similar to previous reports in the laboratory sewer reactors sun et al 2015b the sulfide production rate in the control and experimental sewer lines were 1 3 0 6 and 1 2 0 3 mgs l 1 h 1 respectively considering the similar sulfide production rate in both sewer lines the sulfide removal due to fe dwts happened simultaneously with the sulfide production in the experimental sewer the methane production rate in the control and the experimental sewer line were 1 8 0 8 and 1 9 0 9 mgcod l 1 h 1 respectively the similar methane and sulfide production rates in both sewers imply the negligible impact of fe dwts dosing on the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic archaea ma in sewer biofilms the microbial community analysis of the sewer biofilms from the control and experimental sewers showed negligible impact of fe dwts dosing on the relative abundance of srb and ma section s4 however it was previously reported that sulfate reduction and methanogenic activity can be inhibited by fe salt dosing in rising main sewers kulandaivelu et al 2019 zhang et al 2009 it was hypothesized that the deposition of metal sulfides on the surface of srb and ma could cause the inhibition of these cells utgikar et al 2002 this mostly happen after long term dosing of fe salt which is different from the single dosing events tested in this study during trial 2 the impact of dosing al dwts on the dissolved phosphates and sulfide has been demonstrated in fig 2b the total aluminum concentration in the experimental sewer increased from 0 4 0 1 mgal l 1 to 43 6 6 5 mgal l 1 due to the dosing of al dwts fig s6 the dissolved phosphate concentration decreased drastically from 5 24 0 1 mgp l 1 to 0 13 0 02 mgp l 1 leading to the relative decrease of 97 5 0 2 this rapid removal of dissolved phosphates due to al dwts dosing could be attributed to the adsorption of dissolved phosphates to the sludge huang and chiswell 2000 leader et al 2005 similar to trial 1 the al dwts had negligible effect on the methanogenic activity of the biofilm fig s6 the sulfide production rate in both control and experimental sewer were 0 4 0 5 and 0 5 0 6 mgs l 1 h 1 respectively during trial 2 though the sulfide production rate is same in both the pipes a mean difference of dissolved sulfide concentration between the control and the experimental sewer 1 8 0 4 mgs l 1 was observed this difference could be due to the dilution caused by dwts addition that could potentially reduce the dissolved sulfide concentration by 2 5 mgs l 1 the sulfide production rate during trial 2 is comparatively lesser than trial 1 and could be caused by the change in sulfate concentration of the feed wastewater fig s7 similar change in biofilm activity due to the change in wastewater composition has been previously reported sun et al 2015a 2018 3 2 organic mps in the feed wastewater in this study 28 different intrinsic organic mps were selected for investigation and their concentration in the feed wastewater is given in table s4 the results from the organic mps concentration showed the relative high concentrations of 4 artificial sweeteners 2 caffeine related compounds paracetamol and metformin in the influent wastewater paracetamol is detected at the concentration of 62 7 1 8 μg l 1 similar to the range of 13 57 μg l 1 reported in korea wwtps over different seasonal period choi et al 2008 such high concentration of paracetamol is due to the high consumption and over the counter availability caffeine and paraxanthine were at the concentration of 40 6 0 9 and 26 5 0 6 μg l 1 respectively comparable to the reported concentrations in italy wastewater senta et al 2015 and three different wwtps in china zhou et al 2010 among the artificial sweeteners acesulfame had the highest concentration of 23 6 0 5 μg l 1 followed by sucralose 15 8 0 7 μg l 1 saccharin 15 3 0 4 μg l 1 and cyclamate 8 4 0 5 μg l 1 the acesulfame concentration is lower than the previously reported value for australia 40 μg l 1 lai et al 2015 but is comparable to those reported in china and switzerland buerge et al 2009 gan et al 2013 the concentration of saccharin is lower than the reported value in switzerland buerge et al 2009 the sucralose concentration is comparable to that in the united states ferrer and thurman 2010 in the antihistamine therapeutic group investigated fexofenadine was present at high concentration of 12 6 0 3 μg l 1 whereas ranitidine and cetirizine were at the concentrations of 0 6 0 03 and 0 1 0 01 μg l 1 respectively the endogenous compound miaa which is a histamine catabolite product was detected at the concentration of 20 7 0 8 μg l 1 the other investigated compounds were observed at concentrations 3 5 μg l 1 in the feed wastewater table s4 the concentration of mps in the diluted dwts were 100 times less than their concentrations in raw wastewater table s4 some compounds such as tramadol gabapentin amisulpride carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide are comparable to the wastewater whereas some compounds such as sucralose fluconazole and desvenlafaxine are higher in the diluted sludge those high concentrations might be due to the subnatant used to dilute the sludge table s4 considering the much lower dosing volume rate in comparison to the sewage flow in the sewer pipe c a 13 the diluted dwts will not introduce significant changes to concentrations of organic mps in wastewater the compounds affected by the dilution are discussed accordingly in section 3 4 3 3 fate and removal of mps in the rising main sewer 3 3 1 degradable compounds the term removal mentioned in this study could be either completely degraded by microorganism in sewer biofilms or biologically transformed into metabolite s the metabolites are not analyzed in this study or the removal caused by abiotic transformations such as chemical hydrolysis or sorption to wastewater suspended particles eight out of twenty eight compounds i e caffeine paracetamol metformin miaa cephalexin paraxanthine cyclamate and trimethoprim were degraded in the control sewer pipe during both the trials fig 3 out of these compounds paracetamol had the most removal up to 88 5 1 4 trial 1 and 71 1 4 trial 2 at the end of 6 hr in the control sewer this is comparable to reported removal up to 99 1 in a lab reactor gao et al 2017 and up to 40 4 removal in a pilot rising main sewer over 6 hr gao et al 2019 the higher removal observed in this study was likely due to the continuous wastewater recirculation which is a stronger mixing force than the 1 min mixing each hour in the previous study gao et al 2019 trimethoprim had the least removal among the degradable compounds with the ultimate removal of 31 4 3 7 at the end of 6 hr the removal of trimethoprim was attributed to the co metabolism by methanogens in the sewer biofilm gonzalez gil et al 2017 the removal of other compounds were comparable to the previous studies and were discussed in section s1 the removal of these compounds had a strong pearson correlation coefficient 0 9 among each other indicating similar processes might be responsible for their removal in sewers tables s6 and s7 the removal of these compounds also correlates with the sulfate reduction and dissolved methane production correlation coefficient 0 9 tables s6 and s7 in the control sewer pipe suggesting that their removal could be directly or indirectly related to the activity of ma and srb in the sewer biofilm the removal of some compounds like caffeine paraxanthine paracetamol and metformin during trial 2 is lower than trial 1 the lower removal might be due to the lower biofilm activity in trial 2 section 3 1 as a singular case contrary result was observed for miaa in the control sewer during two trials in trial 1 the ultimate removal of miaa in the control sewer was 37 2 3 whereas a negative removal i e 38 7 8 9 of miaa was observed during trial 2 over the 6 hr cycle the removal of miaa in the rising main sewer was previously reported choi et al 2018 although the negative removal was not previously reported this might be caused by the back transformation of histamine a parent compound of miaa which was not measured in this study in the feed wastewater choi et al 2018 the presence of histamine and other metabolites of histamine such as n tele methyl histamine were detected in the urine samples of the patients consuming histamine rich foods or diagnosed with food allergic symptoms raithel et al 2015 the transformation of n tele methyl histamine to miaa similar to human metabolism may have led to the observed increase of miaa pearce 1998 3 3 2 non degradable compounds twenty other compounds including codeine tramadol atenolol venlafaxine desvenlafaxine mirtazapine ranitidine fexofenadine cetirizine sulfamethoxazole fluconazole hydrochlorothiazide carbamazepine gabapentin amisulpride cotinine hydroxycotinine acesulfame saccharin and sucralose were found to be non degradable during the 6 hr cycle period in the control sewer pipe fig 3 the stability of fexofenadine venlafaxine codeine atenolol hydrochlorothiazide hydroxycotinine and cotinine observed in the control sewer of this study were consistent with previous reports in lab reactors or in the pilot sewer choi et al 2018 gao et al 2019 jelic et al 2015 varying removal rates were reported for ranitidine in rising main sewers such as negative removal in a real sewer jelic et al 2015 but 75 removal in a lab scale rising main reactor choi et al 2018 similarly a limited removal of cetirizine i e 5 9 4 3 in this study is contrary to the 70 loss in a lab scale sewer reactor over 12 hr choi et al 2018 likely due to the different a v ratios the fate of amisulpride and mirtazapine in the anaerobic sewer condition was not reported elsewhere amisulpride was reported to be stable in the conventional activated sludge treatment process while mirtazapine had 14 removal bollmann et al 2016 gurke et al 2015 sulfamethoxazole had a negative removal of 9 1 7 6 at the end of 6 hr in comparison to a reported negative removal of sulfamethoxazole 66 15 in a sewer pipe with 21 hr of hrt jelic et al 2015 the lesser formation in this study could be due to the shorter hrt investigated 3 4 impact of dwts dosing on the fate and removal of mps it is clear that the dosing of fe dwts or al dwts did not have any impact on the degradation of seven organic mps marked with in fig 3 inside the sewers though the dosing of fe sludge reduced the dissolved sulfide concentration the abundance and activities of srb and ma in the sewer biofilm were not impacted section s4 the similar removal behavior of these compounds in both control and experimental sewer was evidenced from their similar coefficients table s9 however continuous dosing of fe dwts for a long term could produce more fes particles that deposits on the biofilm and reduce the activities of srb and ma zhang et al 2009 the long term effect of fe dwts dosing on the sewer biofilm microbial community and its impact on the removal of these compounds needs further investigation nine out of 28 investigated compounds including codeine amisulpride venlafaxine ranitidine mirtazapine cetirizine fexofenadine atenolol and trimethoprim had a rapid initial removal within 1 hr in the experimental sewers due to fe dwts dosing marked by in fig 3 these compounds had the initial rapid removal up to 84 7 0 6 mirtazapine 75 8 6 amisulpride 68 9 6 8 ranitidine 67 4 6 1 venlafaxine 59 9 5 3 codeine 59 9 7 5 cetirizine 50 1 14 fexofenadine 36 3 3 8 trimethoprim and 7 1 6 4 atenolol within 1 hr of dosing fe dwts the ultimate removal of these compounds at the end of 6 hr remained the same as the initial removal observed after 1 hr the removal different between the control and the experiment sewer during trial 1 became constant after 1 hr among these compounds codeine venlafaxine mirtazapine fexofenadine and trimethoprim were not impacted by al dwts dosing i e no significant difference between control and experimental sewer a significant difference in the removal of atenolol cetirizine and ranitidine was observed due to al dwts dosing p 0 05 however al dwts enhanced the ultimate removal of these compound by only 5 10 comparing to the control sewer at the end of 6 hr in comparison to fe dwts dosing the removal difference observed for these compounds due to al dwts dosing are limited the remaining compounds 12 compounds that are non degradable in the control sewer had no significant impact due to either fe dwts or al dwts dosing unmarked and marked as underlined in fig 3 among these compounds carbamazepine sucralose and hydrochlorothiazide are significantly higher than the control sewer due to fe dwts dosing this high concentration could be due to the subnatant used for mixing the sludge based on the concentration of these compounds in the fe dwts sludge mix table s4 the dilution inside the sewer might contribute about 13 3 carbamazepine 17 4 sucralose and 10 hydrochlorothiazide increase to the initial mp concentration of wastewater in the experimental sewer pipe similarly during trial 2 the al dwts dosing to the experimental sewer might contribute about 4 2 tramadol 12 5 gabapentin 21 8 desvenlafaxine and 20 fluconazole increase to the initial concentration of wastewater thus the increase of these concentrations in the experimental sewer were mainly due to the dosing of dwts 3 5 role of adsorption to fe dwts in the rapid removal of mps 3 5 1 properties of fe dwts before and after dosed to sewers the raw fe dwts sludge showed lots of irregular shaped particles in clusters on sem image fig s2 similar to observations for fe dwts in previous studies muruganandham et al 2007 zhu et al 2019 after dosing into the sewer the suspended particles collected at the end of the trial 1 experiment showed clustered nanocrystalline partciles with the floc like structures the particles might be mackinawite fes formed by the precipitation of iron with sulfide in wastewater jeong et al 2007 wolthers et al 2005 eds elemental mapping analysis further confirmed that iron and oxygen were the main composition of raw fe dwts before dosing to the sewer lines fig s3 the elemental composition of the particles formed in the experimental line during trial 1 was donimnated by iron and sulfur the calculated fe s atomic ratio was between 0 8 and 1 1 table s8 which suggests the speciation of the particles as fes similar elemental composition of iron and sulfur were not observed in the suspended particles collected from the control line fig s3 xrd analysis also identified the mineral form of particles collected from the experimental line as iron sulfide clearly theta angle positions of the peaks from 10 to 100 corroborate mackinawite fes as one of the particles formed along with some ferric oxy hydroxides and ferrous sulfates fig s4 no fes was observed on the raw fe dwts before dosed into the sewers 3 5 2 adsorption of mps to fes this study finds the additional benefit of dosing fe dwts i e the removal of 9 out of 28 compounds mps from the liquid phase in the sewer network this initial rapid removal could be attributed to the adsorption of mps to fes particles formed due to the dosing of fe dwts in the rising main sewers in this study nearly 67 4 and 64 removal within an hour for venlafaxine and codeine were observed with the dosing of fe dwts this is much higher than the 2 7 12 and 5 sorption of venlafaxine and codeine respectively to the suspended particulate matter in wastewater baker et al 2012 ftir spectrometry of the suspended particles collected in the experimental sewer during trial 1 showed the appearance of a number of characteristic peaks on the surface of iron particles in comparison to the raw fe dwts section s5 these characteristic peaks were the indicative of the aromatic primary and tertiary amine groups interestingly the compounds that showed a rapid removal contain two or three tertiary amine functional groups attached to their structure table s1 this supports the observed mp removal is due to adsorption onto the iron sulfide particles our previous study showed that iron speciation other than fes had negligible effect on the adsorption of mps in sewer reactors kulandaivelu et al 2019 thus the adsorption of mps onto iron sulfide particles is responsible for the initial fast removal of those organic mp compounds with amine functional groups the sorption could be a physical sorption vander walls force or h bond sharing or chemisorption forming covalent or ionic bonds for instance venlafaxine log kow 3 2 mirtazapine log kow 3 0 and fexofenadine log kow 2 8 are slightly non polar and the sorption is mostly due to the physical sorption or surface complexation on the fes particles the other rapidly removed compounds are polar with low log kow value table s1 and hence the sorption could be chemisorption forming chemical bonds on the surface of fes particles also the correlation showed that log kow compared to other properties of the compound correlates positively with the removal observed during trial 1 due to the dosing of fe dwts fig s1 the extent of removal observed in the pilot scale sewers dosed with fe dwts is primarily comparable to that in the lab scale sewer reactors dosed with ferric chloride kulandaivelu et al 2019 however the removal of atenolol carbamazepine and acesulfame in the pilot sewer is lower kulandaivelu et al 2019 the lower removal is likely due to the lower production of fes particles by a single dose of fe dwts in the pilot sewer in contrast to the continuous ferric dosing in the lab scale rising main sewer kulandaivelu et al 2019 it has been shown that the mp removal is proportional to the fes particle concentration kulandaivelu et al 2019 it is reasonable to expect higher removal of atenolol carbamazepine and acesulfame when fe dwts is continuously discharged to sewers 4 implications this study for the first time showed that fe dwts dosing in sewers led to significant removal of some organic mps from the liquid phase within 1 hr many of these mps are reported to be recalcitrant to the conventional wastewater treatment processes and the occurrence of these organic mps in the aquatic environment is well documented kristofco and brooks 2017 van der grinten et al 2010 these mps usually occurring in mixtures have endocrine disrupting effects on the zebra fish liver cells gust et al 2013 pomati et al 2007 toxic effects on oyster larvae due to venlafaxine di poi et al 2018 and algal toxicity on cyanobacteria due to trimethoprim van der grinten et al 2010 the occurrence of ranitidine fexofenadine and cetirizine is also hazardous to the aquatic life kristofco and brooks 2017 the removal of these mps in the sewer network is adding value to the downstream wwtp by removing them from the influent wastewater and has the potential to reduce the discharge of mps to the aquatic environment in addition fe dwts is the waste by product of drinking water production and it demands cost effective treatment and disposal the annual cost of disposing the dwts was reported as 30 40 million in the netherlands horth et al 1994 the cost of sludge disposal varied between 10 and 20 of the total operating cost in a new zealand plant verrelli 2008 discharging this waste by product into the sewers is highly attractive economically the total saving of 20 500 96 500 per annum in a 17 mgd capacity treatment plant excluding the sludge storage and dosing facility was reported while discharging the dwts in sewers edwards et al 1997 furthermore the discharge of dwts to sewers can be exploited for sulfide control in the sewer system sun et al 2015b previous studies showed that the fes produced in the sewer network will be reactivated in the treatment plant for the phosphorus removal and hydrogen sulfide emission control in the anaerobic digester this study revealed one additional benefit in the removal of mps from the wastewater due to adsorption to fes particles the potential formation of fes particles in the sewers and its associated downstream multiple benefits makes the discharge of dwts to the sewers as an economically viable option compared to using it as an secondary or tertiary treatment method also as discussed in section 3 4 the ultimate removal of mps that are adsorbed to fes remained constant after 1 hr indicating the negligible desorption of these mps in sewers hence future research should focus on understanding the fate and degradation of mps attached to fes when entering the downstream wwtp 5 conclusion in this study the impact of dosing fe dwts and al dwts on the removal of 28 intrinsic organic micropollutants from wastewater was investigated in a pilot rising main sewer the key conclusions are the fe dwts dosing in the pilot rising main sewer was efficient in removing the dissolved sulfides whereas al dwts was effective for the removal of dissolved phosphates from wastewater the fe dwts dosed to the pilot sewer had a rapid removal of certain mps in particular the compounds with amine functional groups i e mirtazapine amisulpride ranitidine venlafaxine codeine cetirizine fexofenadine trimethoprim and atenolol within 1 hr in the pilot rising main sewer the rapid removal of these mps with amine functional groups is likely due to the adsorption onto the fes particles formed by the discharging of fe dwts in sewers such a rapid removal of these mps was not observed for the al dwts dosing seven biodegradable mps including paracetamol caffeine metformin paraxanthine cephalexin cyclamate and miaa were not affected by either sludge dosing this is consistent with the negligible impact on the sewer biofilm activity other mps such as cotinine hydroxycotinine tramadol gabapentin desvenlafaxine hydrochlorothiazide carbamazepine fluconazole sulfamethoxazole acesulfame saccharin and sucralose were neither degraded nor impacted by the dosing of both fe dwts and al dwts in the pilot rising main sewer system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

17857,co digestion of food waste with sewage sludge is widely applied for waste stabilization and energy recovery around the world however the effect of solid retention time srt on the microbial population dynamics metabolism and interspecies interaction have not been fully elucidated here the influence of srts 5 25 days on the performance of the co digestion system was investigated and state of the art genome centric metagenomic analysis was employed to uncover the dynamics and metabolic network of the key players underlying the well functioned and poorly functioned co digestion microbial communities the results of the microbial analyses indicated that srt largely shaped microbial community structure by enriching the syntrophic specialist syntrophomonas and co2 h2 formate using methanogen methanocorpusculum in the well functioned co digester operated at srt of 25 days while selecting acid tolerant populations lactobacillus at srt of 5 days the metagenome assembled genomes mags of key players such as syntrophomonadaceae methanocorpusculum and mesotoga were retrieved additionally the syntrophic acetate oxidation plus hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm were proposed as the dominant pathway for methane production the metabolic interaction in the co digestion microbial consortia was profiled by assigning mags into functional guilds functional redundancy was found in the bacterial groups in hydrolysis step and the members in these groups reduced the direct competition by niche differentiation graphical abstract image 1 keywords solid retention time metagenome assembled genomes co digester microbial communities metabolic interaction 1 introduction nowadays food waste fw is a huge challenge in many big cities in the world especially for the megacity like hong kong where there are more than 3500 tonnes food waste generated per day govhk epd 2019 in addition to landfill and composting for fw disposal anaerobic digestion ad is a microbe mediated biotechnology widely applied for energy recovery and waste reduction stabilization mata alvarez et al 2000 vanwonterghem et al 2014b co digestion a process that exploits microbial ability to anaerobically digest food waste with other types of organics such as sewage sludge manure etc has been reported as a promising solution to improve both the process stability and bioenergy recovery efficiency de vrieze et al 2015 jang et al 2015 noutsopoulos et al 2013 quiroga et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 solid retention time srt as a crucial operational parameter plays an important role in keeping the functional microbial groups in balance maintaining the community activity increasing the efficiency of releasing the organics from the solid wastes to liquid phase and timely converting digested intermediates toc vfas to final products mainly methane de vrieze and verstraete 2016 for ad process the empirical srt in anaerobic digestion varies due to the different substrates applied for example 8 40 days is required to digest sewage sludge bolzonella et al 2005 mao et al 2015 a minimum of 10 days to degrade the solo cellulose vanwonterghem et al 2014a and 12 30 days to co digest fw with dewatered sludge with ratios ranged from 30 70 to 71 29 dai et al 2013 20 days for co digestion of fw with manure on two ratios 32 68 and 48 52 el mashad and zhang 2010 and 15 25 days for fw with mixed sewage sludge with ratio of 20 80 wang et al 2017 the previous studies mainly focused on the feasibility of the co digestion process by finding out the minimum srts however very limited research has been conducted on the microbial communities divergence shaped by varying srt conditions especially for the comparison between acidified co digesters operated at srt of 5 15 days and well functioned one with sufficient srt of 25 days in this study in addition to the comparison of overall performance between acidified co digesters and well functioned one the dynamics of the microbial community would be profiled by using 16s rrna gene based analysis including 1 the microbes which had been washed out or poorly functioned in the acidified co digesters were pinpointed and 2 the populations of particular interest including generalist robust existence in all srt operated co digesters and specialist indicators for certain srt conditions had been deciphered linking the microbial ecology features with the system functionality is crucial in optimizing the engineered system and developing strategies for the efficiently and stably operated anaerobic co digestion system cabrol et al 2017 therefore the metagenomics as a data related broad spectrum microscope was utilized to document the microbial information including but not limited to microbial community composition metabolic features of microbes and ecological niche partitioning in the environmental engineered system specifically the metagenome assembled genomes mags were retrieved from metagenomic sequences and genome centric method was incorporated to assign populations with function s during the digestion process for deciphering the interspecies interactions among microbial populations in summary analyses based on 16s rrna gene and metagenomics were employed to open the black boxes of co digesters and to provide clues for optimizing the co digestion process 2 materials and methods 2 1 co digester setup and operation the fw applied in this study was synthesized according to the method described by wang et al 2017 it consisted of 78 carbohydrates 16 proteins and 6 lipids of which composition was representative for the typical food waste generated in the urban area carucci et al 2005 redondas et al 2012 total solid ts content in this synthesized food waste was 21 and its vs volatile solids ts ratio was 98 the feeding sewage sludge fss applied in this study was the mixture of primary sludge and thickened secondary activated sludge with the volume ratio of 4 5 to 1 by referring to the actual operating parameter applied in tai po sewage treatment works stw in hong kong these two types of wastes fw and fss were mixed by the mass ratio of 40 60 ts ts and to be co digested under four srt conditions as the inoculum to start up the co digesters the digested sludge ds was sampled from the tai po stw and the inoculum feed v v ratio was of 2 1 the startup phase lasted for 7 days and all the four co digesters were operated with the same organic loading rate olr of 1 4 g vs l d the average methane yield and volatile solid reduction ratio were 560 43 ml g vsr and 40 1 in this phase respectively since day 8 four co digesters named as r1 r2 r3 and r4 with olr of 5 8 2 9 1 9 and 1 2 g vs l d were operated at srts of 5 10 15 and 25 days respectively 2 2 chemical analysis the physicochemical parameters monitored included 1 biogas volume and its composition in gas phase 2 total organic carbon toc and volatile fatty acids vfas as the fermentation by products detected in the supernatant in liquid phase and 3 ts and vs contents in the discharged digestate in solid phase these analyses were conducted for each feeding and discharging operation at an interval of 3 days the methods for these analyses had been well documented in our previous publications ju et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the overall performance of the co digesters was evaluated based on methane biogas yield vs reduction ratio vsr and concentrations of toc and vfas 2 3 dna extraction and sequencing the discharged digestate samples were fixed with 100 ethanol and stored at 20 c refrigerator and total dna was extracted from 1 0 ml of these samples by using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals france 16s rrna gene of twenty three digestate samples from different time points fig s2 during the whole operating period were amplified with the universal primer set 515f 806r targeting the v4 region caporaso et al 2011 additionally for each co digester two metagenomic datasets generated from the hiseqxten platform were co assembled using clc s de novo assembly algorithm clc genomics workbench version 11 clcbio qiagen with a k mer of 23 details on the binning process were described in supplementary information s3 2 4 community profiling and biomarker identification the quality control of 16s v4 raw reads was conducted by following miseq sop of the mothur v 1 39 package kozich et al 2013 and then qualified clean reads were imported into qiime v 1 9 1 for the open reference operational taxonomic units otus picking with 98 7 cutoff yarza et al 2014 core diversity analysis and taxon assignment of the picked otus using the most updated silva v 132 database quast et al 2013 with the intention of reducing bias caused by the rare otus the mother tables of the abundance of picked otus were pre filtered following the quality control steps i e 1 removing the two datasets sampled at the beginning 2 excluding the otus with less than 10 counts in a dataset and 3 rarefying the sequence depth to 65000 for each dataset the pre filtered mother tables were then imported into the galaxy platform http huttenhower sph harvard edu galaxy to determine the differential otus based on the linear discriminant effect size lefse method segata et al 2011 the α values for the factorial kruskal wallis test and pairwise wilcoxon test were both 0 05 feng et al 2018 and the threshold on the linear discriminant analysis lda score was set at 2 0 the microbial consortium from the well functioned co digester r4 was used as a reference group to pinpoint the biomarkers in the co digesters r1 r2 and r3 2 5 metagenome assembly population binning and phylogenetic tree two metagenomics datasets for each srt condition were co assembled into contigs and the raw reads from each individual dataset were mapped onto the assembled contigs to quantify the reads utilization efficiency table s3 the mags were retrieved by following the mmgenome workflow albertsen et al 2013 and the quality of mags completeness and contamination level was determined by using checkm v 1 0 11 parks et al 2015 gtdb tk v 0 3 2 parks et al 2018 and the newest database r04 rs89 released on 19th june 2019 was used for object taxonomic classification to mags based on concatenated protein phylogeny the relative abundance of mags was determined by employing coverm v 0 2 0 https github com wwood coverm which mapped metagenomic raw reads to mags with default setting 120 bacterial marker genes of the recovered bacterial mags and reference genomes from ncbi was identified and aligned following the gtdb tk classify workflow parks et al 2018 fasttree v 2 1 10 was then applied to infer the phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of the identified marker genes price et al 2009 in addition interactive tree of life itol https itol embl de was used for the tree annotation and interpretation letunic and bork 2016 2 6 functional annotation and metabolic network reconstruction of the mags the open reading frames orfs prediction of these mags was conducted by using prodigal v 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 for each mag genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes cazy were annotated by using hmmer v 3 2 1 finn et al 2011 against the hmm based cazy database dbcan v 7 yin et al 2012 an online script https github com yuboer genome centric portrait of cellulose hydrolysis was employed to identify and to summarize the cazy modules in each mag meanwhile the predicted orfs were uploaded to ghostkoala online annotation platform https www kegg jp ghostkoala updated on may 15th 2019 for functional gene annotation kanehisa et al 2016 a full reconstruction of the metabolic potential for each mag was based on the metabolic pathway annotated by ghostkoala for each mag a specific pathway shall be considered as comprised in it if 50 of genes involved in a metabolic pathway were detected in that mag the potential of substrate utilization for the mags and the carbon flow from sugars then to fatty acids last to methane were inferred generating the metabolic network of mags 3 results 3 1 srt differentiated co digestion performance for solid phase as shown in fig 1 a the average vsr of 32 33 39 and 47 were detected in co digesters r1 r2 r3 and r4 operated at srts of 5 10 15 and 25 days respectively vsr increased with srt demonstrating higher hydrolysis efficiency under longer srt for gas phase the methane yield varied significantly among co digesters an average value of 548 ml g vsr was detected in the well functioned co digester r4 which kept stable during whole operating period for the other three co digesters with srt of 5 15 days the values decreased along with operating period and finally dropped to 100 ml ch4 g vsr indicating the low efficiency of energy recovery if srt of the co digesters was less than 15 days the shorter srt applied in the co digesters quicker declining of the methane yield was observed the rapid onset of hydrolytic and acidogenic activities resulted in the accumulation of the toc mainly vfas reaching up to a concentration of 7000 mg l and mainly corresponding to the acetate propionate and butyrate this induced a drastic ph drop from 7 5 to less than 5 0 in the acidified co digesters operated at srts of 5 15 days and for the stably operated co digester r4 ph was kept in the methanogenic favorable range 6 8 7 5 and minor ph fluctuation was not an operating problem for the co digestion process fig 1d 3 2 srt differentiated microbial composition and biomarker taxa the principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on the weighted unifrac distance dissimilarities clearly showed that varying srt conditions shaped the divergence of microbial communities of the co digesters specifically the microbial communities were similar and clustered together circled in black at the beginning but the dissimilarities among microbial communities from different co digesters increased after varying srt conditions applied highlighted in multiple colored squares fig 2 a the biomarkers suggested by lefse analysis explained the effect in differentiating the overall performance of co digesters operated at varying srt conditions fig 2b c and d as summarized in table 1 the identified biomarkers accounted for at least 23 and reached up to 67 of the total reads in the varying srt conditions indicating that these otus could be the appropriate markers for distinguishing the overall performance of microbe driven co digesters and these biomarkers also increased the resolution at the population as otu level in profiling the communities divergence of different co digesters the g methanocorpuculum 1 4 g syntrophomonas 4 6 f rikenellaceae 6 5 f anaerolineaceae 3 5 and g mesotoga 4 4 were pinpointed as the biomarkers in the well functioned co digester r4 as the biomarkers in the extremely acidified co digester r1 g bifidobacterium two g lactobacillus and f flavobacteriaceae populations were detected in high relative abundance levels 8 5 7 7 7 4 and 5 3 respectively explaining the difference of performance between r1 and r4 noticeably the population f eubacteriaceae robustly existed in all four co digesters with minimum abundance of 4 7 in the 5d srt co digester but specially enriched in the co digesters with srt of 10 15 days 22 3 in r2 and 34 9 in r3 besides the srt of 10 15 days also favored the enrichment of g prevotella 19 2 in r2 and 15 6 in r3 and the population was identified as the biomarker in both co digesters r2 and r3 table s2 based on the results obtained from the analyses of microbial community s composition and biomarker identification here two questions to be further answered are 1 what were interspecies interactions in the co digestion microbial consortia e g mutualism competition 2 whether microbial composition mattered to the co digestion system processes e g hydrolysis process could be proceeded regardless varying srt conditions 3 3 microbial metabolic interaction in srt differentiated co digesters 90 mags were retrieved by using the sequence based multi dimensional coverage binning method additionally the 16s rrna gene representative sequences otus was extracted for presenting the abundant relative abundance 0 1 populations to blast against the whole genome database 91 621 genomes in total of ncbi and those genomes with 100 similarity and 100 enquiry coverage of these 16s sequences were retrieved as their corresponding genomes this process aimed at improving the percentage of populations which could be explained by using both the direct retrieved mags from metagenomic assembled reads and the recovered genomes based on 16s rrna gene representative sequence blasting result in the whole co digestion microbial communities as a result 6 genomes were recovered and resulted in total 96 genomes of sizes from 1 1 to 4 9 mb the taxon assignment for these 96 mags was realized by using gtdb tk v 0 3 2 and mags were named as the lowest taxon level assigned these 96 mags were mainly phylogenetically affiliated into 8 bacterial phyla of actinobacteriota bacteroidota chloroflexota firmicutes proteobacteria spirochaetota thermotogota and verrucomicrobiota fig 3 and 1 archaeal phylum euryarchaeota fig s3 to avoid annotation mistakes induced by the highly contaminated mags 80 mags were selected as the qualified ones with 50 completeness and 10 contamination table s4 and fig s3 b for further metabolic study the genetic capacity of these qualified 80 mags were classified into four groups based on the numbers of the specific gene count in their genomes namely group i 1 count group ii 2 5 counts group iii 6 10 counts and group iv 11 counts fig 4 and fig s4 more genes in their genomes represented the higher genetic capacity in summary large proportions of populations 79 of 80 mags had genes encoding glycoside hydrolysis families ghs for degrading various carbohydrates 94 for cellulose 90 for cellobiose 79 for hemicellulose 94 for oligosaccharides and 89 for starch but only 31 for chitin after carbohydrates were hydrolyzed to glucose 23 mags in the phyla of actinobacteriota 3 bacteroidota 4 firmicutes 3 proteobacteria 6 spirochaetota 1 and thermotogota 6 had genetic potential of fermenting glucose to produce butyrate and these butyrate producing bacteria took up to 26 3 relative abundance in well functioned co digester especially the four mesotoga populations s mesotoga 1 3 4 5 with their total relative abundance of 19 6 could work in butyrate generation through lysine pathway 13 mags in the phyla of actinobacteriota 1 bacteroidota 9 and proteobacteria 3 were pinpointed as the potential propionate producers via succinate pathway two proteobacteria populations and one firmicutes mags could generate propionate through l lactate and l lactaldehyde respectively the relative abundance of propionate producing populations demonstrated decreasing trend with srts 4 8 in the 25d srt operated co digester and up to 13 8 in the 5d srt operated co digester reduced chemicals such as butyrate and propionate could be further oxidized to acetate h2 co2 and formate by the syntrophic bacteria in the scenario in which h2 concentration was low vanwonterghem et al 2016 in the acetogenic stage 41 mags had genes encoding for both the acetate kinase ack and phosphate acetyltransferase pta which were essential enzymes in catalyzing the acetate production besides 25 bacterial mags were identified being involved in h2 metabolism affiliating to the phyla of bacteroidota 12 proteobacteria 6 firmicutes 2 chloroflexota 3 spirochaetota 1 and verrucomicrobiota 1 18 bacterial populations from the phyla of bacteroidota 12 chloroflexota 3 firmicutes 2 and proteobacteria 1 were inferred to participate in formate formation and the h2 and formate producing populations took up to 6 0 and 9 6 relative abundance in the 25d srt operated co digester fig 4 shows the metabolic interspecies interactions in the well functioned co digester in details mags such as s mesotoga 1 3 4 5 f anaerolineaceae hydrolyzed varying carbohydrates to generate glucose then glucose was utilized by the fermentative bacteria e g s mesotoga 1 3 4 5 f eubacteriaceae to generate butyrate and at the same time some populations such as f eubacteriaceae f rhodobacteraceae o rhodospirillales a 1 2 and o bacteriodales 6 fermented glucose to produce propionate in the stage of acetogensis mags e g s mesotoga 1 2 3 4 5 f eubacteriaceae and o bacteroidales 4 functioned in acetate generation one archaeal mag s methanocorpulsculum utilized h2 co2 or formate produced by mags f syntrophomonadaceae o bacteriodales 6 8 etc to generate ch4 the low concentration of acetate was detected implying the high acetate turnover in the 25d srt operated co digester two reasons of high acetate turnover were speculated 1 the acetoclastic methanogens efficiently worked in timely converting acetate to methane and or 2 the acetate was oxidized by certain bacteria the microbial composition indicated that the acetoclastic methanogenesis was not the predominant pathway in well functioned co digester because that 1 no acetoclastic methanogen s mag was retrieved and 2 extremely low relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogens 0 4 was detected based on 16s rrna gene analysis so the high level of acetate turnover was accomplished by the syntrophic acetate oxidation sao process four marker genes acsbcd and ftfhs mosbæk et al 2016 and the gene encoding for co dehydrogenase can et al 2014 were employed to pinpoint the potential populations involved sao process who would oxidize acetate through reductive acetyl coa pathway the f eubacteriaceae was ascertained as a sao bacterium with the full set of genes and this population accounted for 1 4 and 4 3 relative abundance in 25d srt and 15d srt co digesters another h2 formate providers for hydrogenotrophic methanogen might be the three mesotoga populations including s mesotoga 1 2 4 it had been documented that mesotoga populations were speculated to be involved in syntrophic acetate oxidation in a potential alternative syntrophic acetate degradation pathway nobu et al 2015 with genes encoding both glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate pathway however the formate dehydrolyase complex was not found in mesotoga genomes in this study suggesting that these populations might be capable to oxidize acetate to produce formate but unable to further covert formate to co2 and h2 as the mutualist beneficial partner one hydrogenotrophic methanogenic mag s methanocorpusculum had the complete set of genes required for methane production via co2 h2 or formate pathway and its relative abundance was 0 8 in the 25d srt operated co digester the syntrophic interaction between h2 formate producing bacteria and h2 formate utilizing archaea was the rate limiting but key step for an efficient co digestion process the relative abundance of key functional groups h2 formate specialist syntrophic bacteria f syntrophomonadaceae and methanogen s methanocorpusculum were 0 01 in the acidified co digesters the methane yield in these acidified co digesters were less than 100 ml ch4 g vsr in addition the relative abundance of three speculated mesotoga sao bacteria was 0 1 demonstrating the less efficient turnover of acetate in the acidified co digesters at the same time acetate accumulation was observed in all acidified co digesters especially for the co digesters operated at srt of 10 15 days the concentration reached up to 4000 mg l it could be found that some mags could play multiple roles during the co digestion process suggesting that they had high level of metabolic versatility for example s mesotoga 1 3 4 5 o nanopelagicales 3 and f eubacteriaceae had both hydrolytic and fermentative genetic capacities fig 4 3 4 functional gene redundancy and niche differentiation of mags in srt differentiated co digestion consortia functional gene redundancy was observed in microbial consortium certain functions such as hydrolysis and acetogenesis could be implemented by many microbes without phylogenetic closed relationships for example a large portion of populations in microbial community were identified as hydrolyzers fig s4 and table s5 and half of the microbes had functional genes encoding for acetate production suggesting the high level of functional gene redundancy amani et al 2010 vanwonterghem et al 2016 with the intention to pinpoint the potential major hydrolyzers and to visualize the shift of hydrolytic populations in srt differentiated co digesters here the relative abundance of mags was multiplied with the number of genes for each gh to reflect their total contributions in hydrolysis since the population with more genes encoding gh in its genome and had higher relative abundance in the consortia may contribute more in hydrolyzing substrates as shown in fig 5 the major hydrolyzers and their substrate based hydrolytic contribution were altered by srt conditions in the well functioned co digester the most influential hydrolysers were s mesotoga 5 followed by s mesotoga 4 and s mesotoga 3 not only for the degradation of cellulose but also for starch oligosaccharides and cellobiose and one chloroflexota mag f anaerolineaceae played an important role in hydrolyzing five carbohydrates mainly for starch oligosaccharides and cellobiose the main hydrolyzers in the acidified co digesters operated at srt from 10 to 15 days were one firmicutes mag f eubacteriaceae three bacteroidota mags g prevotella 1 g prevotella 2 and s prevotella 1 in the 5d srt co digester the hydrolysis was mainly conducted by one actinobacteriota mag o nanopelagicales 3 one firmicutes s lactobacillus and one bacteroidota mag f flavobacteriaceae 3 based on the competitive exclusion principle cole 1960 two microbes with exactly same ecological niche could not be able to stably co exist in the community especially for populations with a close phylogenetic relationship violle et al 2011 there should be a niche resource differentiation among the species with overlapped sources at varying environmental conditions for example two sphaerochaetaceae populations demonstrated varying hydrolyzing behaviors in srt differentiated co digesters f sphaerochaetaceae 3 competed over f sphaerochaetaceae 2 in the 10d srt operated co digester but the later gained advantages and played a crucial role in degrading cellobiose and oligosaccharides in the 15d srt operated co digester for three phylogeny closed populations s prevotella 1 s prevotella 2 and s prevotella 3 made a great contribution in hemicellulose and oligosaccharides degradation in the 15d srt operated co digester but only s prevotella 1 made hydrolytic contribution for hemicellulose and oligosaccharides degradation in srt 10d and srt 5d co digesters the rest two microbes had less impact in other acidified co digesters fig 5 the s prevotella 3 was observed to hydrolyze oligosaccharides and hemicellulose in 10d srt co digester but s prevotella 2 competed over s prevotella 3 in the co digesters operated with longer srt of 25 days the reason for the co existence of these potential competing populations may be the different sugars membrane transport mechanisms employed by them such as abc transporters and phosphotransferase systems pts fig 6 the starch could be hydrolyzed in 3 steps 1 extracellular hydrolysis of starch to yield maltose 2 transport extracellular maltose to cytosol abc transporter and or pts 3 intracellular hydrolysis of maltose by phospho alpha glucosidase malh and or maltose phosphorylase malp mala to yield glucose gänzle and follador 2012 specifically starch composed of amylose and amylopectin could be hydrolyzed by amylase and pullulanase to produce maltose and glucose 32 mags were specialized in amylose hydrolysis by using amylase 18 populations could genetically work in amylopectin hydrolysis by employing pullulanase and there were 15 mags worked in starch hydrolysis having genes encoding for both two enzymes then the extracellular maltose would be transported to cytosol by 5 thermotogota mags s mesotoga 2 3 4 5 and f petrotogaceae seven mags could hydrolyze intracellular maltose such as s lactobacillus could synthesize both enzymes malh and mala malp f eubacteriaceae could hydrolyze maltose under the catalysis of malh and the rest 4 mags f favobacteriaceae 1 2 3 f cyclobacteriaceae 2 and f s aprospiraceae 1 were specialized in converting maltose to glucose under the catalysis of mala malp another major type of carbohydrates oligosaccharides could be hydrolyzed by 75 populations based on the cazy annotation result sucrose major disaccharides of oligosaccharides was consisting of glucose and fructose the hydrolysis of sucrose could happen in both extracellular and intracellular environments 1 extracellular hydrolysis of sucrose was catalyzed by levansucrase ftfa to yield one glucose and one fructose 2 intracellular hydrolysis of sucrose was a 2 step process the extracellular sucrose was firstly transported into the cytosol then further be hydrolyzed by sucrose phosphorylase scrp and or fructo furanosidase saca gänzle and follador 2012 in the present study the gene encoding for ftfa was detected in s streptococcus 3 for extracellular hydrolysis of sucrose 6 mags had whole set of genes for membrane transport of extracellular sucrose and intracellular hydrolysis namely g olsenella s streptococcus 1 2 3 o thermomicrobiales 3 and f eubacteriaceae further investigation on the mechanisms incorporated in these 6 mags revealed that theses populations reduce the potential competition by employing different transport strategies specifically the g olsenella could employ both two mechanisms msmefg msmk and pts1bca s streptococcus 1 2 and o thermomicrobiales 3 utilized abc transporters and the rest two populations adopted ptsibca for sucrose uptake fructose the product of sucrose hydrolysis could be transported by 3 mags to cytosol and 23 mags had gene encoding for xylose isomerase xyla functioning in converting fructose to glucose one mag f rhodobacteraceae had full set of genes encoding for the enzymes catalyzing for uptake extracellular fructose and conversion to glucose 5 mags had full set of genes encoding for extracellular cellobiose uptake and intracellular hydrolysis in the microbial consortia namely g olsenella f eubacteriaceae c bacilli 4 f sphaerochaetaceae 2 4 but former 2 mags were also able to hydrolyze sucrose demonstrating that these two populations had high level of metabolic versatility of carbohydrates hydrolysis interestingly some mags preferred to transport extracellular glucose to cytosol and the relative abundance of these populations showed increasing trend with srt from 0 7 to 11 1 in the co digesters with srt from 5 days to 25 days 4 discussion for the well functioned co digester r4 in this study the measured methane yield was 548 ml ch4 g vsr on average which was consistent with our previous study 376 595 ml ch4 g vsr in the co digestion of food waste and sewage sludge wang et al 2017 srt a crucial operational parameter played an important role in ensuring the operational stability of the system it had been documented that if the srt shortened from 25 to 13 days the process was inhibited with accumulation of toc and the methane yield declined salminen and rintala 2002 which had also been observed in the acidified co digesters r1 r3 in this study the quick ph drop was because of toc mainly vfas accumulation 5000 7000 mg l propionate and acetate accumulation were reported in replicate mesophilic reactors operated at short srt of 12 days vanwonterghem et al 2015 which was observed in the acidified co digesters with srt from 5 to 15 days of the present study as shown in fig s1 the occurrence of butyrate accumulation along with the rise of acetate concentration was detected in co digesters operated at srts of 10 and 15 days it had been found that butyrate degradation seemed to be affected by the acetate pool ahring et al 2001 microbial composition and its functional traits are of great importance to ensure the engineered system service cabrol et al 2017 therefore the study of microbial community dynamics and interspecies interaction were crucial for the co digestion system especially the balance and close trophic interaction between acid producing bacteria and acid consuming microbes ensured the stability of the co digestion system chen et al 2018 salminen and rintala 2002 in the co digester operated at sufficient srt condition some bacteria such as megasphaera elsdenii for consuming excess lactate and syntrophobacter fumaroxidans known as propionate degrader ohnishi et al 2010 xing et al 2008 made contribution in ensuring the ecosystem service by timely oxidizing fatty acids and preventing their accumulation in this study f syntrophomonadaceae was identified with the genetic capacities to producing formate and h2 additionally four populations f eubacteriaceae and three mesotoga populations s mesotoga 1 2 4 was speculated as sao bacteria working in acetate oxidization to generate formate simultaneously the hydrogenotrophic methanogen s methanocorpusculum utilized h2 and formate to produce methane ensuring the stability of the co digestion system same with previous study that the syntrophic acetate oxidization and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was proposed as the major methanogenic pathway in the thermophilic cellulose degrading co digester lü et al 2014 while in the acidified co digesters shorter srt conditions caused drastic ph drop inhibited the processes of acetogensis and methanogenesis made hydrolysis and acidification processes prevailed at the same time the microbial community was shaped by washing out the populations with longer generation time and sensitive to dramatic ph fluctuation e g f syntrophomonadaceae s methanocorpusculum and selectively enriching the acid tolerant species such as s lactobacillus with metabolic capacity of fermentation to produce lactate john et al 2006 it also been observed that the drastic decrease of relative abundance of microbes functioned in co2 and h2 production and syntrophic acetate oxidization when srt decreased from 30 days to 10 days fitamo et al 2017 due to the inhibition caused by the low ph and the missing of the keystone microbes the trophic interaction especially for syntrophic interaction in these acidified co digesters were hindered resulting in the failure of the co digestion system based on the results of overall performance and microbial metabolic interspecies interaction from the acidified co digesters acetogensis and methanogenesis were hindered but the hydrolysis and acidification processes were proceeded the carbohydrates hydrolysis happened in all four co digesters regardless srt conditions called functional similarity of microbial communities allison and martiny 2008 which was also been found in the digester of cellulose decomposition wohl et al 2004 two reasons explained the functional similarity of hydrolysis in this study 1 the taxa contained in varying communities were of functionally redundant e g functional genes for hydrolysis were widely detected in the microbial consortia and 2 the community would function differently but resulted in the similar process rate when incorporated at the community level such as the shift of major hydrolytic populations and their preferred substrates in srt differentiated co digesters the above two reasons were also been found in the methanogenic bioreactors in which the communities with different microbial composition but functioned similarly fernandez et al 2000 functional gene redundancy was one of the reasons in ensuring hydrolysis proceeded in srt differentiated reactors wohl et al 2004 the niche differentiation was the mechanism in reducing the direct competition among microbes with overlapped habitat or source in a closed and constant environment in the present study though hydrolytic populations such as f eubacteriaceae and s mesotoga 3 shared similar carbohydrates sources fig 5 but they might employ varied carbohydrates uptake mechanisms and metabolic pathways for example the s mesotoga 3 had genes encoding both amylase and pullulanase for extracellular starch hydrolysis abc transporter for transport extracellular maltose and sucrose to cytosol it also could transport extracellular glucose to cytosol for subsequent metabolic activity which function could not be carried out by f eubacteriaceae due to the absence of the functional genes but f eubacteriaceae was able to uptake extracellular cellobiose to cytosol and to conduct intracellular cellobiose hydrolysis under catalysis of β glucosidase which could not be accomplished by the mag s mesotoga 3 fig 6 the limitations in this study was the accurate assigning functions to mags because of 1 the genome quality of mags 2 the noise caused by the functional gene redundancy observed in some mags 3 the limited existing annotation database such limitation could be overcome in the coming future with new technical developments firstly long reads sequencing e g pacbio nanopore would enable us to improve the resolution of the microbial consortia by retrieving more genomes with high quality additionally metatranscriptomic and metaproteomics combined with metagenomics could be powerful tools for providing direct and solid evidence to ascertain the genetic functions of the retrieved mags by reducing the noises caused by functional gene redundancy of microbes lastly more validated and updated database will make a difference in unraveling the black box of the anaerobic process and reveal the microbial ecology in this engineered system 5 conclusion sufficient srt condition was required for a stable operated co digestion system the main features of microbial analysis in the well functioned co digester were 1 the complementarity of distinct hydrolytic microbial groups to hydrolyze the varying substrates 2 the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in association with syntrophic microbes both h2 producing bacteria f syntrophomonadaceae and putative acetate oxidizing bacteria f eubacteriaceae and three mesotoga populations additionally functional gene redundancy especially for the genes encoding for enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis activity and functional similarity of microbial communities in srt differentiated co digesters were observed in this study varying uptake and metabolic mechanisms of carbohydrates employed by the hydrolytic populations were the niche differentiation observed in the

17857,co digestion of food waste with sewage sludge is widely applied for waste stabilization and energy recovery around the world however the effect of solid retention time srt on the microbial population dynamics metabolism and interspecies interaction have not been fully elucidated here the influence of srts 5 25 days on the performance of the co digestion system was investigated and state of the art genome centric metagenomic analysis was employed to uncover the dynamics and metabolic network of the key players underlying the well functioned and poorly functioned co digestion microbial communities the results of the microbial analyses indicated that srt largely shaped microbial community structure by enriching the syntrophic specialist syntrophomonas and co2 h2 formate using methanogen methanocorpusculum in the well functioned co digester operated at srt of 25 days while selecting acid tolerant populations lactobacillus at srt of 5 days the metagenome assembled genomes mags of key players such as syntrophomonadaceae methanocorpusculum and mesotoga were retrieved additionally the syntrophic acetate oxidation plus hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm were proposed as the dominant pathway for methane production the metabolic interaction in the co digestion microbial consortia was profiled by assigning mags into functional guilds functional redundancy was found in the bacterial groups in hydrolysis step and the members in these groups reduced the direct competition by niche differentiation graphical abstract image 1 keywords solid retention time metagenome assembled genomes co digester microbial communities metabolic interaction 1 introduction nowadays food waste fw is a huge challenge in many big cities in the world especially for the megacity like hong kong where there are more than 3500 tonnes food waste generated per day govhk epd 2019 in addition to landfill and composting for fw disposal anaerobic digestion ad is a microbe mediated biotechnology widely applied for energy recovery and waste reduction stabilization mata alvarez et al 2000 vanwonterghem et al 2014b co digestion a process that exploits microbial ability to anaerobically digest food waste with other types of organics such as sewage sludge manure etc has been reported as a promising solution to improve both the process stability and bioenergy recovery efficiency de vrieze et al 2015 jang et al 2015 noutsopoulos et al 2013 quiroga et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 solid retention time srt as a crucial operational parameter plays an important role in keeping the functional microbial groups in balance maintaining the community activity increasing the efficiency of releasing the organics from the solid wastes to liquid phase and timely converting digested intermediates toc vfas to final products mainly methane de vrieze and verstraete 2016 for ad process the empirical srt in anaerobic digestion varies due to the different substrates applied for example 8 40 days is required to digest sewage sludge bolzonella et al 2005 mao et al 2015 a minimum of 10 days to degrade the solo cellulose vanwonterghem et al 2014a and 12 30 days to co digest fw with dewatered sludge with ratios ranged from 30 70 to 71 29 dai et al 2013 20 days for co digestion of fw with manure on two ratios 32 68 and 48 52 el mashad and zhang 2010 and 15 25 days for fw with mixed sewage sludge with ratio of 20 80 wang et al 2017 the previous studies mainly focused on the feasibility of the co digestion process by finding out the minimum srts however very limited research has been conducted on the microbial communities divergence shaped by varying srt conditions especially for the comparison between acidified co digesters operated at srt of 5 15 days and well functioned one with sufficient srt of 25 days in this study in addition to the comparison of overall performance between acidified co digesters and well functioned one the dynamics of the microbial community would be profiled by using 16s rrna gene based analysis including 1 the microbes which had been washed out or poorly functioned in the acidified co digesters were pinpointed and 2 the populations of particular interest including generalist robust existence in all srt operated co digesters and specialist indicators for certain srt conditions had been deciphered linking the microbial ecology features with the system functionality is crucial in optimizing the engineered system and developing strategies for the efficiently and stably operated anaerobic co digestion system cabrol et al 2017 therefore the metagenomics as a data related broad spectrum microscope was utilized to document the microbial information including but not limited to microbial community composition metabolic features of microbes and ecological niche partitioning in the environmental engineered system specifically the metagenome assembled genomes mags were retrieved from metagenomic sequences and genome centric method was incorporated to assign populations with function s during the digestion process for deciphering the interspecies interactions among microbial populations in summary analyses based on 16s rrna gene and metagenomics were employed to open the black boxes of co digesters and to provide clues for optimizing the co digestion process 2 materials and methods 2 1 co digester setup and operation the fw applied in this study was synthesized according to the method described by wang et al 2017 it consisted of 78 carbohydrates 16 proteins and 6 lipids of which composition was representative for the typical food waste generated in the urban area carucci et al 2005 redondas et al 2012 total solid ts content in this synthesized food waste was 21 and its vs volatile solids ts ratio was 98 the feeding sewage sludge fss applied in this study was the mixture of primary sludge and thickened secondary activated sludge with the volume ratio of 4 5 to 1 by referring to the actual operating parameter applied in tai po sewage treatment works stw in hong kong these two types of wastes fw and fss were mixed by the mass ratio of 40 60 ts ts and to be co digested under four srt conditions as the inoculum to start up the co digesters the digested sludge ds was sampled from the tai po stw and the inoculum feed v v ratio was of 2 1 the startup phase lasted for 7 days and all the four co digesters were operated with the same organic loading rate olr of 1 4 g vs l d the average methane yield and volatile solid reduction ratio were 560 43 ml g vsr and 40 1 in this phase respectively since day 8 four co digesters named as r1 r2 r3 and r4 with olr of 5 8 2 9 1 9 and 1 2 g vs l d were operated at srts of 5 10 15 and 25 days respectively 2 2 chemical analysis the physicochemical parameters monitored included 1 biogas volume and its composition in gas phase 2 total organic carbon toc and volatile fatty acids vfas as the fermentation by products detected in the supernatant in liquid phase and 3 ts and vs contents in the discharged digestate in solid phase these analyses were conducted for each feeding and discharging operation at an interval of 3 days the methods for these analyses had been well documented in our previous publications ju et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the overall performance of the co digesters was evaluated based on methane biogas yield vs reduction ratio vsr and concentrations of toc and vfas 2 3 dna extraction and sequencing the discharged digestate samples were fixed with 100 ethanol and stored at 20 c refrigerator and total dna was extracted from 1 0 ml of these samples by using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals france 16s rrna gene of twenty three digestate samples from different time points fig s2 during the whole operating period were amplified with the universal primer set 515f 806r targeting the v4 region caporaso et al 2011 additionally for each co digester two metagenomic datasets generated from the hiseqxten platform were co assembled using clc s de novo assembly algorithm clc genomics workbench version 11 clcbio qiagen with a k mer of 23 details on the binning process were described in supplementary information s3 2 4 community profiling and biomarker identification the quality control of 16s v4 raw reads was conducted by following miseq sop of the mothur v 1 39 package kozich et al 2013 and then qualified clean reads were imported into qiime v 1 9 1 for the open reference operational taxonomic units otus picking with 98 7 cutoff yarza et al 2014 core diversity analysis and taxon assignment of the picked otus using the most updated silva v 132 database quast et al 2013 with the intention of reducing bias caused by the rare otus the mother tables of the abundance of picked otus were pre filtered following the quality control steps i e 1 removing the two datasets sampled at the beginning 2 excluding the otus with less than 10 counts in a dataset and 3 rarefying the sequence depth to 65000 for each dataset the pre filtered mother tables were then imported into the galaxy platform http huttenhower sph harvard edu galaxy to determine the differential otus based on the linear discriminant effect size lefse method segata et al 2011 the α values for the factorial kruskal wallis test and pairwise wilcoxon test were both 0 05 feng et al 2018 and the threshold on the linear discriminant analysis lda score was set at 2 0 the microbial consortium from the well functioned co digester r4 was used as a reference group to pinpoint the biomarkers in the co digesters r1 r2 and r3 2 5 metagenome assembly population binning and phylogenetic tree two metagenomics datasets for each srt condition were co assembled into contigs and the raw reads from each individual dataset were mapped onto the assembled contigs to quantify the reads utilization efficiency table s3 the mags were retrieved by following the mmgenome workflow albertsen et al 2013 and the quality of mags completeness and contamination level was determined by using checkm v 1 0 11 parks et al 2015 gtdb tk v 0 3 2 parks et al 2018 and the newest database r04 rs89 released on 19th june 2019 was used for object taxonomic classification to mags based on concatenated protein phylogeny the relative abundance of mags was determined by employing coverm v 0 2 0 https github com wwood coverm which mapped metagenomic raw reads to mags with default setting 120 bacterial marker genes of the recovered bacterial mags and reference genomes from ncbi was identified and aligned following the gtdb tk classify workflow parks et al 2018 fasttree v 2 1 10 was then applied to infer the phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of the identified marker genes price et al 2009 in addition interactive tree of life itol https itol embl de was used for the tree annotation and interpretation letunic and bork 2016 2 6 functional annotation and metabolic network reconstruction of the mags the open reading frames orfs prediction of these mags was conducted by using prodigal v 2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 for each mag genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes cazy were annotated by using hmmer v 3 2 1 finn et al 2011 against the hmm based cazy database dbcan v 7 yin et al 2012 an online script https github com yuboer genome centric portrait of cellulose hydrolysis was employed to identify and to summarize the cazy modules in each mag meanwhile the predicted orfs were uploaded to ghostkoala online annotation platform https www kegg jp ghostkoala updated on may 15th 2019 for functional gene annotation kanehisa et al 2016 a full reconstruction of the metabolic potential for each mag was based on the metabolic pathway annotated by ghostkoala for each mag a specific pathway shall be considered as comprised in it if 50 of genes involved in a metabolic pathway were detected in that mag the potential of substrate utilization for the mags and the carbon flow from sugars then to fatty acids last to methane were inferred generating the metabolic network of mags 3 results 3 1 srt differentiated co digestion performance for solid phase as shown in fig 1 a the average vsr of 32 33 39 and 47 were detected in co digesters r1 r2 r3 and r4 operated at srts of 5 10 15 and 25 days respectively vsr increased with srt demonstrating higher hydrolysis efficiency under longer srt for gas phase the methane yield varied significantly among co digesters an average value of 548 ml g vsr was detected in the well functioned co digester r4 which kept stable during whole operating period for the other three co digesters with srt of 5 15 days the values decreased along with operating period and finally dropped to 100 ml ch4 g vsr indicating the low efficiency of energy recovery if srt of the co digesters was less than 15 days the shorter srt applied in the co digesters quicker declining of the methane yield was observed the rapid onset of hydrolytic and acidogenic activities resulted in the accumulation of the toc mainly vfas reaching up to a concentration of 7000 mg l and mainly corresponding to the acetate propionate and butyrate this induced a drastic ph drop from 7 5 to less than 5 0 in the acidified co digesters operated at srts of 5 15 days and for the stably operated co digester r4 ph was kept in the methanogenic favorable range 6 8 7 5 and minor ph fluctuation was not an operating problem for the co digestion process fig 1d 3 2 srt differentiated microbial composition and biomarker taxa the principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on the weighted unifrac distance dissimilarities clearly showed that varying srt conditions shaped the divergence of microbial communities of the co digesters specifically the microbial communities were similar and clustered together circled in black at the beginning but the dissimilarities among microbial communities from different co digesters increased after varying srt conditions applied highlighted in multiple colored squares fig 2 a the biomarkers suggested by lefse analysis explained the effect in differentiating the overall performance of co digesters operated at varying srt conditions fig 2b c and d as summarized in table 1 the identified biomarkers accounted for at least 23 and reached up to 67 of the total reads in the varying srt conditions indicating that these otus could be the appropriate markers for distinguishing the overall performance of microbe driven co digesters and these biomarkers also increased the resolution at the population as otu level in profiling the communities divergence of different co digesters the g methanocorpuculum 1 4 g syntrophomonas 4 6 f rikenellaceae 6 5 f anaerolineaceae 3 5 and g mesotoga 4 4 were pinpointed as the biomarkers in the well functioned co digester r4 as the biomarkers in the extremely acidified co digester r1 g bifidobacterium two g lactobacillus and f flavobacteriaceae populations were detected in high relative abundance levels 8 5 7 7 7 4 and 5 3 respectively explaining the difference of performance between r1 and r4 noticeably the population f eubacteriaceae robustly existed in all four co digesters with minimum abundance of 4 7 in the 5d srt co digester but specially enriched in the co digesters with srt of 10 15 days 22 3 in r2 and 34 9 in r3 besides the srt of 10 15 days also favored the enrichment of g prevotella 19 2 in r2 and 15 6 in r3 and the population was identified as the biomarker in both co digesters r2 and r3 table s2 based on the results obtained from the analyses of microbial community s composition and biomarker identification here two questions to be further answered are 1 what were interspecies interactions in the co digestion microbial consortia e g mutualism competition 2 whether microbial composition mattered to the co digestion system processes e g hydrolysis process could be proceeded regardless varying srt conditions 3 3 microbial metabolic interaction in srt differentiated co digesters 90 mags were retrieved by using the sequence based multi dimensional coverage binning method additionally the 16s rrna gene representative sequences otus was extracted for presenting the abundant relative abundance 0 1 populations to blast against the whole genome database 91 621 genomes in total of ncbi and those genomes with 100 similarity and 100 enquiry coverage of these 16s sequences were retrieved as their corresponding genomes this process aimed at improving the percentage of populations which could be explained by using both the direct retrieved mags from metagenomic assembled reads and the recovered genomes based on 16s rrna gene representative sequence blasting result in the whole co digestion microbial communities as a result 6 genomes were recovered and resulted in total 96 genomes of sizes from 1 1 to 4 9 mb the taxon assignment for these 96 mags was realized by using gtdb tk v 0 3 2 and mags were named as the lowest taxon level assigned these 96 mags were mainly phylogenetically affiliated into 8 bacterial phyla of actinobacteriota bacteroidota chloroflexota firmicutes proteobacteria spirochaetota thermotogota and verrucomicrobiota fig 3 and 1 archaeal phylum euryarchaeota fig s3 to avoid annotation mistakes induced by the highly contaminated mags 80 mags were selected as the qualified ones with 50 completeness and 10 contamination table s4 and fig s3 b for further metabolic study the genetic capacity of these qualified 80 mags were classified into four groups based on the numbers of the specific gene count in their genomes namely group i 1 count group ii 2 5 counts group iii 6 10 counts and group iv 11 counts fig 4 and fig s4 more genes in their genomes represented the higher genetic capacity in summary large proportions of populations 79 of 80 mags had genes encoding glycoside hydrolysis families ghs for degrading various carbohydrates 94 for cellulose 90 for cellobiose 79 for hemicellulose 94 for oligosaccharides and 89 for starch but only 31 for chitin after carbohydrates were hydrolyzed to glucose 23 mags in the phyla of actinobacteriota 3 bacteroidota 4 firmicutes 3 proteobacteria 6 spirochaetota 1 and thermotogota 6 had genetic potential of fermenting glucose to produce butyrate and these butyrate producing bacteria took up to 26 3 relative abundance in well functioned co digester especially the four mesotoga populations s mesotoga 1 3 4 5 with their total relative abundance of 19 6 could work in butyrate generation through lysine pathway 13 mags in the phyla of actinobacteriota 1 bacteroidota 9 and proteobacteria 3 were pinpointed as the potential propionate producers via succinate pathway two proteobacteria populations and one firmicutes mags could generate propionate through l lactate and l lactaldehyde respectively the relative abundance of propionate producing populations demonstrated decreasing trend with srts 4 8 in the 25d srt operated co digester and up to 13 8 in the 5d srt operated co digester reduced chemicals such as butyrate and propionate could be further oxidized to acetate h2 co2 and formate by the syntrophic bacteria in the scenario in which h2 concentration was low vanwonterghem et al 2016 in the acetogenic stage 41 mags had genes encoding for both the acetate kinase ack and phosphate acetyltransferase pta which were essential enzymes in catalyzing the acetate production besides 25 bacterial mags were identified being involved in h2 metabolism affiliating to the phyla of bacteroidota 12 proteobacteria 6 firmicutes 2 chloroflexota 3 spirochaetota 1 and verrucomicrobiota 1 18 bacterial populations from the phyla of bacteroidota 12 chloroflexota 3 firmicutes 2 and proteobacteria 1 were inferred to participate in formate formation and the h2 and formate producing populations took up to 6 0 and 9 6 relative abundance in the 25d srt operated co digester fig 4 shows the metabolic interspecies interactions in the well functioned co digester in details mags such as s mesotoga 1 3 4 5 f anaerolineaceae hydrolyzed varying carbohydrates to generate glucose then glucose was utilized by the fermentative bacteria e g s mesotoga 1 3 4 5 f eubacteriaceae to generate butyrate and at the same time some populations such as f eubacteriaceae f rhodobacteraceae o rhodospirillales a 1 2 and o bacteriodales 6 fermented glucose to produce propionate in the stage of acetogensis mags e g s mesotoga 1 2 3 4 5 f eubacteriaceae and o bacteroidales 4 functioned in acetate generation one archaeal mag s methanocorpulsculum utilized h2 co2 or formate produced by mags f syntrophomonadaceae o bacteriodales 6 8 etc to generate ch4 the low concentration of acetate was detected implying the high acetate turnover in the 25d srt operated co digester two reasons of high acetate turnover were speculated 1 the acetoclastic methanogens efficiently worked in timely converting acetate to methane and or 2 the acetate was oxidized by certain bacteria the microbial composition indicated that the acetoclastic methanogenesis was not the predominant pathway in well functioned co digester because that 1 no acetoclastic methanogen s mag was retrieved and 2 extremely low relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogens 0 4 was detected based on 16s rrna gene analysis so the high level of acetate turnover was accomplished by the syntrophic acetate oxidation sao process four marker genes acsbcd and ftfhs mosbæk et al 2016 and the gene encoding for co dehydrogenase can et al 2014 were employed to pinpoint the potential populations involved sao process who would oxidize acetate through reductive acetyl coa pathway the f eubacteriaceae was ascertained as a sao bacterium with the full set of genes and this population accounted for 1 4 and 4 3 relative abundance in 25d srt and 15d srt co digesters another h2 formate providers for hydrogenotrophic methanogen might be the three mesotoga populations including s mesotoga 1 2 4 it had been documented that mesotoga populations were speculated to be involved in syntrophic acetate oxidation in a potential alternative syntrophic acetate degradation pathway nobu et al 2015 with genes encoding both glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate pathway however the formate dehydrolyase complex was not found in mesotoga genomes in this study suggesting that these populations might be capable to oxidize acetate to produce formate but unable to further covert formate to co2 and h2 as the mutualist beneficial partner one hydrogenotrophic methanogenic mag s methanocorpusculum had the complete set of genes required for methane production via co2 h2 or formate pathway and its relative abundance was 0 8 in the 25d srt operated co digester the syntrophic interaction between h2 formate producing bacteria and h2 formate utilizing archaea was the rate limiting but key step for an efficient co digestion process the relative abundance of key functional groups h2 formate specialist syntrophic bacteria f syntrophomonadaceae and methanogen s methanocorpusculum were 0 01 in the acidified co digesters the methane yield in these acidified co digesters were less than 100 ml ch4 g vsr in addition the relative abundance of three speculated mesotoga sao bacteria was 0 1 demonstrating the less efficient turnover of acetate in the acidified co digesters at the same time acetate accumulation was observed in all acidified co digesters especially for the co digesters operated at srt of 10 15 days the concentration reached up to 4000 mg l it could be found that some mags could play multiple roles during the co digestion process suggesting that they had high level of metabolic versatility for example s mesotoga 1 3 4 5 o nanopelagicales 3 and f eubacteriaceae had both hydrolytic and fermentative genetic capacities fig 4 3 4 functional gene redundancy and niche differentiation of mags in srt differentiated co digestion consortia functional gene redundancy was observed in microbial consortium certain functions such as hydrolysis and acetogenesis could be implemented by many microbes without phylogenetic closed relationships for example a large portion of populations in microbial community were identified as hydrolyzers fig s4 and table s5 and half of the microbes had functional genes encoding for acetate production suggesting the high level of functional gene redundancy amani et al 2010 vanwonterghem et al 2016 with the intention to pinpoint the potential major hydrolyzers and to visualize the shift of hydrolytic populations in srt differentiated co digesters here the relative abundance of mags was multiplied with the number of genes for each gh to reflect their total contributions in hydrolysis since the population with more genes encoding gh in its genome and had higher relative abundance in the consortia may contribute more in hydrolyzing substrates as shown in fig 5 the major hydrolyzers and their substrate based hydrolytic contribution were altered by srt conditions in the well functioned co digester the most influential hydrolysers were s mesotoga 5 followed by s mesotoga 4 and s mesotoga 3 not only for the degradation of cellulose but also for starch oligosaccharides and cellobiose and one chloroflexota mag f anaerolineaceae played an important role in hydrolyzing five carbohydrates mainly for starch oligosaccharides and cellobiose the main hydrolyzers in the acidified co digesters operated at srt from 10 to 15 days were one firmicutes mag f eubacteriaceae three bacteroidota mags g prevotella 1 g prevotella 2 and s prevotella 1 in the 5d srt co digester the hydrolysis was mainly conducted by one actinobacteriota mag o nanopelagicales 3 one firmicutes s lactobacillus and one bacteroidota mag f flavobacteriaceae 3 based on the competitive exclusion principle cole 1960 two microbes with exactly same ecological niche could not be able to stably co exist in the community especially for populations with a close phylogenetic relationship violle et al 2011 there should be a niche resource differentiation among the species with overlapped sources at varying environmental conditions for example two sphaerochaetaceae populations demonstrated varying hydrolyzing behaviors in srt differentiated co digesters f sphaerochaetaceae 3 competed over f sphaerochaetaceae 2 in the 10d srt operated co digester but the later gained advantages and played a crucial role in degrading cellobiose and oligosaccharides in the 15d srt operated co digester for three phylogeny closed populations s prevotella 1 s prevotella 2 and s prevotella 3 made a great contribution in hemicellulose and oligosaccharides degradation in the 15d srt operated co digester but only s prevotella 1 made hydrolytic contribution for hemicellulose and oligosaccharides degradation in srt 10d and srt 5d co digesters the rest two microbes had less impact in other acidified co digesters fig 5 the s prevotella 3 was observed to hydrolyze oligosaccharides and hemicellulose in 10d srt co digester but s prevotella 2 competed over s prevotella 3 in the co digesters operated with longer srt of 25 days the reason for the co existence of these potential competing populations may be the different sugars membrane transport mechanisms employed by them such as abc transporters and phosphotransferase systems pts fig 6 the starch could be hydrolyzed in 3 steps 1 extracellular hydrolysis of starch to yield maltose 2 transport extracellular maltose to cytosol abc transporter and or pts 3 intracellular hydrolysis of maltose by phospho alpha glucosidase malh and or maltose phosphorylase malp mala to yield glucose gänzle and follador 2012 specifically starch composed of amylose and amylopectin could be hydrolyzed by amylase and pullulanase to produce maltose and glucose 32 mags were specialized in amylose hydrolysis by using amylase 18 populations could genetically work in amylopectin hydrolysis by employing pullulanase and there were 15 mags worked in starch hydrolysis having genes encoding for both two enzymes then the extracellular maltose would be transported to cytosol by 5 thermotogota mags s mesotoga 2 3 4 5 and f petrotogaceae seven mags could hydrolyze intracellular maltose such as s lactobacillus could synthesize both enzymes malh and mala malp f eubacteriaceae could hydrolyze maltose under the catalysis of malh and the rest 4 mags f favobacteriaceae 1 2 3 f cyclobacteriaceae 2 and f s aprospiraceae 1 were specialized in converting maltose to glucose under the catalysis of mala malp another major type of carbohydrates oligosaccharides could be hydrolyzed by 75 populations based on the cazy annotation result sucrose major disaccharides of oligosaccharides was consisting of glucose and fructose the hydrolysis of sucrose could happen in both extracellular and intracellular environments 1 extracellular hydrolysis of sucrose was catalyzed by levansucrase ftfa to yield one glucose and one fructose 2 intracellular hydrolysis of sucrose was a 2 step process the extracellular sucrose was firstly transported into the cytosol then further be hydrolyzed by sucrose phosphorylase scrp and or fructo furanosidase saca gänzle and follador 2012 in the present study the gene encoding for ftfa was detected in s streptococcus 3 for extracellular hydrolysis of sucrose 6 mags had whole set of genes for membrane transport of extracellular sucrose and intracellular hydrolysis namely g olsenella s streptococcus 1 2 3 o thermomicrobiales 3 and f eubacteriaceae further investigation on the mechanisms incorporated in these 6 mags revealed that theses populations reduce the potential competition by employing different transport strategies specifically the g olsenella could employ both two mechanisms msmefg msmk and pts1bca s streptococcus 1 2 and o thermomicrobiales 3 utilized abc transporters and the rest two populations adopted ptsibca for sucrose uptake fructose the product of sucrose hydrolysis could be transported by 3 mags to cytosol and 23 mags had gene encoding for xylose isomerase xyla functioning in converting fructose to glucose one mag f rhodobacteraceae had full set of genes encoding for the enzymes catalyzing for uptake extracellular fructose and conversion to glucose 5 mags had full set of genes encoding for extracellular cellobiose uptake and intracellular hydrolysis in the microbial consortia namely g olsenella f eubacteriaceae c bacilli 4 f sphaerochaetaceae 2 4 but former 2 mags were also able to hydrolyze sucrose demonstrating that these two populations had high level of metabolic versatility of carbohydrates hydrolysis interestingly some mags preferred to transport extracellular glucose to cytosol and the relative abundance of these populations showed increasing trend with srt from 0 7 to 11 1 in the co digesters with srt from 5 days to 25 days 4 discussion for the well functioned co digester r4 in this study the measured methane yield was 548 ml ch4 g vsr on average which was consistent with our previous study 376 595 ml ch4 g vsr in the co digestion of food waste and sewage sludge wang et al 2017 srt a crucial operational parameter played an important role in ensuring the operational stability of the system it had been documented that if the srt shortened from 25 to 13 days the process was inhibited with accumulation of toc and the methane yield declined salminen and rintala 2002 which had also been observed in the acidified co digesters r1 r3 in this study the quick ph drop was because of toc mainly vfas accumulation 5000 7000 mg l propionate and acetate accumulation were reported in replicate mesophilic reactors operated at short srt of 12 days vanwonterghem et al 2015 which was observed in the acidified co digesters with srt from 5 to 15 days of the present study as shown in fig s1 the occurrence of butyrate accumulation along with the rise of acetate concentration was detected in co digesters operated at srts of 10 and 15 days it had been found that butyrate degradation seemed to be affected by the acetate pool ahring et al 2001 microbial composition and its functional traits are of great importance to ensure the engineered system service cabrol et al 2017 therefore the study of microbial community dynamics and interspecies interaction were crucial for the co digestion system especially the balance and close trophic interaction between acid producing bacteria and acid consuming microbes ensured the stability of the co digestion system chen et al 2018 salminen and rintala 2002 in the co digester operated at sufficient srt condition some bacteria such as megasphaera elsdenii for consuming excess lactate and syntrophobacter fumaroxidans known as propionate degrader ohnishi et al 2010 xing et al 2008 made contribution in ensuring the ecosystem service by timely oxidizing fatty acids and preventing their accumulation in this study f syntrophomonadaceae was identified with the genetic capacities to producing formate and h2 additionally four populations f eubacteriaceae and three mesotoga populations s mesotoga 1 2 4 was speculated as sao bacteria working in acetate oxidization to generate formate simultaneously the hydrogenotrophic methanogen s methanocorpusculum utilized h2 and formate to produce methane ensuring the stability of the co digestion system same with previous study that the syntrophic acetate oxidization and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was proposed as the major methanogenic pathway in the thermophilic cellulose degrading co digester lü et al 2014 while in the acidified co digesters shorter srt conditions caused drastic ph drop inhibited the processes of acetogensis and methanogenesis made hydrolysis and acidification processes prevailed at the same time the microbial community was shaped by washing out the populations with longer generation time and sensitive to dramatic ph fluctuation e g f syntrophomonadaceae s methanocorpusculum and selectively enriching the acid tolerant species such as s lactobacillus with metabolic capacity of fermentation to produce lactate john et al 2006 it also been observed that the drastic decrease of relative abundance of microbes functioned in co2 and h2 production and syntrophic acetate oxidization when srt decreased from 30 days to 10 days fitamo et al 2017 due to the inhibition caused by the low ph and the missing of the keystone microbes the trophic interaction especially for syntrophic interaction in these acidified co digesters were hindered resulting in the failure of the co digestion system based on the results of overall performance and microbial metabolic interspecies interaction from the acidified co digesters acetogensis and methanogenesis were hindered but the hydrolysis and acidification processes were proceeded the carbohydrates hydrolysis happened in all four co digesters regardless srt conditions called functional similarity of microbial communities allison and martiny 2008 which was also been found in the digester of cellulose decomposition wohl et al 2004 two reasons explained the functional similarity of hydrolysis in this study 1 the taxa contained in varying communities were of functionally redundant e g functional genes for hydrolysis were widely detected in the microbial consortia and 2 the community would function differently but resulted in the similar process rate when incorporated at the community level such as the shift of major hydrolytic populations and their preferred substrates in srt differentiated co digesters the above two reasons were also been found in the methanogenic bioreactors in which the communities with different microbial composition but functioned similarly fernandez et al 2000 functional gene redundancy was one of the reasons in ensuring hydrolysis proceeded in srt differentiated reactors wohl et al 2004 the niche differentiation was the mechanism in reducing the direct competition among microbes with overlapped habitat or source in a closed and constant environment in the present study though hydrolytic populations such as f eubacteriaceae and s mesotoga 3 shared similar carbohydrates sources fig 5 but they might employ varied carbohydrates uptake mechanisms and metabolic pathways for example the s mesotoga 3 had genes encoding both amylase and pullulanase for extracellular starch hydrolysis abc transporter for transport extracellular maltose and sucrose to cytosol it also could transport extracellular glucose to cytosol for subsequent metabolic activity which function could not be carried out by f eubacteriaceae due to the absence of the functional genes but f eubacteriaceae was able to uptake extracellular cellobiose to cytosol and to conduct intracellular cellobiose hydrolysis under catalysis of β glucosidase which could not be accomplished by the mag s mesotoga 3 fig 6 the limitations in this study was the accurate assigning functions to mags because of 1 the genome quality of mags 2 the noise caused by the functional gene redundancy observed in some mags 3 the limited existing annotation database such limitation could be overcome in the coming future with new technical developments firstly long reads sequencing e g pacbio nanopore would enable us to improve the resolution of the microbial consortia by retrieving more genomes with high quality additionally metatranscriptomic and metaproteomics combined with metagenomics could be powerful tools for providing direct and solid evidence to ascertain the genetic functions of the retrieved mags by reducing the noises caused by functional gene redundancy of microbes lastly more validated and updated database will make a difference in unraveling the black box of the anaerobic process and reveal the microbial ecology in this engineered system 5 conclusion sufficient srt condition was required for a stable operated co digestion system the main features of microbial analysis in the well functioned co digester were 1 the complementarity of distinct hydrolytic microbial groups to hydrolyze the varying substrates 2 the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in association with syntrophic microbes both h2 producing bacteria f syntrophomonadaceae and putative acetate oxidizing bacteria f eubacteriaceae and three mesotoga populations additionally functional gene redundancy especially for the genes encoding for enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis activity and functional similarity of microbial communities in srt differentiated co digesters were observed in this study varying uptake and metabolic mechanisms of carbohydrates employed by the hydrolytic populations were the niche differentiation observed in the

17858,anthropogenic organohalide contaminants present in wastewater treatment plants wwtps often remain untreated and can be discharged into the environment although organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb contribute to the elimination of anthropogenic organohalides in natural anaerobic environments reductive dehalogenation by ohrb in mainstream wwtps remains poorly understood in this study we quantified ohrb during a long term operation of a municipal wwtp with short hydraulic and sludge retention times 3 h and 1 5 5 days respectively the obligate ohrb were detected at high levels averaging 2 56 1 73 107 and 3 11 1 16 107 16s rrna gene copies ml mlss sludge in anoxic and aerobic zones respectively over the entire sampling period and throughout the wastewater treatment train microcosms derived from mainstream activated sludge contained an unidentified member of the dehalococcoides genus that metabolically dechlorinated triclosan used as a representative emerging organohalide antimicrobial to diclosan suggesting the potential of anaerobic degradation of emerging contaminants in wwtps to further understand the mechanisms for such antimicrobials removal an investigation of dechlorination of triclosan by dehalococcoides strains was conducted dechlorination of environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan to diclosan was observed in dehalococcoides mccartyi strain cg1 yielding 4 59 0 34 108 cells μmole cl removed at a rate of 0 062 μm day and a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0 5 mg l notably both the tolerance of strain cg1 to triclosan and the rate of triclosan dechlorination increased when cg1 was cultured in the presence of both triclosan and tetrachloroethene taken together our results suggest that anaerobic degradation of organohalide antimicrobials might be more prevalent in mainstream wwtps than previously speculated though the low growth yields that are supported by triclosan dechlorination seem to indicate that other organohalide substrates could be necessary to sustain ohrb populations in these systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords organohalide antimicrobials organohalide respiring bacteria dehalococcoides triclosan reductive dechlorination wastewater 1 introduction municipal and industrial wastewater treatment streams contain a variety of halogenated organic pollutants such as pesticides or pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps because of their high hydrophobicity these compounds are presumed to be removed via hydrophobic attachment to biosolids and biomass however changes in organohalide concentrations beyond what can be explained by physical attachment suggest that biological removal constitutes at least some portion of total organohalide removal in wastewater bester 2003 citulski and farahbakhsh 2010 pycke et al 2014 many organohalide pollutants are structurally resistant to aerobic biodegradation hence removal is more likely to occur during anaerobic treatment via reductive dehalogenation nelson et al 2011 villemur 2013 wang et al 2014 in anoxic anaerobic zones of mainstream bioreactors dehalogenating bacterial populations compete with other fast growing anaerobic heterotrophs thus only thriving to exist and less likely being dominant accordingly anaerobic biodegradation of organohalide contaminants in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is generally thought to occur in anaerobic digesters where the bioavailability of organohalides is increased because the extended residence time sludge retention time srt and higher concentration of organohalide substrates in digesters can accommodate the slow enzymatic catalysis performed by low abundance and slow growing organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb benabdallah el hadj et al 2007 fathepure et al 1988 krzmarzick and novak 2014 conversely the short srt and do fluctuations associated with mainstream bioreactors have long been thought to preclude ohrb metabolic activity and the potential for removal of organohalide contaminants in the mainstream by ohrb has been largely overlooked previous studies have demonstrated that ohrb in particular members of the versatile but fastidious dehalococcoides genus can be sustained in microbial communities in lab scale continuous reactors designed to treat chloroethene contaminated water at srt of less than one week carr et al 2000 delgado et al 2014 drzyzga et al 2001 zheng et al 2001 still the low abundance of ohrb and fluctuations in organohalide substrate concentrations in influent wastewater could lead to less dehalogenation activity in the mainstream treatment heidler and halden 2009 smith et al 2015 however increased usage of organohalide antimicrobials in ppcps and common household cleaning agents have resulted in a fairly consistent source of organohalides in municipal wastewater streams heidler and halden 2007 mcclellan and halden 2010 the increased prevalence of these potential growth substrates may be sufficient to support non negligible ohrb in mainstream bioreactors while organohalide antimicrobials can serve as growth supporting substrates for ohrb these same compounds are an existential threat to functional bacterial populations in bioreactors and can adversely affect biological nutrients removal if left unchecked fan et al 2009 kraigher et al 2008 similarly over abundance of halogenated antimicrobials could hinder the growth or metabolic activity of ohrb thereby reducing the potential for biological degradation of total organics therefore it is worth evaluating the feasibility of anaerobic removal of organohalide antimicrobials in mainstream wwtps and identifying the mechanisms by which different organohalide antimicrobials can be removed in bioreactors in the current study we observed ohrb in mainstream bioreactors at a pilot scale wwtp over two years of operation under different reactor configurations and operational parameters variations in ohrb populations were correlated with environmental factors and the dehalogenation potential of different microcosms established from sludge samples was investigated using triclosan as a model emerging organohalide contaminant the mechanism of triclosan degradation in microcosms was evaluated using previously isolated dehalococcoides as a proxy for the triclosan dehalogenating populations in the wwtp microcosms the presence of ohrb in the wwtp together with observed degradation of triclosan in wwtp microcosms demonstrate the potential for dehalogenation of emerging organohalide contaminants in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals bacterial cultivation and analytical procedures all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo or merck darmstadt germany at the highest

chlortetracycline triclocarban triclosan and diclofenac which are commonly found organohalide antibiotics and antimicrobials in wastewater were selected as representatives to test their bioavailability to support ohrb s growth krzmarzick and novak 2014 tran et al 2016 these specific compounds were weighed and dissolved in microcosm bottles directly at 0 5 mg l in further kinetics

so4 2 ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 were measured during sample collection as previously described wang et al 2019 correlations between ohrb abundance at the genus level and water quality parameters were inferred by analysis of variance anova a pearson s correlation coefficient was calculated between bacterial genera and environmental variables recorded at different time points t test was performed to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two compared groups and the confidence level was set at 95 p 0 05 statistical analyses and plots were calculated with originpro 2017 originlab 2017 2 4 identification of triclosan reductive dehalogenase in d mccartyi strain cg1 the triclosan reductive dehalogenase rdase was identified by monitoring the expressed proteome during dechlorination cells from cultures of d mccartyi strain cg1 provided only triclosan as a growth substrate for eight consecutive subcultures were harvested and crude cell proteins were extracted digested with trypsin and analyzed via nano lc ms ms as previously described zhao et al 2017 identification of peptides and proteins was validated if 95 and 99 probability were achieved by the paragon algorithm shilov et al 2007 respectively in vitro assays to determine dehalogenase functionality were carried out in 4 ml vials containing 2 ml assay solution 2 mm methyl viologen 1 5 mm titanium iii citrate 100 mm tris hcl buffer at ph 7 0 inside an anaerobic chamber as previously described adrian et al 2007 triclosan 1 5 μm and pce 3 0 μm were added as indicated to 4 ml vials containing the assay solution the test was initiated by addition of cell extracts from triclosan or pce fed cultures respectively and the mixtures were incubated at 30 c for 24 h prior to headspace analysis 2 5 triclosan minimal inhibitory concentrations of d mccartyi strains the minimal inhibitory concentration mic of triclosan for d mccartyi strains mb cg1 cg4 and cg5 was investigated by exposure to different concentrations of triclosan 0 2 2 ppm as indicated because d mccartyi are obligate ohrb pce 0 5 mm was amended as an electron acceptor along with triclosan and pce dechlorination kinetics were used to evaluate the inhibitory effects of triclosan further investigation of inhibitory effects of triclosan on cell growth in the presence of other organohalide substrates were carried out in strain cg1 cell density of strain cg1 amended with both pce 0 5 mm and triclosan 0 2 2 ppm was enumerated by qpcr 2 6 transcription of the triclosan dehalogenase transcription of gene catalyzing triclosan dechlorination was investigated in cells of strain cg1 that had been grown to completion i e complete dechlorination of 0 3 mm pce to dces and then starved for 5 d to minimize residual rna after starvation pce 0 3 mm and triclosan 0 5 mg l were added simultaneously to starved cultures gene expression was determined via reverse transcription pcr followed by qpcr rt qpcr briefly 2 5 ml cultures were collected 1 ml for dna extraction and 1 5 ml for rna extraction at 12 h intervals and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm and 4 c for 10 min pellets for rna extraction were immediately re suspended in trizol reagent and stored at 80 c until further processing rna was later extracted using a modified trizol and qiagen rneasy mini kit protocol as previously described ding et al 2014 luciferase mrna promega madison wi was added to each rna sample as an internal control of the efficiency of rna extraction cdna synthesis and qpcr amplification on column digestion with rnase free dnase was performed to remove residual genomic dna rt pcr was performed immediately after rna elution using the qiagen sensiscript kit qiagen with random hexa primers and rnase inhibitor promega 3 results 3 1 correlation between ohrb abundance and environmental factors in wwtp eight morphologically different genera known to contain ohrb were found in the anoxic do 0 mg l below detection limit and swing 0 6 mg l do 2 2 mg l tanks of the wwtp including bacterial genera known to be obligate ohrb whose growth relies upon reductive dehalogenation of organohalides dehalococcoides dehalogenimonas and dehalobium or to contain facultative ohrb which can grow on electron acceptors rather than organohalides desulfitobacterium desulfovibrio sulfurospirillum anaeromyxobacter and desulfoluna the abundance of these eight ohrb populations ranged over several orders of magnitude from 6 25 4 8 104 16s rrna gene copies ml desulfoluna in the swing tank to 2 30 0 94 107 16s rrna gene copies ml dehalobium in the swing tank table 1 and fig 1 the coefficients of variation for each bacterial population ranged from a minimum of 34 12 dehalococcoides to a maximum of 146 51 dehalogenimonas both in the anoxic tank table 1 the average total abundance of the ohrb bacterial populations was 5 25 1 62 107 and 5 35 1 97 107 16s rrna gene copies ml sludge in the anoxic and swing tanks respectively notably the average total abundance of the three obligate ohrb populations whose growth relies upon reductive dehalogenation of organohalides was 2 56 1 73 107 and 3 11 1 16 107 16s rrna gene copies ml in the anoxic and swing tanks respectively representing 0 02 2 76 and 0 04 1 23 of the total bacterial communities respectively differences in the abundance of every obligate ohrb containing genus in the anoxic and swing tanks were statistically significant p 0 05 but the differences in the abundance of facultative ohrb containing genera were not statistically significant p 0 05 fig 2 the abundance of these eight genera showed weak correlations with each other 0 31 r 0 53 p 0 05 with one exception of positive correlations between two obligate ohrb genera dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas r 0 66 p 0 05 which might suggest that the different populations are occupying different niches within the system fig 2 the close correlation between dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas is possibly due to their similar growth environment similarly as for the operational parameters srt and do both differed in anoxic and swing zones p 0 05 only weak negative correlations were observed between do and the abundance of dehalogenimonas r 0 33 p 0 05 and dehalococcoides r 0 27 p 0 05 and between srt and the abundance of dehalobium r 0 27 p 0 05 as in the mlss samples acetate and n nh4 were below detection limit and n no3 n no2 and so4 2 were averaged at 2 54 2 51 mg l 0 24 0 31 mg l and 57 07 6 14 mg l respectively though n no3 and n no2 exhibited differences in anoxic and swing zones p 0 05 n no3 n no2 and so4 2 were barely shown correlations with the eight genera 3 2 organohalide antimicrobials as electron acceptors for ohrb in domestic wwtps the sustained presence of obligate ohrb in the wwtp suggests that these bacterial populations could effectively harvest sufficient growth supporting substrates from the influent wastewater since increased use in consumer products has led to higher and more consistent concentrations of halogenated antimicrobials in domestic wastewater the potential exists for these compounds to support growth of ohrb in wwtps the ability of ohrb to utilize chloramphenicol chlortetracycline triclocarban triclosan and diclofenac which have been detected in wastewater at biologically meaningful concentrations tran et al 2018 as growth supporting substrates was investigated antimicrobial compounds were spiked into microcosms established from sludge collected from the anoxic tank of the wwtp 5 vol vol inocula at different concentrations 0 5 20 ppm of these triclosan was the only compound that exhibited biological degradation after 30 days incubation under strict anaerobic growth conditions fig 3 a no additional dechlorination was observed upon extended incubation to determine which ohrb population s could be responsible for the transformation of triclosan bacterial abundance in the microcosms was quantified before and after incubation in the presence of 0 5 ppm triclosan fig 3b the only potential ohrb population whose abundance differed significantly between microcosms with and without triclosan amendment was dehalococcoides which increased 6 5 folds from 5 67 105 to 4 27 106 16s rrna gene copies ml in microcosms amended with triclosan and decreased by 58 from 5 67 105 to 2 34 105 in microcosms without triclosan together with the change in abundance of dehalococcoides with production of diclosan from the dechlorination of triclosan fig 3a dehalococcoides is likely involved in triclosan transformation in the microcosms 3 3 reductive dechlorination of triclosan by previously isolated dehalococcoides mccartyi strains to better understand whether the prevalence of organohalide antimicrobials in wastewater could lead to the establishment of ohrb populations capable of biologically detoxifying these same compounds in wwtps we evaluated capability of previously isolated d mccartyi strains to metabolically dehalogenate triclosan as the microcosms established from the anoxic tank of the wwtp demonstrated that one or more dehalococcoides played a role in triclosan dehalogenation we screened a representative array of previously identified d mccartyi strains for triclosan dechlorination to elicit the genetic mechanism underlying this phenotype among eight d mccartyi strains tested in this study only one d mccartyi strain cg1 wang et al 2014 exhibited reductive dechlorination of triclosan after three months incubation d mccartyi strain cg1 completely dechlorinated 0 5 mg l 1 5 μm triclosan to diclosan within 28 days at an average rate of 0 062 μm day and with a growth yield of 4 59 0 34 108 μmole cl removal fig 4 the initial triclosan concentration had a notable impact on growth yield with higher initial concentrations resulting in decreased cell growth appendices table s2 i e higher concentrations 1 0 mg ml resulting in a 49 reduction in growth yield 2 34 0 27 108 μmole cl removal compared to the yield observed at 0 5 mg ml triclosan a high initial triclosan concentration also caused a decrease in the growth rate of strain cg1 from 0 10 d to 0 04 d at 0 5 and 1 0 mg l triclosan respectively similarly elevated concentrations of triclosan 1 ppm reduced the rate of pce dechlorination by strain cg1 fig 5 a and b this metabolic suppression was even more pronounced in other d mccartyi strains appendices fig s1 hydrophobic organohalides such as triclosan may be present at much higher concentrations in the anaerobic compartments of bioreactors than in the influent as these compounds tend to sorb to organic particles and reside in the system for prolonged periods of time it seems unlikely however that triclosan concentrations within a bioreactor would exceed 0 5 ppm a concentration that effectively inhibited metabolic activity of all dehalococcoides tested other than cg1 appendices fig s1 fig 5a the growth yield of our model system d mccartyi strain cg1 from triclosan suggests that 0 5 ppm triclosan alone would be insufficient to support the abundance of dehalococcoides we observed in the wwtp however multiple organohalide pollutants typically coexist in domestic wastewater and it is possible that metabolic dechlorination of one or more other halogenated compound along with low levels of triclosan could support a higher density of dehalococcoides cells indeed the cell density we observed when strain cg1 was incubated with both pce and triclosan amendment fig 5c supports such a hypothesis nano liquid chromatography lc ms ms was used to identify proteins that were highly expressed during triclosan dechlorination by strain cg1 of 65 proteins captured confidence 95 table 2 the third most abundant one was matched with a rdase pcba1 with 62 3 sequence coverage of the detected peptides 314 504 aa this same protein was previously found to dechlorinate both pce and pcbs in strain cg1 wang et al 2014 and was the only rdase expressed during triclosan dechlorination in vitro activity assays of crude cell lysates from cg1 cultures grown on pce or triclosan showed that pce fed cultures could dechlorinate triclosan and vice versa suggesting the same functionality in rdase induced by triclosan or pce together these results indicate that pcba1 is responsible for the observed triclosan dechlorination in strain cg1 3 4 effects of sudden increases in concentration of organohalide antimicrobials to evaluate whether sudden temporary exposure to elevated concentrations of antimicrobials could inhibit the metabolic activity of ohrb in bioreactors cultures of strain cg1 pre grown with pce to a high density 5 0 108 cells ml were capable of sustaining dechlorination of additional amendment of pce even in the presence of high triclosan concentrations fig 6 a there were no apparent differences in the levels of pcba1 transcription in pre grown cultures during pce dechlorination in the presence of different concentrations of 0 1 mg l triclosan but pcba1 transcription was significantly reduced p 0 05 at 2 mg l triclosan and was absent at 5 mg l triclosan correspondingly the rate of pce dechlorination in cells exposed to 2 mg ml triclosan was reduced and in cells exposed to 5 mg ml triclosan ceased completely after 10 h fig 6b pce dechlorination between 0 and 10 h in 5 mg ml triclosan was likely due to existing pcba1 in the cells 4 discussion biological removal of organohalide contaminants in wwtps is assumed to occur primarily in anaerobic digesters and it is generally believed that the low concentrations of organohalide contaminants and short srt of mainstream bioreactors limit ohrb metabolic activity krzmarzick and novak 2014 nelson et al 2011 villemur 2013 wang et al 2014 while effluent concentrations of organohalide contaminants are often lower than is predicted by models based solely on physical removal processes i e hydrophobic attachment to biosolids or biomass biological removal has been mostly neglected as a potential source of this observed discrepancy bester 2003 heidler and halden 2007 oulton et al 2010 in the current study we detected a persistently high abundance of bacterial genera known to contain ohrb in the mainstream treatment tanks of a wastewater treatment plant over long term operation evidence that ohrb may function in mainstream treatment systems despite low influent substrate concentrations and short srt the slow growth of ohrb particularly obligate ohrb presents a major challenge to incorporating these microorganisms into mainstream bioreactors due to the short hrt and srt the hrt and srt of the investigated wwtp were 3 h and 1 5 5 d respectively 2 5 5 d in the anoxic tank and 1 5 3 d in the swing tank which are commonly used wwtp operational parameters interestingly we found that the abundance of genera known to contain ohrb was not correlated with srt ranging between 1 5 d and 5 d in the mainstream wwtp which may indicate that these populations can at least survive under these conditions though limited information on the effects of longer srt on dehalogenation of organohalide compounds previous studies have demonstrated effective dehalogenation of organohalide compounds such as chlorinated phenols chlorinated benzenes and polychlorinated biphenyls under a much longer srt of several weeks krzmarzick and novak 2014 suggesting a correlation between the abundance of functional bacterial populations and the elongated srt would be expected evidence from a lab scale continuous up flow bioreactor with an hrt of 3 h showing complete removal of trichloroethene by ohrb delgado et al 2017 provides additional support for this idea in the study by delgado et al self aggregation and bio flocculation of dehalococcoides enabled a trichloroethene high removal rate and no significant differences in dehalococcoides abundance were found at longer hrt furthermore the comparatively moderate doubling time and low monod half maximum rate concentrations of dehalococcoides isolates and some dehalococcoides containing enrichment cultures suggest that these bacteria could dehalogenate an appreciable level of organohalides in continuous flow reactors under normal operating conditions other environmental factors such as the availability of potential electron acceptors like nitrate nitrite and do could potentially affect the growth and persistence of ohrb populations in bioreactors in the current study variations in the abundance of ohrb containing genera in the anoxic and swing tanks were not correlated with nitrate or nitrite while the do exhibited selective correlation with obligate ohrb dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas respiring solely on organohalides for growth rather than facultative ohrb able to use other electron acceptors other than organohalides meanwhile dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas were the only two bacterial genera among the eight investigated ones exhibited differences p 0 05 between anoxic and swing tanks that the abundance of both genera in the anoxic tank were higher than that in the swing tanks this suggests the occurrence of respiration of organohalides in anoxic tank though the aerobic condition in swing tank makes the reductive dehalogenation of organohalides less common than that in anoxic tank the formation of anaerobic microenvironments in activated sludge flocs may accommodate the ohrb to respire organohalides when the oxidation reduction potential at the inner layer of the flocs can go down to strictly anaerobic conditions nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 wilén et al 2018 meeting the ohrb required conditions holliger et al 1998 the presence and activity of ohrb are strongly influenced by the availability of organohalide substrates the stability of bacterial populations corresponding to different ohrb containing genera particularly of obligate ohrb genera suggests the presence is a relatively consistent source of halogenated substrate additionally positive correlations in the abundance of obligate ohrb populations with each other suggests either that the concentration or diversity of organohalides in the anoxic reactor of the wwtp is sufficient to sustain multiple ohrb populations among the obligate ohrb dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas genomes are known to harbor a large number of non redundant rdase encoding homologous genes rdhas löffler et al 2013 yang et al 2017 that enable utilization of multiple halogenated compounds adaptation to changes in availability of halogenated compounds and survival in relatively low concentrations of halogenated compounds in the wwtp obligate ohrb comprised 0 47 0 23 and 0 59 0 10 of the microbial community in the anoxic and swing tank respectively almost 30 times more having been previously reported in anaerobic digesters smith et al 2015 this difference is due to the lower total biomass in the mainstream tank as the absolute quantity of ohrb 5 25 1 62 107 and 5 35 1 97 107 16s rrna gene copies ml in anoxic and swing tank respectively in this study and the previous report is comparable the absolute quantity of ohrb observed in the wwtp mainstream is likely sufficient for dehalogenation as previous reports have demonstrated adequate dehalogenation of chloroethenes with as few as 3 6 0 6 106 dehalococcoides g soil behrens et al 2008 or as little as 0 5 4 dehalococcoides in the microbial community azizian et al 2008 in lab scale continuous flow column reactors the organohalide antimicrobials frequently used in ppcps are discharged to municipal wastewater streams continuously and have come to be seen as emerging contaminants aerobic degradation of triclosan to inorganics has been reported both in mainstream wwtps and by bacteria isolated from activated sludge lee et al 2014 mulla et al 2016 but few studies have investigated reductive dehalogenation of triclosan in these systems we detected dechlorination of triclosan that corresponded with growth of a dehalococcoides population in microcosms established from anaerobic bioreactor sludge and in a previously isolated d mccartyi strain cg1 a possibility that has only been hinted at until now mcnamara and krzmarzick 2013 results from the wwtp provide evidence that ohrb may be responsible for dehalogenation of halogenated antimicrobials in wwtps the inhibitory effects on bacterial metabolisms are an important consideration in determining the environmental fate of antimicrobials we did not observe declines in ohrb populations that might be expected after long term exposure to triclosan above 2 mg l a concentration rarely seen in wwtps additionally experiments using a previously isolated triclosan dechlorinating d mccartyi strain suggest that established dechlorinating populations in wwtps can be easily sustained and resumed under a sudden shock even above minimal inhibitory concentration because the transcriptional and enzymatic activity starts to be affected at much higher concentrations 10 mg l this suggests that the microbial systems could be resilient to sudden shocks of halogenated compounds at levels exceeding otherwise inhibitory concentrations concentrations of triclosan in wwtps vary over a wide range with detected concentrations ranging from 0 086 mg l in wastewater influent to 133 mg kg dry weight in biosolids in a conversion to up to 3 99 mg l in sludge based on up to 3 biosolid content in sludge from wwtps krzmarzick and novak 2014 suggesting that dehalococcoides might not be inhibited at relevant level of triclosan in wwtps the rate of reductive dehalogenation also governs the fate of antimicrobials in wastewater streams a pure culture of d mccartyi strain cg1 grown in optimized conditions dechlorinated triclosan at a slower rate 0 062 μm day than other chlorinated substrates wang et al 2014 but the presence of alternate electron accepters i e pce together with triclosan resulted in much more rapid dechlorination of triclosan 0 245 μm day the increased rate of triclosan dechlorination can be explained by both pce and triclosan being dechlorinated by the same rdase in strain cg1 emphasizing the need to fully characterize the functional range of rdases to better inform predictions about the behavior of functional ohrb populations in complex systems ohrb genomes typically contain multiple non redundant reductive dehalogenase genes most of which remain functionally uncharacterized regardless it seems at least possible that low dehalogenation rates can be overcome by the presence of alternative organohalides in wwtps as electron acceptors to increase the rate of ohrb mediated dehalogenation in this study ohrb populations were found at high abundance in the mainstream of a wwtp and the microbial community in anoxic sludge from this wwtp was able to dechlorinate triclosan a common organohalide antimicrobial to diclosan providing evidence that organohalide antimicrobials in ppcps could act as substrates to support the growth of ohrb an evaluation of the growth yield supported by triclosan dechlorination in a model ohrb strain d mccartyi strain cg1 suggested that triclosan dechlorination alone could unlikely support the abundance of ohrb detected in the wwtp which implies that other halogenated substrates or interspecies interactions contributed to the sustained presence of ohrb in the wwtp the range of organohalide compounds in wastewater streams that may serve as suitable substrates for ohrb growth will continue to increase along with use of halogenated antimicrobials in consumer products increases and the fate of these compounds in natural and engineered systems warrants further study 5 conclusions ohrb were found in high abundance in both the anoxic and aerobic biological tanks in a domestic wwtp ohrb in the anoxic sludge from this wwtp could dechlorinate triclosan a common organohalide antimicrobial via reductive dehalogenation indicating that biological removal should be considered a relevant contributing process in determinations of the environmental fate of this category of emerging contaminants the occurrence of antimicrobials in domestic wastewater influent could not fully explain the observed abundance of ohrb established functional ohrb populations are resilient to sudden temporary increases in concentrations of organohalide substrates environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan were dechlorinated by d mccartyi strain cg1 via the rdase pcba1 which also catalyzes dechlorination of pcbs and pce declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17858,anthropogenic organohalide contaminants present in wastewater treatment plants wwtps often remain untreated and can be discharged into the environment although organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb contribute to the elimination of anthropogenic organohalides in natural anaerobic environments reductive dehalogenation by ohrb in mainstream wwtps remains poorly understood in this study we quantified ohrb during a long term operation of a municipal wwtp with short hydraulic and sludge retention times 3 h and 1 5 5 days respectively the obligate ohrb were detected at high levels averaging 2 56 1 73 107 and 3 11 1 16 107 16s rrna gene copies ml mlss sludge in anoxic and aerobic zones respectively over the entire sampling period and throughout the wastewater treatment train microcosms derived from mainstream activated sludge contained an unidentified member of the dehalococcoides genus that metabolically dechlorinated triclosan used as a representative emerging organohalide antimicrobial to diclosan suggesting the potential of anaerobic degradation of emerging contaminants in wwtps to further understand the mechanisms for such antimicrobials removal an investigation of dechlorination of triclosan by dehalococcoides strains was conducted dechlorination of environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan to diclosan was observed in dehalococcoides mccartyi strain cg1 yielding 4 59 0 34 108 cells μmole cl removed at a rate of 0 062 μm day and a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0 5 mg l notably both the tolerance of strain cg1 to triclosan and the rate of triclosan dechlorination increased when cg1 was cultured in the presence of both triclosan and tetrachloroethene taken together our results suggest that anaerobic degradation of organohalide antimicrobials might be more prevalent in mainstream wwtps than previously speculated though the low growth yields that are supported by triclosan dechlorination seem to indicate that other organohalide substrates could be necessary to sustain ohrb populations in these systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords organohalide antimicrobials organohalide respiring bacteria dehalococcoides triclosan reductive dechlorination wastewater 1 introduction municipal and industrial wastewater treatment streams contain a variety of halogenated organic pollutants such as pesticides or pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps because of their high hydrophobicity these compounds are presumed to be removed via hydrophobic attachment to biosolids and biomass however changes in organohalide concentrations beyond what can be explained by physical attachment suggest that biological removal constitutes at least some portion of total organohalide removal in wastewater bester 2003 citulski and farahbakhsh 2010 pycke et al 2014 many organohalide pollutants are structurally resistant to aerobic biodegradation hence removal is more likely to occur during anaerobic treatment via reductive dehalogenation nelson et al 2011 villemur 2013 wang et al 2014 in anoxic anaerobic zones of mainstream bioreactors dehalogenating bacterial populations compete with other fast growing anaerobic heterotrophs thus only thriving to exist and less likely being dominant accordingly anaerobic biodegradation of organohalide contaminants in wastewater treatment plants wwtps is generally thought to occur in anaerobic digesters where the bioavailability of organohalides is increased because the extended residence time sludge retention time srt and higher concentration of organohalide substrates in digesters can accommodate the slow enzymatic catalysis performed by low abundance and slow growing organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb benabdallah el hadj et al 2007 fathepure et al 1988 krzmarzick and novak 2014 conversely the short srt and do fluctuations associated with mainstream bioreactors have long been thought to preclude ohrb metabolic activity and the potential for removal of organohalide contaminants in the mainstream by ohrb has been largely overlooked previous studies have demonstrated that ohrb in particular members of the versatile but fastidious dehalococcoides genus can be sustained in microbial communities in lab scale continuous reactors designed to treat chloroethene contaminated water at srt of less than one week carr et al 2000 delgado et al 2014 drzyzga et al 2001 zheng et al 2001 still the low abundance of ohrb and fluctuations in organohalide substrate concentrations in influent wastewater could lead to less dehalogenation activity in the mainstream treatment heidler and halden 2009 smith et al 2015 however increased usage of organohalide antimicrobials in ppcps and common household cleaning agents have resulted in a fairly consistent source of organohalides in municipal wastewater streams heidler and halden 2007 mcclellan and halden 2010 the increased prevalence of these potential growth substrates may be sufficient to support non negligible ohrb in mainstream bioreactors while organohalide antimicrobials can serve as growth supporting substrates for ohrb these same compounds are an existential threat to functional bacterial populations in bioreactors and can adversely affect biological nutrients removal if left unchecked fan et al 2009 kraigher et al 2008 similarly over abundance of halogenated antimicrobials could hinder the growth or metabolic activity of ohrb thereby reducing the potential for biological degradation of total organics therefore it is worth evaluating the feasibility of anaerobic removal of organohalide antimicrobials in mainstream wwtps and identifying the mechanisms by which different organohalide antimicrobials can be removed in bioreactors in the current study we observed ohrb in mainstream bioreactors at a pilot scale wwtp over two years of operation under different reactor configurations and operational parameters variations in ohrb populations were correlated with environmental factors and the dehalogenation potential of different microcosms established from sludge samples was investigated using triclosan as a model emerging organohalide contaminant the mechanism of triclosan degradation in microcosms was evaluated using previously isolated dehalococcoides as a proxy for the triclosan dehalogenating populations in the wwtp microcosms the presence of ohrb in the wwtp together with observed degradation of triclosan in wwtp microcosms demonstrate the potential for dehalogenation of emerging organohalide contaminants

populations in a pilot scale wwtp ulu pandan integrated validation plant singapore were investigated from september 2014 to september 2016 this pilot scale wwtp draws sewage from an existing equalization tank sourced from municipal wastewater at a rate of 1000 m3 day the characteristics of the wastewater influent were described in details in previous study wang et al 2019 briefly the wwtp treatment has a biosorption treatment process followed by biological reactors containing five treatment tanks the biosorption tank was designed to enhance the capture of influent organics to reduce the organic loading at the downstream process and resulting in less aeration and energy consumption the five treatment tanks are in a serial of anoxic anoxic swing swing aerobic zones allowing different operational configurations swing zone refers to the possible dissolved oxygen do switch between anoxic and aerobic zones anoxic and aerobic microbial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss samples 50 ml were collected monthly from the point between the two anoxic zones do 0 mg l below detection limit and the point between the two swing zones 0 6 mg l do 2 2 mg l respectively and transported on ice to the laboratory within 30 min samples were mixed thoroughly before 1 ml was withdrawn and centrifuged 12 000 rpm at 4 c supernatants were aspirated and cell pellets were stored at 20 c for further processing total genomic dna was extracted from cell pellets with the qiagen dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen gmbh hilden germany according to the manufacturer s instructions genomic dna from two zones anoxic and swing zones at two time points sep 2014 and sep 2016 was pooled and ohrb identified by pcr with genus specific primers appendices table s1 ohrb in low abundance were identified by nested pcr using the universal bacterial primers 8f 1392r followed by amplification with genus specific primers genus specific primers targeting dehalobium desulfuromongeas desulfoluna and desulfomonile were designed based on the 16s rrna gene sequences of known ohrb in the ncbi database appendices using primer3 rozen and skaletsky 2000 and primer specificity was estimated synthetically via primer blast ohrb were quantified by real time quantitative pcr qpcr conducted on an abi 7500 fast system using the sybr green reporter lo rox kit sensifast sybr bioline the thermocycler program was initiated at 95 c for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 94 c and 30 s at 53 63 c depending on primer annealing temperature appendices table s1 absolute quantification

environmental parameters and ohrb abundance twenty seven samples were collected each at the point between the two anoxic tanks and the point between the two swing tanks thus a total of fifty four sets of microbial samples were obtained from the two tanks over a period of two years environmental variables including volatile fatty acids vfa dissolved oxygen do and inorganic minerals such as phosphate so4 2 ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 were measured during sample collection as previously described wang et al 2019 correlations between ohrb abundance at the genus level and water quality parameters were inferred by analysis of variance anova a pearson s correlation coefficient was calculated between bacterial genera and environmental variables recorded at different time points t test was performed to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two compared groups and the confidence level was set at 95 p 0 05 statistical analyses and plots were calculated with originpro 2017 originlab 2017 2 4 identification of triclosan reductive dehalogenase in d mccartyi strain cg1 the triclosan reductive dehalogenase rdase was identified by monitoring the expressed proteome during dechlorination cells from cultures of d mccartyi strain cg1 provided only triclosan as a growth substrate for eight consecutive subcultures were harvested and crude cell proteins were extracted digested with trypsin and analyzed via nano lc ms ms as previously described zhao et al 2017 identification of peptides and proteins was validated if 95 and 99 probability were achieved by the paragon algorithm shilov et al 2007 respectively in vitro assays to determine dehalogenase functionality were carried out in 4 ml vials containing 2 ml assay solution 2 mm methyl viologen 1 5 mm titanium iii citrate 100 mm tris hcl buffer at ph 7 0 inside an anaerobic chamber as previously described adrian et al 2007 triclosan 1 5 μm and pce 3 0 μm were added as indicated to 4 ml vials containing the assay solution the test was initiated by addition of cell extracts from triclosan or pce fed cultures respectively and the mixtures were incubated at 30 c for 24 h prior to headspace analysis 2 5 triclosan minimal inhibitory concentrations of d mccartyi strains the minimal inhibitory concentration mic of triclosan for d mccartyi strains mb cg1 cg4 and cg5 was investigated by exposure to different concentrations of triclosan 0 2 2 ppm as indicated because d mccartyi are obligate ohrb pce 0 5 mm was amended as an electron acceptor along with triclosan and pce dechlorination kinetics were used to evaluate the inhibitory effects of triclosan further investigation of inhibitory effects of triclosan on cell growth in the presence of other organohalide substrates were carried out in strain cg1 cell density of strain cg1 amended with both pce 0 5 mm and triclosan 0 2 2 ppm was enumerated by qpcr 2 6 transcription of the triclosan dehalogenase transcription of gene catalyzing triclosan dechlorination was investigated in cells of strain cg1 that had been grown to completion i e complete dechlorination of 0 3 mm pce to dces and then starved for 5 d to minimize residual rna after starvation pce 0 3 mm and triclosan 0 5 mg l were added simultaneously to starved cultures gene expression was determined via reverse transcription pcr followed by qpcr rt qpcr briefly 2 5 ml cultures were collected 1 ml for dna extraction and 1 5 ml for rna extraction at 12 h intervals and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm and 4 c for 10 min pellets for rna extraction were immediately re suspended in trizol reagent and stored at 80 c until further processing rna was later extracted using a modified trizol and qiagen rneasy mini kit protocol as previously described ding et al 2014 luciferase mrna promega madison wi was added to each rna sample as an internal control of the efficiency of rna extraction cdna synthesis and qpcr amplification on column digestion with rnase free dnase was performed to remove residual genomic dna rt pcr was performed immediately after rna elution using the qiagen sensiscript kit qiagen with random hexa primers and rnase inhibitor promega 3 results 3 1 correlation between ohrb abundance and environmental factors in wwtp eight morphologically different genera known to contain ohrb were found in the anoxic do 0 mg l below detection limit and swing 0 6 mg l do 2 2 mg l tanks of the wwtp including bacterial genera known to be obligate ohrb whose growth relies upon reductive dehalogenation of organohalides dehalococcoides dehalogenimonas and dehalobium or to contain facultative ohrb which can grow on electron acceptors rather than organohalides desulfitobacterium desulfovibrio sulfurospirillum anaeromyxobacter and desulfoluna the abundance of these eight ohrb populations ranged over several orders of magnitude from 6 25 4 8 104 16s rrna gene copies ml desulfoluna in the swing tank to 2 30 0 94 107 16s rrna gene copies ml dehalobium in the swing tank table 1 and fig 1 the coefficients of variation for each bacterial population ranged from a minimum of 34 12 dehalococcoides to a maximum of 146 51 dehalogenimonas both in the anoxic tank table 1 the average total abundance of the ohrb bacterial populations was 5 25 1 62 107 and 5 35 1 97 107 16s rrna gene copies ml sludge in the anoxic and swing tanks respectively notably the average total abundance of the three obligate ohrb populations whose growth relies upon reductive dehalogenation of organohalides was 2 56 1 73 107 and 3 11 1 16 107 16s rrna gene copies ml in the anoxic and swing tanks respectively representing 0 02 2 76 and 0 04 1 23 of the total bacterial communities respectively differences in the abundance of every obligate ohrb containing genus in the anoxic and swing tanks were statistically significant p 0 05 but the differences in the abundance of facultative ohrb containing genera were not statistically significant p 0 05 fig 2 the abundance of these eight genera showed weak correlations with each other 0 31 r 0 53 p 0 05 with one exception of positive correlations between two obligate ohrb genera dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas r 0 66 p 0 05 which might suggest that the different populations are occupying different niches within the system fig 2 the close correlation between dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas is possibly due to their similar growth environment similarly as for the operational parameters srt and do both differed in anoxic and swing zones p 0 05 only weak negative correlations were observed between do and the abundance of dehalogenimonas r 0 33 p 0 05 and dehalococcoides r 0 27 p 0 05 and between srt and the abundance of dehalobium r 0 27 p 0 05 as in the mlss samples acetate and n nh4 were below detection limit and n no3 n no2 and so4 2 were averaged at 2 54 2 51 mg l 0 24 0 31 mg l and 57 07 6 14 mg l respectively though n no3 and n no2 exhibited differences in anoxic and swing zones p 0 05 n no3 n no2 and so4 2 were barely shown correlations with the eight genera 3 2 organohalide antimicrobials as electron acceptors for ohrb in domestic wwtps the sustained presence of obligate ohrb in the wwtp suggests that these bacterial populations could effectively harvest sufficient growth supporting substrates from the influent wastewater since increased use in consumer products has led to higher and more consistent concentrations of halogenated antimicrobials in domestic wastewater the potential exists for these compounds to support growth of ohrb in wwtps the ability of ohrb to utilize chloramphenicol chlortetracycline triclocarban triclosan and diclofenac which have been detected in wastewater at biologically meaningful concentrations tran et al 2018 as growth supporting substrates was investigated antimicrobial compounds were spiked into microcosms established from sludge collected from the anoxic tank of the wwtp 5 vol vol inocula at different concentrations 0 5 20 ppm of these triclosan was the only compound that exhibited biological degradation after 30 days incubation under strict anaerobic growth conditions fig 3 a no additional dechlorination was observed upon extended incubation to determine which ohrb population s could be responsible for the transformation of triclosan bacterial abundance in the microcosms was quantified before and after incubation in the presence of 0 5 ppm triclosan fig 3b the only potential ohrb population whose abundance differed significantly between microcosms with and without triclosan amendment was dehalococcoides which increased 6 5 folds from 5 67 105 to 4 27 106 16s rrna gene copies ml in microcosms amended with triclosan and decreased by 58 from 5 67 105 to 2 34 105 in microcosms without triclosan together with the change in abundance of dehalococcoides with production of diclosan from the dechlorination of triclosan fig 3a dehalococcoides is likely involved in triclosan transformation in the microcosms 3 3 reductive dechlorination of triclosan by previously isolated dehalococcoides mccartyi strains to better understand whether the prevalence of organohalide antimicrobials in wastewater could lead to the establishment of ohrb populations capable of biologically detoxifying these same compounds in wwtps we evaluated capability of previously isolated d mccartyi strains to metabolically dehalogenate triclosan as the microcosms established from the anoxic tank of the wwtp demonstrated that one or more dehalococcoides played a role in triclosan dehalogenation we screened a representative array of previously identified d mccartyi strains for triclosan dechlorination to elicit the genetic mechanism underlying this phenotype among eight d mccartyi strains tested in this study only one d mccartyi strain cg1 wang et al 2014 exhibited reductive dechlorination of triclosan after three months incubation d mccartyi strain cg1 completely dechlorinated 0 5 mg l 1 5 μm triclosan to diclosan within 28 days at an average rate of 0 062 μm day and with a growth yield of 4 59 0 34 108 μmole cl removal fig 4 the initial triclosan concentration had a notable impact on growth yield with higher initial concentrations resulting in decreased cell growth appendices table s2 i e higher concentrations 1 0 mg ml resulting in a 49 reduction in growth yield 2 34 0 27 108 μmole cl removal compared to the yield observed at 0 5 mg ml triclosan a high initial triclosan concentration also caused a decrease in the growth rate of strain cg1 from 0 10 d to 0 04 d at 0 5 and 1 0 mg l triclosan respectively similarly elevated concentrations of triclosan 1 ppm reduced the rate of pce dechlorination by strain cg1 fig 5 a and b this metabolic suppression was even more pronounced in other d mccartyi strains appendices fig s1 hydrophobic organohalides such as triclosan may be present at much higher concentrations in the anaerobic compartments of bioreactors than in the influent as these compounds tend to sorb to organic particles and reside in the system for prolonged periods of time it seems unlikely however that triclosan concentrations within a bioreactor would exceed 0 5 ppm a concentration that effectively inhibited metabolic activity of all dehalococcoides tested other than cg1 appendices fig s1 fig 5a the growth yield of our model system d mccartyi strain cg1 from triclosan suggests that 0 5 ppm triclosan alone would be insufficient to support the abundance of dehalococcoides we observed in the wwtp however multiple organohalide pollutants typically coexist in domestic wastewater and it is possible that metabolic dechlorination of one or more other halogenated compound along with low levels of triclosan could support a higher density of dehalococcoides cells indeed the cell density we observed when strain cg1 was incubated with both pce and triclosan amendment fig 5c supports such a hypothesis nano liquid chromatography lc ms ms was used to identify proteins that were highly expressed during triclosan dechlorination by strain cg1 of 65 proteins captured confidence 95 table 2 the third most abundant one was matched with a rdase pcba1 with 62 3 sequence coverage of the detected peptides 314 504 aa this same protein was previously found to dechlorinate both pce and pcbs in strain cg1 wang et al 2014 and was the only rdase expressed during triclosan dechlorination in vitro activity assays of crude cell lysates from cg1 cultures grown on pce or triclosan showed that pce fed cultures could dechlorinate triclosan and vice versa suggesting the same functionality in rdase induced by triclosan or pce together these results indicate that pcba1 is responsible for the observed triclosan dechlorination in strain cg1 3 4 effects of sudden increases in concentration of organohalide antimicrobials to evaluate whether sudden temporary exposure to elevated concentrations of antimicrobials could inhibit the metabolic activity of ohrb in bioreactors cultures of strain cg1 pre grown with pce to a high density 5 0 108 cells ml were capable of sustaining dechlorination of additional amendment of pce even in the presence of high triclosan concentrations fig 6 a there were no apparent differences in the levels of pcba1 transcription in pre grown cultures during pce dechlorination in the presence of different concentrations of 0 1 mg l triclosan but pcba1 transcription was significantly reduced p 0 05 at 2 mg l triclosan and was absent at 5 mg l triclosan correspondingly the rate of pce dechlorination in cells exposed to 2 mg ml triclosan was reduced and in cells exposed to 5 mg ml triclosan ceased completely after 10 h fig 6b pce dechlorination between 0 and 10 h in 5 mg ml triclosan was likely due to existing pcba1 in the cells 4 discussion biological removal of organohalide contaminants in wwtps is assumed to occur primarily in anaerobic digesters and it is generally believed that the low concentrations of organohalide contaminants and short srt of mainstream bioreactors limit ohrb metabolic activity krzmarzick and novak 2014 nelson et al 2011 villemur 2013 wang et al 2014 while effluent concentrations of organohalide contaminants are often lower than is predicted by models based solely on physical removal processes i e hydrophobic attachment to biosolids or biomass biological removal has been mostly neglected as a potential source of this observed discrepancy bester 2003 heidler and halden 2007 oulton et al 2010 in the current study we detected a persistently high abundance of bacterial genera known to contain ohrb in the mainstream treatment tanks of a wastewater treatment plant over long term operation evidence that ohrb may function in mainstream treatment systems despite low influent substrate concentrations and short srt the slow growth of ohrb particularly obligate ohrb presents a major challenge to incorporating these microorganisms into mainstream bioreactors due to the short hrt and srt the hrt and srt of the investigated wwtp were 3 h and 1 5 5 d respectively 2 5 5 d in the anoxic tank and 1 5 3 d in the swing tank which are commonly used wwtp operational parameters interestingly we found that the abundance of genera known to contain ohrb was not correlated with srt ranging between 1 5 d and 5 d in the mainstream wwtp which may indicate that these populations can at least survive under these conditions though limited information on the effects of longer srt on dehalogenation of organohalide compounds previous studies have demonstrated effective dehalogenation of organohalide compounds such as chlorinated phenols chlorinated benzenes and polychlorinated biphenyls under a much longer srt of several weeks krzmarzick and novak 2014 suggesting a correlation between the abundance of functional bacterial populations and the elongated srt would be expected evidence from a lab scale continuous up flow bioreactor with an hrt of 3 h showing complete removal of trichloroethene by ohrb delgado et al 2017 provides additional support for this idea in the study by delgado et al self aggregation and bio flocculation of dehalococcoides enabled a trichloroethene high removal rate and no significant differences in dehalococcoides abundance were found at longer hrt furthermore the comparatively moderate doubling time and low monod half maximum rate concentrations of dehalococcoides isolates and some dehalococcoides containing enrichment cultures suggest that these bacteria could dehalogenate an appreciable level of organohalides in continuous flow reactors under normal operating conditions other environmental factors such as the availability of potential electron acceptors like nitrate nitrite and do could potentially affect the growth and persistence of ohrb populations in bioreactors in the current study variations in the abundance of ohrb containing genera in the anoxic and swing tanks were not correlated with nitrate or nitrite while the do exhibited selective correlation with obligate ohrb dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas respiring solely on organohalides for growth rather than facultative ohrb able to use other electron acceptors other than organohalides meanwhile dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas were the only two bacterial genera among the eight investigated ones exhibited differences p 0 05 between anoxic and swing tanks that the abundance of both genera in the anoxic tank were higher than that in the swing tanks this suggests the occurrence of respiration of organohalides in anoxic tank though the aerobic condition in swing tank makes the reductive dehalogenation of organohalides less common than that in anoxic tank the formation of anaerobic microenvironments in activated sludge flocs may accommodate the ohrb to respire organohalides when the oxidation reduction potential at the inner layer of the flocs can go down to strictly anaerobic conditions nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 wilén et al 2018 meeting the ohrb required conditions holliger et al 1998 the presence and activity of ohrb are strongly influenced by the availability of organohalide substrates the stability of bacterial populations corresponding to different ohrb containing genera particularly of obligate ohrb genera suggests the presence is a relatively consistent source of halogenated substrate additionally positive correlations in the abundance of obligate ohrb populations with each other suggests either that the concentration or diversity of organohalides in the anoxic reactor of the wwtp is sufficient to sustain multiple ohrb populations among the obligate ohrb dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas genomes are known to harbor a large number of non redundant rdase encoding homologous genes rdhas löffler et al 2013 yang et al 2017 that enable utilization of multiple halogenated compounds adaptation to changes in availability of halogenated compounds and survival in relatively low concentrations of halogenated compounds in the wwtp obligate ohrb comprised 0 47 0 23 and 0 59 0 10 of the microbial community in the anoxic and swing tank respectively almost 30 times more having been previously reported in anaerobic digesters smith et al 2015 this difference is due to the lower total biomass in the mainstream tank as the absolute quantity of ohrb 5 25 1 62 107 and 5 35 1 97 107 16s rrna gene copies ml in anoxic and swing tank respectively in this study and the previous report is comparable the absolute quantity of ohrb observed in the wwtp mainstream is likely sufficient for dehalogenation as previous reports have demonstrated adequate dehalogenation of chloroethenes with as few as 3 6 0 6 106 dehalococcoides g soil behrens et al 2008 or as little as 0 5 4 dehalococcoides in the microbial community azizian et al 2008 in lab scale continuous flow column reactors the organohalide antimicrobials frequently used in ppcps are discharged to municipal wastewater streams continuously and have come to be seen as emerging contaminants aerobic degradation of triclosan to inorganics has been reported both in mainstream wwtps and by bacteria isolated from activated sludge lee et al 2014 mulla et al 2016 but few studies have investigated reductive dehalogenation of triclosan in these systems we detected dechlorination of triclosan that corresponded with growth of a dehalococcoides population in microcosms established from anaerobic bioreactor sludge and in a previously isolated d mccartyi strain cg1 a possibility that has only been hinted at until now mcnamara and krzmarzick 2013 results from the wwtp provide evidence that ohrb may be responsible for dehalogenation of halogenated antimicrobials in wwtps the inhibitory effects on bacterial metabolisms are an important consideration in determining the environmental fate of antimicrobials we did not observe declines in ohrb populations that might be expected after long term exposure to triclosan above 2 mg l a concentration rarely seen in wwtps additionally experiments using a previously isolated triclosan dechlorinating d mccartyi strain suggest that established dechlorinating populations in wwtps can be easily sustained and resumed under a sudden shock even above minimal inhibitory concentration because the transcriptional and enzymatic activity starts to be affected at much higher concentrations 10 mg l this suggests that the microbial systems could be resilient to sudden shocks of halogenated compounds at levels exceeding otherwise inhibitory concentrations concentrations of triclosan in wwtps vary over a wide range with detected concentrations ranging from 0 086 mg l in wastewater influent to 133 mg kg dry weight in biosolids in a conversion to up to 3 99 mg l in sludge based on up to 3 biosolid content in sludge from wwtps krzmarzick and novak 2014 suggesting that dehalococcoides might not be inhibited at relevant level of triclosan in wwtps the rate of reductive dehalogenation also governs the fate of antimicrobials in wastewater streams a pure culture of d mccartyi strain cg1 grown in optimized conditions dechlorinated triclosan at a slower rate 0 062 μm day than other chlorinated substrates wang et al 2014 but the presence of alternate electron accepters i e pce together with triclosan resulted in much more rapid dechlorination of triclosan 0 245 μm day the increased rate of triclosan dechlorination can be explained by both pce and triclosan being dechlorinated by the same rdase in strain cg1 emphasizing the need to fully characterize the functional range of rdases to better inform predictions about the behavior of functional ohrb populations in complex systems ohrb genomes typically contain multiple non redundant reductive dehalogenase genes most of which remain functionally uncharacterized regardless it seems at least possible that low dehalogenation rates can be overcome by the presence of alternative organohalides in wwtps as electron acceptors to increase the rate of ohrb mediated dehalogenation in this study ohrb populations were found at high abundance in the mainstream of a wwtp and the microbial community in anoxic sludge from this wwtp was able to dechlorinate triclosan a common organohalide antimicrobial to diclosan providing evidence that organohalide antimicrobials in ppcps could act as substrates to support the growth of ohrb an evaluation of the growth yield supported by triclosan dechlorination in a model ohrb strain d mccartyi strain cg1 suggested that triclosan dechlorination alone could unlikely support the abundance of ohrb detected in the wwtp which implies that other halogenated substrates or interspecies interactions contributed to the sustained presence of ohrb in the wwtp the range of organohalide compounds in wastewater streams that may serve as suitable substrates for ohrb growth will continue to increase along with use of halogenated antimicrobials in consumer products increases and the fate of these compounds in natural and engineered systems warrants further study 5 conclusions ohrb were found in high abundance in both the anoxic and aerobic biological tanks in a domestic wwtp ohrb in the anoxic sludge from this wwtp could dechlorinate triclosan a common organohalide antimicrobial via reductive dehalogenation indicating that biological removal should be considered a relevant contributing process in determinations of the environmental fate of this category of emerging contaminants the occurrence of antimicrobials in domestic wastewater influent could not fully explain the observed abundance of ohrb established functional ohrb populations are resilient to sudden temporary increases in concentrations of organohalide substrates environmentally relevant concentrations of triclosan were dechlorinated by d

17859,in this study magnetic ion exchange miex resin was evaluated to remove six carboxylic and three sulfonic pfas at environmentally relevant concentrations 300 ng l in groundwater with low organic content and aromaticity 0 78 mg l of dissolved organic carbon doc and 0 96 l mg 1m 1 of specific uv absorbance suva in order to evaluate pfas adsorption the apparent equilibrium constant for pfas adsorption in a dilute system was derived as an indicator of the adsorption capacity of miex in adsorption of pfas hydrophobic interactions induced by difluoromethylene and trifluoromethyl groups are known to be effective however the hydrophobic and charge interactions caused by such functional groups are not easily differentiable from each other since both are additive with respect to the chain length in this study the total negative atomic charge q i was calculated using density functional theory dft calculation and correlated with the apparent equilibrium constants the negative atomic charge showed better correlation than the hydrophobicity log d ow at ph 7 of pfas suggesting that the charge interaction would be a more plausible role of fluorinated moieties for adsorption in the miex process than the hydrophobic interaction this was also bolstered by the similar adsorption kinetics and equilibrium of pfos log d ow 3 05 and its less hydrophobic isomer log d ow 2 79 but with almost identical total negative atomic charge 8 05 and 8 06 of q i respectively the regeneration efficiency of miex was also assessed almost complete restoration of pfas adsorption capacity was achieved after 30 min of a regeneration process with a 10 w w nacl solution as a regenerant the efficient regeneration was attributed to the effective desorption of dissolved organic matter that occupied sorptive sites predominantly graphical abstract image 1 keywords per and polyfluorinated alkylsubstance pfas groundwater ion exchange atomic charge hydrophobic interaction regeneration 1 introduction per and polyfluorinated alkylsubstances pfas are a class of aliphatic organofluorine compounds in which the hydrogens attached are either partially or fully substituted by fluorine recently there have been many studies on pfas occurrence and its treatment technologies due to their recalcitrant nature in the environment hu et al 2016 munoz et al 2017 sun et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 along with the prevalence of pfas in the aquatic environment significant public concerns are also associated with many different health endpoints such as developmental effects sagiv et al 2015 kidney and testicular cancer barry et al 2013 immune mediated liver damage qazi et al 2013 and endocrine disrupting effects berg et al 2015 pfas toxicity is compound specific and different behavioral modifications were reported among different pfas jantzen et al 2016 compared to perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorononanoic acid pfna for instance perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos caused more significant gene expression changes that potentially alternate calcium ion binding cell cycle regulation and aromatic compound metabolism jantzen et al 2016 in addition sulfonic pfas caused greater developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos than carboxylic pfas at the same carbon chain length while longer chain pfas have greater toxicity than shorter chain pfas ulhaq et al 2013 a large number of treatment technologies for pfas attenuation have been studied over the past decades while advanced electrochemical oxidation and plasma based processes seem promising schaefer et al 2017 stratton et al 2017 zhuo et al 2011 the predominant treatment technologies in practice are adsorption processes using activated carbons and ion exchange resins due to their cost effectiveness du et al 2014 while both adsorption processes are effective for the abatement of pfas ion exchange resins have been reported to be more effective particularly for shorter chain and sulfonic pfas at environmentally relevant concentrations woodard et al 2017 the predominant mode of operation for anion exchange resins is a fixed bed adsorber single use resins have attracted commercial applications partly because operators do not need to be concerned about their regeneration horst et al 2018 furthermore hysteresis and the irreversible nature of hydrophobic pfas uptake by resins accompany difficulty in their regeneration which also attributes to the commercial popularity of single use resins carter and farrell 2010 while the benefits of single use resin exist regenerable resins can provide a more sustainable operation in this study magnetic anion exchange miex resin was investigated to attenuate pfas in groundwaters magnetic properties of miex enable their fast agglomeration into larger particles which increases their settleability miex is operated in an up flow fluidized reactor that diverts a small portion of settled resins e g 5 10 to a regeneration system for continuous operation cadee et al 2000 more importantly understanding the performance of miex for pfas attenuation can be beneficial for water treatment facilities in the practice of miex currently many water utilities operate miex systems to reduce dissolved organic matter dom therefore reducing chlorine demand for disinfection and controlling precursors of disinfection by product dbp csiropedia 2014 hence the investigation of miex efficacy for the attenuation of pfas in a drinking water source not only can help augment the water supply portfolio for treatment facilities in the current practice of miex but also can provide useful information to those considering an upgrade of treatment systems to control pfas as well as dbp formation a few research studies reported the use of miex for the attenuation of pfas two independent studies tested miex for the attenuation of a suite of pfas in various water matrices arevalo perez 2014 lundgren 2014 the studies concurred that longer chain pfas than shorter ones and sulfonic pfas than carboxylic ones exhibited better attenuation which is in agreement with the findings of many other anion exchange resin studies ateia et al 2019 mccleaf et al 2017 woodard et al 2017 in line with such studies many studies concluded or postulated that hydrophobic interactions can play important roles in the sorption of pfas franke et al 2019 zaggia et al 2016 in a wide consensus acidic groups play the predominant roles in pfas adsorption in ion exchange processes however the roles of trifluoromethyl and difluoromethylene groups of pfas for adsorption was not yet pellucid because such functional groups induce both hydrophobicity and negative charges of pfas zaggia et al tested three anion exchange resins with different hydrophobicities and concluded that hydrophobic interaction was important in the extent of adsorption zaggia et al 2016 while it is a striking finding there was evidence in the same study that factors other than hydrophobic interactions would play significant roles in pfas adsorption in their study the most hydrophobic resin i e purolite a532e outperformed the other two resins i e purolite a520e and a600e for the adsorption of hydrophilic pfba c4 and marginally hydrophobic pfbs c4 which are anticipated to have minimal hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions in contrast the hydrophobic resin performed marginally better for the corresponding longer chain hydrophobic pfas i e pfoa c8 and pfos c8 that are anticipated to have hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions indeed dixit et al showed the stoichiometric balance between equivalents of chloride release and pfas uptake indicating that ion exchange was the predominant role of attenuation dixit et al 2019 2020 all in all demands for a clearer understanding of surface interactions in ion exchange processes persist the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and performance affecting factors of pfas adsorption in groundwater by miex to this end a mixing chamber containing solutions with miex and pfas was tested as a means of simulating a fluidized bed reactor in order to assess the roles of pfas moieties other than acidic groups including difluoromethylene and trifluoromethyl two physical parameters such as the sum of negative atomic charges calculated by density functional theory dft calculation and octanol water partition coefficient at ph 7 hereinafter log d ow were correlated with the apparent equilibrium constant of adsorption in addition the regeneration of miex was also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 miex exposure experiment groundwater was collected via a tap in tucson az usa and spiked with 300 ng l of the selected pfas after a day of natural dechlorination the tested groundwater had low dissolved organic concentration doc and low aromaticity 0 78 mg l of doc and 0 96 l mg 1m 1 of specific uv absorbance suva other water quality parameters are shown in table s1 in the supplementary material miex doc resin miex hereinafter was used for the testing of pfas removal the list of tested pfas is shown in table 1 as recommended by the manufacturer miex was stored wet in a 5 nacl solution until use before using miex it was rinsed with di water three times of the volume of the resin since miex is in a slurry form its dose was determined based on v v concentration to this end the resin was allowed to settle in a conical tube and was placed above a magnet to accelerate the settling the applied miex doses were 2 4 8 and 15 ml l the groundwater was spiked and mixed with miex at 300 rpm 350 sec 1 of velocity gradient g using a jar tester phipps bird pb900 for 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 90 and 120 min contact times for the kinetic experiment section 3 1 at the desired contact time a jar was placed on a magnet and miex was allowed to settle for 1 min subsequently the supernatant was collected and refrigerated at 4 c until chemical analyses pfas removals at 240 min exposure times were used for the equilibrium concentrations for section 3 4 suwannee river nom srnom was spiked into the tested groundwater to assess the effects of dom on the apparent equilibrium constant of adsorption k a i it is noteworthy that the srnom standard spiking aims to increase the overall organic content responsible for the competitive adsorption hence the compositional difference between srnom and organic matrices of the tested groundwater was not scrutinized the spiked water was exposed to 8 ml l of miex for 240 min and k a i was calculated using eq 4 i e single point calculation whereas k a i values for the original groundwater section 3 2 were obtained using curve fitting of multiple concentration data for a given pfas 2 2 regeneration of miex the pristine miex at 4 ml l dose was exposed to the groundwater containing pfas for 30 min the treated water was collected for pfas analysis to evaluate the adsorption efficiency of the pristine resin subsequently the exhausted miex was regenerated with a 10 w w nacl solution two bed volumes of the solution were added into a conical tube with the exhausted resins and stirred for 30 60 90 and 120 min the regenerated resins were exposed to the same groundwater for 30 min to evaluate the recovery of adsorption capability of miex 2 3 analytical methods doc was measured using a shimadzu toc analyzer japan samples were filtered with 0 45 μm syringe filters pvdf millex hv emd millipore subsequently acidified with hydrochloric acid 37 acs grade sigma aldrich to a ph of 2 3 in order to calculate suva absorbance spectra were acquired using a horiba aqualog fluorometer horiba jobin yvon nine pfas table 1 were analyzed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography agilent technologies 1290 tandem mass spectrometer agilent technologies 6490 lc ms ms the high throughput direct injection method was employed with the isotope dilution method an agilent zorbax rrhd eclipse plus c 18 column 100 nm 2 1 mm 1 8 μm was used for chromatographic separation the mobile phase was composed of hplc water with 5 mm ammonium acetate and methanol which was supplied to the separation column at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min the detailed information of isotope dilution mass spectrometer parameters qa qc and mobile phase gradient can be found in our previous study park et al 2020 ftir spectra were collected using a nicolet nexus 670 ir spectrometer madison wi with a kbr beam splitter and a deuterated triglycine sulfate dtgs detector samples were freeze dried then mixed with ir grade kbr and compressed into pellets 1 sample for each sample 64 scans were collected over the spectral range of 400 4000 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 2 4 adsorption kinetic models in this study the pseudo first order and second order kinetic models were implemented to obtain the apparent adsorption rate constants it should be emphasized here that the kinetic models do not directly address important transport mechanisms such as intraparticle diffusion and were used only for the calculation of apparent adsorption rate and equilibrium solid phase concentration the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations are expressed in eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 log q e q log q e k 1 2 303 t 2 1 q e q 1 q e k 2 t where q and q e are the solid phase concentrations on the adsorbents at a specific time and at equilibrium respectively ng pfas ml miex k 1 and k 2 are the apparent rate constants of pseudo first and second order adsorptions respectively s 1 and ml miex ng pfas 1s 1 respectively and t is the contact time it is noteworthy mentioning that q e was fitted along with the rate constants i e k 1 and k 2 although the experimental equilibrium constants are available because the use of the experimental values resulted in low goodness of fit values for the rate constants of pfba and pfpea data not shown the sole purpose of this fitting process is to evaluate the adsorption rate of pfas quantitatively therefore the equilibrium constants were also fitted to quantify the adsorption kinetics accurately overall the goodness of fit r 2 values for both kinetic models showed high values in this study the pseudo second order model fitted the data slightly better table s2 since it fits well data that has a rapid initial increase followed by a leveling off simonin 2016 therefore the kinetic parameters of the second order model were used in this study it is noteworthy that the rate constant k 2 is a measure of how fast pfas reaches the equilibrium concentration not of how fast pfas is adsorbed in an absolute manner 2 5 natural population analysis for calculating elemental charges elemental charges were calculated to assess their effects on the extent of ion exchange using dft calculation to this end all the tested pfas structures were drawn using avogadro software and their geometries were optimized with the mmff94 force field method hanwell et al 2012 subsequently cartesian coordinates of the molecular geometries generated in avogadro software were entered in an ab initio dft calculation software orca orca 4 2 1 for the calculation of electronic structures neese 2018 the three parameter hybrid functional with becke and lee yang parr correlation b3lyp with valence triple zeta with two sets of polarization functions def2 tzvpp was employed the solvent effects were computed by the conductor like polarizable continuum model cpcm with a static dielectric constant and refractive index of water 80 4 and 1 33 respectively natural population analysis npa was conducted using an open source java software janpa nikolaienko et al 2014 there are several branched isomers of pfos e g perfluoro n methyl heptanesulfonates pnmhps and perfluoro n n dimethyl hexanesulfonates the technical grade of the pfos standard contains mainly monotrifluoromethyl branched isomers i e pnmhps as an impurity gebbink and letcher 2010 npa values of five selected pnmhps i e n 2 to 6 were similar to each other table s3 since p6mhps was the most abundant in the technical grade standard as well as in the environment gebbink and letcher 2010 greaves and letcher 2013 p6mhps was selected as a representative pfos isomer and its npa value was used for this study 2 6 multiple linear regression a way to estimate the degree of contribution of each chemical descriptor to the prediction is to establish a predictive model like a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar followed by sensitivity analysis park et al 2015 in this study two chemical descriptors the total negative atomic charge q i and octanol water partition coefficient log d ow at ph 7 log d ow i were considered as potential factors influencing the equilibrium of pfas in miex in order to measure each parameters contribution to the equilibrium multiple linear regression was carried out to fit the apparent equilibrium constants of pfas k a i with respect to q i and log d ow i after their normalization using the subsequent equation 3 l o g k a i ˆ a 1 a 2 l o g d o w i ˆ a 3 q i ˆ a 4 l o g d o w i ˆ q i ˆ where the parameters with a hat symbol indicate normalized values a 1 to a 4 are the fitting parameters for sensitivity analysis the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method with a million iterations was employed park et al 2011 a detailed procedure of sensitivity analysis is included in the supplementary material section s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of pfas adsorption by miex fig 1 illustrates the percent removal a and solid phase concentration q b of pfas in the groundwater with doc of 0 78 mg l and suva of 0 96 l mg 1m 1 at 4 ml l of miex dose the results for the other resin doses can be found in figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary material all the tested pfas were rapidly removed at the early contact time 20 min and subsequently plateaued longer chain carboxylic pfas were removed to a greater extent at the corresponding contact time for instance pfoa c8 removal at 20 min is 55 whereas pfba c4 removal at the corresponding contact time is 20 similarly the same trend was found for sulfonic pfas 85 and 70 of removal for pfos c8 and pfbs c4 at 20 min respectively with the same chain length pfas with sulfonate exhibited greater removal than those with carboxylate at the corresponding contact times that is pfbs c4 and pfos c8 exhibited 50 and 30 higher removal at 20 min than the corresponding carboxylic pfas pfba and pfoa respectively this result is in agreement with the observations in other studies mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 in contrast an opposite observation can also be found in the literature yu et al showed that pfoa c8 exhibited much higher abatement than pfos c8 by an anion exchange resin yu et al 2009 such discrepancy may be attributed to the initial concentrations of pfas in the tested waters a factor that can influence the formation of micelles or hemi micelles when surfactant concentrations exceed critical micelle concentration cmc micelles start forming or the hemi micelle formation can also be expected when the surfactant concentration is two or three orders of magnitude smaller than cmc johnson et al 2007 since pfos in yu et al s study had a three fold lower concentration than cmc it is possible that pfos selectively form hemi micelles which can be size excluded by micropores of adsorbents therefore inaccessible to the primary sorptive sites of micropores however the pfas concentrations applied in this study are at a part per trillion level i e ng l about seven orders of magnitude smaller than cmc in the aquatic environment such as groundwater surface water and treated wastewater effluents pfas occur in ng l level ranges arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 hu et al 2016 therefore hemi micelle formation is not likely to occur since cmc values of pfos and pfoa 16 000 and 4600 mg l respectively are much higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations while the relative adsorption kinetic trends were similar to each other the inverse relationship of k 2 and q e obtained using the pseudo second order kinetic equation indicates that pfas with less adsorption affinity reaches the equilibrium faster than those with a greater affinity fig 2 such an inverse relationship cannot be explained by the physicochemical properties of pfas alone surface diffusion could not be the rate limiting step since more favorably adsorbing pfas therefore likely having the greater driving force of surface diffusion showed lower k 2 values bulk diffusivity also does not explain the lower k 2 value of pfbs d 7 15 10 6 cm2 s than pfhxa d 6 58 10 6 cm2 s and pfpea d 7 19 10 6 cm2 s fig s4 and table 1 the inverse relation of k 2 and q e of pfas might be explained by the effects of dom on adsorption dom is the predominant organic matter occupying sorptive sites since their concentration i e 0 8 mg l is much higher than pfas i e 300 ng l the area of sportive sites would have dwindled as the adsorption of dom progressed which gradually diminishes available sportive sites for less favorably adsorbing pfas first maimaiti et al s observation also bolsters the roles of competing adsorbates on pfas adsorption maimaiti et al 2018 in their study faster adsorption kinetics of pfbs c4 and pfhxa c6 at the beginning of adsorption subsequently their desorption occurred when pfas with greater adsorption affinity such as pfhxs c6 pfoa c8 and pfos c8 were progressively adsorbed maimaiti et al 2018 no desorption of pfas in this study was observed within the experimental timeframe because the adsorption affinity of the main competitive adsorbate dom would be similar or lower than the tested pfas more discussion of the dom effect is discussed in the following section 3 4 3 2 apparent equilibrium constants of pfas in a diluted system many studies employed isotherm testing to explain the adsorption behavior of various organic molecules the most widely used isotherms include langmuir and freundlich isotherms while those two isotherm equations can provide valuable information on adsorption characteristics such as adsorption capacity and affinity of molecules they did not provide a meaningful interpretation for the selected pfas in the given experimental conditions of this study for instance pfos and its branched isomer had very different isotherm constants even though their adsorption behaved similarly to each other table s4 because the pfas concentrations used in this study are low where relatively large analytical variation occurs two fitting parameters of langmuir and freundlich isotherms are sensitive to the variation of data which can cause an erroneous interpretation of the pfas adsorption in this study hinz 2001 therefore an apparent equilibrium constant was derived from an adsorption kinetic equation to this end it was postulated that the occupied sorption sites are governed primarily by dom but little by pfas which allows the term of the adsorption rate in of the supplementary material to be first order the derivation procedure can be found in the supplementary material and the final equation is as follows 4 c 0 i c e i 1 k a i c r where c 0 i and c e i are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of pfas i respectively in the unit of ng l k a i is the apparent equilibrium constant of i k i r s v 1 θ in the unit of l ml miex 1 where k i k a i k d i is the intrinsic equilibrium constant l m 2 k a i l mol 1s 1 and k d i s 1 are the adsorption and desorption rates of i respectively θ is the fraction of occupied sorption sites dimensionless r sv is the ratio of resin surface area to resin volume m2 ml miex 1 c r is the miex dose ml miex l it is beneficial to use eq 4 for a diluted system since this equation requires only one fitting parameter i e k a i thereby minimizing potential errors during the fitting procedure also eq 4 indicates that pfas adsorption in a diluted system is independent of their initial concentrations this is in agreement with the derivation of an equilibrium equation using the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast knappe et al 1998 fig 3 a illustrates the linear relation of c 0 i c e i 1 of pfoa with the resin dose c r the linearities for the other pfas were also included in fig s5 the good linearity of k a i with respect to resin dose indicates that the adsorption capacity is proportional to the adsorptive surface area of miex equivalently resin dose as depicted in fig 3b sulfonic pfas exhibited a greater capacity of adsorption at the corresponding carbon chain length compared to carboxylic ones this is because sulfonate possesses a stronger negative inductive effect than carboxylate due to its resonance structure with one more oxygen atom fig 4 illustrates the atomic charge distribution of four selected pfas sulfonic pfas induced greater negative atomic charges per unit oxygen ca 1 0 than carboxylic pfas ca 0 74 due to the resonance stabilization which caused almost two fold higher summed charges of total oxygens which contributed to their greater adsorption affinity than carboxylic pfas this result concurred with the previously reported findings kanazawa et al calculated the selectivity coefficients i e relative affinity of sorption of a compound compared to chloride ion of benzoic acid c6h5cooh and benzenesulfonic acid c6h5so3h kanazawa et al 2004 in the study ca 2 fold greater selectivity coefficient of benzenesulfonic acid was observed compared to benzoic acid for the strongly basic ion exchange resins with quaternary ammonium type i n ch3 3 and type ii n ch3 2c2h4oh another study also showed a similar tendency that aromatic hydrocarbons with sulfonate were better retarded by a quaternary ammonium based chromatographic column compared to those with carboxylate at the corresponding carbon chain length indicating that sulfonic acid has a greater affinity for sorption bear et al 1984 interestingly the chain length had little influence on the atomic charge of oxygens at the corresponding acidic groups in other words the greater adsorption capacity of longer chain pfas than shorter ones with the corresponding acidic groups would not be attributed to their charges of the acidic groups therefore the other moieties such as difluoromethylene and trifluoromethyl groups play a crucial role in determining their adsorption capacity along with their acidic groups such a role is discussed in the following section 3 3 relation of negative natural atomic charges with pfas adsorption along with the acidic group the carbon chain length plays an important role in determining the physical characteristics of pfas such as hydrophobicity thereby corresponding adsorption phenomena many researchers demonstrated the importance of hydrophobic interactions for ion exchange of pfas deng et al 2010 yu et al 2009 zaggia et al 2016 the hydrophobicity of pfas with the given acidic group is linearly proportional to the length of carbon chain length therefore causing greater hydrophobicity for longer chain pfas park et al 2020 meanwhile the longer chain length can also cause a greater extent of weak charge attraction of pfas with resin surfaces due to the negative dipole moment induced by fluorine atoms du et al 2014 since both the hydrophobicity of pfas and their total negative charges of fluorine atoms are additive with respect to the chain length it is challenging to differentiate hydrophobic interactions and charge interactions since they increase together as the carbon chain length increases recently charge density was employed in the literature to explain the effects of charge interactions of pfas with resins dixit et al compared genx perfluoromethoxy propanoic acid pfmopra and perfluoromethoxybutanoic acid pfmoba and concluded that their equivalent uptake increased in the ascending order of charge density in an equivalent concentration basis i e pfmopra pfmoba genx in a single solute system dixit et al 2020 however there are several concerns arising from the study first charge density on a molar or equivalent basis should be the same or very similar for all perfluorinated carboxylic acids with the same number of acidic groups because the charge density calculation depends on two specific functional groups carboxylic acid and phenol ritchie and perdue 2003 the study employed the same initial concentrations of the three fluorinated compounds on a mass basis while the comparison of uptake was made on an equivalent basis which resulted in equivocal comparison in fact the mass uptake of the three fluorinated compounds was very similar to each other at the same initial mass concentrations indicating that charge density is not a plausible indicator to account for charge effects of pfas or other types of fluorinated compounds this study employed the total negative atomic charge q i computed using dft calculation to explain the overall negative charge effects of pfas on adsorption atomic charge calculated by dft calculation can be a useful chemical descriptor of pfas in that 1 the sum of atomic charges results in the total number of electrons 2 the calculation provides individual atomic charges q i was selected as a pfas charge descriptor based on the postulation that the effects of positive charges of carbon atoms on surface interactions are negligible since they are located inside the negatively charged electron shell as depicted in fig 5 q i was better correlated with the equilibrium constants compared to log d ow at ph 7 that is an indicator of hydrophobicity at a neutral ph see fig s6 the better correlation suggests that the total negative charge explains the equilibrium of pfas better than hydrophobicity about 2 6 fold greater coefficient of multiple linear regression for q i than log d ow also bolsters that the negative charge effect can be more sensitive for the prediction of the equilibrium constant as shown in the following equation 5 l o g k a i ˆ 1 65 0 635 l o g d o w i ˆ 1 69 q i ˆ 0 515 l o g d o w i ˆ q i ˆ furthermore 5 8 fold greater sensitivity index value for q i ˆ than l o g d o w i ˆ also concurs that charge interaction is a more suitable descriptor for the prediction of log k a i fig s7 it is noteworthy that while the comparison of the two regression coefficients does not provide the information on the interaction term i e the last term of eq 5 the sensitivity analysis takes into account the interaction term accounting for collinearity along with the constant terms therefore it is more meaningful there is experimental evidence supporting that charge interactions play more important roles than hydrophobic interactions in ion exchange resin processes dixit et al showed an equivalent stoichiometry between chloride release and pfoa and pfos uptake dixit et al 2019 which means that almost all the pfas were retained via the ion exchange mechanism more interestingly another study exhibited that short chain pfba c4 exhibited a 1 1 equivalent stoichiometry of pfas uptake and chloride release whereas up to 1 3 times higher pfas uptake than chloride release was observed for longer chain ones such as pfos in a single solute system maimaiti et al 2018 this implies that longer chain pfas can be retained on resin surfaces with a horizontal orientation that occupies more than a chlorine equivalent sorption site in other words additional exchanges of chlorine with difluoromethylene or trifluoromethyl groups may have occurred with the given experimental approach it is not yet conclusive which interactive force between hydrophobic or charge interactions was predominant but other studies regarding miex interactions with trace organic compounds can shed light on roles of charge interactions two non charged hydrophobic compounds atrazine log d ow ph7 2 20 and isoproturon log d ow ph7 2 57 were reported to be little adsorbed onto miex humbert et al 2008 those two compounds are more hydrophobic at a neutral ph than pfoa log dow 1 58 but their little removal suggests that hydrophobic interaction plays minimal roles in adsorption with miex moreover almost identical uptake and equilibrium constant of pfos and its branched isomer also evinced that charge interactions are more important than hydrophobic interactions in miex processes previously due to its lower hydrophobicity branched pfos isomer showed lower adsorption capacity than pfos in activated carbon processes whose predominant separation mechanism is hydrophobic interaction eschauzier et al 2012 park et al 2020 while branched pfos isomer has lower hydrophobicity log d ow 2 79 than pfos log d ow 3 05 they possess almost identical q i 8 05 and 8 06 respectively all in all charge interaction was a more plausible explanation to the roles of difluoromethylene and tritrifluoromethyl groups for pfas adsorption in miex processes rather than hydrophobic interactions 3 4 effects of background organic matter on pfas adsorption the apparent equilibrium constant is a function of the fraction of occupied sorption sites θ that are primarily governed by dom and other favorably adsorbing anions such as sulfate greater adsorption affinity and or content of dom increases θ thereby reducing the apparent equilibrium constant meanwhile the intrinsic equilibrium constant k i should be consistent regardless of the adsorption affinity of the predominant competing matter in order to evaluate the effects of dom on the apparent equilibrium constant 8 mg c l of srnom were spiked a linear relation between the equilibrium constants of pfas between the original and srnom spiked groundwater was observed fig 6 less than a unity of slope indicates that higher content of competing organic matter in the spiked groundwater reduced the available sorptive sites 1 θ for pfas uptake meanwhile the linearity between two different water qualities suggests the consistency of intrinsic equilibrium constants k i as defined during the derivation of eq 4 ftir analysis sheds light on the functionality of organic matter adsorbed on the miex surfaces fig 7 a shows the ftir absorbance spectra of pristine miex and exhausted miex i e resin with 120 min exposure while the major functional groups remain unchanged a broad peak of the spectrum for the exhausted resin was observed between 1240 and 900 cm 1 with the maximum at 1090 cm 1 this trend is more clearly observed by the difference of the two absorbance spectra fig 7b the substantial absorbance increase corresponds to c o stretching of carbohydrates ester and polysaccharide and c o asymmetric vibration in carboxylic acids alcohols phenol and esters liu et al 2015 which are the signatures widely observed for dom no noticeable pfas characteristic peaks whose maxima range from 1150 to 1370 such as asymmetric symmetric and axial vibration of difluoromethylene and trifluoromethyl groups were found in this study fang et al 2009 gao and chorover 2012 which also supports the predominance of dom on the surfaces of the exhausted miex 3 5 regeneration of miex in a pilot or full scale miex system a portion of miex is diverted to a regeneration chamber containing 10 w w concentration of nacl cadee et al 2000 however such salt composition has been reported to yield a poor regeneration efficiency for resins exhausted by pfas due to the very low aqueous solubility of pfas at high ionic strength deng et al 2010 in addition na is not an effective positive counterion for regeneration e g compared to nh4 zaggia et al 2016 therefore minimal regeneration efficiency of miex is expected however this study showed rapid miex regeneration when using nacl fig 8 almost complete restoration of its pfas adsorption capacity was made within 30 min of contact time and no more pfas adsorption improvement was found at the longer exposure times this exceptional regeneration efficiency was attributed to the fact that the resin was predominantly exhausted by dom that can be effectively exchanged with chlorides as a future study studying the amount of pfas desorbed from miex will be valuable since the amount of pfas released into the brine solution was not quantifiable under these experimental conditions 4 conclusions in this study miex was evaluated to remove six carboxylic and three sulfonic pfas at environmentally relevant concentrations 300 ng l in groundwater with low organic content and aromaticity 0 78 mg l of doc and 0 96 l mg 1m 1 of specific uv absorbance suva the major findings of this study are summarized as follows miex was an effective means of removing sulfonic pfas such as pfbs c4 and pfos c8 and long chain carboxylic pfas such as pfoa c8 and pfda c10 in groundwater 80 removal at 15 ml l resin dose an apparent equilibrium constant in a dilute system was derived based on pseudo first order kinetic of adsorption the total negative atomic charge was better correlated with the apparent equilibrium constant compared to hydrophobicity at the given ph i e log d ow suggesting that charge interaction would be more important roles of difluoromethylene and trifluoromethyl groups for adsorption increased dom content proportionally decreased the apparent equilibrium constants of pfas inferring that the intrinsic equilibrium constants of pfas were consistent regardless of dom content whereas the available sorptive site decreased regeneration after 30 min of resin exposure with 10 w w nacl almost completely recovered the pfas adsorption capacity of miex because the desorption of dom the predominant adsorbate was effective during the regeneration process while this study focused primarily on the miex application for groundwater with low organic content it is necessary to scrutinize its adsorption kinetics and equilibrium in diverse water qualities containing a higher content of competitive matter such as dom and inorganic ions furthermore understanding of service life of miex for pfas adsorption is also encouraged to study while the fast recovery of adsorption capability for pfas was achieved in the regeneration of miex the extent of pfas desorption was not evaluated in this study hence it is invaluable to assess the desorption efficiency of pfas which ultimately sheds light on the longevity of miex for pfas adsorption lastly an adequate treatment of regenerant i e brine is also a crucial point for the sustainable operation of miex or any other regenerable ion exchange resins for pfas abatement an inappropriate discharge of brine is implicated in causing adverse impacts on the aquatic environment therefore studies on technologies for the brine treatment would play a key role for sustainable applications of ion exchange technologies for pfas removal declaration of competing interest

17859,in this study magnetic ion exchange miex resin was evaluated to remove six carboxylic and three sulfonic pfas at environmentally relevant concentrations 300 ng l in groundwater with low organic content and aromaticity 0 78 mg l of dissolved organic carbon doc and 0 96 l mg 1m 1 of specific uv absorbance suva in order to evaluate pfas adsorption the apparent equilibrium constant for pfas adsorption in a dilute system was derived as an indicator of the adsorption capacity of miex in adsorption of pfas hydrophobic interactions induced by difluoromethylene and trifluoromethyl groups are known to be effective however the hydrophobic and charge interactions caused by such functional groups are not easily differentiable from each other since both are additive with respect to the chain length in this study the total negative atomic charge q i was calculated using density functional theory dft calculation and correlated with the apparent equilibrium constants the negative atomic charge showed better correlation than the hydrophobicity log d ow at ph 7 of pfas suggesting that the charge interaction would be a more plausible role of fluorinated moieties for adsorption in the miex process than the hydrophobic interaction this was also bolstered by the similar adsorption kinetics and equilibrium of pfos log d ow 3 05 and its less hydrophobic isomer log d ow 2 79 but with almost identical total negative atomic charge 8 05 and 8 06 of q i respectively the regeneration efficiency of miex was also assessed almost complete restoration of pfas adsorption capacity was achieved after 30 min of a regeneration process with a 10 w w nacl solution as a regenerant the efficient regeneration was attributed to the effective desorption of dissolved organic matter that occupied sorptive sites predominantly graphical abstract image 1 keywords per and polyfluorinated alkylsubstance pfas groundwater ion exchange atomic charge hydrophobic interaction regeneration 1 introduction per and polyfluorinated alkylsubstances pfas are a class of aliphatic organofluorine compounds in which the hydrogens attached are either partially or fully substituted by fluorine recently there have been many studies on pfas occurrence and its treatment technologies due to their recalcitrant nature in the environment hu et al 2016 munoz et al 2017 sun et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 along with the prevalence of pfas in the aquatic environment significant public concerns are also associated with many different health endpoints such as developmental effects sagiv et al 2015 kidney and testicular cancer barry et al 2013 immune mediated liver damage qazi et al 2013 and endocrine disrupting effects berg et al 2015 pfas toxicity is compound specific and different behavioral modifications were reported among different pfas jantzen et al 2016 compared to perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorononanoic acid pfna for instance perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos caused more significant gene expression changes that potentially alternate calcium ion binding cell cycle regulation and aromatic compound metabolism jantzen et al 2016 in addition sulfonic pfas caused greater developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos than carboxylic pfas at the same carbon chain length while longer chain pfas have greater toxicity than shorter chain pfas ulhaq et al 2013 a large number of treatment technologies for pfas attenuation have been studied over the past decades while advanced electrochemical oxidation and plasma based processes seem promising schaefer et al 2017 stratton et al 2017 zhuo et al 2011 the predominant treatment technologies in practice are adsorption processes using activated carbons and ion exchange resins due to their cost effectiveness du et al 2014 while both adsorption processes are effective for the abatement of pfas ion exchange resins have been reported to be more effective particularly for shorter chain and sulfonic pfas at environmentally relevant concentrations woodard et al 2017 the predominant mode of operation for anion exchange resins is a fixed bed adsorber single use resins have attracted commercial applications partly because operators do not need to be concerned about their regeneration horst et al 2018 furthermore hysteresis and the irreversible nature of hydrophobic pfas uptake by resins accompany difficulty in their regeneration which also attributes to the commercial popularity of single use resins carter and farrell 2010 while the benefits of single use resin exist regenerable resins can provide a more sustainable operation in this study magnetic anion exchange miex resin was investigated to attenuate pfas in groundwaters magnetic properties of miex enable their fast agglomeration into larger particles which increases their settleability miex is operated in an up flow fluidized reactor that diverts a small portion of settled resins e g 5 10 to a regeneration system for continuous operation cadee et al 2000 more importantly understanding the performance of miex for pfas attenuation can be beneficial for water treatment facilities in the practice of miex currently many water utilities operate miex systems to reduce dissolved organic matter dom therefore reducing chlorine demand for disinfection and controlling precursors of disinfection by product dbp csiropedia 2014 hence the investigation of miex efficacy for the attenuation of pfas in a drinking water source not only can help augment the water supply portfolio for treatment facilities in the current practice of miex but also can provide useful information to those considering an upgrade of treatment systems to control pfas as well as dbp formation a few research studies reported the use of miex for the attenuation of pfas two independent studies tested miex for the attenuation of a suite of pfas in various water matrices arevalo perez 2014 lundgren 2014 the studies concurred that longer chain pfas than shorter ones and sulfonic pfas than carboxylic ones exhibited better attenuation which is in agreement with the findings of many other anion exchange resin studies ateia et al 2019 mccleaf et al 2017 woodard et al 2017 in line with such studies many studies concluded or postulated that hydrophobic interactions can play important roles in the sorption of pfas franke et al 2019 zaggia et al 2016 in a wide consensus acidic groups play the predominant roles in pfas adsorption in ion exchange processes however the roles of trifluoromethyl and difluoromethylene groups of pfas for adsorption was not yet pellucid because such functional groups induce both hydrophobicity and negative charges of pfas zaggia et al tested three anion exchange resins with different hydrophobicities and concluded that hydrophobic interaction was important in the extent of adsorption zaggia et al 2016 while it is a striking finding there was evidence in the same study that factors other than hydrophobic interactions would play significant roles in pfas adsorption in their study the most hydrophobic resin i e purolite a532e outperformed the other two resins i e purolite a520e and a600e for the adsorption of hydrophilic pfba c4 and marginally hydrophobic pfbs c4 which are anticipated to have minimal hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions in contrast the hydrophobic resin performed marginally better for the corresponding longer chain hydrophobic pfas i e pfoa c8 and pfos c8 that are anticipated to have hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions indeed dixit et al showed the stoichiometric balance between equivalents of chloride release and pfas uptake indicating that ion exchange was the predominant role of attenuation dixit et al 2019 2020 all in all demands for a clearer understanding of surface interactions in ion exchange processes persist the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and performance affecting factors of pfas adsorption in groundwater by miex to this end a mixing chamber containing solutions with miex and pfas was tested as a means of simulating a fluidized bed reactor in order to assess the roles of pfas moieties other than acidic groups including difluoromethylene and trifluoromethyl two physical parameters such as the sum of negative atomic charges calculated by density functional theory dft calculation and octanol water partition coefficient at ph 7 hereinafter log d ow were correlated with the apparent equilibrium constant of adsorption in addition the regeneration of miex was also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 miex exposure experiment groundwater was collected via a tap in tucson az usa and spiked with 300 ng l of the selected pfas after a day of natural dechlorination the tested groundwater had low dissolved organic concentration doc and low aromaticity 0 78 mg l of doc and 0 96 l mg 1m 1 of specific uv absorbance suva other water quality parameters are shown in table s1 in the supplementary material miex doc resin miex hereinafter was used for the testing of pfas removal the list of tested pfas is shown in table 1 as recommended by the manufacturer miex was stored wet in a 5 nacl solution until use before using miex it was rinsed with di water three times of the volume of the resin since miex is in a slurry form its dose was determined based on v v concentration to this end the resin was allowed to settle in a conical tube and was placed above a magnet to accelerate the settling the applied miex doses were 2 4 8 and 15 ml l the groundwater was spiked and mixed with miex at 300 rpm 350 sec 1 of velocity gradient g using a jar tester phipps bird pb900 for 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 90 and 120 min contact times for the kinetic experiment section 3 1 at the desired contact time a jar was placed on a magnet and miex was allowed to settle for 1 min subsequently the supernatant was collected and refrigerated at 4 c until chemical analyses pfas removals at 240 min exposure times were used for the equilibrium concentrations for section 3 4 suwannee river nom srnom was spiked into the tested groundwater to assess the effects of dom on the apparent equilibrium constant of adsorption k a i it is noteworthy that the srnom standard spiking aims to increase the overall organic content responsible for the competitive adsorption hence the compositional difference between srnom and organic matrices of the tested groundwater was not scrutinized the spiked water was exposed to 8 ml l of miex for 240 min and k a i was calculated using eq 4 i e single point calculation whereas k a i values for the original groundwater section 3 2 were obtained using curve fitting of multiple concentration data for a given pfas 2 2 regeneration of miex the pristine miex at 4 ml l dose was exposed to the groundwater containing pfas for 30 min the treated water was collected for pfas analysis to evaluate the adsorption efficiency of the pristine resin subsequently the exhausted miex was regenerated with a 10 w w nacl solution two bed volumes of the solution were added into a conical tube with the exhausted resins and stirred for 30 60 90 and 120 min the regenerated resins were exposed to the same groundwater for 30 min to evaluate the recovery of adsorption capability of miex 2 3 analytical methods doc was measured using a shimadzu toc analyzer japan samples were filtered with 0 45 μm syringe filters pvdf millex hv emd millipore subsequently acidified with hydrochloric acid 37 acs grade sigma aldrich to a ph of 2 3 in order to calculate suva absorbance spectra were acquired using a horiba aqualog fluorometer horiba jobin yvon nine pfas table 1 were analyzed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography agilent technologies 1290 tandem mass spectrometer agilent technologies 6490 lc ms ms the high throughput direct injection method was employed with the isotope dilution method an agilent zorbax rrhd eclipse plus c 18 column 100 nm 2 1 mm 1 8 μm was used for chromatographic separation the mobile phase was composed of hplc water with 5 mm ammonium acetate and methanol which was supplied to the separation column at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min the detailed information of isotope dilution mass spectrometer parameters qa qc and mobile phase gradient can be found in our previous study park et al 2020 ftir spectra were collected using a nicolet nexus 670 ir spectrometer madison wi with a kbr beam splitter and a deuterated triglycine sulfate dtgs detector samples were freeze dried then mixed with ir grade kbr and compressed into pellets 1 sample for each sample 64 scans were collected over the spectral range of 400 4000 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 2 4 adsorption kinetic models in this study the pseudo first order and second order kinetic models were implemented to obtain the apparent adsorption rate constants it should be emphasized here that the kinetic models do not directly address important transport mechanisms such as intraparticle diffusion and were used only for the calculation of apparent adsorption rate and equilibrium solid phase concentration the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations are expressed in eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 log q e q log q e k 1 2 303 t 2 1 q e q 1 q e k 2 t where q and q e are the solid phase concentrations on the adsorbents at a specific time and at equilibrium respectively ng pfas ml miex k 1 and k 2 are the apparent rate constants of pseudo first and second order adsorptions respectively s 1 and ml miex ng pfas 1s 1 respectively and t is the contact time it is noteworthy mentioning that q e was fitted along with the rate constants i e k 1 and k 2 although the experimental equilibrium constants are available because the use of the experimental values resulted in low goodness of fit values for the rate constants of pfba and pfpea data not shown the sole purpose of this fitting process is to evaluate the adsorption rate of pfas quantitatively therefore the equilibrium constants were also fitted to quantify the adsorption kinetics accurately overall the goodness of fit r 2 values for both kinetic models showed high values in this study the pseudo second order model fitted the data slightly better table s2 since it fits well data that has a rapid initial increase followed by a leveling off simonin 2016 therefore the kinetic parameters of the second order model were used in this study it is noteworthy that the rate constant k 2 is a measure of how fast pfas reaches the equilibrium concentration not of how fast pfas is adsorbed in an absolute manner 2 5 natural population analysis for calculating elemental charges elemental charges were calculated to assess their effects on the extent of ion exchange using dft calculation to this end all the tested pfas structures were drawn using avogadro software and their geometries were optimized with the mmff94 force field method hanwell et al 2012 subsequently cartesian coordinates of the molecular geometries generated in avogadro software were entered in an ab initio dft calculation software orca orca 4 2 1 for the calculation of electronic structures neese 2018 the three parameter hybrid functional with becke and lee yang parr correlation b3lyp with valence triple zeta with two sets of polarization functions def2 tzvpp was employed the solvent effects were computed by the conductor like polarizable continuum model cpcm with a static dielectric constant and refractive index of water 80 4 and 1 33 respectively natural population analysis npa was conducted using an open source java software janpa nikolaienko et al 2014 there are several branched isomers of pfos e g perfluoro n methyl heptanesulfonates pnmhps and perfluoro n n dimethyl hexanesulfonates the technical grade of the pfos standard contains mainly monotrifluoromethyl branched isomers i e pnmhps as an impurity gebbink and letcher 2010 npa values of five selected pnmhps i e n 2 to 6 were similar to each other table s3 since p6mhps was the most abundant in the technical grade standard as well as in the environment gebbink and letcher 2010 greaves and letcher 2013 p6mhps was selected as a representative pfos isomer and its npa value was used for this study 2 6 multiple linear regression a way to estimate the degree of contribution of each chemical descriptor to the prediction is to establish a predictive model like a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar followed by sensitivity analysis park et al 2015 in this study two chemical descriptors the total negative atomic charge q i and octanol water partition coefficient log d ow at ph 7 log d ow i were considered as potential factors influencing the equilibrium of pfas in miex in order to measure each parameters contribution to the equilibrium multiple linear regression was carried out to fit the apparent equilibrium constants of pfas k a i with respect to q i and log d ow i after their normalization using the subsequent equation 3 l o g k a i ˆ a 1 a 2 l o g d o w i ˆ a 3 q i ˆ a 4 l o g d o w i ˆ q i ˆ where the parameters with a hat symbol indicate normalized values a 1 to a 4 are the fitting parameters for sensitivity analysis the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method with a million iterations was employed park et al 2011 a detailed procedure of sensitivity analysis is included in the supplementary material section s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of pfas adsorption by miex fig 1 illustrates the percent removal a and solid phase concentration q b of pfas in the groundwater with doc of 0 78 mg l and suva of 0 96 l mg 1m 1 at 4 ml l of miex dose the results for the other resin doses can be found in figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary material all the tested pfas were rapidly removed at the early contact time 20 min and subsequently plateaued longer chain carboxylic pfas were removed to a greater extent at the corresponding contact time for instance pfoa c8 removal at 20 min is 55 whereas pfba c4 removal at the corresponding contact time is 20 similarly the same trend was found for sulfonic pfas 85 and 70 of removal for pfos c8 and pfbs c4 at 20 min respectively with the same chain length pfas with sulfonate exhibited greater removal than those with carboxylate at the corresponding contact times that is pfbs c4 and pfos c8 exhibited 50 and 30 higher removal at 20 min than the corresponding carboxylic pfas pfba and pfoa respectively this result is in agreement with the observations in other studies mccleaf et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 in contrast an opposite observation can also be found in the literature yu et al showed that pfoa c8 exhibited much higher abatement than pfos c8 by an anion exchange resin yu et al 2009 such discrepancy may be attributed to the initial concentrations of pfas in the tested waters a factor that can influence the formation of micelles or hemi micelles when surfactant concentrations exceed critical micelle concentration cmc micelles start forming or the hemi micelle formation can also be expected when the surfactant concentration is two or three orders of magnitude smaller than cmc johnson et al 2007 since pfos in yu et al s study had a three fold lower concentration than cmc it is possible that pfos selectively form hemi micelles which can be size excluded by micropores of adsorbents therefore inaccessible to the primary sorptive sites of micropores however the pfas concentrations applied in this study are at a part per trillion level i e ng l about seven orders of magnitude smaller than cmc in the aquatic environment such as groundwater surface water and treated wastewater effluents pfas occur in ng l level ranges arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 hu et al 2016 therefore hemi micelle formation is not likely to occur since cmc values of pfos and pfoa 16 000 and 4600 mg l respectively are much higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations while the relative adsorption kinetic trends were similar to each other the inverse relationship of k 2 and q e obtained using the pseudo second order kinetic equation indicates that pfas with less adsorption affinity reaches the equilibrium faster than those with a greater affinity fig 2 such an inverse relationship cannot be explained by the physicochemical properties of pfas alone surface diffusion could not be the rate limiting step since more favorably adsorbing pfas therefore likely having the greater driving force of surface diffusion showed lower k 2 values bulk diffusivity also does not explain the lower k 2 value of pfbs d 7 15 10 6 cm2 s than pfhxa d 6 58 10 6 cm2 s and pfpea d 7 19 10 6 cm2 s fig s4 and table 1 the inverse relation of k 2 and q e of pfas might be explained by the effects of dom on adsorption dom is the predominant organic matter occupying sorptive sites since their concentration i e 0 8 mg l is much higher than pfas i e 300 ng l the area of sportive sites would have dwindled as the adsorption of dom progressed which gradually diminishes available sportive sites for less favorably adsorbing pfas first maimaiti et al s observation also bolsters the roles of competing adsorbates on pfas adsorption maimaiti et al 2018 in their study faster adsorption kinetics of pfbs c4 and pfhxa c6 at the beginning of adsorption subsequently their desorption occurred when pfas with greater adsorption affinity such as pfhxs c6 pfoa c8 and pfos c8 were progressively adsorbed maimaiti et al 2018 no desorption of pfas in this study was observed within the experimental timeframe because the adsorption affinity of the main competitive adsorbate dom would be similar or lower than the tested pfas more discussion of the dom effect is discussed in the following section 3 4 3 2 apparent equilibrium constants of pfas in a diluted system many studies employed isotherm testing to explain the adsorption behavior of various organic molecules the most widely used isotherms include langmuir and freundlich isotherms while those two isotherm equations can provide valuable information on adsorption characteristics such as adsorption capacity and affinity of molecules they did not provide a meaningful interpretation for the selected pfas in the given experimental conditions of this study for instance pfos and its branched isomer had very different isotherm constants even though their adsorption behaved similarly to each other table s4 because the pfas concentrations used in this study are low where relatively large analytical variation occurs two fitting parameters of langmuir and freundlich isotherms are sensitive to the variation of data which can cause an erroneous interpretation of the pfas adsorption in this study hinz 2001 therefore an apparent equilibrium constant was derived from an adsorption kinetic equation to this end it was postulated that the occupied sorption sites are governed primarily by dom but little by pfas which allows the term of the adsorption rate in of the supplementary material to be first order the derivation procedure can be found in the supplementary material and the final equation is as follows 4 c 0 i c e i 1 k a i c r where c 0 i and c e i are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of pfas i respectively in the unit of ng l k a i is the apparent equilibrium constant of i k i r s v 1 θ in the unit of l ml miex 1 where k i k a i k d i is the intrinsic equilibrium constant l m 2 k a i l mol 1s 1 and k d i s 1 are the adsorption and desorption rates of i respectively θ is the fraction of occupied sorption sites dimensionless r sv is the ratio of resin surface area to resin volume m2 ml miex 1 c r is the miex dose ml miex l it is beneficial to use eq 4 for a diluted system since this equation requires only one fitting parameter i e k a i thereby minimizing potential errors during the fitting procedure also eq 4 indicates that pfas adsorption in a diluted system is independent of their initial concentrations this is in agreement with the derivation of an equilibrium equation using the ideal adsorbed solution theory iast knappe et al 1998 fig 3 a illustrates the linear relation of c 0 i c e i 1 of pfoa with the resin dose c r the linearities for the other pfas were also included in fig s5 the good linearity of k a i with respect to resin dose indicates that the adsorption capacity is proportional to the adsorptive surface area of miex equivalently resin dose as depicted in fig 3b sulfonic pfas exhibited a greater capacity of adsorption at the corresponding carbon chain length compared to carboxylic ones this is because sulfonate possesses a stronger negative inductive effect than carboxylate due to its resonance structure with one more oxygen atom fig 4 illustrates the atomic charge distribution of four selected pfas sulfonic pfas induced greater negative atomic charges per unit oxygen ca 1 0 than carboxylic pfas ca 0 74 due to the resonance stabilization which caused almost two fold higher summed charges of total oxygens which contributed to their greater adsorption affinity than carboxylic pfas this result concurred with the previously reported findings kanazawa et al calculated the selectivity coefficients i e relative affinity of sorption of a compound compared to chloride ion of benzoic acid c6h5cooh and benzenesulfonic acid c6h5so3h kanazawa et al 2004 in the study ca 2 fold greater selectivity coefficient of benzenesulfonic acid was observed compared to benzoic acid for the strongly basic ion exchange resins with quaternary ammonium type i n ch3 3 and type ii n ch3 2c2h4oh another study also showed a similar tendency that aromatic hydrocarbons with sulfonate were better retarded by a quaternary ammonium based chromatographic column compared to those with carboxylate at the corresponding carbon chain length indicating that sulfonic acid has a greater affinity for sorption bear et al 1984 interestingly the chain length had little influence on the atomic charge of oxygens at the corresponding acidic groups in other words the greater adsorption capacity of longer chain pfas than shorter ones with the corresponding acidic groups would not be attributed to their charges of the acidic groups therefore the other moieties such as difluoromethylene and trifluoromethyl groups play a crucial role in determining their adsorption capacity along with their acidic groups such a role is discussed in the following section 3 3 relation of negative natural atomic charges with pfas adsorption along with the acidic group the carbon chain length plays an important role in determining the physical characteristics of pfas such as hydrophobicity thereby corresponding adsorption phenomena many researchers demonstrated the importance of hydrophobic interactions for ion exchange of pfas deng et al 2010 yu et al 2009 zaggia et al 2016 the hydrophobicity of pfas with the given acidic group is linearly proportional to the length of carbon chain length therefore causing greater hydrophobicity for longer chain pfas park et al 2020 meanwhile the longer chain length can also cause a greater extent of weak charge attraction of pfas with resin surfaces due to the negative dipole moment induced by fluorine atoms du et al 2014 since both the hydrophobicity of pfas and their total negative charges of fluorine atoms are additive with respect to the chain length it is challenging to differentiate hydrophobic interactions and charge interactions since they increase together as the carbon chain length increases recently charge density was employed in the literature to explain the effects of charge interactions of pfas with resins dixit et al compared genx perfluoromethoxy propanoic acid pfmopra and perfluoromethoxybutanoic acid pfmoba and concluded that their equivalent uptake increased in the ascending order of charge density in an equivalent concentration basis i e pfmopra pfmoba genx in a single solute system dixit et al 2020 however there are several concerns arising from the study first charge density on a molar or equivalent basis should be the same or very similar for all perfluorinated carboxylic acids with the same number of acidic groups because the charge density calculation depends on two specific functional groups carboxylic acid and phenol ritchie and perdue 2003 the study employed the same initial concentrations of the three fluorinated compounds on a mass basis while the comparison of uptake was made on an equivalent basis which resulted in equivocal comparison in fact the mass uptake of the three fluorinated compounds was very similar to each other at the same initial mass concentrations indicating that charge density is not a plausible indicator to account for charge effects of pfas or other types of fluorinated compounds this study employed the total negative atomic charge q i computed using dft calculation to explain the overall negative charge effects of pfas on adsorption atomic charge calculated by dft calculation can be a useful chemical descriptor of pfas in that 1 the sum of atomic charges results in the total number of electrons 2 the calculation provides individual atomic charges q i was selected as a pfas charge descriptor based on the postulation that the effects of positive charges of carbon atoms on surface interactions are negligible since they are located inside the negatively charged electron shell as depicted in fig 5 q i was better correlated with the equilibrium constants compared to log d ow at ph 7 that is an indicator of hydrophobicity at a neutral ph see fig s6 the better correlation suggests that the total negative charge explains the equilibrium of pfas better than hydrophobicity about 2 6 fold greater coefficient of multiple linear regression for q i than log d ow also bolsters that the negative charge effect can be more sensitive for the prediction of the equilibrium constant as shown in the following equation 5 l o g k a i ˆ 1 65 0 635 l o g d o w i ˆ 1 69 q i ˆ 0 515 l o g d o w i ˆ q i ˆ furthermore 5 8 fold greater sensitivity index value for q i ˆ than l o g d o w i ˆ also concurs that charge interaction is a more suitable descriptor for the prediction of log k a i fig s7 it is noteworthy that while the comparison of the two regression coefficients does not provide the information on the interaction term i e the last term of eq 5 the sensitivity analysis takes into account the interaction term accounting for collinearity along with the constant terms therefore it is more meaningful there is experimental evidence supporting that charge interactions play more important roles than hydrophobic interactions in ion exchange resin processes dixit et al showed an equivalent stoichiometry between chloride release and pfoa and pfos uptake dixit et al 2019 which means that almost all the pfas were retained via the ion exchange mechanism more interestingly another study exhibited that short chain pfba c4 exhibited a 1 1 equivalent stoichiometry of pfas uptake and chloride release whereas up to 1 3 times higher pfas uptake than chloride release was observed for longer chain ones such as pfos in a single solute system maimaiti et al 2018 this implies that longer chain pfas can be retained on resin surfaces with a horizontal orientation that occupies more than a chlorine equivalent sorption site in other words additional exchanges of chlorine with difluoromethylene or trifluoromethyl groups may have occurred with the given experimental approach it is not yet conclusive which interactive force between hydrophobic or charge interactions was predominant but other studies regarding miex interactions with trace organic compounds can shed light on roles of charge interactions two non charged hydrophobic compounds atrazine log d ow ph7 2 20 and isoproturon log d ow ph7 2 57 were reported to be little adsorbed onto miex humbert et al 2008 those two compounds are more hydrophobic at a neutral ph than pfoa log dow 1 58 but their little removal suggests that hydrophobic interaction plays minimal roles in adsorption with miex moreover almost identical uptake and equilibrium constant of pfos and its branched isomer also evinced that charge interactions are more important than hydrophobic interactions in miex processes previously due to its lower hydrophobicity branched pfos isomer showed lower adsorption capacity than pfos in activated carbon processes whose predominant separation mechanism is hydrophobic interaction eschauzier et al 2012 park et al 2020 while branched pfos isomer has lower hydrophobicity log d ow 2 79 than pfos log d ow 3 05 they possess almost identical q i 8 05 and 8 06 respectively all in all charge interaction was a more plausible explanation to the roles of difluoromethylene and tritrifluoromethyl groups for pfas adsorption in miex processes rather than hydrophobic interactions 3 4 effects of background organic matter on pfas adsorption the apparent equilibrium constant is a function of the fraction of occupied sorption sites θ that are primarily governed by dom and other favorably adsorbing anions such as sulfate greater adsorption affinity and or content of dom increases θ thereby reducing the apparent equilibrium constant meanwhile the intrinsic equilibrium constant k i should be consistent regardless of the adsorption affinity of the predominant competing matter in order to evaluate the effects of dom on the apparent equilibrium constant 8 mg c l of srnom were spiked a linear relation between the equilibrium constants of pfas between the original and srnom spiked groundwater was observed fig 6 less than a unity of slope indicates that higher content of competing organic matter in the spiked groundwater reduced the available sorptive sites 1 θ for pfas uptake meanwhile the linearity between two different water qualities suggests the consistency of intrinsic equilibrium constants k i as defined during the derivation of eq 4 ftir analysis sheds light on the functionality of organic matter adsorbed on the miex surfaces fig 7 a shows the ftir absorbance spectra of pristine miex and exhausted miex i e resin with 120 min exposure while the major functional groups remain unchanged a broad peak of the spectrum for the exhausted resin was observed between 1240 and 900 cm 1 with the maximum at 1090 cm 1 this trend is more clearly observed by the difference of the two absorbance spectra fig 7b the substantial absorbance increase corresponds to c o stretching of carbohydrates ester and polysaccharide and c o asymmetric vibration in carboxylic acids alcohols phenol and esters liu et al 2015 which are the signatures widely observed for dom no noticeable pfas characteristic peaks whose maxima range from 1150 to 1370 such as asymmetric symmetric and axial vibration of difluoromethylene and trifluoromethyl groups were found in this study fang et al 2009 gao and chorover 2012 which also supports the predominance of dom on the surfaces of the exhausted miex 3 5 regeneration of miex in a pilot or full scale miex system a portion of miex is diverted to a regeneration chamber containing 10 w w concentration of nacl cadee et al 2000 however such salt composition has been reported to yield a poor regeneration efficiency for resins exhausted by pfas due to the very low aqueous solubility of pfas at high ionic strength deng et al 2010 in addition na is not an effective positive counterion for regeneration e g compared to nh4 zaggia et al 2016 therefore minimal regeneration efficiency of miex is expected however this study showed rapid miex regeneration when using nacl fig 8 almost complete restoration of its pfas adsorption capacity was made within 30 min of contact time and no more pfas adsorption improvement was found at the longer exposure times this exceptional regeneration efficiency was attributed to the fact that the resin was predominantly exhausted by dom that can be effectively exchanged with chlorides as a future study studying the amount of pfas desorbed from miex will be valuable since the amount of pfas released into the brine solution was not quantifiable under these experimental conditions 4 conclusions in this study miex was evaluated to remove six carboxylic and three sulfonic pfas at environmentally relevant concentrations 300 ng l in groundwater with low organic content and aromaticity 0 78 mg l of doc and 0 96 l mg 1m 1 of specific uv absorbance suva the major findings of this study are summarized as follows miex was an effective means of removing sulfonic pfas such as pfbs c4 and pfos c8 and long chain carboxylic pfas such as pfoa c8 and pfda c10 in groundwater 80 removal at 15 ml l resin dose an apparent equilibrium constant in a dilute system was derived based on pseudo first order kinetic of adsorption the total negative atomic charge was better correlated with the apparent equilibrium constant compared to hydrophobicity at the given ph i e log d ow suggesting that charge interaction would be more important roles of difluoromethylene and trifluoromethyl groups for adsorption increased dom content proportionally decreased the apparent equilibrium constants of pfas inferring that the intrinsic equilibrium constants of pfas were consistent regardless of dom content whereas the available sorptive site decreased regeneration after 30 min of resin exposure with 10 w w nacl almost completely recovered the pfas adsorption capacity of miex because the desorption of dom the predominant adsorbate was effective during the regeneration process while this study focused primarily on the miex application for groundwater with low organic content it is necessary to scrutinize its adsorption kinetics and equilibrium in diverse water qualities containing a higher content of competitive matter such as dom and inorganic ions furthermore understanding of service life of miex for pfas adsorption is also encouraged to study while the fast recovery of adsorption capability for pfas was achieved in the regeneration of miex the extent of pfas desorption was not evaluated in this study hence it is invaluable to assess the desorption efficiency of pfas which ultimately sheds light on the longevity of miex for pfas adsorption lastly an adequate treatment of regenerant i e brine is also a crucial point for the sustainable operation of miex or any other regenerable ion exchange resins for pfas abatement an inappropriate discharge of brine is implicated in causing adverse impacts on the aquatic environment therefore studies on technologies for the brine treatment would play a key role for sustainable applications of ion exchange technologies for pfas removal declaration of competing interest
