18475,colloids and particles act as vectors for contaminant transport in karst aquifers particle transport is particularly efficient and plays critical roles in soil erosion and in the process of karstification however available techniques for particle tracing are either expensive or not representative for the transport of natural colloids and particles we developed a new method for particle tracing using natural sediments as artificial tracers and first applied this method at a karst experimental site in the alps suspended particles were injected into a swallow hole together with a conservative solute tracer for comparison breakthrough curves for 32 different particle size classes between 0 8 and 450 μm were recorded at a karst spring 230 m away using a mobile particle counter that allows quantitative detection at high temporal resolution results show that i sediments can be used as efficient particle tracers in karst groundwater ii recoveries are similar for particles and solutes iii mean velocity increases with increasing particle size iv dispersion decreases with increasing particle size v these observations point to exclusion processes as a conclusion this new experimental technique allows new insights into the transport and fate of colloids and particles in groundwater at affordable costs graphical abstract image 1 keywords particle transport conservative

mccarthy and mckay 2004 mccarthy and zachara 1989 typically three classes of possibly hazardous and potentially mobile colloidal particles are differentiated grolimund et al 2007 i intrinsic colloidal particles such as precipitates of inorganic pollutants ii carrier colloidal particles that can bind the pollutants at their surfaces and iii biocolloids natural colloidal particles can be composed of inorganic material originating from the host rock such as clays minerals zeolites quartz feldspars fe oxides and hydroxides of actinide elements such as u np and am organic material such as natural organic matter and microorganisms such as viruses bacteria and protozoans mccarthy and mckay 2004 according to mccarthy and zachara 1989 colloids are defined as particles with diameters less than 10 μm for this study for reasons of simplicity all size classes are referred to as particles karst aquifers are characterized by a distinctive hydrology and landforms that are the consequence of a combination of high rock solubility and well developed secondary porosity ford and williams 2007 sinking streams caves and large karst springs can occur in karst aquifer systems particle transport is particularly relevant because of the rapid and turbulent flow in open fractures and conduits karst terranes are vulnerable to soil erosion soil material eroded from the land surface is flushed into the underground and transported in the conduit network feeser and o connell 2009 yang et al 2010 particle transport also plays an important but poorly studied role in the process of karstification most carbonate rocks contain traces of non soluble minerals which are released during carbonate rock dissolution and represent a major source of autogenic sediments in karst aquifers while the chemical process and kinetics of carbonate rock dissolution is well understood dreybrodt 1996 perne et al 2014 only few conceptual studies address the behavior of non soluble minerals during this process goldscheider et al 2010 empirically low percentages 25 of non soluble minerals can be removed as suspended particles while higher percentages stop the solution process and prevent the formation of a karst aquifer ford and williams 2007 the transport behavior of particles in comparison to solutes can vary significantly depending on the hydrological and hydrochemical conditions aquifer type and investigation scale goeppert and goldscheider 2008 mccarthy and mckay 2004 molnar et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 frequently observed are faster travel times and lower recovery rates for particles compared to solutes auckenthaler et al 2002 flynn and sinreich 2010 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 2011 rossi et al 1998 sinreich et al 2009 weisbrod et al 2013 a commonly accepted explanation for higher peak and mean flow velocities are pore and size exclusion processes bradford et al 2003 which affect only particles because they cannot enter smaller pores or the pore space closer to walls where lower flow velocities occur earlier first arrival times however can also be attributed to lower detection limits of particles compared to solutes exclusion processes in karst aquifers are less well studied but could be conceptually linked to the double porosity of karst aquifers consisting of large conduits or drains and the adjacent fissured and porous rock matrix as colloids are omnipresent in groundwater as potential pollutants or pollutant carriers a strong interest in understanding the transport behavior of colloids arose therefore there is considerable research focusing on laboratory studies or small scale field studies in porous media to understand the governing colloid transport and retention processes such as advection and dispersion adsorption desorption physical straining and air water interface capturing bradford et al 2003 knappett et al 2008 morales et al 2011 seetha et al 2015 tran et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 field scale studies dealing with the transport of particles however are much less common in particular in karst areas auckenthaler et al 2002 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 2011 schiperski et al 2016 given the enormous importance of karst aquifers as freshwater resources and their vulnerability to contamination a profound understanding of colloid bound transport processes in this type of aquifer is highly important about 21 6 of the european land surface is occupied by carbonate rocks that have karst aquifers chen et al 2017 in some european countries karst groundwater contributes 50 to the total freshwater supply and several big cities such as vienna austria rome italy and austin usa are predominantly supplied by freshwater from karst springs or wells hartmann et al 2014 even fewer investigations deal with the natural particle size distribution psd in karst areas to quantify the contamination risk and vulnerability of karst springs atteia and kozel 1997 ender et al 2017 frank et al 2018 pronk et al 2007 schiperski et al 2015 a major outcome of the study by pronk et al 2007 is that particles in the range of 1 2 μm along with elevated levels of dissolved organic matter are often associated with e coli contamination groundwater tracing methods provide an excellent means for the determination of transport parameters and aquifer characteristics artificial tracers are substances that are intentionally introduced into the water to study flow and transport whereas natural tracers are substances that are encountered naturally in the water including both natural water constituents and contaminants goldscheider et al 2008 this study focuses entirely on artificial tracers it is important to note however that natural substances also can be used and referred to as artificial tracers if they are injected intentionally for scientific purposes there is a large amount of research dealing with solute tracers in field studies whereas only few studies deal with particle tracers as surrogates for colloidal particles most of these used latex microspheres goeppert and goldscheider 2008 2011 käss 2004 schiperski et al 2016 or bacteriophages and bacteria auckenthaler et al 2002 rossi et al 1998 sinreich et al 2009 flynn and sinreich 2010 however these colloidal particles do not necessarily represent the natural particles that are present in the aquifer and therefore might not be able to lead to an improved understanding of the transport properties of natural colloidal particles thus the objectives of this study were i to develop a robust groundwater tracing technique based on sediment particles originating from the aquifer ii use the particle size distribution in particular the finer size classes for evaluating the hygienic risk of the aquifer iii decipher similarities or dissimilarities between the conservative solute tracer and the particle size classes and iv improve the understanding of the aquifer properties by the application of different tracer types for this study we used a karst experimental site in the lechquellen mountains austria that is ideally suited for field tracer tests it is located in one of the most important european karstifiable carbonate rock formations so the results may be transferrable to many other karst areas with a well developed conduit network the proposed particle tracing method can also be applied in other environments with similar flow properties and thus help to better manage and protect groundwater resources 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the karst experimental site is located at near lake formarinsee in the lechquellen mountains in the western austrian state of vorarlberg geologically it belongs to the austro alpine nappes of the northern calcareous alps the test site consists of triassic thin bedded limestone of the so called plattenkalk formation that forms spectacular karst landforms the experimental site consists of a swallow hole that is directly connected to a karst spring at a linear distance of 230 m the spring is located at 1847 m a s l and consists of several orifices it is the main surficial tributary to lake formarinsee a famous karst lake without any surface drainages that is located in a depression fig 1 the observed spring discharge ranges between 12 1 l s and 99 2 l s which is higher than the discharge of the swallow hole indicating that the spring also receives water from diffuse recharge in its autogenic catchment for water quality investigations the influence of the swallow hole on these springs is of major importance while diffuse infiltration might lead to significant retardation the main advantages of this study area are relatively simple hydrogeological conditions with an active swallow hole connected to perennial karst springs short distances and high flow velocities resulting in short experiment durations low background particle numbers at the spring with constant values during constant hydrological conditions good accessibility these advantages make this location an ideal benchmark site with regard to evaluating tracers and tracing concepts 2 2 sediment particle sampling and particle size distribution measurements the particle size distribution psd was determined by using a particle counter abakus mobil fluid klotz gmbh bad liebenzell germany each measurement cycle comprises one purge volume of 10 ml and the followed by a measurement volume of 10 ml the limit of detection is 1 particle per measurement volume in this case 1 10 ml the particle counter groups the particles into 32 freely definable size classes ranging from 0 8 µm to 450 μm the smallest detectable particle diameter is 0 8 μm the size class δd of 0 8 μm corresponds to 0 8 δd 1 0 μm sediment particles designated for injection were retrieved prior to the field test directly from the outlet of the karst spring and stored at 4 c until they were received at the laboratory afterwards these sediments were sieved to remove the particle fractions larger than 200 μm in diameter stainless steel test sieve 200 μm opening paul stenzel hamburg 50 germany the psd of the injection particles was determined by the particle counter after dilution of a 1 ml sample of the suspension and sonication for 60 s with an ultrasonic homogenizer sonopuls hd 2200 bandelin gmbh co kg berlin germany for the 0 8 μm size class for instance the injected particle number was 1 36 1010 the final volume of the injection suspension was 1 8 l the measurement of the aqueous samples at the spring during the field tracing tests was done online at cycle intervals of 2 5 min by using the same particle counters as for the injection suspension but without sample dilution prior to the tracer injection background measurements of the psd at the spring outlet were taken for 24 h during the pre injection psd measurements relatively constant background values were obtained for the size classes between 0 8 and 10 μm with only minor variability ranging from 1 86 to 4 95 for the larger size classes 20 140 μm the overall number of particles was significantly smaller but the variability increased to 69 for the 100 μm size class therefore size classes larger than 20 μm were not considered for this study for the smaller size classes the constant background values were subtracted 2 3 conservative tracer analysis and field tracing experiments during the field tracer test the fluorescent dye uranine cas rn 518 47 8 applichem gmbh darmstadt germany was used as a conservative solute for comparison the sediment particles and 1 002 g of uranine were injected simultaneously as a dirac input into the swallow hole location see fig 1 the flow rate at the swallow hole was 0 8 l s 50 ml water samples were taken at the spring for laboratory analysis of uranine which was done with a perkinelmer ls 55 spectrofluorometer 4 ml were adjusted with 50 μl of a ph 10 buffer to achieve the maximum fluorescence intensity following the standard procedure reported in käss 2004 during the experiment the spring discharge was 20 l s determined by the salt dilution method corresponding to low flow conditions 2 4 data analysis for each particle size class and for uranine the basic transport parameters were derived directly from the breakthrough curves btcs time of first detection t 1 peak concentration c p peak concentration time t p mean transit time t m and the corresponding maximum flow velocity v max peak velocity v p and mean flow velocity v m the recovery rates r were calculated using the discharge q 1 r 1 m t 0 q c d t where m is the injected tracer mass and c is the aqueous concentration at time t leibundgut et al 2009 the btcs were further evaluated by a one dimensional 1d advection dispersion model adm 2 c t d 2 c x 2 v m c x with mean flow velocity v m and dispersion d acting as fitting parameters the adm was initially developed for porous media but can also be applied to karst conduits where dispersion is most important in flow direction so that 1d models are justified geyer et al 2007 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 advection can be expressed as mean transit time t 0 or mean flow velocity v m l t 0 with l flow path length dispersion can be expressed by the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d the longitudinal dispersivity α d v or the peclet number pe v m l d for the modelling of the observed btcs the software cxtfit toride et al 1999 was used multiple peaks are often detected for tracers therefore the multi dispersion model mdm käss 2004 leibundgut et al 2009 was applied the widely accepted assumption of this approach is that there are individual flow paths with different flow velocities and dispersivities which converge close to the outlet of the system in this case the karst spring the observed btcs represent the superposition of the individual flow paths in cxtfit for modelling multiple peaks a stepwise determination of the transport parameters needs to be realized the earliest peak peak 1 is fitted for the determination of v and d and then subtracted the residual concentrations are used for further fitting for comparison all values are given as normalized values c m where m stands for the tracer injection mass uranine or injected particle number the normalization of the concentration values by the input mass in case of a solute tracer or input particle number in case of a particle tracer makes the btcs easily comparable as it levels out the effect of the different tracer types solute vs particles and input quantities käss 2004 the generalized extreme studentized deviate test esd was conducted to identify if present statistically significant outliers in the series of descriptive and fitted parameters yu et al 2004 the shapiro wilk test was used prior to the esd to verify that the data is normally distributed except for the outliers the software origin was used for these statistical analyses in karst aquifer systems finer particles are always more abundant than larger ones pronk et al 2007 therefore more sophisticated methods for psd analysis are required the particle size distribution psd can be presented as absolute particle numbers or percentage either in a distributive or in a cumulative form in the distributive psd the number or percentage of particles for each individual size class is presented and the sum of all values is the total particle number or 100 in the cumulative psd the number or percentage of particles smaller than a specific diameter is presented and the final value for the largest size class is the total particle number or 100 the cumulative psd can be obtained from the distributive one by summing up all size classes starting with the smallest one normalized psd can be obtained by defining a reference psd e g pre experimental conditions and dividing all obtained psd by this reference in this presentation form the reference psd will occur as a horizontal line y 1 and all measured psds will plot above or below this line thus indicating over or underrepresentation of the respective size classes for the evaluation of the btcs the constant background values were subtracted for each particle size class for the cumulative and distributive psd analysis original values including the background values were taken into consideration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the solute btcs at the karst spring the conservative solute tracer uranine provided evidence for the underground connection between the swallow hole and the spring which is located at a horizontal distance of 230 m the test yielded multiple peaks very high mean flow velocities 253 m h 164 m h and 77 m h and low dispersivities 2 6 m 2 8 m and 7 2 m for the first peak and the two subsequent peaks for peak 1 see table 1 fig 2 the total recovery at the spring was 83 indicating that it is the main outlet of this system although the missing 17 suggest infiltration into deeper parts of the aquifer to additional spring outlets or the fissured matrix the large peclet numbers 88 7 81 4 and 31 8 show that the flow can be mainly characterized by advection rather than dispersion the overall fit quality is relatively good r2 0 976 for the entire btc the obtained values of flow velocity and dispersion are within a typical range for karst aquifers goldscheider et al 2008 3 2 particle tracer btcs transport properties and comparison with the solute tracer due to the low variability of the natural background and stable hydrological conditions an accurate discrimination between the natural background particles and the injected particles is possible exemplarily the btcs of the particle size classes pscs 1 1 µm 2 1 µm and 3 2 μm are shown as classical btcs in fig 3 a compilation of all btcs including uranine and the 28 particle size classes between 0 8 µm and 10 μm is shown in fig 4 there is a distinct first peak with a first detection time t1 of about 0 57 h up to 0 70 h table 1 and a mean value of 0 64 h thus the maximum flow velocity vmax ranges from 402 9 m h to 326 6 m h for the 2 2 μm psc and the 10 μm psc respectively the mean value of vmax for all size classes is 357 4 m h in comparison to the solute tracer uranine with a t1 of 0 58 h and a vmax of 394 3 m h table 1 an earlier first arrival or faster transport of particles is not observable fig 4 the absolute differences between t1 and vmax of uranine and particles are relatively small and statistically not significant according to the esd test for the first peak the peak time tp of the particles has a mean value of 0 83 h with a standard deviation of 0 02 h which is virtually equal to the value of uranine with tp 0 83 h table 1 however the mean travel times tm and mean flow velocities vm for the particles differ significantly from the solute table 1 fig 5 b uranine gives a tm of 0 91 h and thus a vm of 253 2 m h whereas the mean values for the particles are 0 87 h with a standard deviation of 0 01 h and 263 8 m h with a standard deviation of 4 5 m h for tm and vm respectively according to the esd test tm and vm of uranine and the 10 μm psc are statistically different from the other particle size classes albeit representing different endpoints for uranine the adm gives the lowest vm and for the 10 μm psc it gives the largest vm the general trend shows clearly increasing mean flow velocities with increasing particle sizes fig 5 the smaller the particle sizes are the closer is vm to that of the solute dispersion shows exactly the opposite behavior table 1 fig 5 for uranine the adm gives a dispersion of d 656 9 m2 h the largest dispersion with d 718 7 m2 h is given for the 1 4 μm psc and the lowest for the 10 μm psc with d 214 6 m2 h fig 5 whereas the mean for the particles is about 621 6 m2 h thus the dispersion of the solute is larger than the average range of the particle size classes in particular of the 10 μm psc fig 5c which is significantly lower according to the esd test the general trend shows that with increasing particle sizes the dispersion decreases albeit it is less pronounced than the trend for vm fig 5 this is in good agreement with the findings sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 observed for the pore scale in micromodels of porous media these authors reported an increasing average velocity larger than that of the solute and at the same time decreasing dispersion with increasing colloidal size this was explained by size exclusion processes at the pore scale which might lead to pore exclusion at larger scales size exclusion implies that colloidal particles cannot move into the entire pore space and travel only in the center of the pores where flow paths with the largest flow velocities prevail pore exclusion refers to a larger scale and assumes that there are regions that are non accessible for colloidal particles as a result smaller colloidal particles can be transported easier through a larger proportion of the entire pore space and show vm and dispersion closer to that of the solute tracer in contrast larger colloidal particles can only travel in the centers of the largest pore channels and have less diverse flowpaths thus giving a lower dispersion and higher vm auset and keller 2004 fig 6 illustrates the transfer of the concept of exclusion processes to karst aquifers with double porosity where rapid flow and preferential transport of larger particles occurs in the main conduits solutionally enlarged fractures and bedding planes solutes and smaller particles sample the entire velocity field but may also enter the low flow volumes of the adjacent fissured and porous rock matrix it should be noted that the dimensions of karst conduits cm to m ford and williams 2007 are much larger than large pore channels in porous media larger particles are subject to sedimentation 3 3 evidence for multiple flow paths and implications as there are several individual peaks observed for the btcs and the hydrological conditions are constant throughout the test different flow channels or pathways in the underground can be assumed leibundgut et al 2009 otherwise multiple peaks could be attributed to individual rain events in contrast to the solute btc the secondary peaks of the individual pscs are associated with a significantly lower fit quality therefore the transport parameters are not discussed in greater detail however it is obvious from the btcs fig 3 that the second peak becomes less important with increasing particle sizes this supports the hypothesis that exclusion processes occur which affect the larger colloidal particles to a larger degree 3 4 recovery rates of solutes and particles the recovery of the conservative solute tracer is 83 3 which is very similar to the observed particle recoveries with a mean value of 77 1 and a standard deviation of 12 3 table 1 in particular the larger pscs between 2 3 µm and 4 0 μm yield a slightly larger recovery than the solute tracer whereas the recovery of the finer pscs 0 8 2 2 μm is equal or slightly smaller than for uranine fig 5 this behavior is also reflected by the normalized concentrations c m which show larger values for the larger pscs and smaller values for the smaller pscs fig 4 particles larger than 5 μm experience sedimentation and thus yield lower recoveries fig 5 this is in good agreement with other studies of the natural particle size distribution in karst aquifers schiperski et al 2015 atteia and kozel 1997 where sedimentation processes were assumed for particles larger than 4 3 μm and 5 μm respectively in granular porous media however physical straining is a significant mechanism of colloid retention when the ratio of the colloid and the median grain diameter is larger than 0 5 bradford et al 2004 for the 4 3 μm particles this would yield a median collector grain diameter of 860 μm and less in conduit or fissure dominated karst aquifers conduit diameters are significantly larger ford and williams 2007 and thus physical straining does not play a major role the very high recoveries for both the solute tracer and the particles show that retention of particles does not take place in this karst flow system and processes such as aggregation straining filtration and sedimentation do not operate efficiently except for particles larger than 5 μm from previous field studies particle recovery rates were reported that were significantly lower auckenthaler et al 2002 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 2011 schiperski et al 2016 than for comparatively injected conservative solute tracers in most of these studies the injected particles were latex microspheres or bacteriophages which might be prone to retention processes due to their surface properties schiperski et al 2016 in addition the injection number of microspheres is restricted in many cases due to financial reasons 3 5 relative normalized concentrations of fine versus larger particles for a karst aquifer system in switzerland it was observed that the autochthonous turbidity originating from sediments inside the conduit system goes along with a wide range of particle sizes whereas the allochthonous turbidity is characterized by a predominance of finer particles pronk et al 2007 these originate from the inflowing surface stream due to the longer travel distance the larger particles were removed by sedimentation or filtration and are thus underrepresented the study from pronk et al 2007 represents the natural flow conditions in a karst aquifer for the particle tracer test there is a clear increase of the particle numbers of the pscs between 0 8 µm and 10 μm figs 3 and 4 using the normalized concentrations c m allows removing the effect of the variable input numbers for each psc fig 4 as all particle numbers increase particle size distributions are presented as distributive or cumulative psd fig 7 for further analyses the cumulative psd analysis shows the cumulative psd for a given time over the cumulative reference psd at t0 versus the particle size classes for the analysis of psds from the tracer tests the reference psd was obtained by measurement of the spring water prior to the test the distributive psd analysis shows the distributive psd for a given time over the distributive reference psd at t0 versus the particle size classes in both cases the reference psd at t0 0 is a horizontal line at y 1 in this case the normalized cumulative psd of the injection solution red line in fig 7a plots below the reference psd indicating that it contains a lower percentage of small particles and a higher percentage of larger particles than the reference psd during the rising limb and peak t 0 84 h of the particle btc the psd becomes even lower than the psd of the injection solution demonstrating an even higher percentage of larger particles which means that larger particles travel faster than smaller particles during the recession limb fig 7b the psd converges back to pre experimental conditions this observation is also clearly discernible in the normalized distributive psd measured during the peak of the breakthrough curve fig 7c where small particle size classes ranging from 0 8 µm to 1 4 μm are clearly underrepresented whereas larger particles ranging from 1 4 µm to 10 μm are overrepresented with respect to pre experimental conditions towards the end of the tracer test these differences level out and the psd is almost back to pre experimental conditions 2 24 h after the injection fig 7d this is in accordance with the smaller flow velocities and larger dispersion of finer particles this illustrates that there is a relative decrease of finer particles because there is a wider range of particles present in comparison to pre experiment conditions this corresponds well with the interpretation of the autochthonous turbidity signal by pronk et al 2007 for tracer tests with longer flow distances it can be expected that the recovery of the largest particles will be lower because they will be subject to sedimentation 4 conclusions and implications given the importance of colloids with respect to contaminant transport in groundwater and the role of particle transport for soil erosion and karstification processes in carbonate rock karst terranes there is the need for an appropriate tracer technique to quantify these transport processes in this study we show that natural sediment particles and the analysis of the particle size distribution using modern particle counters with extremely low detection limits can bridge this research gap natural sediment particles are available at low cost therefore it is possible to use injection quantities that are sufficient for generating definitive particle breakthrough curves at monitoring sites furthermore there are legal reservations in many countries with regard to the toxicity of solute substances commonly used as groundwater tracers natural non toxic sediment particles are not an additional burden to aquifers therefore legal restrictions might be minimized the measurement of the individual size classes at the karst spring allows a deeper understanding of size dependent particle transport mechanisms the main conclusions can be summarized as follows mean flow velocities increase systematically with increasing particle size pointing to preferential transport of larger particles in the main karst conduits while finer particles and solutes also enter zones with lower flow velocities dispersion decreased with increasing particle size which also supports the hypothesis that smaller particles and solutes experience a wider range of flow velocities while the transport of larger particles mainly occurs along the fastest transport pathways these two observations point to exclusion processes operating in karst aquifers i e the transport of larger particles mainly occurs in the fast flowing conduits whereas solutes and fine particles also enter low flow zones and sample a wider velocity field the recovery of solutes and small to medium particles 0 8 4 μm is comparably high suggesting that there are no efficient retention processes while the recovery of the largest particles is lower most probably as a result of sedimentation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

2007 schiperski et al 2015 a major outcome of the study by pronk et al 2007 is that particles in the range of 1 2 μm along with elevated levels of dissolved organic matter are often associated with e coli contamination groundwater tracing methods provide an excellent means for the determination of transport parameters and aquifer characteristics artificial tracers are substances that are intentionally introduced into the water to study flow and transport whereas natural tracers are substances that are encountered naturally in the water including both natural water constituents and contaminants goldscheider et al 2008 this study focuses entirely on artificial tracers it is important to note however that natural substances also can be used and referred to as artificial tracers if they are injected intentionally for scientific purposes there is a large amount of research dealing with solute tracers in field studies whereas only few studies deal with particle tracers as surrogates for colloidal particles most of these used latex microspheres goeppert and goldscheider 2008 2011 käss 2004 schiperski et al 2016 or bacteriophages and bacteria auckenthaler et al 2002 rossi et al 1998 sinreich et al 2009 flynn and sinreich 2010 however these colloidal particles do not necessarily represent the natural particles that are present in the aquifer and therefore might not be able to lead to an improved understanding of the transport properties of natural colloidal particles thus the objectives of this study were i to develop a robust groundwater tracing technique based on sediment particles originating from the aquifer ii use the particle size distribution in particular the finer size classes for evaluating the hygienic risk of the aquifer iii decipher similarities or dissimilarities between the conservative solute tracer and the particle size classes and iv improve the understanding of the aquifer properties by the application of different tracer types for this study we used a karst experimental site in the lechquellen mountains austria that is ideally suited for field tracer tests it is located in one of the most important european karstifiable carbonate rock formations so the results may be transferrable to many other karst areas with a well developed conduit network the proposed particle tracing method can also be applied in other environments with similar flow properties and thus help to better manage and protect groundwater resources 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the karst experimental site is located at near lake formarinsee in the lechquellen mountains in the western austrian state of vorarlberg geologically it belongs to the austro alpine nappes of the northern calcareous alps the test site consists of triassic thin bedded limestone of the so called plattenkalk formation that forms spectacular karst landforms the experimental site consists of a swallow hole that is directly connected to a karst spring at a linear distance of 230 m the spring is located at 1847 m a s l and consists of several orifices it is the main surficial tributary to lake formarinsee a famous karst lake without any surface drainages that is located in a depression fig 1 the observed spring discharge ranges between 12 1 l s and 99 2 l s which is higher than the discharge of the swallow hole indicating that the spring also receives water from diffuse recharge in its autogenic catchment for water quality investigations the influence of the swallow hole on these springs is of major importance while diffuse infiltration might lead to significant retardation the main advantages of this study area are relatively simple hydrogeological conditions with an active swallow hole connected to perennial karst springs short distances and high flow velocities resulting in short experiment durations low background particle numbers at the spring with constant values during constant hydrological conditions good accessibility these advantages make this location an ideal benchmark site with regard to evaluating tracers and tracing concepts 2 2 sediment particle sampling and particle size distribution measurements the particle size distribution psd was determined by using a particle counter abakus mobil fluid klotz gmbh bad liebenzell germany each measurement cycle comprises one purge volume of 10 ml and the followed by a measurement volume of 10 ml the limit of detection is 1 particle per measurement volume in this case 1 10 ml the particle counter groups the particles into 32 freely definable size classes ranging from 0 8 µm to 450 μm the smallest detectable particle diameter is 0 8 μm the size class δd of 0 8 μm corresponds to 0 8 δd 1 0 μm sediment particles designated for injection were retrieved prior to the field test directly from the outlet of the karst spring and stored at 4 c until they were received at the laboratory afterwards these sediments were sieved to remove the particle fractions larger than 200 μm in diameter stainless steel test sieve 200 μm opening paul stenzel hamburg 50 germany the psd of the injection particles was determined by the particle counter after dilution of a 1 ml sample of the suspension and sonication for 60 s with an ultrasonic homogenizer sonopuls hd 2200 bandelin gmbh co kg berlin germany for the 0 8 μm size class for instance the injected particle number was 1 36 1010 the final volume of the injection suspension was 1 8 l the measurement of the aqueous samples at the spring during the field tracing tests was done online at cycle intervals of 2 5 min by using the same particle counters as for the injection suspension but without sample dilution prior to the tracer injection background measurements of the psd at the spring outlet were taken for 24 h during the pre injection psd measurements relatively constant background values were obtained for the size classes between 0 8 and 10 μm with only minor variability ranging from 1 86 to 4 95 for the larger size classes 20 140 μm the overall number of particles was significantly smaller but the variability increased to 69 for the 100 μm size class therefore size classes larger than 20 μm were not considered for this study for the smaller size classes the constant background values were subtracted 2 3 conservative tracer analysis and field tracing experiments during the field tracer test the fluorescent dye uranine cas rn 518 47 8 applichem gmbh darmstadt germany was used as a conservative solute for comparison the sediment particles and 1 002 g of uranine were injected simultaneously as a dirac input into the swallow hole location see fig 1 the flow rate at the swallow hole was 0 8 l s 50 ml water samples were taken at the spring for laboratory analysis of uranine which was done with a perkinelmer ls 55 spectrofluorometer 4 ml were adjusted with 50 μl of a ph 10 buffer to achieve the maximum fluorescence intensity following the standard procedure reported in käss 2004 during the experiment the spring discharge was 20 l s determined by the salt dilution method corresponding to low flow conditions 2 4 data analysis for each particle size class and for uranine the basic transport parameters were derived directly from the breakthrough curves btcs time of first detection t 1 peak concentration c p peak concentration time t p mean transit time t m and the corresponding maximum flow velocity v max peak velocity v p and mean flow velocity v m the recovery rates r were calculated using the discharge q 1 r 1 m t 0 q c d t where m is the injected tracer mass and c is the aqueous concentration at time t leibundgut et al 2009 the btcs were further evaluated by a one dimensional 1d advection dispersion model adm 2 c t d 2 c x 2 v m c x with mean flow velocity v m and dispersion d acting as fitting parameters the adm was initially developed for porous media but can also be applied to karst conduits where dispersion is most important in flow direction so that 1d models are justified geyer et al 2007 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 advection can be expressed as mean transit time t 0 or mean flow velocity v m l t 0 with l flow path length dispersion can be expressed by the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d the longitudinal dispersivity α d v or the peclet number pe v m l d for the modelling of the observed btcs the software cxtfit toride et al 1999 was used multiple peaks are often detected for tracers therefore the multi dispersion model mdm käss 2004 leibundgut et al 2009 was applied the widely accepted assumption of this approach is that there are individual flow paths with different flow velocities and dispersivities which converge close to the outlet of the system in this case the karst spring the observed btcs represent the superposition of the individual flow paths in cxtfit for modelling multiple peaks a stepwise determination of the transport parameters needs to be realized the earliest peak peak 1 is fitted for the determination of v and d and then subtracted the residual concentrations are used for further fitting for comparison all values are given as normalized values c m where m stands for the tracer injection mass uranine or injected particle number the normalization of the concentration values by the input mass in case of a solute tracer or input particle number in case of a particle tracer makes the btcs easily comparable as it levels out the effect of the different tracer types solute vs particles and input quantities käss 2004 the generalized extreme studentized deviate test esd was conducted to identify if present statistically significant outliers in the series of descriptive and fitted parameters yu et al 2004 the shapiro wilk test was used prior to the esd to verify that the data is normally distributed except for the outliers the software origin was used for these statistical analyses in karst aquifer systems finer particles are always more abundant than larger ones pronk et al 2007 therefore more sophisticated methods for psd analysis are required the particle size distribution psd can be presented as absolute particle numbers or percentage either in a distributive or in a cumulative form in the distributive psd the number or percentage of particles for each individual size class is presented and the sum of all values is the total particle number or 100 in the cumulative psd the number or percentage of particles smaller than a specific diameter is presented and the final value for the largest size class is the total particle number or 100 the cumulative psd can be obtained from the distributive one by summing up all size classes starting with the smallest one normalized psd can be obtained by defining a reference psd e g pre experimental conditions and dividing all obtained psd by this reference in this presentation form the reference psd will occur as a horizontal line y 1 and all measured psds will plot above or below this line thus indicating over or underrepresentation of the respective size classes for the evaluation of the btcs the constant background values were subtracted for each particle size class for the cumulative and distributive psd analysis original values including the background values were taken into consideration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the solute btcs at the karst spring the conservative solute tracer uranine provided evidence for the underground connection between the swallow hole and the spring which is located at a horizontal distance of 230 m the test yielded multiple peaks very high mean flow velocities 253 m h 164 m h and 77 m h and low dispersivities 2 6 m 2 8 m and 7 2 m for the first peak and the two subsequent peaks for peak 1 see table 1 fig 2 the total recovery at the spring was 83 indicating that it is the main outlet of this system although the missing 17 suggest infiltration into deeper parts of the aquifer to additional spring outlets or the fissured matrix the large peclet numbers 88 7 81 4 and 31 8 show that the flow can be mainly characterized by advection rather than dispersion the overall fit quality is relatively good r2 0 976 for the entire btc the obtained values of flow velocity and dispersion are within a typical range for karst aquifers goldscheider et al 2008 3 2 particle tracer btcs transport properties and comparison with the solute tracer due to the low variability of the natural background and stable hydrological conditions an accurate discrimination between the natural background particles and the injected particles is possible exemplarily the btcs of the particle size classes pscs 1 1 µm 2 1 µm and 3 2 μm are shown as classical btcs in fig 3 a compilation of all btcs including uranine and the 28 particle size classes between 0 8 µm and 10 μm is shown in fig 4 there is a distinct first peak with a first detection time t1 of about 0 57 h up to 0 70 h table 1 and a mean value of 0 64 h thus the maximum flow velocity vmax ranges from 402 9 m h to 326 6 m h for the 2 2 μm psc and the 10 μm psc respectively the mean value of vmax for all size classes is 357 4 m h in comparison to the solute tracer uranine with a t1 of 0 58 h and a vmax of 394 3 m h table 1 an earlier first arrival or faster transport of particles is not observable fig 4 the absolute differences between t1 and vmax of uranine and particles are relatively small and statistically not significant according to the esd test for the first peak the peak time tp of the particles has a mean value of 0 83 h with a standard deviation of 0 02 h which is virtually equal to the value of uranine with tp 0 83 h table 1 however the mean travel times tm and mean flow velocities vm for the particles differ significantly from the solute table 1 fig 5 b uranine gives a tm of 0 91 h and thus a vm of 253 2 m h whereas the mean values for the particles are 0 87 h with a standard deviation of 0 01 h and 263 8 m h with a standard deviation of 4 5 m h for tm and vm respectively according to the esd test tm and vm of uranine and the 10 μm psc are statistically different from the other particle size classes albeit representing different endpoints for uranine the adm gives the lowest vm and for the 10 μm psc it gives the largest vm the general trend shows clearly increasing mean flow velocities with increasing particle sizes fig 5 the smaller the particle sizes are the closer is vm to that of the solute dispersion shows exactly the opposite behavior table 1 fig 5 for uranine the adm gives a dispersion of d 656 9 m2 h the largest dispersion with d 718 7 m2 h is given for the 1 4 μm psc and the lowest for the 10 μm psc with d 214 6 m2 h fig 5 whereas the mean for the particles is about 621 6 m2 h thus the dispersion of the solute is larger than the average range of the particle size classes in particular of the 10 μm psc fig 5c which is significantly lower according to the esd test the general trend shows that with increasing particle sizes the dispersion decreases albeit it is less pronounced than the trend for vm fig 5 this is in good agreement with the findings sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 observed for the pore scale in micromodels of porous media these authors reported an increasing average velocity larger than that of the solute and at the same time decreasing dispersion with increasing colloidal size this was explained by size exclusion processes at the pore scale which might lead to pore exclusion at larger scales size exclusion implies that colloidal particles cannot move into the entire pore space and travel only in the center of the pores where flow paths with the largest flow velocities prevail pore exclusion refers to a larger scale and assumes that there are regions that are non accessible for colloidal particles as a result smaller colloidal particles can be transported easier through a larger proportion of the entire pore space and show vm and dispersion closer to that of the solute tracer in contrast larger colloidal particles can only travel in the centers of the largest pore channels and have less diverse flowpaths thus giving a lower dispersion and higher vm auset and keller 2004 fig 6 illustrates the transfer of the concept of exclusion processes to karst aquifers with double porosity where rapid flow and preferential transport of larger particles occurs in the main conduits solutionally enlarged fractures and bedding planes solutes and smaller particles sample the entire velocity field but may also enter the low flow volumes of the adjacent fissured and porous rock matrix it should be noted that the dimensions of karst conduits cm to m ford and williams 2007 are much larger than large pore channels in porous media larger particles are subject to sedimentation 3 3 evidence for multiple flow paths and implications as there are several individual peaks observed for the btcs and the hydrological conditions are constant throughout the test different flow channels or pathways in the underground can be assumed leibundgut et al 2009 otherwise multiple peaks could be attributed to individual rain events in contrast to the solute btc the secondary peaks of the individual pscs are associated with a significantly lower fit quality therefore the transport parameters are not discussed in greater detail however it is obvious from the btcs fig 3 that the second peak becomes less important with increasing particle sizes this supports the hypothesis that exclusion processes occur which affect the larger colloidal particles to a larger degree 3 4 recovery rates of solutes and particles the recovery of the conservative solute tracer is 83 3 which is very similar to the observed particle recoveries with a mean value of 77 1 and a standard deviation of 12 3 table 1 in particular the larger pscs between 2 3 µm and 4 0 μm yield a slightly larger recovery than the solute tracer whereas the recovery of the finer pscs 0 8 2 2 μm is equal or slightly smaller than for uranine fig 5 this behavior is also reflected by the normalized concentrations c m which show larger values for the larger pscs and smaller values for the smaller pscs fig 4 particles larger than 5 μm experience sedimentation and thus yield lower recoveries fig 5 this is in good agreement with other studies of the natural particle size distribution in karst aquifers schiperski et al 2015 atteia and kozel 1997 where sedimentation processes were assumed for particles larger than 4 3 μm and 5 μm respectively in granular porous media however physical straining is a significant mechanism of colloid retention when the ratio of the colloid and the median grain diameter is larger than 0 5 bradford et al 2004 for the 4 3 μm particles this would yield a median collector grain diameter of 860 μm and less in conduit or fissure dominated karst aquifers conduit diameters are significantly larger ford and williams 2007 and thus physical straining does not play a major role the very high recoveries for both the solute tracer and the particles show that retention of particles does not take place in this karst flow system and processes such as aggregation straining filtration and sedimentation do not operate efficiently except for particles larger than 5 μm from previous field studies particle recovery rates were reported that were significantly lower auckenthaler et al 2002 goeppert and goldscheider 2008 2011 schiperski et al 2016 than for comparatively injected conservative solute tracers in most of these studies the injected particles were latex microspheres or bacteriophages which might be prone to retention processes due to their surface properties schiperski et al 2016 in addition the injection number of microspheres is restricted in many cases due to financial reasons 3 5 relative normalized concentrations of fine versus larger particles for a karst aquifer system in switzerland it was observed that the autochthonous turbidity originating from sediments inside the conduit system goes along with a wide range of particle sizes whereas the allochthonous turbidity is characterized by a predominance of finer particles pronk et al 2007 these originate from the inflowing surface stream due to the longer travel distance the larger particles were removed by sedimentation or filtration and are thus underrepresented the study from pronk et al 2007 represents the natural flow conditions in a karst aquifer for the particle tracer test there is a clear increase of the particle numbers of the pscs between 0 8 µm and 10 μm figs 3 and 4 using the normalized concentrations c m allows removing the effect of the variable input numbers for each psc fig 4 as all particle numbers increase particle size distributions are presented as distributive or cumulative psd fig 7 for further analyses the cumulative psd analysis shows the cumulative psd for a given time over the cumulative reference psd at t0 versus the particle size classes for the analysis of psds from the tracer tests the reference psd was obtained by measurement of the spring water prior to the test the distributive psd analysis shows the distributive psd for a given time over the distributive reference psd at t0 versus the particle size classes in both cases the reference psd at t0 0 is a horizontal line at y 1 in this case the normalized cumulative psd of the injection solution red line in fig 7a plots below the reference psd indicating that it contains a lower percentage of small particles and a higher percentage of larger particles than the reference psd during the rising limb and peak t 0 84 h of the particle btc the psd becomes even lower than the psd of the injection solution demonstrating an even higher percentage of larger particles which means that larger particles travel faster than smaller particles during the recession limb fig 7b the psd converges back to pre experimental conditions this observation is also clearly discernible in the normalized distributive psd measured during the peak of the breakthrough curve fig 7c where small particle size classes ranging from 0 8 µm to 1 4 μm are clearly underrepresented whereas larger particles ranging from 1 4 µm to 10 μm are overrepresented with respect to pre experimental conditions towards the end of the tracer test these differences level out and the psd is almost back to pre experimental conditions 2 24 h after the injection fig 7d this is in accordance with the smaller flow velocities and larger dispersion of finer particles this illustrates that there is a relative decrease of finer particles because there is a wider range of particles present in comparison to pre experiment conditions this corresponds well with the interpretation of the autochthonous turbidity signal by pronk et al 2007 for tracer tests with longer flow distances it can be expected that the recovery of the largest particles will be lower because they will be subject to sedimentation 4 conclusions and implications given the importance of colloids with respect to contaminant transport in groundwater and the role of particle transport for soil erosion and karstification processes in carbonate rock karst terranes there is the need for an appropriate tracer technique to quantify these transport processes in this study we show that natural sediment particles and the analysis of the particle size distribution using modern particle counters with extremely low detection limits can bridge this research gap natural sediment particles are available at low cost therefore it is possible to use injection quantities that are sufficient for generating definitive particle breakthrough curves at monitoring sites furthermore there are legal reservations in many countries with regard to the toxicity of solute substances commonly used as groundwater tracers natural non toxic sediment particles are not an additional burden to aquifers therefore legal restrictions might be minimized the measurement of the individual size classes at the karst spring allows a deeper understanding of size dependent particle transport mechanisms the main conclusions can be summarized as follows mean flow velocities increase systematically with increasing particle size pointing to preferential transport of larger particles in the main karst conduits while finer particles and solutes also enter zones with lower flow velocities dispersion decreased with increasing particle size which also supports the hypothesis that smaller particles and solutes experience a wider range of flow velocities while the transport of larger particles mainly occurs along the fastest transport pathways these two observations point to exclusion processes operating in karst aquifers i e the transport of larger particles mainly occurs in the fast flowing conduits whereas solutes and fine particles also enter low flow zones and sample a wider velocity field the recovery of solutes and small to medium particles 0 8 4 μm is comparably high suggesting that there are no efficient retention processes while the recovery of the largest particles is lower most probably as a result of sedimentation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

18476,pipe bursts in water distribution networks lead to considerable water loss and pose risks of bacteria and pollutant contamination pipe burst localisation methods help water service providers repair the burst pipes and restore water supply timely and efficiently although methods have been reported on burst detection and localisation there is a lack of studies on accurate localisation of a burst within a potential district by accessible meters to address this a novel burst location identification framework by fully linear densenet bliff is proposed in this framework additional pressure meters are placed at limited optimised places for a short period minutes to hours to monitor system behaviour after the burst the fully linear densenet fl densenet newly developed in this study modifies the state of the art deep learning algorithm to effectively extract features in the limited pressure signals for accurate burst localisation bliff was tested on a benchmark network with different parameter settings which showed that accurate burst localisation results can be achieved even with high model uncertainties the framework was also applied to a real life network in which 57 of the total 58 synthetic bursts in the potential burst district were correctly located when the top five most possible pipes are considered and among them 37 were successfully located when considering only the top one only one failed because of the very small pipe diameter and remote location comparisons with densenet and the traditional fully linear neural network demonstrate that the framework can effectively narrow the potential burst district to one or several pipes with good robustness and applicability codes are available at https github com wizard1203 waternn graphical abstract image 1 keywords burst localisation deep learning densenet pipe burst water distribution network 1 introduction water loss is a key issue in the management of water distribution systems as in addition to the depletion of water resources it also causes additional energy and chemical usage for water treatment and supply and poses risks of bacteria and pollutant contamination fontanazza et al 2015 for example about 29 billion m3 of drinking water a value of over 9 billion is lost per year in asia frauendorfer and liemberger 2010 and about 7 85 billion m3 of water was lost in 2017 in china cuwa 2017 pipe bursts in water distribution networks wdns are a main source of water loss awwa 2009 moreover they often lead to social impacts like water service interruptions and traffic delays berardi et al 2008 as such it is critical that the location of a pipe burst can be determined effectively for efficient restoration of water supply with the development of supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems real time monitoring of pressure and or flow data are being widely used for the detection and localisation of pipe bursts in wdns the deviation of real time data from the normal range of system behaviour is a key principle adopted in literature for burst detection localisation to establish the normal performance expected from a wdn models have been developed based on data driven techniques such as machine learning models mounce et al 2002 2010a romano et al 2014 and clustering analysis wu et al 2016 the deviation can also be analysed using hydraulic models bicik et al 2010 meseguer et al 2014 wu et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 the data driven techniques were found to be effective in burst detection but incompetent in burst localisation wu and liu 2017 the model based approaches rely heavily on the accuracy of the hydraulic model hutton et al 2014 and do not perform as well in larger wdns as in small ones other burst localisation methods using pressure flow measurements have also been proposed based on spatial analysis of the change in pressure flow data across a wdn for example mounce et al 2003 used a triangle based cubic interpolation to create a pressure drop surface during a burst to estimate its location in farley et al 2013 the location of a burst within a district metering area dma was inferred by the sensitivities of different pressure flow measurements with respect to a burst outflow romano et al 2013 employed multivariate gaussian mixtures based graphical model and geostatistical techniques to exploit data from a larger number of pressure meters to determine the potential positions of a burst within a dma nevertheless due to the insensitivity of pressures to bursts bakker et al 2014 and as normally random demand fluctuations could mask the hydraulic variations caused by bursts these methods can only narrow down the potential locations of a burst to a rough district as large as hundreds of meters including at least several tens of pipes which is insufficient for timely repair of pipe burst and service restoration for more accurate localisation of pipe bursts new targeted monitoring is usually required to collect detailed information e g acoustic or transient signals of system behaviour at the potential locations to detect the abnormality acoustic equipment such as listening sticks and noise correlators are widely used for manual inspection despite the effectiveness and easy implementation they are very labour intensive by temporarily placing accelerometer sensors and analysing the acoustic signals the method proposed by kang et al 2018 can detect the location of a burst leakage automatically however its reliability is sensitive to the characteristics of the leak conditions e g water pressure leak flow rate and the detection range is limited by the clarity and correlation of acoustic signals transient based methods colombo et al 2009 locate bursts by analysing transient wave features such as propagation reflection and damping however the background noise or other activities in a system may shadow the burst induced transient signals especially if the number of pipes to be analysed increases wu and liu 2017 moreover some methods in this category need computationally demanding mathematical simulations and the high frequency sensors employed are costly as such the current acoustic or transient based methods are not suitable for accurate burst locating from a reasonably large area e g a dma or tens of pipes to a single pipe pressure meters can be a good alternative as they are easy to install e g at any hydrant or other tapping points and are less costly than flow meters a possible solution to overcome the insensitivity of pressures is to mutually complement key features in pressures at different moments and fuse and identify the features in a continuous period of measurements by pattern recognition algorithms although machine learning algorithms such as traditional artificial neural networks anns clustering and support vector machines have been used to detect and or locate bursts mounce et al 2002 2010a romano et al 2014 wu et al 2016 they need to hand design suitable feature extractors and are difficult to learn complex features in recent years as a newly developed subfield of anns deep learning technology lecun et al 2015 has become a powerful tool for feature identification and pattern recognition comparing with the traditional machine learning algorithms very complex functions can be learned from raw data with the key features automatically extracted convolutional neural networks cnns are the most widely used deep learning methods more recently researchers found that cnns can be deeper thus more accurate and efficient to train if they have shorter connections between former layers and latter layers srivastava et al 2015 based on this huang et al 2017 proposed a novel densely connected convolutional network densenet architecture which improves the flow of information and gradients among layers intensifies the propagation of features and encourages feature reuse thus densenet provides better parameter efficiency and is easier to be trained with better accuracy cnns including densenet which employ convolutional layers to detect local conjunctions of features from the previous layers and pooling layers to merge semantically similar features lecun et al 2015 show higher accuracy in identifying objects with abundant local features e g language images or videos than global features however the global features of a wdn pressure signal such as its amplitude and time variation could be more important and the convolution and pooling procedures may disorganise the global features in this study we proposed a new fully linear densenet fl densenet by replacing the convolutional layers in densenet with linear connections benefiting from the dense connectivity pattern fl densenet enables the key features in pressure signals to be automatically extracted and more efficiently learned this study aims to propose a novel burst location identification framework by fl densenet bliff it can effectively identify the accurate location a single or a few pipes of a burst from a larger potential district e g a dma bliff uses the hydraulic model of a wdn to simulate bursts to train fl densenet the newly collected pressure data at the optimised meter locations are fed to the trained fl densenet for prediction of burst location the framework is applied on two case studies and its robustness against the accuracy of system hydraulic model is examined 2 methodology built on the hydraulic model of a wdn fl densenet extracts features in pressure patterns when a burst occurs at each pipe this is based on the fact that 1 for any burst the responses in pressure drop caused by a burst outflow vary at different nodes across a wdn and 2 for any node the pressure variations when the burst occur at different pipes also vary by matching the learnt features with new monitoring data the likelihood of burst occurring at every pipe can be predicted the structure of the proposed bliff is introduced in section 2 1 with a few key steps described in sections 2 2 to 2 5 2 1 burst location identification framework by fl densenet fig 1 shows the flow chart for the proposed bliff as highlighted in the top box in dashed lines a key assumption is that a burst has already been detected and the potential district of the burst a dma or tens to hundreds of potential pipes is given bliff consists of eight steps the first four of which can be done either offline or simultaneously with the latter four after a burst is detected the first step of bliff is to choose the optimal locations for the added pressure meters in the potential burst district so that effective and efficient collection of burst information can be made using the least number of meters the meters should be sensitive to flow changes occurring in the potential burst district the optimisation and sampling design are described in detail in section 2 3 the hydraulic model of a wdn built on epanet3 rossman 2010 yan et al 2019 which allows for pressure driven analysis pda is employed to simulate pipe bursts further details are provided in section 2 4 the simulation results are processed and fed to train fl densenet described in section 2 2 the data preprocessing as described in section 2 5 can improve the learning performance by amplifying key features and improving comparability in pressure measurements after a pipe burst is detected pressure meters are placed at the optimised nodes to collect dynamic pressure changes within a prescribed duration in minutes to hours further described in section 2 4 3 the collected monitoring data are preprocessed according to the procedure described in section 2 5 and then fed to the trained fl densenet model for prediction 2 2 fully linear densenet fl densenet differs from the original densenet by replacing convolutional layers with linear connections and omitting the pooling layers similar to other anns fl densenet is based on a collection of connected processors i e artificial neurons which form an input layer a number of hidden layers i e a series of dense blocks and transition layers to transfer analyse and weight the input information and an output layer an illustrative flowchart is shown in fig 2 and the detailed description is provided as follows where l 0 l 1 l i 1 is a concatenation of the previous layers 0 1 i 1 c i is a composite function which includes three consecutive operations batch normalisation bn ioffe and szegedy 2015 rectified linear unit relu schmidhuber 2015 and a linear connection 1 input layer it receives input information e g preprocessed pressure measurements in the form of matrices or vectors 2 dense block it contains a number of layers which are connected by a dense connectivity pattern namely there are direct connections from any layer to all subsequent layers huang et al 2017 and a layer l i can receive the outputs of all preceding layers at its input 1 l i c i l 0 l 1 l i 1 3 transition layer it is also a combination of bn relu and linear connection and is used to link the blocks to fuse different characters 4 prediction a softmax classifier is attached at the end of the last dense block to give the prediction results in this study a probability value of burst occurring is generated for every pipe in the potential burst district 2 3 optimisation of pressure meter locations in a wdn the sensitivity of nodal pressures to the changing of nodal outflows can be indicated by a jacobian matrix which contains the gradient information of nodal pressure with respect to nodal outflow as presented in eq 2 2 q h h q where q h is the jacobian matrix of which the elements represent the sensitivities of nodal heads with respect to nodal outflows h is the vector of nodal heads q is the vector of nodal outflows an explicit method proposed by liu et al 2017 is employed in our study to solve q h three parameters are proposed to measure the effectiveness of meters which are coverage limit c l coverage number c n and coverage rate c r for node i and pressure meter at node j if 3 q h i j c l then node i is considered to be covered by meter at node j as such c l determines the minimum sensitivity that the meters should meet if node i is covered by more than c n meters node i is considered to be sufficiently covered the higher the value of c n the richer the information can be used to train fl densenet c r is the ratio of sufficiently covered nodes with respect to all nodes in the potential burst district for example if c l c n and c r are set as 0 02 2 and 85 respectively then there should be at least 85 of nodes are covered q h i j 0 02 by no less than two meters the optimal pressure meter locations are those which can satisfy the threshold limits defined by c l c n and c r with the least number of meters the optimisation model can be expressed as below 4 min s 1 n p s subject to 5 1 n p i 1 n p χ j ε s χ q h i j c l c n c r where n p is the number of nodes in the potential burst district set s contains the selected meter locations element j in s denotes that a meter is placed at node j s denotes the cardinality of the set s χ r 0 1 is defined as χ a 1 if a 0 and 0 otherwise the optimisation problem is solved by the genetic algorithm ga holland 1992 ga is a metaheuristic algorithm which is widely used to solve optimisation problems in urban water management meng et al 2016 fu et al 2013 inspired by natural selection ga creates a set of solutions in the feasible region as individuals which evolve into better individuals in the next generation by means of bio inspired operators such as crossover mutation and selection this process is repeated until satisfactory results are obtained the ga toolbox in matlab is used in our study 2 4 training data generation epanet3 is employed to build the hydraulic model of a wdn and perform extended period simulations in this study as it enables pda which can produce a more realistic representation of the pressure deficient situations under pipe bursts yan et al 2019 a nodal outflow is dependent on its nodal pressure in a pda model which is calculated according to the wagner s formulas wagner et al 1988 6 q i 0 h i h i m i n q i r e q h i h i m i n h i r e q h i m i n 1 η h i m i n h i h i r e q q i r e q h i h i r e q where q i and q i r e q is the available outflow and required demand at node i respectively h i is the pressure at node i η is the head exponent generally η 1 5 2 h i m i n and h i r e q is the minimum pressure and required pressure respectively the values of η h i m i n and h i r e q are set as 2 0m and 30m in this study he et al 2016 the flow rate of a burst on a pipe is assumed to follow the orifice outflow formula in eq 7 7 q b u r s t c d a o r i 2 g h o r i where q b u r s t is the burst flow c d is the outflow coefficient c d 0 5 0 7 depending on the reynolds number and the shape of the orifice lambert 2001 and is set to be 0 6 in this study a o r i is area of the orifice and h o r i is the pressure it is assumed that a o r i γ a i j where a i j is the cross sectional area of corresponding pipe i j γ is an intensity coefficient which is determined by the intensity of a burst therefore we can simulate different scales of burst flow on a pipe by assigning different values of γ for example for a pipe with a diameter of 200 mm and a pressure of 30m γ 10 corresponds to a burst flow of 45 7l s and γ 30 corresponds to 137 1l s different values of γ are used and examined in this work the embedded leakage simulation model in epanet3 which is based on eq 8 is used to calculate the orifice outflow equation and simulate burst flows 8 q i j l e a k a i j h i j b l i j where q i j l e a k h i j and l i j are the leakage flow pressure and length of pipe i j respectively a i j and b are parameters to be determined if a i j and b are defined according to eq 9 9 a i j c d γ a i j 2 g l i j b 0 5 then the right side of eq 8 will be the same as that of the orifice outflow formula in eq 7 therefore using the parameters defined in eq 9 we can employ epanet3 to simulate burst orifice outflow on pipe i j and γ is the only parameter to be determined as pda is employed in this study the burst flow rate is dynamic with the change of water pressure on a pipe 2 4 1 uncertainties of model parameters there are no perfect accurate hydraulic models of any wdns due to the various sources of uncertainty hutton et al 2014 savic et al 2009 for example there are inherent random patterns in the behaviour of water usage and the scale characteristics of a pipe burst moreover some parameters e g pipe roughness coefficients cannot be precisely measured to make realistic assumptions for bliff and test its robustness against the accuracy of the hydraulic model the following parameters are simulated in a stochastic manner pipe roughness coefficients and nodal demands white gaussian noises n 0 σ 2 are added to the existing roughness coefficients and diurnal nodal demand curves with the standard deviation values for the two parameters being σ c and σ q respectively smaller standard deviation should be assigned if a hydraulic model is well calibrated otherwise a larger value should be used intensity coefficient γ pipe burst flow rate can vary in a wide range in real life and it is hard if possible to know the exact outflow rate of a burst even after its detection the burst flow is assumed to be affected by the diameter and the intensity coefficient γ of a burst pipe in this work γ is simulated as a random number which follows the uniform distribution u γ m i n γ m a x 2 4 2 simulation of pipe burst the procedures for the simulation of a burst are summarised in six steps described below 1 set pipe i j as the pipe where a burst occurs 2 for each pipe draw a noise value from n 0 σ c 2 and add it to the original roughness coefficient 3 for each node draw noise values from n 0 σ q 2 and add them to elements of the nodal demand curve respectively 4 randomly select intensity coefficient γ from u γ m i n γ m a x and calculate the parameter a i j and assign leakage parameters a i j and b to pipe i j 5 employ epanet3 to run the hydraulic simulation with the assigned parameter values 6 record pressure values at selected monitoring nodes 2 4 3 generation of training data besides σ c σ q and γ m i n γ m a x mentioned in section 2 4 1 values of the following parameters also need to be defined for the generation of the training data set number of samples per pipe n t r to support feature identification of a pipe burst against various sources of uncertainties the simulation of pipe burst on any single pipe is performed for n t r times with stochastic parameter settings as such the total number of samples in the training data set is n t r m p if there are m p pipes in the potential burst district duration of data collection t d after a burst occurs pressure needs to be monitored at the optimised locations described in section 2 3 for a prescribed duration t d as nodal pressures are likely to show distinctive features at different times of a day driven by water usage behaviours the time parameters of the training data should correspond to those of actual bursts for effective machine learning for example assuming that a burst occurs at 2pm and field pressure data is measured from 3pm for 24 h t d 24 h with a 15 min interval when generating training data the burst should also starts at 2pm and the report start time time step and duration corresponding to the time parameters in epanet3 should be 3pm 15 min and 24 h respectively a longer t d is likely to yield a higher prediction accuracy as more data are captured however it also means longer waiting time for the burst localisation before a burst can be repaired thus a trade off needs to be made different values of t d are tested in this work number of pressure meters n m pressures are monitored at the n m selected nodes both for the generation of training data and for the field monitoring the number and location of meters are decided by the values of c l c n and c r as described in section 2 3 the accuracy of model prediction is likely to be higher with a larger n m but this increases the expenditures on the sampling equipment although a specific value of n m needs to be determined for the generation of a training data set similar to n t r and t d different values are tested for comprehensive analysis and discussion the four steps summarised below are used in our study to generate training data 1 choose parameter values for σ c σ q γ m i n γ m a x n t r t d and n m 2 set pipe i j as the pipe where a burst occurs simulate the burst and record pressure values at monitoring nodes 3 repeat step 2 for n t r times each of which uses newly randomly generated noise values and intensity coefficient n t r burst records are generated for pipe i j 4 for all the m p pipes in the potential burst district repeat steps 2 3 and n t r m p burst records are generated as the training data 2 5 data preprocessing the pressure data at a node meter m can be expressed as 10 h m h m 1 h m 2 h m n where h m denotes the monitored pressures at node m with fixed time intervals the length of h m is decided by the data collection duration t d and interval for example if t d 24 h with a time interval of 15 min then the length of h m is 96 n 96 the pressure measurements at all available meters can be expressed as a matrix as shown below 11 h h 1 h 2 h m h 11 h m 1 h 1 n h m n 2 5 1 nonlinear mapping the nonlinear mapping procedure is applied to facilitate feature extraction as it can amplify the time variation features of an original data set and increase the dimension of the original feature space for each h m defines 12 s m d i a g h m h m where the operator d i a g converts the vector to a diagonal matrix of which the diagonal is the original vector and other elements are 0 for all the measurements s s 1 s 2 s m 2 5 2 data normalisation as pressures of different meters may have diverse ranges affected by the location and elevation of the meters we need to normalise the values to make the pressures at different meters more comparable besides normalisation can help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fl densenet al shalabi and shaaban 2006 the z score normalisation is employed to normalise the data taken h m as an example 13 h m h m μ m σ m where h m is the normalised vector μ m and σ m are the mean and standard deviation of all the measurements collected at node m both h and s are normalised and fed to fl densenet 3 case studies and results two cases a benchmark network and a real life wdn are studied to demonstrate the reliability and applicability of bliff the following default settings are used σ c 10 σ q 10 γ m i n γ m a x 10 30 n t r 1800 t d 24 h n m 4 the default sampling interval is 15 min the neural network structure and hyper parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins used in the case studies are summarised in table 1 for example the hidden layers of the fl densenet used in case 1 consist of four dense blocks which contain 8 16 16 and 12 dense layers respectively the learning rate we used for this network is 0 6 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fl densenet four different kinds of anns are used for case 2 which are fl densenet fl densenet with the activation function relu replaced by sigmoid function schmidhuber 2015 densenet and the traditional fully linear neural network flnn as the flnn does not contain dense blocks its hidden layers are constituted by three fully connected layers the hyper parameters of the anns are the optimal parameters identified from a series of trials to test the performance for each pipe in the potential burst district we simulate burst on it for n t e times and generate n t e m p burst data as the test samples with the parameters be the same as the training data n t e is set to 200 after being trained bliff predicts the location of the burst in the test samples the prediction accuracy of a test sample i can be assessed by p r e 1 i and p r e 5 i bliff will evaluate a burst happening probability for each pipe if the pipe with the highest probability is the true burst pipe p r e 1 i 1 otherwise p r e 1 i 0 if the top five pipes include the true burst pipe p r e 5 i 1 otherwise p r e 5 i 0 in which case the prediction is considered as failed the overall performance of bliff can be assessed by eqs 14 and 15 14 a c c 1 1 n t e m p i 1 n t e m p p r e 1 i 15 a c c 5 1 n t e m p i 1 n t e m p p r e 5 i where a c c 1 and a c c 5 are the overall prediction accuracy of all test samples corresponding to p r e 1 i and p r e 5 i 3 1 case 1 the anytown walski et al 1987 network which is a highly looped small sized wdn fig 3 is employed to illustrate the application of bliff and its performance under different settings the network consists of 16 nodes 34 pipes 2 tanks and 1 reservoir the diameters of pipes range from 200 mm to 400 mm and the base demands of nodes range from 12 5 l s to 63 8l s different diurnal demand patterns are allocated to different nodes the potential burst district is assumed to be the whole network that is every pipe in the network is a potential location of the burst the least required number of pressure meters varies when different threshold values are assigned for c l c n and c r for example if c l c n and c r were set as 0 01 1 and 0 85 respectively one meter is sufficient if it is placed at node 9 if c l c n and c r are set as 0 02 2 and 0 85 respectively at least four meters need to be placed and the optimal locations are found to be nodes 3 12 15 and 17 the optimal locations corresponding to different n m are presented in table 2 and marked in fig 3 to provide insights on the practical application of bliff its performance under different network physical or hydraulic conditions are analysed by using one at a time sensitivity analysis in the analysis one parameter setting is changed to a different value at a time while other parameters remain at default settings as n t e 200 a total of 200 34 test samples are generated with each parameter setting as the uncertainties in pipe roughness coefficients and nodal demands highly affect model accuracy in a joint manner the performance of bliff under different combinations of σ c and σ q are analysed for a comprehensive representation of different levels of hydraulic model accuracy the results are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a and b the performance of bliff improves if the uncertainties in pipe roughness and nodal demands decrease i e a c c 1 in fig 4a and a c c 5 in fig 4b increases with lower values of σ c and σ q if σ c 5 and σ q 5 a c c 1 and a c c 5 are 99 and 100 respectively i e the top left corner of fig 4a and b if σ c and σ q increases to 20 and 25 respectively the accuracy reduces with a c c 1 81 and a c c 5 98 i e the bottom right corner of fig 4a and b nevertheless satisfactory prediction results are still obtained which indicates the high robustness of bliff against the accuracy of the hydraulic models results under different burst flow rates are presented in fig 4c it can be seen that the accuracy increases with the growth in γ m i n γ m a x which corresponds to larger burst flows if γ m i n γ m a x 1 5 corresponding to a 4 6 22 9l s burst flow for a 200 mm pipe with 30 m pressure a c c 1 is 35 and a c c 5 is 70 however a c c 1 and a c c 5 become higher than 80 and 95 if γ m i n γ m a x increases to 5 10 corresponding to a 22 9 45 7l s burst flow for a 200 mm pipe with 30 m pressure this is expected as the disturbance in pressure is more distinct with a higher burst flow which facilitates pattern recognition and burst localisation bliff can complement the features of pressures at different moments to achieve higher accuracy therefore longer t d will increase the prediction accuracy because pressures at more moments are collected however shorter t d allows faster field data collection hence the burst can be more rapidly located the relationship between t d and prediction accuracy are shown in fig 4d when t d 0 25 h i e 15 min which equals to the sampling interval so only 2 pressure measurements are collected per meter the a c c 1 and a c c 5 are 70 and 98 respectively when t d increases to more than 10 h a c c 1 reaches 96 and higher the accuracy rates are higher than 80 if t d is 1 h which is satisfactory and fits with regulations in the water industry such as the 3 h limit of response time in the uk diao et al 2016 meters should be placed at nodes where a burst can have sufficient influence on the pressures in our study c l c n and c r are used to define the minimum sensitivity requirement that the chosen meters should meet larger c l c n and c r results in more meters which will increase the performance of bliff but also will lead to more costs as shown in fig 4e when there is only one meter in the network a c c 1 and a c c 5 are 62 and 96 respectively if four meters are installed the a c c 1 and a c c 5 increased to 97 and 99 respectively a c c 5 is very high even with only one meter which indicates that it is also feasible to use fewer meters but employs more manpower to locate burst e g with listening sticks within the five identified pipes in generating the training data the simulated start time of the bursts should ideally be the same as the actual situation however as fl densenet could be trained in advance and in some cases we cannot clearly confirm when the burst started the start time of burst simulation t s may lag behind the real burst time t b to test its effect on the performance of bliff the burst time of training data t s is set to 24 00 and the real burst time t b of the test samples is set to 12 00 to 24 00 results are presented in fig 4f it can be seen that the accuracy decreased with larger lag times the main reason could be that the continuous burst outflow causes the water level of the tanks to drop hence the overall pressure distribution during simulation is inconsistent with the actual situation however even with a lag of 2 h the accuracy of bliff is still higher than 80 it is expected that the learning is more effective with larger n t r and training epoch training epoch indicates the number of times that fl densenet repeatedly learns the same training data set the default training epoch used in our study is 120 the effects of n t r and training epoch are presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a a c c 1 and a c c 5 are 85 and 99 respectively if n t r is 100 and increase with larger n t r however the increase rate becomes very small if n t r is over 1000 fig 5b shows that bliff can achieve good results acc1 90 after 25 training epochs with minor improvement acc1 97 if over 85 training epochs is used in this case with n t r 1800 processing each epoch takes about 3 5 min on an i7 4700mq cpu gtx850m gpu computer 3 2 case 2 a real network though the burst data are synthetic is used to test the reliability of bliff under realistic settings the network layout presented in fig 6 lies in eastern china jiangsu province it consists of 567 pipes total length is147km 480 junctions and 4 reservoirs and supplies 57 000 tons of water per day a burst is assumed to happen at the lower left district of the network this potential burst district contains 58 pipes with different diameters ranging from 100 mm to 400 mm c l c n and c r are set as 0 03 2 and 0 9 respectively and four optimal pressure meters are required their locations are optimised according to section 2 3 the training data and test samples are generated using the default parameter settings described at the beginning of section 3 as the potential burst district is connected with and affected by the rest of the wdn the uncertainties in the roughness coefficient and nodal demand are also simulated for pipes nodes outside the potential burst district to compare the performance of fl densenet with other anns four different anns as shown in table 1 are trained by the same training data and are evaluated with the same test samples table 3 reports the results on a c c 1 and a c c 5 of the four anns changing the activation function of fl densenet from relu to sigmoid has minimal effect on the results nevertheless using sigmoid is less computationally efficient than relu because frequent exponential operations in sigmoid which are computationally demanding need to be performed for densenet a c c 1 31 and a c c 5 67 these accuracies are about half of those of fl densenet the results demonstrate the validity of replacing the convolutional layers in densenet with linear connections which can avoid the global features in pressure signals being disorganised besides using linear connections requires less computational time than convolutional layers although the accuracy of flnn in this case seems acceptable in trial simulations it is found that the performance of flnn is very sensitive to the settings of the hyper parameters such as the learning rate and the number of hidden layers it only provides satisfactory results in a quite limited range of hyper parameters this implies that the algorithm is less robust and thus limited in practical application to further explore the performance of bliff on different pipes we create a new set of test samples with n t e 1 i e each pipe in the potential burst district is assumed as burst pipe for once respectively i e a total of 58 burst events are generated the prediction results are shown in fig 7 a 37 pipes i e 64 of the 58 pipes presented in green in fig 7a are accurately targeted with p r e 1 1 20 pipes 35 presented in yellow in fig 7a are included in the top five likely locations i e p r e 1 0 p r e 5 1 only one pipe fails to be correctly located i e p r e 1 0 p r e 5 0 as highlighted in red in fig 7a fig 7b to d show three examples of bursts in the three categories mentioned above the likelihood of burst happening is shown by the line colour and the true location of the burst is marked with a star as shown in fig 7a pipes with larger diameters i e thicker lines or closer to the monitoring meters are accurately predicted in general the two large pipes in the top left corner of the district have large diameters but are not as well predicted this may be because the pipes are linked to each other with very few branches hence they may yield similar patterns of pressure change when a burst occurs fig 7b gives an example of a correctly located burst of which the pipe with the highest predicted probability is the burst pipe fig 7c shows another example of pipe burst that falls in the second category i e p r e 1 0 p r e 5 1 this suggests that the feature of bursts at small pipes may be harder to distinguish from similar nearby pipes fig 7d shows an example of failed prediction a few pipes near the true burst location are predicted with high probabilities of burst this indicates that the pressure responses at the monitoring nodes are similar when the burst occurs at branched pipes or nearby pipes nevertheless bliff provides a good direction though not the accurate location in this case there could be more than one burst concurrently happening in real life to test the performance of bliff with multiple bursts two bursts are simultaneously simulated in the potential burst district with default parameters and at two randomly selected locations 11600 equals to n t e m p simulations are conducted as test samples it should be noted that fl densenet in this test is trained by data with only one burst and default parameters rather than two for each test sample if at least one of the bursts is correctly located the sample is deemed as successfully predicted an overall result of all the test samples is a c c 1 29 and a c c 5 77 it can be seen that the accuracy of burst localisation decreases when more than one burst occurs this is expected as wdns are nonlinear systems thus the impact of two bursts is not the addition of two single bursts hence the accuracy is low with the model trained using only single bursts three representative cases are illustrated in fig 8 if the bursts happen at pipes with large diameters and are far from each other so there are less mutual hydraulic effects both of them can be targeted by bliff in the example shown in fig 8a one burst is successfully located at the pipe with the highest probability and another included in the top five likely pipes fig 8b shows an example that a large burst and a small burst happen simultaneously in this case the hydraulic response of the smaller burst is masked by the larger one hence bliff failed to target it on the other hand the localisation accuracy of the larger burst is affected due to the disturbance of the smaller one however the larger burst pipe is still correctly identified within the top five predictions in the example shown in fig 8c bliff incorrectly locate the burst to the middle district of the two burst pipes this is because similar patterns are produced when a burst occurs in the middle of two bursts however bliff still identifies the correct area of bursts 4 discussions although previous studies suggest that pressure values are less sensitive to a burst or leak event bakker et al 2014 mounce et al 2010b the proposed bliff which is built on the latest deep learning technology can identify features in a continuous period of pressure measurements to accurately locate a burst to one or several pipes based on the two case studies comprehensive discussions about bliff are presented as follows a wdn model needs appropriate parameters such as pipe roughness coefficients and nodal demands to represent the real network accurately the uncertainty in the parameter values are especially high in less calibrated models and poorly maintained networks which undermines the performance of bliff however even assuming considerably large uncertainties in case 1 bliff can still provide satisfactory results this may be attributed to the following reasons firstly for a network in poor conditions with an uncalibrated model larger σ c and σ q are chosen to generate the training set hence it enables fl densenet to learn in a wider feature space and cover the features of the network despite the large uncertainty secondly as the pressure data are collected for a continuous period of time rather than a single moment features at different moments can complement each other which provides more thorough information and the effect of uncertainties can be reduced in practical application bliff can be set up as either offline or online in the offline bliff fl densenet is trained in advance moreover pressure meters can be installed in the optimal locations for a given district even without any bursts i e the first four steps in fig 1 are done offline if a burst occurs in this area the pressure records can be extracted and fed to the trained fl densenet in this case the efficiency of burst localisation solely depends on the duration of data collection process t d as discussed in fig 4d even if t d is within 1 h good prediction results can be yielded hence the offline bliff can achieve near real time burst localisation the offline bliff is more suitable for small networks or those with dma configurations as the potential burst district can be easily targeted e g within a dma as the burst time in training data should aim to be the same as actual bursts a series of fl densenets need to be trained with different burst time in the offline bliff as shown in fig 4f the accuracy is still high if there is a 1 h lag in the actual and assumed burst time hence 24 fl densenets i e burst occurring at 00 00 01 00 and 23 00 respectively should be sufficient for a given wdn the online bliff is more suitable for large wdns without dmas or where sufficient pressure meters cannot be installed in these cases mobile meters can be employed when a burst is detected concurrently training of fl densenet is performed on the provided potential burst district longer time is required for burst localisation in the online bliff than the offline because extra time is needed to place the mobile meters however the online bliff is more economically favourable as no pre installed meters are required different parameter settings should be used on different bursts to save costs and achieve higher localisation accuracy large bursts can be located more easily as the localisation accuracy of bursts with γ 10 is very high as shown in fig 4c based on the two case studies a large burst can be deemed as one which causes a pressure drop of more than 3 m at any pressure meter or with an outflow of over 100l s due to the economic and social consequences of large bursts the efficiency of the localisation is more important if the offline bliff is applied a shorter t d such as 15 or 30 min can be chosen to achieve an almost real time localisation of large bursts for the online bliff in addition to using shorter t d employing a smaller number of mobile meters is also critical as it saves time for the manual placement of the meters this is unlikely to undermine the accuracy of the localisation of large bursts as satisfactory results are obtained even with only one meter in case 1 as shown in fig 4e besides the training process can be faster by using small n t r and training epochs in comparison the localisation of smaller bursts is harder and needs greater efforts and careful design small bursts have limited disturbance on the wdn hydraulic state and can be easily masked by normally random demand fluctuations reducing the parameter uncertainties by good maintenance of the network and model calibration could be the key to improve the accuracy of locating small bursts besides setting more meters and choosing larger t d also help in improving the accuracy in addition to small bursts bursts which happen at branched pipes at the end of a network could also have lower localisation accuracy because they are prone to be confused with adjacent bursts in practice if the predictions include the branched end pipes the nearby pipes should also be checked 5 conclusions a novel deep learning framework called bliff is proposed in this study for accurate localisation of pipe bursts within a potential burst district based on additional real time pressure monitoring at limited places for a short period in the framework fl densenet a modified version of the popular deep learning algorithm densenet is employed to effectively extract the features in pressure signals in wdns procedures are also incorporated in bliff for optimising the locations for the additional monitoring bliff is tested on two case studies and the key findings are summarised below 1 accurate predictions can be made based on pressure signals using the newly developed deep learning algorithm fl densenet the pressure meters are cheaper than flow meters and easier to install indicating the practicality of bliff for real life applications 2 bliff is trained using the data generated from hydraulic models but is found to be robust to high model uncertainties 3 the one at a time sensitivity analysis shows that the prediction accuracy is high under a wide range of parameter settings of bliff highlighting its robustness for effective burst localisation although a few key uncertainty sources in modelling have been considered further study is recommended to examine the effects of other uncertainty sources such as inaccurate pump curves unknown valve states and pipe and node elevations the wagner s formulas and orifice outflow equation are used in this

18476,pipe bursts in water distribution networks lead to considerable water loss and pose risks of bacteria and pollutant contamination pipe burst localisation methods help water service providers repair the burst pipes and restore water supply timely and efficiently although methods have been reported on burst detection and localisation there is a lack of studies on accurate localisation of a burst within a potential district by accessible meters to address this a novel burst location identification framework by fully linear densenet bliff is proposed in this framework additional pressure meters are placed at limited optimised places for a short period minutes to hours to monitor system behaviour after the burst the fully linear densenet fl densenet newly developed in this study modifies the state of the art deep learning algorithm to effectively extract features in the limited pressure signals for accurate burst localisation bliff was tested on a benchmark network with different parameter settings which showed that accurate burst localisation results can be achieved even with high model uncertainties the framework was also applied to a real life network in which 57 of the total 58 synthetic bursts in the potential burst district were correctly located when the top five most possible pipes are considered and among them 37 were successfully located when considering only the top one only one failed because of the very small pipe diameter and remote location comparisons with densenet and the traditional fully linear neural network demonstrate that the framework can effectively narrow the potential burst district to one or several pipes with good robustness and applicability codes are available at https github com wizard1203 waternn graphical

berardi et al 2008 as such it is critical that the location of a pipe burst can be determined effectively for efficient restoration of water supply with the development of supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems real time monitoring of pressure and or flow data are being widely used for the detection and localisation of pipe bursts in wdns the deviation of real time data from the normal range of system behaviour is a key principle adopted in literature for burst detection localisation to establish the normal performance expected from a wdn models have been developed based on data driven techniques such as machine learning models mounce et al 2002 2010a romano et al 2014 and clustering analysis wu et al 2016 the deviation can also be analysed using hydraulic models bicik et al 2010 meseguer et al 2014 wu et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 the data driven techniques were found to be effective in burst detection but incompetent in burst localisation wu and liu 2017 the model based approaches rely heavily on the accuracy of the hydraulic model hutton et al 2014 and do not perform as well in larger wdns as in small ones other burst localisation methods using pressure flow measurements have also been proposed based on spatial analysis of the change in pressure flow data across a wdn for example mounce et al 2003 used a triangle based cubic interpolation to create a pressure drop surface during a burst to estimate its location in farley et al 2013 the location of a burst within a district metering area dma was inferred by the sensitivities of different pressure flow measurements with respect to a burst outflow romano et al 2013 employed multivariate gaussian mixtures based graphical model and geostatistical techniques to exploit data from a larger number of pressure meters to determine the potential positions of a burst within a dma nevertheless due to the insensitivity of pressures to bursts bakker et al 2014 and as normally random demand fluctuations could mask the hydraulic variations caused by bursts these methods can only narrow down the potential locations of a burst to a rough district as large as hundreds of meters including at least several tens of pipes which is insufficient for timely repair of pipe burst and service restoration for more accurate localisation of pipe bursts new targeted monitoring is usually required to collect detailed information e g acoustic or transient signals of system behaviour at the potential locations to detect the abnormality acoustic equipment such as listening sticks and noise correlators are widely used for manual inspection despite the effectiveness and easy implementation they are very labour intensive by temporarily placing accelerometer sensors and analysing the acoustic signals the method proposed by kang et al 2018 can detect the location of a burst leakage automatically however its reliability is sensitive to the characteristics of the leak conditions e g water pressure leak flow rate and the detection range is limited by the clarity and correlation of acoustic signals transient based methods colombo et al 2009 locate bursts by analysing transient wave features such as propagation reflection and damping however the background noise or other activities in a system may shadow the burst induced transient signals especially if the number of pipes to be analysed increases wu and liu 2017 moreover some methods in this category need computationally demanding mathematical simulations and the high frequency sensors employed are costly as such the current acoustic or transient based methods are not suitable for accurate burst locating from a reasonably large area e g a dma or tens of pipes to a single pipe pressure meters can be a good alternative as they are easy to install e g at any hydrant or other tapping points and are less costly than flow meters a possible solution to overcome the insensitivity of pressures is to mutually complement key features in pressures at different moments and fuse and identify the features in a continuous period of measurements by pattern recognition algorithms although machine learning algorithms such as traditional artificial neural networks anns clustering and support vector machines have been used to detect and or locate bursts mounce et al 2002 2010a romano et al 2014 wu et al 2016 they need to hand design suitable feature extractors and are difficult to learn complex features in recent years as a newly developed subfield of anns deep learning technology lecun et al 2015 has become a powerful tool for feature identification and pattern recognition comparing with the traditional machine learning algorithms very complex functions can be learned from raw data with the key features automatically extracted convolutional neural networks cnns are the most widely used deep learning methods more recently researchers found that cnns can be deeper thus more accurate and efficient to train if they have shorter connections between former layers and latter layers srivastava et al 2015 based on this huang et al 2017 proposed a novel densely connected convolutional network densenet architecture which improves the flow of information and gradients among layers intensifies the propagation of features and encourages feature reuse thus densenet provides better parameter efficiency and is easier to be trained with better accuracy cnns including densenet which employ convolutional layers to detect local conjunctions of features from the previous layers and pooling layers to merge semantically similar features lecun et al 2015 show higher accuracy in identifying objects with abundant local features e g language images or videos than global features however the global features of a wdn pressure signal such as its amplitude and time variation could be more important and the convolution and pooling procedures may disorganise the global features in this study we proposed a new fully linear densenet fl densenet by replacing the convolutional layers in densenet with linear connections benefiting from the dense connectivity pattern fl densenet enables the key features in pressure signals to be automatically extracted and more efficiently learned this study aims to propose a novel burst location identification framework by fl densenet bliff it can effectively identify the accurate location a single or a few pipes of a burst from a larger potential district e g a dma bliff uses the hydraulic model of a wdn to simulate bursts to train fl densenet the newly collected pressure data at the optimised meter locations are fed to the trained fl densenet for prediction of burst location the framework is applied on two case studies and its robustness against the accuracy of system hydraulic model is examined 2 methodology built on the hydraulic model of a wdn fl densenet extracts features in pressure patterns when a burst occurs at each pipe this is based on the fact that 1 for any burst the responses in pressure drop caused by a burst outflow vary at different nodes across a wdn and 2 for any node the pressure variations when the burst occur at different pipes also vary by matching the learnt features with new monitoring data the likelihood of burst occurring at every pipe can be predicted the structure of the proposed bliff is introduced in section 2 1 with a few key steps described in sections 2 2 to 2 5 2 1 burst location identification framework by fl densenet fig 1 shows the flow chart for the proposed bliff as highlighted in the top box in dashed lines a key assumption is that a burst has already been detected and the potential district of the burst a dma or tens to hundreds of potential pipes is given bliff consists of eight steps the first four of which can be done either offline or simultaneously with the latter four after a burst is detected the first step of bliff is to choose the optimal locations for the added pressure meters in the potential burst district so that effective and efficient collection of burst information can be made using the least number of meters the meters should be sensitive to flow changes occurring in the potential burst district the optimisation and sampling design are described in detail in section 2 3 the hydraulic model of a wdn built on epanet3 rossman 2010 yan et al 2019 which allows for pressure driven analysis pda is employed to simulate pipe bursts further details are provided in section 2 4 the simulation results are processed and fed to train fl densenet described in section 2 2 the data preprocessing as described in section 2 5 can improve the learning performance by amplifying key features and improving comparability in pressure measurements after a pipe burst is detected pressure meters are placed at the optimised nodes to collect dynamic pressure changes within a prescribed duration in minutes to hours further described in section 2 4 3 the collected monitoring data are preprocessed according to the procedure described in section 2 5 and then fed to the trained fl densenet model for prediction 2 2 fully linear densenet fl densenet differs from the original densenet by replacing convolutional layers with linear connections and omitting the pooling layers similar to other anns fl densenet is based on a collection of connected processors i e artificial neurons which form an input layer a number of hidden layers i e a series of dense blocks and transition layers to transfer analyse and weight the input information and an output layer an illustrative flowchart is shown in fig 2 and the detailed description is provided as follows where l 0 l 1 l i 1 is a concatenation of the previous layers 0 1 i 1 c i is a composite function which includes three consecutive operations batch normalisation bn ioffe and szegedy 2015 rectified linear unit relu schmidhuber 2015 and a linear connection 1 input layer it receives input information e g preprocessed pressure measurements in the form of matrices or vectors 2 dense block it contains a number of layers which are connected by a dense connectivity pattern namely there are direct connections from any layer to all subsequent layers huang et al 2017 and a layer l i can receive the outputs of all preceding layers at its input 1 l i c i l 0 l 1 l i 1 3 transition layer it is also a combination of bn relu and linear connection and is used to link the blocks to fuse different characters 4 prediction a softmax classifier is attached at the end of the last dense block to give the prediction results in this study a probability value of burst occurring is generated for every pipe in the potential burst district 2 3 optimisation of pressure meter locations in a wdn the sensitivity of nodal pressures to the changing of nodal outflows can be indicated by a jacobian matrix which contains the gradient information of nodal pressure with respect to nodal outflow as presented in eq 2 2 q h h q where q h is the jacobian matrix of which the elements represent the sensitivities of nodal heads with respect to nodal outflows h is the vector of nodal heads q is the vector of nodal outflows an explicit method proposed by liu et al 2017 is employed in our study to solve q h three parameters are proposed to measure the effectiveness of meters which are coverage limit c l coverage number c n and coverage rate c r for node i and pressure meter at node j if 3 q h i j c l then node i is considered to be covered by meter at node j as such c l determines the minimum sensitivity that the meters should meet if node i is covered by more than c n meters node i is considered to be sufficiently covered the higher the value of c n the richer the information can be used to train fl densenet c r is the ratio of sufficiently covered nodes with respect to all nodes in the potential burst district for example if c l c n and c r are set as 0 02 2 and 85 respectively then there should be at least 85 of nodes are covered q h i j 0 02 by no less than two meters the optimal pressure meter locations are those which can satisfy the threshold limits defined by c l c n and c r with the least number of meters the optimisation model can be expressed as below 4 min s 1 n p s subject to 5 1 n p i 1 n p χ j ε s χ q h i j c l c n c r where n p is the number of nodes in the potential burst district set s contains the selected meter locations element j in s denotes that a meter is placed at node j s denotes the cardinality of the set s χ r 0 1 is defined as χ a 1 if a 0 and 0 otherwise the optimisation problem is solved by the genetic algorithm ga holland 1992 ga is a metaheuristic algorithm which is widely used to solve optimisation problems in urban water management meng et al 2016 fu et al 2013 inspired by natural selection ga creates a set of solutions in the feasible region as individuals which evolve into better individuals in the next generation by means of bio inspired operators such as crossover mutation and selection this process is repeated until satisfactory results are obtained the ga toolbox in matlab is used in our study 2 4 training data generation epanet3 is employed to build the hydraulic model of a wdn and perform extended period simulations in this study as it enables pda which can produce a more realistic representation of the pressure deficient situations under pipe bursts yan et al 2019 a nodal outflow is dependent on its nodal pressure in a pda model which is calculated according to the wagner s formulas wagner et al 1988 6 q i 0 h i h i m i n q i r e q h i h i m i n h i r e q h i m i n 1 η h i m i n h i h i r e q q i r e q h i h i r e q where q i and q i r e q is the available outflow and required demand at node i respectively h i is the pressure at node i η is the head exponent generally η 1 5 2 h i m i n and h i r e q is the minimum pressure and required pressure respectively the values of η h i m i n and h i r e q are set as 2 0m and 30m in this study he et al 2016 the flow rate of a burst on a pipe is assumed to follow the orifice outflow formula in eq 7 7 q b u r s t c d a o r i 2 g h o r i where q b u r s t is the burst flow c d is the outflow coefficient c d 0 5 0 7 depending on the reynolds number and the shape of the orifice lambert 2001 and is set to be 0 6 in this study a o r i is area of the orifice and h o r i is the pressure it is assumed that a o r i γ a i j where a i j is the cross sectional area of corresponding pipe i j γ is an intensity coefficient which is determined by the intensity of a burst therefore we can simulate different scales of burst flow on a pipe by assigning different values of γ for example for a pipe with a diameter of 200 mm and a pressure of 30m γ 10 corresponds to a burst flow of 45 7l s and γ 30 corresponds to 137 1l s different values of γ are used and examined in this work the embedded leakage simulation model in epanet3 which is based on eq 8 is used to calculate the orifice outflow equation and simulate burst flows 8 q i j l e a k a i j h i j b l i j where q i j l e a k h i j and l i j are the leakage flow pressure and length of pipe i j respectively a i j and b are parameters to be determined if a i j and b are defined according to eq 9 9 a i j c d γ a i j 2 g l i j b 0 5 then the right side of eq 8 will be the same as that of the orifice outflow formula in eq 7 therefore using the parameters defined in eq 9 we can employ epanet3 to simulate burst orifice outflow on pipe i j and γ is the only parameter to be determined as pda is employed in this study the burst flow rate is dynamic with the change of water pressure on a pipe 2 4 1 uncertainties of model parameters there are no perfect accurate hydraulic models of any wdns due to the various sources of uncertainty hutton et al 2014 savic et al 2009 for example there are inherent random patterns in the behaviour of water usage and the scale characteristics of a pipe burst moreover some parameters e g pipe roughness coefficients cannot be precisely measured to make realistic assumptions for bliff and test its robustness against the accuracy of the hydraulic model the following parameters are simulated in a stochastic manner pipe roughness coefficients and nodal demands white gaussian noises n 0 σ 2 are added to the existing roughness coefficients and diurnal nodal demand curves with the standard deviation values for the two parameters being σ c and σ q respectively smaller standard deviation should be assigned if a hydraulic model is well calibrated otherwise a larger value should be used intensity coefficient γ pipe burst flow rate can vary in a wide range in real life and it is hard if possible to know the exact outflow rate of a burst even after its detection the burst flow is assumed to be affected by the diameter and the intensity coefficient γ of a burst pipe in this work γ is simulated as a random number which follows the uniform distribution u γ m i n γ m a x 2 4 2 simulation of pipe burst the procedures for the simulation of a burst are summarised in six steps described below 1 set pipe i j as the pipe where a burst occurs 2 for each pipe draw a noise value from n 0 σ c 2 and add it to the original roughness coefficient 3 for each node draw noise values from n 0 σ q 2 and add them to elements of the nodal demand curve respectively 4 randomly select intensity coefficient γ from u γ m i n γ m a x and calculate the parameter a i j and assign leakage parameters a i j and b to pipe i j 5 employ epanet3 to run the hydraulic simulation with the assigned parameter values 6 record pressure values at selected monitoring nodes 2 4 3 generation of training data besides σ c σ q and γ m i n γ m a x mentioned in section 2 4 1 values of the following parameters also need to be defined for the generation of the training data set number of samples per pipe n t r to support feature identification of a pipe burst against various sources of uncertainties the simulation of pipe burst on any single pipe is performed for n t r times with stochastic parameter settings as such the total number of samples in the training data set is n t r m p if there are m p pipes in the potential burst district duration of data collection t d after a burst occurs pressure needs to be monitored at the optimised locations described in section 2 3 for a prescribed duration t d as nodal pressures are likely to show distinctive features at different times of a day driven by water usage behaviours the time parameters of the training data should correspond to those of actual bursts for effective machine learning for example assuming that a burst occurs at 2pm and field pressure data is measured from 3pm for 24 h t d 24 h with a 15 min interval when generating training data the burst should also starts at 2pm and the report start time time step and duration corresponding to the time parameters in epanet3 should be 3pm 15 min and 24 h respectively a longer t d is likely to yield a higher prediction accuracy as more data are captured however it also means longer waiting time for the burst localisation before a burst can be repaired thus a trade off needs to be made different values of t d are tested in this work number of pressure meters n m pressures are monitored at the n m selected nodes both for the generation of training data and for the field monitoring the number and location of meters are decided by the values of c l c n and c r as described in section 2 3 the accuracy of model prediction is likely to be higher with a larger n m but this increases the expenditures on the sampling equipment although a specific value of n m needs to be determined for the generation of a training data set similar to n t r and t d different values are tested for comprehensive analysis and discussion the four steps summarised below are used in our study to generate training data 1 choose parameter values for σ c σ q γ m i n γ m a x n t r t d and n m 2 set pipe i j as the pipe where a burst occurs simulate the burst and record pressure values at monitoring nodes 3 repeat step 2 for n t r times each of which uses newly randomly generated noise values and intensity coefficient n t r burst records are generated for pipe i j 4 for all the m p pipes in the potential burst district repeat steps 2 3 and n t r m p burst records are generated as the training data 2 5 data preprocessing the pressure data at a node meter m can be expressed as 10 h m h m 1 h m 2 h m n where h m denotes the monitored pressures at node m with fixed time intervals the length of h m is decided by the data collection duration t d and interval for example if t d 24 h with a time interval of 15 min then the length of h m is 96 n 96 the pressure measurements at all available meters can be expressed as a matrix as shown below 11 h h 1 h 2 h m h 11 h m 1 h 1 n h m n 2 5 1 nonlinear mapping the nonlinear mapping procedure is applied to facilitate feature extraction as it can amplify the time variation features of an original data set and increase the dimension of the original feature space for each h m defines 12 s m d i a g h m h m where the operator d i a g converts the vector to a diagonal matrix of which the diagonal is the original vector and other elements are 0 for all the measurements s s 1 s 2 s m 2 5 2 data normalisation as pressures of different meters may have diverse ranges affected by the location and elevation of the meters we need to normalise the values to make the pressures at different meters more comparable besides normalisation can help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fl densenet al shalabi and shaaban 2006 the z score normalisation is employed to normalise the data taken h m as an example 13 h m h m μ m σ m where h m is the normalised vector μ m and σ m are the mean and standard deviation of all the measurements collected at node m both h and s are normalised and fed to fl densenet 3 case studies and results two cases a benchmark network and a real life wdn are studied to demonstrate the reliability and applicability of bliff the following default settings are used σ c 10 σ q 10 γ m i n γ m a x 10 30 n t r 1800 t d 24 h n m 4 the default sampling interval is 15 min the neural network structure and hyper parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins used in the case studies are summarised in table 1 for example the hidden layers of the fl densenet used in case 1 consist of four dense blocks which contain 8 16 16 and 12 dense layers respectively the learning rate we used for this network is 0 6 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fl densenet four different kinds of anns are used for case 2 which are fl densenet fl densenet with the activation function relu replaced by sigmoid function schmidhuber 2015 densenet and the traditional fully linear neural network flnn as the flnn does not contain dense blocks its hidden layers are constituted by three fully connected layers the hyper parameters of the anns are the optimal parameters identified from a series of trials to test the performance for each pipe in the potential burst district we simulate burst on it for n t e times and generate n t e m p burst data as the test samples with the parameters be the same as the training data n t e is set to 200 after being trained bliff predicts the location of the burst in the test samples the prediction accuracy of a test sample i can be assessed by p r e 1 i and p r e 5 i bliff will evaluate a burst happening probability for each pipe if the pipe with the highest probability is the true burst pipe p r e 1 i 1 otherwise p r e 1 i 0 if the top five pipes include the true burst pipe p r e 5 i 1 otherwise p r e 5 i 0 in which case the prediction is considered as failed the overall performance of bliff can be assessed by eqs 14 and 15 14 a c c 1 1 n t e m p i 1 n t e m p p r e 1 i 15 a c c 5 1 n t e m p i 1 n t e m p p r e 5 i where a c c 1 and a c c 5 are the overall prediction accuracy of all test samples corresponding to p r e 1 i and p r e 5 i 3 1 case 1 the anytown walski et al 1987 network which is a highly looped small sized wdn fig 3 is employed to illustrate the application of bliff and its performance under different settings the network consists of 16 nodes 34 pipes 2 tanks and 1 reservoir the diameters of pipes range from 200 mm to 400 mm and the base demands of nodes range from 12 5 l s to 63 8l s different diurnal demand patterns are allocated to different nodes the potential burst district is assumed to be the whole network that is every pipe in the network is a potential location of the burst the least required number of pressure meters varies when different threshold values are assigned for c l c n and c r for example if c l c n and c r were set as 0 01 1 and 0 85 respectively one meter is sufficient if it is placed at node 9 if c l c n and c r are set as 0 02 2 and 0 85 respectively at least four meters need to be placed and the optimal locations are found to be nodes 3 12 15 and 17 the optimal locations corresponding to different n m are presented in table 2 and marked in fig 3 to provide insights on the practical application of bliff its performance under different network physical or hydraulic conditions are analysed by using one at a time sensitivity analysis in the analysis one parameter setting is changed to a different value at a time while other parameters remain at default settings as n t e 200 a total of 200 34 test samples are generated with each parameter setting as the uncertainties in pipe roughness coefficients and nodal demands highly affect model accuracy in a joint manner the performance of bliff under different combinations of σ c and σ q are analysed for a comprehensive representation of different levels of hydraulic model accuracy the results are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a and b the performance of bliff improves if the uncertainties in pipe roughness and nodal demands decrease i e a c c 1 in fig 4a and a c c 5 in fig 4b increases with lower values of σ c and σ q if σ c 5 and σ q 5 a c c 1 and a c c 5 are 99 and 100 respectively i e the top left corner of fig 4a and b if σ c and σ q increases to 20 and 25 respectively the accuracy reduces with a c c 1 81 and a c c 5 98 i e the bottom right corner of fig 4a and b nevertheless satisfactory prediction results are still obtained which indicates the high robustness of bliff against the accuracy of the hydraulic models results under different burst flow rates are presented in fig 4c it can be seen that the accuracy increases with the growth in γ m i n γ m a x which corresponds to larger burst flows if γ m i n γ m a x 1 5 corresponding to a 4 6 22 9l s burst flow for a 200 mm pipe with 30 m pressure a c c 1 is 35 and a c c 5 is 70 however a c c 1 and a c c 5 become higher than 80 and 95 if γ m i n γ m a x increases to 5 10 corresponding to a 22 9 45 7l s burst flow for a 200 mm pipe with 30 m pressure this is expected as the disturbance in pressure is more distinct with a higher burst flow which facilitates pattern recognition and burst localisation bliff can complement the features of pressures at different moments to achieve higher accuracy therefore longer t d will increase the prediction accuracy because pressures at more moments are collected however shorter t d allows faster field data collection hence the burst can be more rapidly located the relationship between t d and prediction accuracy are shown in fig 4d when t d 0 25 h i e 15 min which equals to the sampling interval so only 2 pressure measurements are collected per meter the a c c 1 and a c c 5 are 70 and 98 respectively when t d increases to more than 10 h a c c 1 reaches 96 and higher the accuracy rates are higher than 80 if t d is 1 h which is satisfactory and fits with regulations in the water industry such as the 3 h limit of response time in the uk diao et al 2016 meters should be placed at nodes where a burst can have sufficient influence on the pressures in our study c l c n and c r are used to define the minimum sensitivity requirement that the chosen meters should meet larger c l c n and c r results in more meters which will increase the performance of bliff but also will lead to more costs as shown in fig 4e when there is only one meter in the network a c c 1 and a c c 5 are 62 and 96 respectively if four meters are installed the a c c 1 and a c c 5 increased to 97 and 99 respectively a c c 5 is very high even with only one meter which indicates that it is also feasible to use fewer meters but employs more manpower to locate burst e g with listening sticks within the five identified pipes in generating the training data the simulated start time of the bursts should ideally be the same as the actual situation however as fl densenet could be trained in advance and in some cases we cannot clearly confirm when the burst started the start time of burst simulation t s may lag behind the real burst time t b to test its effect on the performance of bliff the burst time of training data t s is set to 24 00 and the real burst time t b of the test samples is set to 12 00 to 24 00 results are presented in fig 4f it can be seen that the accuracy decreased with larger lag times the main reason could be that the continuous burst outflow causes the water level of the tanks to drop hence the overall pressure distribution during simulation is inconsistent with the actual situation however even with a lag of 2 h the accuracy of bliff is still higher than 80 it is expected that the learning is more effective with larger n t r and training epoch training epoch indicates the number of times that fl densenet repeatedly learns the same training data set the default training epoch used in our study is 120 the effects of n t r and training epoch are presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a a c c 1 and a c c 5 are 85 and 99 respectively if n t r is 100 and increase with larger n t r however the increase rate becomes very small if n t r is over 1000 fig 5b shows that bliff can achieve good results acc1 90 after 25 training epochs with minor improvement acc1 97 if over 85 training epochs is used in this case with n t r 1800 processing each epoch takes about 3 5 min on an i7 4700mq cpu gtx850m gpu computer 3 2 case 2 a real network though the burst data are synthetic is used to test the reliability of bliff under realistic settings the network layout presented in fig 6 lies in eastern china jiangsu province it consists of 567 pipes total length is147km 480 junctions and 4 reservoirs and supplies 57 000 tons of water per day a burst is assumed to happen at the lower left district of the network this potential burst district contains 58 pipes with different diameters ranging from 100 mm to 400 mm c l c n and c r are set as 0 03 2 and 0 9 respectively and four optimal pressure meters are required their locations are optimised according to section 2 3 the training data and test samples are generated using the default parameter settings described at the beginning of section 3 as the potential burst district is connected with and affected by the rest of the wdn the uncertainties in the roughness coefficient and nodal demand are also simulated for pipes nodes outside the potential burst district to compare the performance of fl densenet with other anns four different anns as shown in table 1 are trained by the same training data and are evaluated with the same test samples table 3 reports the results on a c c 1 and a c c 5 of the four anns changing the activation function of fl densenet from relu to sigmoid has minimal effect on the results nevertheless using sigmoid is less computationally efficient than relu because frequent exponential operations in sigmoid which are computationally demanding need to be performed for densenet a c c 1 31 and a c c 5 67 these accuracies are about half of those of fl densenet the results demonstrate the validity of replacing the convolutional layers in densenet with linear connections which can avoid the global features in pressure signals being disorganised besides using linear connections requires less computational time than convolutional layers although the accuracy of flnn in this case seems acceptable in trial simulations it is found that the performance of flnn is very sensitive to the settings of the hyper parameters such as the learning rate and the number of hidden layers it only provides satisfactory results in a quite limited range of hyper parameters this implies that the algorithm is less robust and thus limited in practical application to further explore the performance of bliff on different pipes we create a new set of test samples with n t e 1 i e each pipe in the potential burst district is assumed as burst pipe for once respectively i e a total of 58 burst events are generated the prediction results are shown in fig 7 a 37 pipes i e 64 of the 58 pipes presented in green in fig 7a are accurately targeted with p r e 1 1 20 pipes 35 presented in yellow in fig 7a are included in the top five likely locations i e p r e 1 0 p r e 5 1 only one pipe fails to be correctly located i e p r e 1 0 p r e 5 0 as highlighted in red in fig 7a fig 7b to d show three examples of bursts in the three categories mentioned above the likelihood of burst happening is shown by the line colour and the true location of the burst is marked with a star as shown in fig 7a pipes with larger diameters i e thicker lines or closer to the monitoring meters are accurately predicted in general the two large pipes in the top left corner of the district have large diameters but are not as well predicted this may be because the pipes are linked to each other with very few branches hence they may yield similar patterns of pressure change when a burst occurs fig 7b gives an example of a correctly located burst of which the pipe with the highest predicted probability is the burst pipe fig 7c shows another example of pipe burst that falls in the second category i e p r e 1 0 p r e 5 1 this suggests that the feature of bursts at small pipes may be harder to distinguish from similar nearby pipes fig 7d shows an example of failed prediction a few pipes near the true burst location are predicted with high probabilities of burst this indicates that the pressure responses at the monitoring nodes are similar when the burst occurs at branched pipes or nearby pipes nevertheless bliff provides a good direction though not the accurate location in this case there could be more than one burst concurrently happening in real life to test the performance of bliff with multiple bursts two bursts are simultaneously simulated in the potential burst district with default parameters and at two randomly selected locations 11600 equals to n t e m p simulations are conducted as test samples it should be noted that fl densenet in this test is trained by data with only one burst and default parameters rather than two for each test sample if at least one of the bursts is correctly located the sample is deemed as successfully predicted an overall result of all the test samples is a c c 1 29 and a c c 5 77 it can be seen that the accuracy of burst localisation decreases when more than one burst occurs this is expected as wdns are nonlinear systems thus the impact of two bursts is not the addition of two single bursts hence the accuracy is low with the model trained using only single bursts three representative cases are illustrated in fig 8 if the bursts happen at pipes with large diameters and are far from each other so there are less mutual hydraulic effects both of them can be targeted by bliff in the example shown in fig 8a one burst is successfully located at the pipe with the highest probability and another included in the top five likely pipes fig 8b shows an example that a large burst and a small burst happen simultaneously in this case the hydraulic response of the smaller burst is masked by the larger one hence bliff failed to target it on the other hand the localisation accuracy of the larger burst is affected due to the disturbance of the smaller one however the larger burst pipe is still correctly identified within the top five predictions in the example shown in fig 8c bliff incorrectly locate the burst to the middle district of the two burst pipes this is because similar patterns are produced when a burst occurs in the middle of two bursts however bliff still identifies the correct area of bursts 4 discussions although previous studies suggest that pressure values are less sensitive to a burst or leak event bakker et al 2014 mounce et al 2010b the proposed bliff which is built on the latest deep learning technology can identify features in a continuous period of pressure measurements to accurately locate a burst to one or several pipes based on the two case studies comprehensive discussions about bliff are presented as follows a wdn model needs appropriate parameters such as pipe roughness coefficients and nodal demands to represent the real network accurately the uncertainty in the parameter values are especially high in less calibrated models and poorly maintained networks which undermines the performance of bliff however even assuming considerably large uncertainties in case 1 bliff can still provide satisfactory results this may be attributed to the following reasons firstly for a network in poor conditions with an uncalibrated model larger σ c and σ q are chosen to generate the training set hence it enables fl densenet to learn in a wider feature space and cover the features of the network despite the large uncertainty secondly as the pressure data are collected for a continuous period of time rather than a single moment features at different moments can complement each other which provides more thorough information and the effect of uncertainties can be reduced in practical application bliff can be set up as either offline or online in the offline bliff fl densenet is trained in advance moreover pressure meters can be installed in the optimal locations for a given district even without any bursts i e the first four steps in fig 1 are done offline if a burst occurs in this area the pressure records can be extracted and fed to the trained fl densenet in this case the efficiency of burst localisation solely depends on the duration of data collection process t d as discussed in fig 4d even if t d is within 1 h good prediction results can be yielded hence the offline bliff can achieve near real time burst localisation the offline bliff is more suitable for small networks or those with dma configurations as the potential burst district can be easily targeted e g within a dma as the burst time in training data should aim to be the same as actual bursts a series of fl densenets need to be trained with different burst time in the offline bliff as shown in fig 4f the accuracy is still high if there is a 1 h lag in the actual and assumed burst time hence 24 fl densenets i e burst occurring at 00 00 01 00 and 23 00 respectively should be sufficient for a given wdn the online bliff is more suitable for large wdns without dmas or where sufficient pressure meters cannot be installed in these cases mobile meters can be employed when a burst is detected concurrently training of fl densenet is performed on the provided potential burst district longer time is required for burst localisation in the online bliff than the offline because extra time is needed to place the mobile meters however the online bliff is more economically favourable as no pre installed meters are required different parameter settings should be used on different bursts to save costs and achieve higher localisation accuracy large bursts can be located more easily as the localisation accuracy of bursts with γ 10 is very high as shown in fig 4c based on the two case studies a large burst can be deemed as one which causes a pressure drop of more than 3 m at any pressure meter or with an outflow of over 100l s due to the economic and social consequences of large bursts the efficiency of the localisation is more important if the offline bliff is applied a shorter t d such as 15 or 30 min can be chosen to achieve an almost real time localisation of large bursts for the online bliff in addition to using shorter t d employing a smaller number of mobile meters is also critical as it saves time for the manual placement of the meters this is unlikely to undermine the accuracy of the localisation of large bursts as satisfactory results are obtained even with only one meter in case 1 as shown in fig 4e besides the training process can be faster by using small n t r and training epochs in comparison the localisation of smaller bursts is harder and needs greater efforts and careful design small bursts have limited disturbance on the wdn hydraulic state and can be easily masked by normally random demand fluctuations reducing the parameter uncertainties by good maintenance of the network and model calibration could be the key to improve the accuracy of locating small bursts besides setting more meters and choosing larger t d also help in improving the accuracy in addition to small bursts bursts which happen at branched pipes at the end of a network could also have lower localisation accuracy because they are prone to be confused with adjacent bursts in practice if the predictions include the branched end pipes the nearby pipes should also be checked 5 conclusions a novel deep learning framework called bliff is proposed in this study for accurate localisation of pipe bursts within a potential burst district based on additional real time pressure monitoring at limited places for a short period in the framework fl densenet a modified version of the popular deep learning algorithm densenet is employed to effectively extract the features in pressure signals in wdns procedures are also incorporated in bliff for optimising the locations for the additional monitoring bliff is tested on two case studies and the key findings are summarised below 1 accurate predictions can be made based on pressure signals using the newly developed deep learning algorithm fl densenet the pressure meters are cheaper than flow meters and easier to install indicating the practicality of bliff for real life applications 2 bliff is trained using the data generated from hydraulic models but is found to be robust to high model uncertainties 3 the one at a time sensitivity analysis shows that the prediction accuracy is high under a wide range of parameter settings of bliff highlighting its robustness for effective burst localisation although a few key uncertainty sources in modelling have been considered further study is recommended to examine the effects of other uncertainty sources such as inaccurate pump curves unknown valve states and pipe and node elevations the wagner s formulas and orifice outflow equation are used in this study to simulate a burst with pda however other burst simulation methods can be investigated for improving the performance of bliff declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

previously werner et al 2011 and are summarized in table 1 plasmid sizes ranged from 50 kb to 200 kb and were characterized by different genetic content including toxin antitoxin systems and replicon

faecium strains were cultured on media with and without antibiotics added to confirm maintenance of plasmids throughout the experiment as retention of plasmids through the experiment was necessary to

was about a log greater under low nutrient compared to augmented conditions the significant difference in decay between e0292 and the parent strain under natural nutrient conditions does suggest that the nutrients are a biologically relevant factor in survival 3 4 reduction associated with plasmid size the log10 reduction of the e faecium strains directly correlated with plasmid size in the natural nutrient treatment fig 3 a p 0 027 r 0 2436 but not in the augmented nutrient treatment fig 3b p 0 5963 r 0 1261 larger plasmids were associated with greater reduction in the natural nutrient treatment but not in the augmented nutrient treatment 4 discussion the fitness cost of plasmids in general smalla et al 2015 and antibiotic resistance plasmids in particular san millan et al 2015 schrag et al 1997 smith and bidochka 1998b has been the subject of study for decades the general conclusion drawn from such studies is that plasmids incur a fitness cost in the absence of selective pressure under laboratory conditions because growing emphasis is placed on the importance of environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance mclain et al 2016 we designed this study to assess the fitness cost of mobile plasmids carrying the vana operon for e faecium in a simulated aquatic environment we hypothesized that organic nutrient levels could influence the burden of plasmid maintenance a linkage that has not been well explored the most obvious mechanism for such an influence would be that increased nutrient levels offset the metabolic costs of plasmid dna and protein synthesis carroll and wong 2018 in this study effects of nutrients on survival were statistically significant only when analyzed based on a relationship to a continuous scale of plasmid size increasing plasmid size was associated with decreased survival under natural nutrient conditions but not when river water was augmented with nutrients augmented nutrient conditions designed to reflect organic carbon levels in a eutrophic surface water wanjugi et al 2016 were expected to enhance survival of all strains in this study given that nutrient availability is a key influence on bacterial survival in aquatic ecosystems anderson et al 2005 barcina et al 1997 craig et al 2004 this is particularly true of organic carbon for enterococcus spp zhang et al 2017 and other heterotrophic bacteria however added nutrients did not have a significant within strain effect on survival which may be explained by relatively low nutrient concentration amendments used in the treatments the lack of within strain effect could also be due low cellular metabolic activity a previous study wanjugi et al 2016 using the same river water and organic carbon sources glucose pyruvate and acetate as this study determined that nutrient concentrations at five times the augmented level used here enhanced survival of e coli compared to natural and 1x amended conditions those results suggest that using more concentrated nutrient treatments in future studies may reveal a relationship or help to disentangle the differences between strains and nutrient levels and could better assess the impacts of raw sewage containing vre released into aquatic ecosystems greater reduction of one plasmid bearing e faecium strain e0292 compared to the parent strain which lacked plasmids confirms previous findings of a fitness cost of plasmids in environments devoid of selective pressure ramadhan and hegedus 2005 san millan et al 2015 starikova et al 2013 vogwill and maclean 2015 zhang et al 2017 two of the transconjugant strains used in this study e0292 and h182 were previously studied to assess fitness cost in competitive mixed culture experiments under laboratory conditions starikova et al 2013 the largest plasmid had a detrimental effect e0292 relative fitness 0 73 and the smallest was beneficial h182 relative fitness 1 1 while the microcosms in this study confirm that reduced fitness is associated with the large plasmid there was no observed benefit to smaller plasmids in our experiments which included environmental stressors such as sunlight and ambient nutrient levels results from the previous study with the same transconjugants starikova et al 2013 support the hypothesis that large plasmids exert fitness costs to their hosts although the conditions in the competitive culture experiments contrasted sharply from those in this study which simulated a natural oligotrophic aquatic environment rather than nutrient rich culture media the largest vancomycin resistance plasmid significantly reduced survival in e faecium transconjugant e0292 compared to the vancomycin susceptible counterpart under natural nutrient conditions in this study log10 reduction of the other transconjugant vre strains was not significantly different than that of the parent strain suggesting that there may be a cut off or threshold size for larger plasmids to negatively impact survival under conditions used here while plasmid copy numbers were not assessed here their size and previously characterized replicon types indicate that they are large low copy number plasmids with less than 5 10 copies per cell san millan et al 2014 werner et al 2011 while the precise genes or gene cassettes responsible for decreased fitness have not been elucidated the difference between the large plasmid and the parent strain was only determined in the natural unaugmented nutrient conditions which suggests that the oligotrophic environment affects the relative success of bacteria bearing large plasmids and that eutrophic nutrient levels may reduce fitness cost the fact that smaller plasmids that confer clinically relevant vre characteristics did not exert a cost of fitness in the environmental conditions studies here is cautionary as it suggests that smaller plasmids may not hamper survival of these pathogens various genes within conjugative plasmids can mediate virulence and survival elwell and shipley 1980 groisman and ochman 1996 guilloteau et al 1996 ramirez et al 2014 trevors et al 1989 but known genes on the plasmids studied here were not associated with survival advantages or inhibition all three conjugative plasmids of the vre strains used in this study are classified as repinc18 repinc prum or both shintani et al 2015 werner et al 2011 e0292 and h74 contained a repinc18 plasmid which is associated with horizontal gene transfer and no known survival advantages palmer et al 2010 while h74 and h182 both contained the repinc prum type plasmid see table 1 toxin antitoxin systems of repinc prum plasmids have been shown to inhibit survival and also support plasmid maintenance in e coli grady and hayes 2003 but did not appear to affect survival in this study with e faecium when compared to parent strains lacking plasmids both transconjugants with the repinc prum plasmids h74 and h182 had lower decay rates compared to e0292 however this study was not desiged to determine whether the plasmid types contribute to or inhibit persistence of vre broadly or how variability in molecular structure of plasmids influenced survival the findings presented here are initial steps towards understanding how antibiotic resistance plasmids influence survival in aquatic environments and should lead to further experimental investigation and genetic analyses while some genetic aspects of the plasmids have been characterized sequencing of entire plasmids might further clarify the role of resistance determinants in the differential survival demonstrated in this study fitness costs shown in the strain carrying the largest plasmid e0292 could be associated with strong promoters regulating gene expression including any additional antibiotic resistance genes located on the plasmids expression of plasmid genes could also be impacted by nutrient levels or other environmental factors and could be explored by transcriptomic analysis focusing on and isolating the role of the plasmid outside of the chromosomal genetic background shared by each strain represents novel research that can inform future studies of fitness costs of antibiotic resistance 5 conclusions this study showed that the transconjugant e faecium strain carrying the largest plasmid decayed faster than its plasmid less parent strain in an aquatic environment with low available nutrients and in the absence of selective pressure strains with smaller plasmids persisted similarly to the parent strain clinical vre strains can enter the environment through sewage spills young et al 2016 and this study investigated the fate of these pathogens in environmental surface water showing that large plasmids inhibit survival but that increased levels of organic nutrients can alleviate the fitness costs vancomycin resistance plasmids that are maintained in the absence of selective pressure can exert fitness costs under natural nutrient conditions the size of vancomycin resistance plasmids was correlated with fitness costs under natural nutrient conditions characteristics of antibiotic resistance plasmids can influence the survival of bacterial pathogens released into aquatic ecosystems

and some bacteria lose plasmids when under stress in order to reduce metabolic expense smith and bidochka 1998a however fitness experiments in the laboratory have shown that the cost of plasmid associated resistance is host and plasmid dependent starikova et al 2013 in some cases plasmids can be maintained in the absence of selective pressure johnsen et al 2002 werner et al 2011 and in starvation states ramadhan and hegedus 2005 bacterial persistence and interactions in aquatic habitats are strongly driven by nutrient availability byappanahalli et al 2012 cloutier et al 2015 staley et al 2014 few studies have investigated the influence of nutrients on maintenance of antibiotic resistance plasmids outside of nutrient rich culture experiments the aquatic environment provides relatively oligotrophic conditions compared to culture media or intestinal environments pereira and berry 2017 and the role of nutrients in the survival of bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance plasmids need further study in oligotrophic settings in this study chromosomally identical strains of e faecium with vancomycin resistance plasmids of differing sizes and genetic makeup were compared in microcosms containing filtered river water maintained in an outdoor environment nutrient levels were natural or augmented with trace vitamins minerals and organic carbon sources glucose pyruvate and acetate investigating bacterial persistence associated with plasmids and environmental nutrient levels contributes to understanding antibiotic resistance and its potential to impact human health in a dynamic ecologically relevant context 2 methods 2 1 enterococcus faecium strains e faecium strains were obtained from dr guido werner robert koch institute wernigerode germany in a previous study clinically derived strains carrying plasmids with the vana gene were filter mated with the vancomycin sensitive american type culture collection atcc strain 64 3 werner et al 2011 each vre strain in table 1 represents a transconjugant of 64 3 recipient strain whose plasmids ranged from 50 to 200 kb previous testing showed stable maintenance of plasmids on media without antibiotics for approximately 100 generations werner et al 2011 additional testing confirmed that strains maintained plasmids and survived for up to two weeks in phosphate buffered water and filtered river water in microcosms maintained in the laboratory data not shown the four e faecium strains used here all had similar growth rates in brain heart infusion bhi broth 2 2 microcosm set up water was collected from the hillsborough river in tampa fl 28 069992 82 377558 on march 31 2017 in sterile 50 l carboys the hillsborough river is a typical tannic florida river originating in the green swamp and passing through natural and rural watersheds before it reaches the sampling site the water was filtered on that date using dialysis filters rexeed 25s asahi kasei to remove particles and microorganisms filtered water was tested for endogenous enterococci and vre on mei agar and mei agar amended with 32 μg ml 1 vancomycin to confirm absence of culturable enterococci prior to the start of the experiment epa 2006 four strains were inoculated in separate microcosms each microcosm contained 1 l filtered river water in a 2 l beaker the nutrient treatment included unamended control conditions and added nutrients see below five replicates were created for each strain representing both control and nutrient conditions microcosms were covered with plastic wrap to allow light penetration and prevent contamination a 1000 gallon capacity tank functioned as a water bath to modulate temperature fluctuations in the greenhouse at the usf botanical gardens the greenhouse is protected from rainfall and covered and fenced to prevent animal intrusion but is exposed to uv light and susceptible to environmental temperature changes microcosms were secured to shelves and partially submerged in the tank three days prior to inoculation in order to stabilize carbon sources vitamins and minerals were added as nutritional supplements in augmented nutrient conditions and compared to a control treatment with no nutrients added nutrient additions were as follows hydrated sodium salts of pyruvate 8 3 mg l c3h3nao3 acetate 6 2 mg l c2h3nao2 and glucose 18 mg l c6h12o6 for final concentrations of 75 μm 75 μm and 100 μm respectively 1 ml of pre mixed additives for trace vitamins and 1 ml of pre mixed minerals were added to each microcosm atcc manassas va wanjugi et al 2016 two hobo data loggers h08 004 02 onset computer corporation bourne ma were placed in identical beakers with the same source water inside the water bath where measurements for temperature humidity and light intensity were logged hourly over eight days light wavelength and intensity were recorded on each sampling date using a spectroradiometer model ilt950 international light technologies peabody ma at the time of collection confirming that natural uv light was reaching the microcosms though not as strong as direct sunlight inoculum preparation and inoculation overnight cultures of each e faecium strain were prepared in 10 ml bhi broth becton dickinson and company sparks md usa using isolated colonies obtained from frozen stock cultures of vre transconjugants e0292 h182 h74 and the parent strain vancomycin sensitive 64 3 cultures were incubated for 12 h at 37 c then transferred to a sterile 15 ml tube and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 3 min supernatant broth was removed and 6 ml of sterile phosphate buffered solution was added to each tube and vortexed to create stock inoculant for each strain of approximately 9 log10 cfu ml 1 based on mei agar quantification individual strains were added separately to each of five replicate beakers containing 1l each of river water such that each mesocosm contained only one e faecium strain one ml of the stock inoculant was added to make an initial concentration in the mesocosms of approximately 6 log10 cfu ml 1 equivalent to 8 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 2 3 sample collection and processing water samples were collected at the initial inoculation time day 0 and on day 2 day 4 and day 7 samples were collected from each microcosm n 40 in 10 ml volumes using sterile pipets after stirring to mix using the collection pipets samples were transported on ice to the laboratory in sterile 15 ml centrifuge tubes held on ice and processed within 6 h water samples were processed by membrane filtration for enterococci in duplicate on both mei and on mei 32 μg ml 1 vancomycin except for the non resistant strain 64 3 which was only processed on unamended mei epa 2006 dilutions were established to ensure a countable number of colonies 20 100 per plate estimates for dilution series were based on preliminary studies and earlier sampling results when processing samples at later time points vre strains were cultured on both mei and mei amended with vancomycin on day 0 and day 4 data from day 7 are shown in figs 1 and 2 but were excluded from analyses because some strains were reduced to undetectable concentrations by that date 1 cfu 100 ml 1 2 4 data analysis culturable enterococci concentrations were recorded as cfu 100ml 1 log10 reduction which represents the log decrease in cell concentration from day 0 to day x was calculated for each replicate based on the final concentration at day 4 and the initial concentration at day 0 using an equation as previously described wanjugi and harwood 2013 greater log10 reduction corresponds to a more rapid decay rate and reduced survival day 4 was chosen based the most appropriate time point for capturing the decay rate before enterococci reached undetectable levels graphpad prism was used to perform 2 way anova with tukey s multiple comparison and linear correlation assuming gaussian distribution with pearson s r version 6 07 graphpad software inc la jolla ca 3 results 3 1 plasmid characteristics natural nutrient concentrations of ammonium nitrate and phosphorus in filtered river water 0 165 0 536 and 0 047 ppm respectively were consistent with florida water quality guidelines for unpolluted waters and measurements from similar freshwater systems in the region epa 2015 plasmids in each transconjugant strain differed in their sizes and other characteristics as described previously werner et al 2011 and are summarized in table 1 plasmid sizes ranged from 50 kb to 200 kb and were characterized by different genetic content including toxin antitoxin systems and replicon typing each transconjugant contained a plasmid from a clinical isolate one from a hospital in the united states e0292 and two from hospitals in portugal h74 and h182 table 1 3 2 plasmid maintenance e faecium strains were cultured on media with and without antibiotics added to confirm maintenance of plasmids throughout the experiment as retention of plasmids through the experiment was necessary to test the hypothesis that plasmid size affects survival no significant differences in concentrations of transconjugant e faecium strains cultured on mei compared to vancomycin amended mei were detected in natural or augmented nutrient conditions 2 way anova p 0 66 for and p 0 73 respectively showing plasmid stability in the absence of selective pressure 3 3 decay of e faecium strains the relative decay of plasmid bearing and wild type e faecium strains was compared in natural river water and with added nutrients the mean initial concentration of all four strains inoculated in natural and augmented microcosms on day 0 was 7 9 log10 100 ml 1 standard deviation 0 3 log10 100 ml 1 all strains declined 1 4 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 after four days fig 1 the only significant difference observed among strains α 0 05 was that transconjugant e0292 experienced significantly greater log10 reduction than the parent strain under natural nutrient conditions tukey s multiple comparisons p 0 0245 fig 2 this difference was not observed under augmented nutrient conditions p 0 934 nutrient levels did not significantly affect log10 reduction of any strain two way anova p 0 523 although e0292 reduction was about a log greater under low nutrient compared to augmented conditions the significant difference in decay between e0292 and the parent strain under natural nutrient conditions does suggest that the nutrients are a biologically relevant factor in survival 3 4 reduction associated with plasmid size the log10 reduction of the e faecium strains directly correlated with plasmid size in the natural nutrient treatment fig 3 a p 0 027 r 0 2436 but not in the augmented nutrient treatment fig 3b p 0 5963 r 0 1261 larger plasmids were associated with greater reduction in the natural nutrient treatment but not in the augmented nutrient treatment 4 discussion the fitness cost of plasmids in general smalla et al 2015 and antibiotic resistance plasmids in particular san millan et al 2015 schrag et al 1997 smith and bidochka 1998b has been the subject of study for decades the general conclusion drawn from such studies is that plasmids incur a fitness cost in the absence of selective pressure under laboratory conditions because growing emphasis is placed on the importance of environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance mclain et al 2016 we designed this study to assess the fitness cost of mobile plasmids carrying the vana operon for e faecium in a simulated aquatic environment we hypothesized that organic nutrient levels could influence the burden of plasmid maintenance a linkage that has not been well explored the most obvious mechanism for such an influence would be that increased nutrient levels offset the metabolic costs of plasmid dna and protein synthesis carroll and wong 2018 in this study effects of nutrients on survival were statistically significant only when analyzed based on a relationship to a continuous scale of plasmid size increasing plasmid size was associated with decreased survival under natural nutrient conditions but not when river water was augmented with nutrients augmented nutrient conditions designed to reflect organic carbon levels in a eutrophic surface water wanjugi et al 2016 were expected to enhance survival of all strains in this study given that nutrient availability is a key influence on bacterial survival in aquatic ecosystems anderson et al 2005 barcina et al 1997 craig et al 2004 this is particularly true of organic carbon for enterococcus spp zhang et al 2017 and other heterotrophic bacteria however added nutrients did not have a significant within strain effect on survival which may be explained by relatively low nutrient concentration amendments used in the treatments the lack of within strain effect could also be due low cellular metabolic activity a previous study wanjugi et al 2016 using the same river water and organic carbon sources glucose pyruvate and acetate as this study determined that nutrient concentrations at five times the augmented level used here enhanced survival of e coli compared to natural and 1x amended conditions those results suggest that using more concentrated nutrient treatments in future studies may reveal a relationship or help to disentangle the differences between strains and nutrient levels and could better assess the impacts of raw sewage containing vre released into aquatic ecosystems greater reduction of one plasmid bearing e faecium strain e0292 compared to the parent strain which lacked plasmids confirms previous findings of a fitness cost of plasmids in environments devoid of selective pressure ramadhan and hegedus 2005 san millan et al 2015 starikova et al 2013 vogwill and maclean 2015 zhang et al 2017 two of the transconjugant strains used in this study e0292 and h182 were previously studied to assess fitness cost in competitive mixed culture experiments under laboratory conditions starikova et al 2013 the largest plasmid had a detrimental effect e0292 relative fitness 0 73 and the smallest was beneficial h182 relative fitness 1 1 while the microcosms in this study confirm that reduced fitness is associated with the large plasmid there was no observed benefit to smaller plasmids in our experiments which included environmental stressors such as sunlight and ambient nutrient levels results from the previous study with the same transconjugants starikova et al 2013 support the hypothesis that large plasmids exert fitness costs to their hosts although the conditions in the competitive culture experiments contrasted sharply from those in this study which simulated a natural oligotrophic aquatic environment rather than nutrient rich culture media the largest vancomycin resistance plasmid significantly reduced survival in e faecium transconjugant e0292 compared to the vancomycin susceptible counterpart under natural nutrient conditions in this study log10 reduction of the other transconjugant vre strains was not significantly different than that of the parent strain suggesting that there may be a cut off or threshold size for larger plasmids to negatively impact survival under conditions used here while plasmid copy numbers were not assessed here their size and previously characterized replicon types indicate that they are large low copy number plasmids with less than 5 10 copies per cell san millan et al 2014 werner et al 2011 while the precise genes or gene cassettes responsible for decreased fitness have not been elucidated the difference between the large plasmid and the parent strain was only determined in the natural unaugmented nutrient conditions which suggests that the oligotrophic environment affects the relative success of bacteria bearing large plasmids and that eutrophic nutrient levels may reduce fitness cost the fact that smaller plasmids that confer clinically relevant vre characteristics did not exert a cost of fitness in the environmental conditions studies here is cautionary as it suggests that smaller plasmids may not hamper survival of these pathogens various genes within conjugative plasmids can mediate virulence and survival elwell and shipley 1980 groisman and ochman 1996 guilloteau et al 1996 ramirez et al 2014 trevors et al 1989 but known genes on the plasmids studied here were not associated with survival advantages or inhibition all three conjugative plasmids of the vre strains used in this study are classified as repinc18 repinc prum or both shintani et al 2015 werner et al 2011 e0292 and h74 contained a repinc18 plasmid which is associated with horizontal gene transfer and no known survival advantages palmer et al 2010 while h74 and h182 both contained the repinc prum type plasmid see table 1 toxin antitoxin systems of repinc prum plasmids have been shown to inhibit survival and also support plasmid maintenance in e coli grady and hayes 2003 but did not appear to affect survival in this study with e faecium when compared to parent strains lacking plasmids both transconjugants with the repinc prum plasmids h74 and h182 had lower decay rates compared to e0292 however this study was not desiged to determine whether the plasmid types contribute to or inhibit persistence of vre broadly or how variability in molecular structure of plasmids influenced survival the findings presented here are initial steps towards understanding how antibiotic resistance plasmids influence survival in aquatic environments and should lead to further experimental investigation and genetic analyses while some genetic aspects of the plasmids have been characterized sequencing of entire plasmids might further clarify the role of resistance determinants in the differential survival demonstrated in this study fitness costs shown in the strain carrying the largest plasmid e0292 could be associated with strong promoters regulating gene expression including any additional antibiotic resistance genes located on the plasmids expression of plasmid genes could also be impacted by nutrient levels or other environmental factors and could be explored by transcriptomic analysis focusing on and isolating the role of the plasmid outside of the chromosomal genetic background shared by each strain represents novel research that can inform future studies of fitness costs of antibiotic resistance 5 conclusions this study showed that the transconjugant e faecium strain carrying the largest plasmid decayed faster than its plasmid less parent strain in an aquatic environment with low available nutrients and in the absence of selective pressure strains with smaller plasmids persisted similarly to the parent strain clinical vre strains can enter the environment through sewage spills young et al 2016 and this study investigated the fate of these pathogens in environmental surface water showing that large plasmids inhibit survival but that increased levels of organic nutrients can alleviate the fitness costs vancomycin resistance plasmids that are maintained in the absence of selective pressure can exert fitness costs under natural nutrient conditions the size of vancomycin resistance plasmids was correlated with fitness costs under natural nutrient conditions characteristics of antibiotic resistance plasmids can influence the survival of bacterial pathogens released into aquatic ecosystems

18478,the domestic usage of water generates approximately 310 km3 of wastewater worldwide 2015 aquastat food and agriculture organization of united nations this sewage contains an important organic load due to the use of this water this organic load is characterized using a standard method namely the biological oxygen demand measurement bod5 the bod5 provides information about the biodegradable organic load standard iso 5815 however this measurement protocol is very time consuming 5 days and may produce variability in approximately 20 of results mainly due to variation in the environmental inocula to remedy these limitations this work proposes an innovative concept relying on the implementation of a set of rigorously selected bacterial strains this publication depicts the different steps used in this study from bio indicator selection to validation with real wastewater samples the results obtained in the final step show a strong correlation between the developed approach and the reference method iso 5815 with a correlation rate of approximately 0 9 in addition the optimization of the experimental conditions and the use of controlled strains 8 selected strains allow significant reduction in the duration of the bod5 analysis with only 3 h required for the proposed method versus 5 days for the reference method this technological breakthrough should simplify the monitoring of wastewater treatment plants and provide quicker easier and more coherent control in terms of the treatment time keywords bod5 multivariate approach bacterial biosensor neural network wastewater 1 introduction the global production of domestic wastewater was assessed to be 315 km3 in 2010 and will tend to increase in the future concomitant with population expansion flörke et al 2013 mateo sagasta et al 2015 these wastewaters which are mainly contaminated by organic materials i e carbohydrates fats proteins etc resulting from human body wastes 20 faeces and urine and domestic uses 80 personal washing laundry food preparation etc duncan 2004 garcia et al 2006 present a real risk for the receiving environment and the exposed population to limit the consequences of release of these wastewaters into the environment they are treated to remove the organic load through bioprocesses such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps to measure the conformity of the released waters the organic load in the treated water is tested weekly in average samples according to the reference method iso 5815 1 2003 2003 iso 5815 2 2003 2003 based on bod biological oxygen demand this method dates from the beginning of the twentieth century great britain royal commission on sewage disposal 1908 jouanneau et al 2014 and its implementation is widespread worldwide this method is based on assessment of the biochemical oxygen demand i e the amount of oxygen consumed over 5 days by environmental microorganisms to biodegrade the organic matter under aerobic conditions bod5 in mg l 1 of consumed o2 however this method has several drawbacks the method exhibits important intrinsic variability higher than 20 that is mainly due to the broad diversity of inocula used to carry out the measurements guyard 2010 the 5 day period required for a measurement is longer than the retention time of water in wwtps close to 3 days the measurement carries a significant risk of measurement error due to the available amount of oxygen in water indeed the maximal load measured with this method cannot exceeded 6 mg l bod iso 5815 1 2003 2003 iso 5815 2 2003 2003 whereas the bod5 value of wastewater is close to 300 mg l and thus requires pre dilution over the last several decades many research teams have focused on these issues to propose new measurement strategies with an aim of removing these drawbacks jouanneau et al 2014 sun et al 2015 yang et al 2015 a specific focus on the biological aspect of the measurement highlights two strategies based on i the use of environmental inocula and ii the implementation of only one microbial strain the first strategy has the advantage of ensuring great representativeness of the biological answers due to broad microbial diversity but induces significant variability i e origin density and diversity liu et al 2012 rastogi et al 2003 rocher et al 2011 due to the intrinsic characteristics of the inocula conversely the second strategy based on the use of one known strain is very reproducible but is limited by the range of metabolic abilities of the selected strain arlyapov et al 2012 raud et al 2012 yoshida et al 2001 which consequently provides a truncated view of the biodegradable organic diversity in light of these issues some researchers have proposed an alternative strategy based on the use of several known microbial strains two strategies were proposed based on either i an artificial mixture of 2 4 strains or ii a set of several strains used individually the aims of these strategies were the same namely to enlarge the biodegradation spectra while ensuring a great level of reproducibility catterall et al 2003 jia et al 2003 jiang et al 2006 lin et al 2006 xin et al 2007 in the case of multi species mixtures i the stability of the initial properties of the consortia i e cell density diversity ratio between strains biodegradation abilities etc was difficult to ensure long term mostly due to competition for the carbon substrate the second strategy ii pitman et al 2015 raud and kikas 2013 also relies on several strains but is based on the use of several selected strains not structured in the consortium this strategy ensures good reproducibility while freeing the results from potential inocula drifts this strategy was applied in this work nevertheless this multivariate approach based on several biological descriptors increases the complexity of the data analysis one value per strains to overcome this limitation raud and kikas 2013 analysed the data with a pls partial least squares regression method to simultaneously take into consideration all the information provided by the different strains the results were very encouraging but the validation was performed only on synthetic wastewaters and not on real samples moreover bio element selection is a crucial parameter in these metrological approaches based on controlled strains and directly conditions the potential performances of the future analytical method i e biodegradation spectra and response kinetics jouanneau et al 2014 the selection step when included generally is based on either the intrinsic properties of the strains i e biodegradation range and growth conditions kwok et al 2005 oota et al 2010 raud et al 2012 raud and kikas 2013 or isolation of strains from a specific environment chan et al 2000 kwok et al 2005 yoshida et al 2000 nevertheless no characterization or comparison has been carried out to determine the relevance of this choice moreover questions remain concerning how to ensure the representativity of the proposed analytical approach under these conditions the aim of the proposed study was to design a relevant analytical method for the assessment of the bod5 to address these limitations this strategy is based on the separate use not structured in the consortium of a set of 8 bacterial strains that have been rigorously selected using defined characteristics such as the biodegradation potential metabolic rate and toxicological robustness fig 1 coupled with an algorithm of data processing allowing to analyses the multivariate information provided by the bacterial set the proposed method is able to assess bod5 in only 3 h with a high reliability r2 0 85 2 experimental section 2 1 bacterial strains a total of 28 strains were preselected from the literature according to the following characteristics i their representativity with regard to the microbial population of an activated sludge from a wwtp kong et al 2007 snaidr et al 1997 xia et al 2010 ii their weak pathogenicity mainly group 1 risk according to the 2000 54 ec classification proposed by the european directive iii their broad biodegradation abilities gao et al 2010 and iv their resistance to freeze drying conditions information collected from microbial collections such as atcc dsmz or cip specification relative to an eventual industrial transfer the full list of pre selected strains at this step is described in the supplementary data tables sd 1 2 2 growth medium of the strains and other solutions the luria bertani medium lb medium was prepared in distilled water and supplemented with 5 g l 1 nacl merck germany 5 g l 1 tryptone biokar diagnostics france and 1 g l 1 yeast extract biokar diagnostics france 15 g l 1 of agar type e biokar diagnostics france was added to obtain the solid medium the ph was adjusted to 7 using a solution of hcl sigma aldrich usa or naoh merck germany before autoclaving at 120 c for 20 min the synthetic wastewater sww solution was prepared in accordance with the oecd 209 standard28 as follows 1 l of distilled water was supplemented with 16 g of tryptone biokar diagnostics france 11 g of meat extract biokar diagnostics france 3

medium atlas 1997 without a carbon source used in this study was prepared in two steps the first step consisted of preparation of several concentrated solutions s1 s2 s3 st and sb in distilled water s1 consists of 60 g l 1 na2hpo4 fluka germany 30 g l 1 kh2po4 merck germany 10 g l 1 nh4cl merck germany and 5 g l 1 nacl merck germany s2 s3 sb and st are composed of 264 5 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o sigma

were filtered through 0 2 μm cellulose acetate filters 146560 dutscher france and stored at 4 c the second step consisted of mixing these solutions according to the following ratio for 1 l of mm 100 ml of s1 1 ml of s2 s3 st sb and if required 10 ml of a carbon source at the desired concentration the mixture was adjusted to 1 l with sterile distilled water glucose solutions gss were prepared at several carbon concentrations in the mm medium and sterilized by filtration cellulose acetate filters 146560 dutscher france glycerol solution glys at 50 v v was prepared in distilled water and sterilized by autoclaving 2 3 growth and preparation of bacterial cells all strains were stored and cultivated under the same conditions the cells were stored at 80 c in a mixture v v of lb medium 50 and glys 50 the cells were isolated on solid lb medium at 30 c during 12 24 h and the obtained colonies were used to inoculated the first cultivations for the first cultures the cells were grown overnight 14 h in lb medium at 30 c under shaking at 250 rpm then the cells were diluted to an optical density of od620nm 0 2 in fresh lb medium and cultivated at 30 c under shaking at 250 rpm until an od620nm 0 6 exponential growth stage was reached this od620nm value 0 6 corresponds to a cell density varying between 108 and 109 cfu ml 1 for the tested strains results not shown for the sake of simplicity we considered that these cell densities were not significantly different from strain to strain the cultivated cells od620nm 0 6 were refreshed in an ethanol bath at 20 c for 1 min the aim of this step is not to freeze the cells but to decrease quickly the temperature in order to avoid any change of their physiological state then the cells were centrifuged 6400 g 5 min 4 c to remove the growth medium and resuspended in a cold washing solution of mgso4 7h2o 10 2 m after three washes the cells were resuspended in mm without a carbon source and adjusted to obtain the required cellular density od620nm 0 43 0 86 1 1 72 2 57 3 43 4 29 2 4 optimization of the experimental conditions we were interested in improving some of the experimental conditions through two strategies the replacement of oxygen used as an activity marker of biodegradation in the reference method with a fluorescent dye resazurin that was a priori better suited for this metrological context and the optimization of the cell density in the biodegradation assays the aim of this second strategy was to define the condition that ensured both a reduced analysis duration and a measurement range that was as large as possible the resazurin solution used in this work was a commercial solution prestoblue invitrogen usa no information was available relative its concentration these steps were performed with the model strain e coli k12 mg1655 in duplicate 2 4 1 comparison of two activity markers oxygen versus resazurin fluorescent dye 2 4 1 1 monitoring the biodegradation activity via the fluorescent marker the bacterial suspension was prepared as described above see 2 3 at an od620nm 0 43 the assay solution was prepared by mixing the washed bacterial suspension mm supplemented with glucose and the commercial resazurin solution prestoblue invitrogen usa several glucose concentrations final concentration ranging from 0 1 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 were tested to define the limits of the measurement

2006 tizzard et al 2006 was performed with the tristar lb 941 multimode microplate reader berthold technologies gmbh germany every 10 min λexcitation 540 nm bandwidth 10 nm λemission 610 nm bandwidth 10 nm counting time 0 1 s and incubation temperature 30 c 2 4 1 2 monitoring of the biodegradation activity via oxygen consumption for the assay based on the oxygen marker the resazurin solution was replaced by distilled water in the assay solution in this case the biological activity was monitored in an oxodish od24 microplate reader 24 well microplate with an integrated oxygen sensor presens precision sensing gmbh germany each well was filled with 3 ml of assay solution same ratio as in 2 4 1 a 700 μl of bacterial suspension 2 ml of mm with glucose but 300 μl of distilled water and sealed using an ab 0558 adhesive pcr film thermo abgene france to prevent atmospheric oxygen from entering the system cregut et al 2013 during the test oxygen was monitored at 30 c with the sensordish reader presens precision sensing 2 4 2 optimization of the cellular density the impact of the cell density was evaluated as described in the previous paragraph 2 4 1 the same protocol based on resazurin as the biodegradation marker was used except for the final bacterial concentration which ranged from od620nm 0 1 to od620nm 1 2 5 characterization of the strains the characterization steps described below were performed for the 28 selected strains in parallel with the optimization phases the cellular density after the washing step see 2 3 was adjusted to od620nm 1 for all strains 2 5 1 metabolic profile and stress robustness the objective was to characterize the selected strains according to two criteria their biodegradation capabilities and their intrinsic robustness towards several environmental stresses i e ph salinity antibiotics reference toxic compounds etc these two parameters were assessed simultaneously using gen iii microplates biolog inc usa see fig sd 1 with 71 different carbon sources and 23 stress conditions test based on the growth inhibition induced by specific conditions such as osmotic and ph stresses or several reference toxics supplemented with tetrazolium redox dyes as a colorimetric respiratory marker following the protocol provided by the manufacturer briefly after the washing step see 2 3 the bacterial suspension was diluted tenfold in

atmospheric oxygen diffusion in the reaction medium measurements were performed with the sensordish reader presens precision sensing each minute at 30 c for 10 h in triplicate the kinetics values were calculated from the maximal slope of the measured oxygen consumption 2 6 environmental samples the environmental samples n 104 tables sd 2 had several origins including raw or treated waters from

for bod5 were performed according to the standard method iso 5815 by the inovalys nantes lab nantes france which is certified by the french accreditation committee cofrac 2 7 2 method developed in this work the measurement protocol for the proposed bod5 test was carried out in 96 well microplates nunc f96 microwell 236108 according to the following ratio 35 μl of bacterial suspension at an od620nm 2 57 final od620nm in well 0 6 100 μl of sample and 15 μl of resazurin prestoblue invitrogen usa the microplate was incubated for 3 h at 30 c these test conditions incubation period cell density oxygen marker and used strains were determined during the optimization step of the experimental conditions see results in 3 1 and 3 2 subsequently the fluorescence signal relative to the biological activity of the strains was individually read with the tristar lb941 multimode microplate reader as described above see 2 4 1 all the samples see 2 6 were tested in duplicate and the collected values were exported to an overall database this data set was used to establish the correlation algorithm between the biological values provided by the bacterial set and the bod5 reference method iso 5815 2 8 data processing design of correlation models by a statistical approach the aim of the data processing was to design algorithms to correlate the biological data fluorescence values obtained from the selected strains with the bod5 reference values the final goal was to propose a mathematical model to predict the bod5 value from only the data provided by these strains all models were designed via a dedicated software neuro one 6 13 0 5 netral france 2 8 1 architecture of the model number of biological descriptors and nature of the model first the data were analysed using a mono parametric approach the information fluorescence values from each strain was individually correlated with the reference values by linear regression because the results were insufficient low correlation rates the data processing focused on a multi component strategy based on several strains which was also based on a linear regression algorithm this step allowed the determination of the number of biological descriptors selected strain required to assess the bod5 the predictive abilities of these models are limited to improve the performance of the models for the assessment of the bod5 non linear algorithms by neural networks were deployed these models are defined according to architectural characteristics such as the number of hidden neurons the activation modalities of the neurons and the data standardization conditions several architectures were compared for the overall database to identify a priori the most relevant algorithms 2 8 2 model validation the last data processing step consisted of comparing the preselected architectures based on their predictive abilities with new samples for this purpose the overall database was randomly separated into two groups a learning set n 148 assays and a validation set n 60 assays the learning set was used to design new algorithms based on the preselected architectures number of hidden neurons activation mode and data standardization to assess the robustness of these new models and choose the most relevant model the estimated bod5 values obtained from the validation set were compared to the reference values this step was also performed with neuro one 6 13 0 5 netral france 3 results and discussion 3 1 improvement of biological activity monitoring the reference method used to assess bod5 is based on oxygen consumption as a marker of the biodegradation activity this approach induces some technical constraints such as a measurement range that is limited by the saturation rate of oxygen in water cregut et al 2013 or the tightness of the system to air contaminant oxygen in this context resazurin appears to be a relevant marker for monitoring biological activity cregut et al 2013 this non toxic non fluorescent dye λabsorbance max 601 nm is reduced in the cell cytoplasm to a fluorescent compound resorufin λabsorbance max 571 nm λexcitation 535 560 nm λemission 590 615 nm see fig sd 2 by the enzymatic chain involved in cellular respiration cregut et al 2013 fai and grant 2009 o brien et al 2000 these two cell activity markers were compared during glucose biodegradation monitoring mm supplemented with glucose as the sole carbon source in e coli several glucose concentrations range from 0 1 to 500 mg l 1 were tested to determine the highest measurable concentration according to the marker used fig 2 a comparative analysis of these results showed that use of resazurin as a marker could assess the glucose concentration up to 495 mg l 1 versus only 125 mg l 1 with oxygen in light of these data the fluorescent dye was selected for continuation of the study subsequently we were interested in the effect of the cell density of e coli on the measurement duration with resazurin as cell activity marker fig 2b shows that an increase in the cell density substantially reduced the analysis duration a cell density of 0 1 od620nm resulted in a measurement duration of almost 12 h versus 2 h for an od620nm 1 the results also showed a reduction in the measurement range that was linked to the increasing cell density this trend can be explained by an increase in the signal to noise ratio see fig sd 3 an important noise fluorescence baseline measured with the high cell densities probably is induced by endogenous cellular respiration at the same time the saturation limit of the approach is reached at approximately 800 000 rfu consequently the maximal measurable concentrations should not exceed 500 mg l 1 for a cell density of 0 1 od620nm versus 170 mg l 1 for an od620nm 1 to comply with the approach expectations analysis limited in time but ensuring a relevant measurement range the better compromise seemed to be a cellular density of 0 6 corresponding to an analysis duration of approximately 3 h 3 2 selection of a representative set of strains the objective of this step was to constitute a set of controlled bacterial strains that were able to reliably assess the bod5 in a limited time and under reproducible conditions 3 2 1 pre selection of bacterial candidates the first step was dedicated to the preselection of bacterial strains that were likely to become a biological strain capable of assessing the bod5 a literature review identified the major phyla present in the activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants main targets of the proposed metrological approach isazadeh et al 2016 xia et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 more than 1200 operational taxonomic units otus were identified as potential candidates in activated sludge from wwtps several of these otus were directly rejected due to their strong pathogenicity i e campylobacteraceae helicobacteraceae xanthomonadales some burkholderiales some bacteriodetes etc or their unsuitable metabolism strictly anaerobic strains such as desulfobacterales and desulfovibrionales and marine strains such as alteromonadales which were incompatible with the intended use of the technology fig 3 among the selected families we focused on the identification of bacterial species that met the criteria of the approach the pre selected strains should preferably be isolated from activated sludge of wwtps should be largely represented in these environments should have wide and complementary a priori biodegradation abilities should not be pathogenic and should be available in the current strain banks i e dsmz or atcc in accordance with these five criteria 31 strains among more than 1200 identified otus were pre selected before a second characterization step based on their ease of use quick growth and ease of cultivation from the obtained results 3 strains were discarded complexity of culture or too low a growth rate which reduced the bacterial preselection to 28 strains see tables sd 1 the overall pre selection strategy is shown in fig 3 3 2 2 selection of a representative set of strains the simultaneous use of the 28 strains as individual descriptors of the bod5 was extremely technically complex and expensive consequently we needed to reduce the number of strains used in the bioassay first we focused on the biodegradation capabilities of the selected strains the biodegradation profile of each candidate was determined using 71 carbon sources see fig sd 1 and hierarchical clustering was performed according to their similarities agglomerative hierarchical clustering fig 4 eight clusters with comparable biodegradation capabilities were identified among the 28 preselected strains similar profiles at 95 for example group a which consisted of 6 strains a towneri b aquatica p pantrophus z resiniphila b vertrisii and b funiculus exhibited a modest range only 6 of molecules that were likely to be biodegraded among the 71 proposed carbon sources conversely group h offered a very wide set of biodegradation capabilities with ca 85 biodegraded molecules r radiobacter b subtilis staphylococcus sp s yanoikuyae and a aurescens in parallel all strains were characterized according to their robustness and biodegradation kinetics fig 5 these criteria were taken into account to select a representative among the bacterial groups with similar biodegradation profiles to limit the effect of the water toxicity on the metrological approach strains with strong robustness were preferred because of their inherent capabilities to resist environmental stresses indeed in the case of excessive water toxicity or too high sensitivity of strains the bacterial cells will be not able to provide reliable information inducing erroneous results however strains with high biodegradation kinetics were a priori more likely to provide a biological signal quickly consequently these strains were also preferred in view of the context of technological development of this study fig 5a reports the specific robustness of each strain these values were calculated based on 23 stress conditions and varied between 0 13 for b mycoides the most sensitive strain among the 28 tested and 1 for e coli fig 5b depicts the biodegradation kinetics of each strain for the synthetic wastewater sww from these data that were calculated from the maximal measured slope of oxygen consumption we noted significant differences between strains for example the biodegradation kinetics reached 0 33 mg bod l 1 h 1 for b vertrisii whereas the kinetics achieved by p putida dsm 1868 were approximately 12 mg bod l 1 h 1 consequently the second strain should a priori provide a faster biological signal as desired for our bioassay the final selection process of representative strains among each cluster was based on these last two criteria in addition to some criteria relative to the utilization of the strains such as the flocculation of cells during growth complexity of the preparation step for example group a consists of 6 strains b funiculus b vertrisii z resiniphila p pantrophus b aquatica and a towneri among these 6 strains b aquatica was selected to represent this group because of its capabilities highest robustness and fastest biodegradation kinetics finally among the 28 candidates a representative set of 8 strains was definitively selected consisting of b aquatica c testosteroni p putida dsm 1868 v paradoxus c pseudodiphteriticum p mirabilis e coli and b subtilis 3 3 bod5 assessment with the standard method and the bioassay the bod5 values of the 104 real samples collective or non collective sanitation or stormwater were determined according to the standard method iso 5815 see tables sd 2 as expected the samples taken before treatment by a wwtp showed significant pollution levels with an average bod5 of nearly 120 mg l 1 min 66 mg l 1 max 190 mg l 1 the levels measured in the treated waters varied strongly according to their origins collective or non collective sanitation the average bod5 of stormwater was approximately 40 mg l 1 min 12 mg l 1 max 54 mg l 1 this pollution is probably due to runoff of water on roads and roofs which transfers pollutants from support to water in parallel each sample was subjected to the selected strains to determine the corresponding biological activity fluorescence values obtained after 3 h of exposure for the 104 analysed samples in duplicate the final database consisted of 208 assays each sample is defined by 8 fluorescence values one per strain and a bod5 reference value obtained using the standard method the data analysis was performed from this database the main objective of this supplementary step was to propose a reliable correlation model that allowed prediction of the bod5 after only 3 h nevertheless we were focused on the number of strains required to assess the bod5 before improving the correlation algorithm a second time numerical model allowing calculation of the bod5 from fluorescence values provided by the selected strains 3 3 1 determination of the number of biological descriptors needed to assess the bod5 the data provided by each selected bacterial strain were individually correlated by linear regression with the bod5 reference values fig 6 the average correlation rate was approximately 0 11 with a standard deviation of 0 08 among the 8 selected strains the best correlation rate obtained with b aquatica r2 0 2638 was too low to be used as a reliable bio indicator of the bod5 nevertheless each strain provided a portion of the overall information consequently increasing the number of strains used to assess the bod5 should improve the relevance of the approach however the number of strains required to ensure a reliable measurement is unknown correlation models linear regression were designed based on the use of 1 8 strains the obtained models are presented on fig 7 the correlation rate between the predicted calculated from fluorescence data provided by the selected strains and reference values standard method tended to increase with the number of strains used indeed the average rate obtained from a single strain was approximately 0 11 whereas this rate reached approximately 0 6 when the 8 strains were used increasing the number of strains used to assess the bod5 was associated with a significant increase in the correlation rate of the models however the predictive capabilities of the best model based on the 8 strains was not sufficient r2 0 58 in view of these results a second step was required to improve the predictive capabilities of the data analysis model 3 3 2 improvement of the correlation model to overcome this limitation and to propose a more reliable method for the assessment of the bod5 the regression linear algorithms were compared to a neural network approach the neural network is a framework for many different machine learning algorithms that can process complex data consequently an exploratory step was performed to screen the architectures with the most potential several architectures were compared with the dedicated neuro one software version 6 13 0 5 netral france the differences between the tested architectures were based on the number of hidden neurons the activation mode and the data standardization more than 800 models 80 architectures and 10 models by architecture obtained by iterations were generated see tables sd 3 by supervised learning from the overall database the correlation rate obtained between the predicted and reference bod5 values varied from 0 36 below the model based on linear regression 0 58 to 0 93 among the 80 tested architectures several architectures had relevant predictive capacities with correlation rates superior to 0 8 the best model r2 0 93 was based on an orthonormalization gram schmidt process of inputs 4 hidden neurons activated by a hyperbolic tangent algorithm and post treatment of the outputs these models are iteratively designed from existing data i e they modify the different variables that control the variables during the learning process according to the data taken into account consequently over learning is a significant risk which leads to questions about the relevance and the robustness of the predicted bod5 values obtained from new data to remove this uncertainty new models were designed using a fraction of the overall database 3 3 3 model validation the global database was randomly separated into two sets the learning n 148 and the validation n 60 sets see 2 8 2 the learning set was used to design models with the 10 best a priori architectures determined during the previous step see tables sd 3 conditions overlined in grey ten models were generated based on the architecture the robustness of these models was compared from unused data in the validation set based on the correlation rate between the predicted and reference values among the 100 models the most relevant was able to estimate the bod5 of the validation samples data not included during the learning process with strong reliability r2 0 851 fig 8 this model consists of a hidden layer of three neurons activated by a hyperbolic tangent function the input and output data are standardized with respect to a centred reduced normal distribution from a global perspective the bod5 values calculated from the bacterial set are relatively consistent with the reference values the model seems to be particularly reliable between 25 and 300 mg l 1 bod5 according to the reference method for wastewaters collective or non collective sanitation nevertheless its performance decreases for samples with low biodegradable organic loads inferior to 25 mg l 1 according to the reference method and for stormwaters two hypotheses can explain this result i the current model is not sufficiently accurate to predict low bod5 values a specific model must be designed to analyse specifically these low values and or ii an organic composition of stormwater different from that of wastewaters organic compounds collected during water runoff on roads or roofs induces specific findings from the bacterial descriptors similar results were obtained by raud and kikas 2013 their strategy was based on a microbial set consisting of 7 bacterial strains selected from their intrinsic biodegradation properties the processing of multivariate data was performed using a pls algorithm the validation was only performed on artificial samples synthetic wastewater spiked with phenol milk fat or cellulose and not on real wastewater samples nevertheless the correlation rate between the calculated and reference values was close to 1 r2 0 85 in our study opposition to real samples seems to decrease the correlation rate calculated values versus reference values because mimicking a real sample with synthetic effluents is difficult the reference values own an inherent variability close to 20 jouanneau et al 2014 notably due to the environmental variability of used inoculum conversely the mean variability of data provided by the selected strains is 6 62 results not showed during the learning process the model adjusts the model variables to match the data provided by the bacterial set with the reference data integrating at the same time its inherent variability 20 to improve prediction reliability it is required to know the true reference value for this it would be necessary to carry out several reference analysis by samples to determinate these true values statistical analysis in order to design new predictive models 3 3 4 post analysis in accordance with the selected architecture a post analysis was performed to demonstrate the relevance of the use of several strains as bio indicators associated with data processing by the neural network fig 9 shows the average correlation rates linear least squares method and the associated standard deviations depending on the number of strains used and according to the models used linear regression or neural network the results show a significant improvement in the reliability of the provided bod5 values compared with those obtained with the linear regression models with this post analysis we demonstrated firstly that the number of biological descriptors was a crucial factor in the development of a method to assess the biodegradable organic load the use of a single bio indicator seems to significantly limit the measurement performance of the strategy the review of jouanneau et al 2014 tended to reinforce this observation indeed among the many cited publications strategies based on a unique biological descriptor show lower abilities to assess the bod5 in real samples see fig sd 4 and wider variability between studies from the publications cited in this review the average correlation rate was close to 0 81 sd 0 24 with a unique biological descriptor r2 min 0 09 r2 max 1 versus 0 95 sd 0 07 with a consortium r2 min 0 81 r2 max 1 strategies based on consortium related systems use microbial mixtures from natural or artificial origins in most cases these strategies are in agreement the protocol described in the reference method iso 5815 but induce wide inherent variability due to the descriptors used 4 conclusion in this work we proposed an overall strategy to assess the bod5 from the selection of bacterial indicators to the validation of real wastewater samples by acting on some levers such as the measurement conditions or the selection of 8 bacterial bio indicators we developed a bioassay that allowed reliable and accurate bod5 measurement and required only 3 h versus 5 days for the reference method the measurement range being enlarged no dilution is required to assess bod5 in most wastewater contrary to the reference method limited to 6 mg l bod the obtained results are very encouraging and show a strong correlation with the reference bod5 values r2 0 85 nevertheless the method seems to reach its limits regarding to the assessing of low bod5 levels inferior to 25 mg l 1 according to the reference method further work will have to be carried out to improve the model in these cases this significant technological improvement should increase the monitoring level of wastewaters indeed by reducing the analysis duration it is easier to control the process of water treatment and if necessary to adjust some parameters such as the oxygen intake or the water flow due to the time scale that is consistent with the treatment duration 2 3 days in wwtps this metrological strategy was filed with the

18478,the domestic usage of water generates approximately 310 km3 of wastewater worldwide 2015 aquastat food and agriculture organization of united nations this sewage contains an important organic load due to the use of this water this organic load is characterized using a standard method namely the biological oxygen demand measurement bod5 the bod5 provides information about the biodegradable organic load standard iso 5815 however this measurement protocol is very time consuming 5 days and may produce variability in approximately 20 of results mainly due to variation in the environmental inocula to remedy these limitations this work proposes an innovative concept relying on the implementation of a set of rigorously selected bacterial strains this publication depicts the different steps used in this study from bio indicator selection to validation with real wastewater samples the results obtained in the final step show a strong correlation between the developed approach and the reference method iso 5815 with a correlation rate of approximately 0 9 in addition the optimization of the experimental conditions and the use of controlled strains 8 selected strains allow significant reduction in the duration of the bod5 analysis with only 3 h required for the proposed method versus 5 days for the reference method this technological breakthrough should simplify the monitoring of wastewater treatment plants and provide quicker easier and more coherent control in terms of the treatment time keywords bod5 multivariate approach bacterial biosensor neural network wastewater 1 introduction the global production of domestic wastewater was assessed to be 315 km3 in 2010 and will tend to increase in the future concomitant with population expansion flörke et al 2013 mateo sagasta et al 2015 these wastewaters which are mainly contaminated by organic materials i e carbohydrates fats proteins etc resulting from human body wastes 20 faeces and urine and domestic uses 80 personal washing laundry food preparation etc duncan 2004 garcia et al 2006 present a real risk for the receiving environment and the exposed population to limit the consequences of release of these wastewaters into the environment they are treated to remove the organic load through bioprocesses such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps to measure the conformity of the released waters the organic load in the treated water is tested weekly in average samples according to the reference method iso 5815 1 2003 2003 iso 5815 2 2003 2003 based on bod biological oxygen demand this method dates from the beginning of the twentieth century great britain royal commission on sewage disposal 1908 jouanneau et al 2014 and its implementation is widespread worldwide this method is based on assessment of the biochemical oxygen demand i e the amount of oxygen consumed over 5 days by environmental microorganisms to biodegrade the organic matter under aerobic conditions bod5 in mg l 1 of consumed o2 however this method has several drawbacks the method exhibits important intrinsic variability higher than 20 that is mainly due to the broad diversity of inocula used to carry out the measurements guyard 2010 the 5 day period required for a measurement is longer than the retention time of water in wwtps close to 3 days the measurement carries a significant risk of measurement error due to the available amount of oxygen in water indeed the maximal load measured with this method cannot exceeded 6 mg l bod iso 5815 1 2003 2003 iso 5815 2 2003 2003 whereas the bod5 value of wastewater is close to 300 mg l and thus requires pre dilution over the last several decades many research teams have focused on these issues to propose new measurement strategies with an aim of removing these drawbacks jouanneau et al 2014 sun et al 2015 yang et al 2015 a specific focus on the biological aspect of the measurement highlights two strategies based on i the use of environmental inocula and ii the implementation of only one microbial strain the first strategy has the advantage of ensuring great representativeness of the biological answers due to broad microbial diversity but induces significant variability i e origin density and diversity liu et al 2012 rastogi et al 2003 rocher et al 2011 due to the intrinsic characteristics of the inocula conversely the second strategy based on the use of one known strain is very reproducible but is limited by the range of metabolic abilities of the selected strain arlyapov et al 2012 raud et al 2012 yoshida et al 2001 which consequently provides a truncated view of the biodegradable organic diversity in light of these issues some researchers have proposed an alternative strategy based on the use of several known microbial strains two strategies were proposed based on either i an artificial mixture of 2 4 strains or ii a set of several strains used individually the aims of these strategies were the same namely to enlarge the biodegradation spectra while ensuring a great level of reproducibility catterall et al 2003 jia et al 2003 jiang et al 2006 lin et al 2006 xin et al 2007 in the case of multi species mixtures i the stability of the initial properties of the consortia i e cell density diversity ratio between strains biodegradation abilities etc was difficult to ensure long term mostly due to competition for the carbon substrate the second strategy ii pitman et al 2015 raud and kikas 2013 also relies on several strains but is based on the use of several selected strains not structured in the consortium this strategy ensures good reproducibility while freeing the results from potential inocula drifts this strategy was applied in this work nevertheless this multivariate approach based on several biological descriptors increases the complexity of the data analysis one value per strains to overcome this limitation raud and kikas 2013 analysed the data with a pls partial least squares regression method to simultaneously take into consideration all the information provided by the different strains the results were very encouraging but the validation was performed only on synthetic wastewaters and not on real samples moreover bio element selection is a crucial parameter in these metrological approaches based on controlled strains and directly conditions the potential performances of the future analytical method i e biodegradation spectra and response kinetics jouanneau et al 2014 the selection step when included generally is based on either the intrinsic properties of the strains i e biodegradation range and growth conditions kwok et al 2005 oota et al 2010 raud et al 2012 raud and kikas 2013 or isolation of strains from a specific environment chan et al 2000 kwok et al 2005 yoshida et al 2000 nevertheless no characterization or comparison has been carried out to determine the relevance of this choice moreover questions remain concerning how to ensure the representativity of the proposed analytical approach under these conditions the aim of the proposed study was to design a relevant analytical method for the assessment of the bod5 to address these limitations this strategy is based on the separate use not structured in the consortium of a set of 8 bacterial strains that have been rigorously selected using defined characteristics such as the biodegradation potential metabolic rate and toxicological robustness fig 1 coupled with an algorithm of data processing allowing to analyses the multivariate information provided by the bacterial set the proposed method is able to assess bod5 in only 3 h with a high reliability r2 0 85 2 experimental section 2 1 bacterial strains a total of 28 strains were preselected from the literature according to the following characteristics i their representativity with regard to the microbial population of an activated sludge from a wwtp kong et al 2007 snaidr et al 1997 xia et al 2010 ii their weak pathogenicity mainly group 1 risk according to the 2000 54 ec classification proposed by the european directive iii their broad biodegradation abilities gao et al 2010 and iv their resistance to freeze drying conditions information collected from microbial collections such as atcc dsmz or cip specification relative to an eventual industrial transfer the full list of pre selected

overnight 14 h in lb medium at 30 c under shaking at 250 rpm then the cells were diluted to an optical density of od620nm 0 2 in fresh lb medium and cultivated at 30 c under shaking at 250 rpm until an od620nm 0 6 exponential growth stage was reached this od620nm value 0 6 corresponds to a cell density varying between 108 and 109 cfu ml 1 for the tested strains results not shown for the sake of simplicity we considered that these cell densities were not significantly different from strain to strain the cultivated cells od620nm 0 6 were refreshed in an ethanol bath at 20 c for 1 min the aim of this step is not to freeze the cells but to decrease quickly the temperature in order to avoid any change of their physiological state then the cells were centrifuged 6400 g 5 min 4 c to remove the

density od620nm 0 43 0 86 1 1 72 2 57 3 43 4 29 2 4 optimization of the experimental conditions we were interested in improving some of the experimental conditions through two strategies the replacement of oxygen used as an activity marker of biodegradation in the reference method with a fluorescent dye resazurin that was a priori better suited for this metrological context and the optimization of the cell density in the biodegradation assays the aim of this second strategy was to define the condition that ensured both a reduced analysis duration and a measurement range that was as large as possible the resazurin solution used in this work was a commercial solution prestoblue invitrogen usa no information was available relative its concentration these steps were performed with the model strain e coli k12 mg1655 in duplicate 2 4 1 comparison of two activity markers oxygen versus resazurin fluorescent dye 2 4 1 1 monitoring the biodegradation activity via the fluorescent marker the bacterial suspension was prepared as described above see 2 3 at an od620nm 0 43 the assay solution was prepared by mixing the washed bacterial suspension mm supplemented with glucose and the commercial resazurin solution prestoblue invitrogen usa several glucose concentrations final concentration ranging from 0 1 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 were tested to define the limits of the measurement

10 nm counting time 0 1 s and incubation temperature 30 c 2 4 1 2 monitoring of the biodegradation activity via oxygen consumption for the assay based on the oxygen marker the resazurin solution was replaced by distilled water in the assay solution in this case the biological activity was monitored in an oxodish od24 microplate reader 24 well microplate with an integrated oxygen sensor presens precision sensing gmbh germany each well was filled with 3 ml of assay solution same ratio as in 2 4 1 a 700 μl of bacterial suspension 2 ml of mm with glucose but 300 μl of distilled water and sealed using an ab 0558 adhesive pcr film thermo abgene france to prevent atmospheric oxygen from entering the system cregut et al 2013 during the test oxygen was monitored at 30 c with the sensordish reader presens precision sensing 2 4 2 optimization of the cellular density the impact of the cell density was evaluated as described in the previous paragraph 2 4 1 the same protocol based on resazurin as the biodegradation marker was used except for the final bacterial concentration which ranged from od620nm 0 1 to od620nm 1 2 5 characterization of the strains the characterization steps described below were performed for the 28 selected strains in parallel with the optimization phases the cellular density after the washing step see 2 3 was adjusted to od620nm 1 for all strains 2 5 1 metabolic profile and stress robustness the objective was to characterize the selected strains according to two criteria their biodegradation capabilities and their intrinsic robustness towards several environmental stresses i e ph salinity antibiotics reference toxic compounds etc these two parameters were assessed simultaneously using gen iii microplates biolog inc usa see fig sd 1 with 71 different carbon sources and 23 stress conditions test based on the growth inhibition induced by specific conditions such as osmotic and ph stresses or several reference toxics supplemented with tetrazolium redox dyes as a colorimetric respiratory marker following the protocol provided by the manufacturer briefly after the washing step see 2 3 the bacterial suspension was diluted tenfold in an if a solution biolog inc no 72401 if a usa to obtain a cellular density between 107 and 108 cell ml 1 od620nm 0 1 then 100 μl of this diluted suspension was added to each microplate well and the plate was incubated for 40 h at 30 c the reading was performed at a wavelength of 590 nm preston mafham et al 2002 with the tristar lb 941 multimode microplate reader berthold technologies germany each strain was tested in duplicate the results obtained from the 71 carbon sources were used to establish biodegradation profiles specific to each strain and then compared and clustered using statistical approaches agglomerative hierarchical clustering xlstat addinsoft for each strain an index of robustness was calculated from the number of stress conditions conditions inducing a growth inhibition none observed cellular development divided by the overall number of tested conditions n 23 this index aims to compare the sensitivity of the strains to potential environmental stresses 2 5 2 assessment of the biodegradation kinetics the biodegradation kinetics of the 28 strains were compared in the sww medium to evaluate their respective response times first 2 7 ml of sww and 300 μl of the washed suspension od620nm 1 were added to the wells of an oxodish od24 microplate presens germany an ab 0558 adhesive pcr film thermo abgene france was applied on the microplates to limit atmospheric oxygen diffusion in the reaction medium measurements were performed with the sensordish reader presens precision sensing each minute at 30 c for 10 h in triplicate the kinetics values were calculated from the maximal slope of the measured oxygen consumption 2 6 environmental samples the environmental samples n 104 tables sd 2 had several origins including raw or treated waters from several wwtps in the nantes countryside france n 72 stormwaters from the bordeaux region france n 8 and treated waters collected from non collective treatment units autonomous sanitation system dedicated to the isolated private dwellings installed in the scientific and technical centre for building of nantes cstb france n 24 the sampling procedure used for this study follows the conditions described by the iso 5667 2 and iso 5667 3 standards the samples were collected in 250 ml disposable plastic bottles pe 030424 dustcher france that were previously washed with distilled water the samples were aliquoted into 2 ml tubes pp biopurtm safe locktm tubes eppendorf germany and stored at 20 c prior to use several parameters were measured to characterize the samples including the bod5 see 2 7 chemical oxygen demand nf t90 101 nf en 872 and toxicity iso 11348 iso 6341 and iso 20666 data shown in tables sd 2 2 7 bod5 measurement 2 7 1 reference method iso 5815 the reference analyses for bod5 were performed according to the standard method iso 5815 by the inovalys nantes lab nantes france which is certified by the french accreditation committee cofrac 2 7 2 method developed in this work the measurement protocol for the proposed bod5 test was carried out in 96 well microplates nunc f96 microwell 236108 according to the following ratio 35 μl of bacterial suspension at an od620nm 2 57 final od620nm in well 0 6 100 μl of sample and 15 μl of resazurin prestoblue invitrogen usa the microplate was incubated for 3 h at 30 c these test conditions incubation period cell density oxygen marker and used strains were determined during the optimization step of the experimental conditions see results in 3 1 and 3 2 subsequently the fluorescence signal relative to the biological activity of the strains was individually read with the tristar lb941 multimode microplate reader as described above see 2 4 1 all the samples see 2 6 were tested in duplicate and the collected values were exported to an overall database this data set was used to establish the correlation algorithm between the biological values provided by the bacterial set and the bod5 reference method iso 5815 2 8 data processing design of correlation models by a statistical approach the aim of the data processing was to design algorithms to correlate the biological data fluorescence values obtained from the selected strains with the bod5 reference values the final goal was to propose a mathematical model to predict the bod5 value from only the data provided by these strains all models were designed via a dedicated software neuro one 6 13 0 5 netral france 2 8 1 architecture of the model number of biological descriptors and nature of the model first the data were analysed using a mono parametric approach the information fluorescence values from each strain was individually correlated with the reference values by linear regression because the results were insufficient low correlation rates the data processing focused on a multi component strategy based on several strains which was also based on a linear regression algorithm this step allowed the determination of the number of biological descriptors selected strain required to assess the bod5 the predictive abilities of these models are limited to improve the performance of the models for the assessment of the bod5 non linear algorithms by neural networks were deployed these models are defined according to architectural characteristics such as the number of hidden neurons the activation modalities of the neurons and the data standardization conditions several architectures were compared for the overall database to identify a priori the most relevant algorithms 2 8 2 model validation the last data processing step consisted of comparing the preselected architectures based on their predictive abilities with new samples for this purpose the overall database was randomly separated into two groups a learning set n 148 assays and a validation set n 60 assays the learning set was used to design new algorithms based on the preselected architectures number of hidden neurons activation mode and data standardization to assess the robustness of these new models and choose the most relevant model the estimated bod5 values obtained from the validation set were compared to the reference values this step was also performed with neuro one 6 13 0 5 netral france 3 results and discussion 3 1 improvement of biological activity monitoring the reference method used to assess bod5 is based on oxygen consumption as a marker of the biodegradation activity this approach induces some technical constraints such as a measurement range that is limited by the saturation rate of oxygen in water cregut et al 2013 or the tightness of the system to air contaminant oxygen in this context resazurin appears to be a relevant marker for monitoring biological activity cregut et al 2013 this non toxic non fluorescent dye λabsorbance max 601 nm is reduced in the cell cytoplasm to a fluorescent compound resorufin λabsorbance max 571 nm λexcitation 535 560 nm λemission 590 615 nm see fig sd 2 by the enzymatic chain involved in cellular respiration cregut et al 2013 fai and grant 2009 o brien et al 2000 these two cell activity markers were compared during glucose biodegradation monitoring mm supplemented with glucose as the sole carbon source in e coli several glucose concentrations range from 0 1 to 500 mg l 1 were tested to determine the highest measurable concentration according to the marker used fig 2 a comparative analysis of these results showed that use of resazurin as a marker could assess the glucose concentration up to 495 mg l 1 versus only 125 mg l 1 with oxygen in light of these data the fluorescent dye was selected for continuation of the study subsequently we were interested in the effect of the cell density of e coli on the measurement duration with resazurin as cell activity marker fig 2b shows that an increase in the cell density substantially reduced the analysis duration a cell density of 0 1 od620nm resulted in a measurement duration of almost 12 h versus 2 h for an od620nm 1 the results also showed a reduction in the measurement range that was linked to the increasing cell density this trend can be explained by an increase in the signal to noise ratio see fig sd 3 an important noise fluorescence baseline measured with the high cell densities probably is induced by endogenous cellular respiration at the same time the saturation limit of the approach is reached at approximately 800 000 rfu consequently the maximal measurable concentrations should not exceed 500 mg l 1 for a cell density of 0 1 od620nm versus 170 mg l 1 for an od620nm 1 to comply with the approach expectations analysis limited in time but ensuring a relevant measurement range the better compromise seemed to be a cellular density of 0 6 corresponding to an analysis duration of approximately 3 h 3 2 selection of a representative set of strains the objective of this step was to constitute a set of controlled bacterial strains that were able to reliably assess the bod5 in a limited time and under reproducible conditions 3 2 1 pre selection of bacterial candidates the first step was dedicated to the preselection of bacterial strains that were likely to become a biological strain capable of assessing the bod5 a literature review identified the major phyla present in the activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants main targets of the proposed metrological approach isazadeh et al 2016 xia et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 more than 1200 operational taxonomic units otus were identified as potential candidates in activated sludge from wwtps several of these otus were directly rejected due to their strong pathogenicity i e campylobacteraceae helicobacteraceae xanthomonadales some burkholderiales some bacteriodetes etc or their unsuitable metabolism strictly anaerobic strains such as desulfobacterales and desulfovibrionales and marine strains such as alteromonadales which were incompatible with the intended use of the technology fig 3 among the selected families we focused on the identification of bacterial species that met the criteria of the approach the pre selected strains should preferably be isolated from activated sludge of wwtps should be largely represented in these environments should have wide and complementary a priori biodegradation abilities should not be pathogenic and should be available in the current strain banks i e dsmz or atcc in accordance with these five criteria 31 strains among more than 1200 identified otus were pre selected before a second characterization step based on their ease of use quick growth and ease of cultivation from the obtained results 3 strains were discarded complexity of culture or too low a growth rate which reduced the bacterial preselection to 28 strains see tables sd 1 the overall pre selection strategy is shown in fig 3 3 2 2 selection of a representative set of strains the simultaneous use of the 28 strains as individual descriptors of the bod5 was extremely technically complex and expensive consequently we needed to reduce the number of strains used in the bioassay first we focused on the biodegradation capabilities of the selected strains the biodegradation profile of each candidate was determined using 71 carbon sources see fig sd 1 and hierarchical clustering was performed according to their similarities agglomerative hierarchical clustering fig 4 eight clusters with comparable biodegradation capabilities were identified among the 28 preselected strains similar profiles at 95 for example group a which consisted of 6 strains a towneri b aquatica p pantrophus z resiniphila b vertrisii and b funiculus exhibited a modest range only 6 of molecules that were likely to be biodegraded among the 71 proposed carbon sources conversely group h offered a very wide set of biodegradation capabilities with ca 85 biodegraded molecules r radiobacter b subtilis staphylococcus sp s yanoikuyae and a aurescens in parallel all strains were characterized according to their robustness and biodegradation kinetics fig 5 these criteria were taken into account to select a representative among the bacterial groups with similar biodegradation profiles to limit the effect of the water toxicity on the metrological approach strains with strong robustness were preferred because of their inherent capabilities to resist environmental stresses indeed in the case of excessive water toxicity or too high sensitivity of strains the bacterial cells will be not able to provide reliable information inducing erroneous results however strains with high biodegradation kinetics were a priori more likely to provide a biological signal quickly consequently these strains were also preferred in view of the context of technological development of this study fig 5a reports the specific robustness of each strain these values were calculated based on 23 stress conditions and varied between 0 13 for b mycoides the most sensitive strain among the 28 tested and 1 for e coli fig 5b depicts the biodegradation kinetics of each strain for the synthetic wastewater sww from these data that were calculated from the maximal measured slope of oxygen consumption we noted significant differences between strains for example the biodegradation kinetics reached 0 33 mg bod l 1 h 1 for b vertrisii whereas the kinetics achieved by p putida dsm 1868 were approximately 12 mg bod l 1 h 1 consequently the second strain should a priori provide a faster biological signal as desired for our bioassay the final selection process of representative strains among each cluster was based on these last two criteria in addition to some criteria relative to the utilization of the strains such as the flocculation of cells during growth complexity of the preparation step for example group a consists of 6 strains b funiculus b vertrisii z resiniphila p pantrophus b aquatica and a towneri among these 6 strains b aquatica was selected to represent this group because of its capabilities highest robustness and fastest biodegradation kinetics finally among the 28 candidates a representative set of 8 strains was definitively selected consisting of b aquatica c testosteroni p putida dsm 1868 v paradoxus c pseudodiphteriticum p mirabilis e coli and b subtilis 3 3 bod5 assessment with the standard method and the bioassay the bod5 values of the 104 real samples collective or non collective sanitation or stormwater were determined according to the standard method iso 5815 see tables sd 2 as expected the samples taken before treatment by a wwtp showed significant pollution levels with an average bod5 of nearly 120 mg l 1 min 66 mg l 1 max 190 mg l 1 the levels measured in the treated waters varied strongly according to their origins collective or non collective sanitation the average bod5 of stormwater was approximately 40 mg l 1 min 12 mg l 1 max 54 mg l 1 this pollution is probably due to runoff of water on roads and roofs which transfers pollutants from support to water in parallel each sample was subjected to the selected strains to determine the corresponding biological activity fluorescence values obtained after 3 h of exposure for the 104 analysed samples in duplicate the final database consisted of 208 assays each sample is defined by 8 fluorescence values one per strain and a bod5 reference value obtained using the standard method the data analysis was performed from this database the main objective of this supplementary step was to propose a reliable correlation model that allowed prediction of the bod5 after only 3 h nevertheless we were focused on the number of strains required to assess the bod5 before improving the correlation algorithm a second time numerical model allowing calculation of the bod5 from fluorescence values provided by the selected strains 3 3 1 determination of the number of biological descriptors needed to assess the bod5 the data provided by each selected bacterial strain were individually correlated by linear regression with the bod5 reference values fig 6 the average correlation rate was approximately 0 11 with a standard deviation of 0 08 among the 8 selected strains the best correlation rate obtained with b aquatica r2 0 2638 was too low to be used as a reliable bio indicator of the bod5 nevertheless each strain provided a portion of the overall information consequently increasing the number of strains used to assess the bod5 should improve the relevance of the approach however the number of strains required to ensure a reliable measurement is unknown correlation models linear regression were designed based on the use of 1 8 strains the obtained models are presented on fig 7 the correlation rate between the predicted calculated from fluorescence data provided by the selected strains and reference values standard method tended to increase with the number of strains used indeed the average rate obtained from a single strain was approximately 0 11 whereas this rate reached approximately 0 6 when the 8 strains were used increasing the number of strains used to assess the bod5 was associated with a significant increase in the correlation rate of the models however the predictive capabilities of the best model based on the 8 strains was not sufficient r2 0 58 in view of these results a second step was required to improve the predictive capabilities of the data analysis model 3 3 2 improvement of the correlation model to overcome this limitation and to propose a more reliable method for the assessment of the bod5 the regression linear algorithms were compared to a neural network approach the neural network is a framework for many different machine learning algorithms that can process complex data consequently an exploratory step was performed to screen the architectures with the most potential several architectures were compared with the dedicated neuro one software version 6 13 0 5 netral france the differences between the tested architectures were based on the number of hidden neurons the activation mode and the data standardization more than 800 models 80 architectures and 10 models by architecture obtained by iterations were generated see tables sd 3 by supervised learning from the overall database the correlation rate obtained between the predicted and reference bod5 values varied from 0 36 below the model based on linear regression 0 58 to 0 93 among the 80 tested architectures several architectures had relevant predictive capacities with correlation rates superior to 0 8 the best model r2 0 93 was based on an orthonormalization gram schmidt process of inputs 4 hidden neurons activated by a hyperbolic tangent algorithm and post treatment of the outputs these models are iteratively designed from existing data i e they modify the different variables that control the variables during the learning process according to the data taken into account consequently over learning is a significant risk which leads to questions about the relevance and the robustness of the predicted bod5 values obtained from new data to remove this uncertainty new models were designed using a fraction of the overall database 3 3 3 model validation the global database was randomly separated into two sets the learning n 148 and the validation n 60 sets see 2 8 2 the learning set was used to design models with the 10 best a priori architectures determined during the previous step see tables sd 3 conditions overlined in grey ten models were generated based on the architecture the robustness of these models was compared from unused data in the validation set based on the correlation rate between the predicted and reference values among the 100 models the most relevant was able to estimate the bod5 of the validation samples data not included during the learning process with strong reliability r2 0 851 fig 8 this model consists of a hidden layer of three neurons activated by a hyperbolic tangent function the input and output data are standardized with respect to a centred reduced normal distribution from a global perspective the bod5 values calculated from the bacterial set are relatively consistent with the reference values the model seems to be particularly reliable between 25 and 300 mg l 1 bod5 according to the reference method for wastewaters collective or non collective sanitation nevertheless its performance decreases for samples with low biodegradable organic loads inferior to 25 mg l 1 according to the reference method and for stormwaters two hypotheses can explain this result i the current model is not sufficiently accurate to predict low bod5 values a specific model must be designed to analyse specifically these low values and or ii an organic composition of stormwater different from that of wastewaters organic compounds collected during water runoff on roads or roofs induces specific findings from the bacterial descriptors similar results were obtained by raud and kikas 2013 their strategy was based on a microbial set consisting of 7 bacterial strains selected from their intrinsic biodegradation properties the processing of multivariate data was performed using a pls algorithm the validation was only performed on artificial samples synthetic wastewater spiked with phenol milk fat or cellulose and not on real wastewater samples nevertheless the correlation rate between the calculated and reference values was close to 1 r2 0 85 in our study opposition to real samples seems to decrease the correlation rate calculated values versus reference values because mimicking a real sample with synthetic effluents is difficult the reference values own an inherent variability close to 20 jouanneau et al 2014 notably due to the environmental variability of used inoculum conversely the mean variability of data provided by the selected strains is 6 62 results not showed during the learning process the model adjusts the model variables to match the data provided by the bacterial set with the reference data integrating at the same time its inherent variability 20 to improve prediction reliability it is required to know the true reference value for this it would be necessary to carry out several reference analysis by samples to determinate these true values statistical analysis in order to design new predictive models 3 3 4 post analysis in accordance with the selected architecture a post analysis was performed to demonstrate the relevance of the use of several strains as bio indicators associated with data processing by the neural network fig 9 shows the average correlation rates linear least squares method and the associated standard deviations depending on the number of strains used and according to the models used linear regression or neural network the results show a significant improvement in the reliability of the provided bod5 values compared with those obtained with the linear regression models with this post analysis we demonstrated firstly that the number of biological descriptors was a crucial factor in the development of a method to assess the biodegradable organic load the use of a single bio indicator seems to significantly limit the measurement performance of the strategy the review of jouanneau et al 2014 tended to reinforce this observation indeed among the many cited publications strategies based on a unique biological descriptor show lower abilities to assess the bod5 in real samples see fig sd 4 and wider variability between studies from the publications cited in this review the average correlation rate was close to 0 81 sd 0 24 with a unique biological descriptor r2 min 0 09 r2 max 1 versus 0 95 sd 0 07 with a consortium r2 min 0 81 r2 max 1 strategies based on consortium related systems use microbial mixtures from natural or artificial origins in most cases these strategies are in agreement the protocol described in the reference method iso 5815 but induce wide inherent variability due to the descriptors used 4 conclusion in this work we proposed an overall strategy to assess the bod5 from the selection of bacterial indicators to the validation of real wastewater samples by acting on some levers such as the measurement conditions or the selection of 8 bacterial bio indicators we developed a bioassay that allowed reliable and accurate bod5 measurement and required only 3 h versus 5 days for the reference method the measurement range being enlarged no dilution is required to assess bod5 in most wastewater contrary to the reference method limited to 6 mg l bod the obtained results are very encouraging and show a strong correlation with the reference bod5 values r2 0 85 nevertheless the method seems to reach its limits regarding to the assessing of low bod5 levels inferior to 25 mg l 1 according to the reference method further work will have to be carried out to improve the model in these cases this significant technological improvement should increase the monitoring level of wastewaters indeed by reducing the analysis duration it is easier to control the process of water treatment and if necessary to adjust some parameters such as the oxygen intake or the water flow due to the time scale that is consistent with the treatment duration 2 3 days in wwtps this metrological strategy was filed with the

18479,this study investigated formation and genotoxicities of disinfection by products dbps during chlorination of hydrophobic organic compounds hocs extracted from six drinking water reservoirs around the pearl river delta region china chemical analyses firstly showed that after chlorination aromatic hocs including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs decreased but dbps including chlorinated pahs increased while genotoxicity assays revealed that the chlorination increased dna damage in human caco 2 cells although the link between dbps and the genotoxicity was weak insignificant correlations p 0 05 we observed that chlorination of hocs from more contaminated reservoirs in general resulted in higher genotoxicity secondly remedial effects of catalase and dietary antioxidants i e vitamin c and epigallocatechin gallate in protecting cells against dbps genotoxicity were detected after 1 h treatment by the antioxidants the dna damage in caco 2 cells due to previous exposure to dbps significantly decreased p 0 05 in 7 out of a total of 18 treatments 38 9 this is the first study demonstrating that catalase vitamin c and epigallocatechin gallate protected human cells in vitro against dna damage upon exposure to chlorinated genotoxic dbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrophobic organic pollutants disinfection by products caco 2 cells dna damage dietary antioxidants 1 introduction hydrophobic organic compounds hocs are ubiquitous in aquatic environment it is reported that 38 61 of dissolved organic carbon in surface water was hydrophobic nikolaou and lekkas 2001 hua et al 2015 while high amount of hocs was detected in raw water entering water treatment plant hawker et al 2011 hocs tend to deposit and accumulate in particulate matter rügner et al 2019 that more retention time is usually needed to allow them settled down to the bottom however this approach becomes less effective in the future e g in hong kong and the pearl river delta region because extreme weathers caused by global climate change may lead to a rise in sediment flux due to heavy rainfalls and intense typhoons lu et al 2018 fan 2011 moreover nano sized fine particles 100 nm are in increasingly widespread use but they are less easily deposited to bottom sediments and more easily penetrate filters during water treatment oberdörster et al 2006 as a consequence hocs carried by the particles could be transported to water treatment and exposed to disinfection because hocs are rich in aromatic carbon phenolic structures and conjugated double bonds reckhow et al 1990 matilainen and sillanpää 2010 hong et al 2013 most hocs can be removed in coagulation and sedimentation process however water treatment plants often use pre chlorination measures before coagulation in order to improve the coagulation efficiency in this process hocs may react extensively with chlorine causing variable transformations such as oxidation and halogenations niu et al 2017 chu et al 2011 and eventually result in formation of variable disinfection by products dbps with enhanced shi et al 2009 wang et al 2011 or reduced egito et al 2007 toxicities dbps have been shown to causally link with urinary bladder cancer michaud et al 2007 du et al 2013 regli et al 2015 li and mitch 2018 therefore it is of practical significance to understand the changes of dbps and genotoxicity during chlorination of hocs which will be useful for better management and control of dbps for aquatic hocs most of them are from natural sources such as humic substances i e humic and fulvic acids that mainly originated from allochthonous plant and autochthonous algae wetzel 2001 nguyen et al 2005 only a small fraction of hocs are from anthropogenic sources such as persistence organic pollutants pops which usually include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls organochlorine pesticides and dioxin related compounds especially pahs they are highly toxic widely detected in surface water sediment and drinking water treatment and usually occurred in higher concentration as compared to the other pops zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 2018 pintado herrera et al 2017 many studies have shown that natural source hocs humic fulvic acid hydrophobic organic matter from algae and plant leaves etc are potent precursor for the formation of toxic dbps such as trihalomethane haloacetic acids haloketone and haloacetinitriles reckhow et al 1990 nikolaou et al 2004 abouleish and wells 2015 sun et al 2018 our previous study also showed hydrophobic algal protein served as potent precursors of genotoxicants during chlorination lui et al 2011 in contrast information on chlorination of anthropogenic hocs is very limited only a few studies showed that pahs could be transformed into chlorinated pahs cl pahs upon chlorination and some of which are more genotoxic than the parent pahs xu et al 2018 chao et al 2018 richardson et al reviewed that although chemical analysis has identified about 600 dbps the amount of uncharacterized organics suggests that 50 of the total organic halide remaining to be identified hockaday et al 2009 richardson et al 2007 liviac et al 2011 therefore one focus of this study was to identify formation patterns of dbps and genotoxicity after chlorination of hocs extracted from local drinking water reservoirs due to the fact that hocs in local drinking water reservoirs contained pahs liang et al 2008a 2008b and effect of chlorination as well as the associated toxicities have remained unknown following an understanding of dbps genotoxicity derived from chlorinating hocs the other focus of this study was to investigate effects of dietary antioxidants against dbps genotoxicity it was hoped that consumption of antioxidant containing foods or drinks might help protecting human cells from exposure to dbps in fact catalase has been shown to be effective in reducing dna damage induced by iodoacetic acid cemeli et al 2006 but effect of dietary antioxidants e g vitamin c vc and epigallocatechin gallate egcg against dbps toxicity have remained unknown for example vc is one of the most studied and powerful dietary antioxidant in directly scavenging reactive oxygen species ros and donating electrons in various enzymatic and non enzymatic reactions and therefore can reduce ros induced toxicity noctor and foyer 2002 vc can also reduce amount of aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr in inducing cyp1a1 gene so that genotoxic metabolites could be reduced chang et al 2009 in particular vc was found to inhibit tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin tcdd induced ecto atpase activity which is required for ahr translocation to the nucleus chang et al 2009 egcg performs its function similar to vc particularly that low dose of h2o2 in cells could be generated upon exposure to these antioxidants and thus served as pro oxidant to increase cell resistance against high dose oxidative stress in short period of incubation elbling et al 2010 therefore it was expected that vc and egcg might exert protective effects if dbps caused oxidative dna damage or ahr mediated genotoxicity in cells considering that sediment organic matter including hocs is the sink for the organic matter in surface water and the content of hocs in sediments is much higher than in surface water sediments was used to extract hocs in this study we collected sediment samples from drinking water reservoirs along a river in the pearl river delta region china from upstream low human activity to downstream high human activity hong et al 2008 2010 liang et al 2008a 2008b after characterizing basic sediment contamination hocs were extracted and subjected to chlorination and chemistry and genotoxicity of hocs before after the chlorination were examined lastly role of vc and egcg in protecting against genotoxicity was determined for the first time we utilized human colon carcinoma cell line caco 2 to test dna damage via single cell gel electrophoresis assay comet assay this cell line was rather relevant because the gastrointestinal tract presents the first and direct target of dbp exposure and was more metabolically competent possessing both the p 450 enzymes and phase ii enzymes similar to those observed in vivo metabolism studies sambuy et al 2005 meanwhile the sos chromotest a quantitative colorimetric assay for genotoxins at the microbial level was also conducted as a comparison janion 2001 overall our objectives were 1 to investigate effects of chlorination on genotoxicity of hocs 2 to examine link between the genotoxicity and contamination level of the drinking water reservoirs and 3 to identify effects of catalase vc and egcg on protecting cells against genotoxicity upon exposure to dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment sampling six drinking water reservoirs around the pearl river delta region china were selected for surface sediment sampling xfj reservoir xfjr

cell line was obtained from the american type culture collection atcc rockville md the cells were cultured in dulbecco modified eagle s medium dmem supplemented with 20 fetal bovine serum fbs in a humidified atmosphere of 95 air and 5 co2 at 37 c the medium was changed every 3 days and the cells were sub cultured every 7 days when 95 of the cells confluenced oxiselect comet assay kit cell biolabs inc was used for comet assays procedures mainly followed the product manual with some modifications according to fairbairn et al 1995 and klaude et al 1996 cell viability was determined via observing color change of 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide mtt only cells with viability of more than 80 were used for toxicity tests the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs without mg2 and ca2 and treated with different samples sediment hocs cl ws and cl hocs cells treated simply with dmem medium were used as the control in particular sediment hocs and cl hocs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso final concentration 0 5 v v respectively before added into the medium dmso solution 0 5 was also used as solvent control for hocs and cl hocs for testing cl ws the dmem powder was dissolved directly into the respective cl ws solutions followed by filtration through 0 22 μm acetate cellulose membrane before incubation with the cells milli q water prepared dmem medium was used as the control for comparison the cell culture media contain 5 g sediment in 100 ml solution was used as 100 treated media for hocs cl ws and cl hocs respectively after treatment for 1 h at 37 c with 5 co2 the cells were collected and washed once with ice cold pbs and suspended in 100 μl ice cold pbs the cells then were mixed with low melting point agarose 37 c 1 10 briefly and spread on slide 4 c avoid light until solidification the cells were lysed in lysis buffer for 1 h and then in alkaline buffer for 30 min 4 c avoid light followed by being washed with ice cold tris borate edta tbe buffer twice electrophoresis was performed at 4 c 1 v cm 1 for 15 min in tbe afterwards the slides were neutralized using pre chilled di water dehydrated with 70 ethanol and stained using vista green dna dye for 15 min the cells were measured for their comet tail moment tm olive tail moment per cell using a fluorescence microscope with a ccd camera to indicate dna damage in the treated cells the tail moment tm was an index of dna damage calculated by the migrated dna density multiplied by the migration distance of the nuclei the digitalized data were transferred to a computer for subsequent statistical analysis liviac et al 2010 about 50 cells per treatment were randomly measured of tm per cell and the experiment was repeated three times using three different generations of cells respectively hence the average tm value per cell of each treatment was derived from the mean value among 150 cells additionally the dmem medium for culturing caco 2 cells was used as the negative control after 10 batches of preliminary test we identified that cl ws of szr demonstrated repeatable and comparable positive response we therefore used the same prepared cl ws sample of szr throughout the whole experiment as the internal quality control sample i e positive control sample 2 7 sos chromotest sos chromotest was performed without metabolic activation using sos chromo test kit and e coli pq37 strain supplied by ebpi brampton ontario canada which was then modified according to quillardet and hofnung 1985 and mersch sundermann et al 1991 briefly an overnight culture of bacterial suspension was appropriately diluted using 10 dmso saline six concentration levels of each sample were also prepared using 10 dmso saline a 10 μl sample and 100 μl of bacteria suspension were transferred into 96 well microplate and exposed 2 h at 37 c β galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase activities were then determined by using 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d galactoside x gal mym biological technology co ltd and p nitrophenyl phosphate pnpp mym biological technology co ltd disodium substrates respectively 4 nitro quinoline 1 oxide was used as the positive control the ratio of β galactosidase alkaline phosphatase activities divided by the values of control samples was calculated as the induction factor the induction factor increased with sample concentration and sos inducing potency sosip was calculated as the slope of the linear region 2 8 treatment by antioxidants catalase sigma vc sigma and egcg wako were added into caco 2 cell cultures respectively to investigate effect of antioxidants in protecting cells from dna damage the experiment was conducted using cl ws of the 6 reservoirs via comet assay and sos chromotest mtt test was firstly conducted for preliminary determination of antioxidant dose after 24 h incubation vc 25 5000 μm showed less than 10 cell death at concentrations below 500 μm fig s1 while egcg 10 350 μm fig s1 and catalase 500 u ml 1 and 1000 u ml 1 were not cytotoxic therefore in the experiment 500 u ml 1 catalase 500 μm vc and 90 μm egcg were mixed with cl ws respectively in comet assay mixtures of antioxidants and cl ws were used as diluents of dmem media for the treatments caco 2 cells were exposed to the dmem media containing variable mixtures of antioxidants and cl ws for 1 h with dmem media containing simply cl ws being used as the control effect of incubation time influencing function of the antioxidants was also investigated by using cl ws of hir three incubation time periods 0 5 h 1 h and 1 5 h were sampled for the observation for the sos chromotest antioxidants were dissolved in 0 85 nacl as stock solutions freshly prepared respectively stock solutions were diluted into the wells immediately after 10 μl samples and 100 μl bacteria suspension 2 9 data analysis one way anova correlation and regression analyses were conducted using spss 16 0 statistic package for social science software program for windows spss inc 3 results and discussions this study adopted the comet assay as a rapid sensitive and uncomplicated method for detecting dna damage at the level of the individual eukaryotic cell fairbairn et al 1995 for pahs in environmental complex mixtures conflicting dna damage in cells were reported previously for example pahs in soil extracts induced irreparable dna damage in hepg 2 cells niziolek kierecka et al 2012 children living in the surroundings of petrochemical industrial areas are exposed to high pah levels contributed to dna damage sánchez guerra et al 2012 the highest dna damage in blood cells of flounder paralichthys olivaceus was found in the sediments showing the highest pahs contamination woo et al 2006 however complex mixtures may also modify the carcinogenic potency of pahs by shifting the metabolic activation pathway from the production of pah diol epoxides to akr pathway derived metabolites courter et al 2007 non genotoxic substances in extractable organic matter eom from airborne particles showed to inhibit the formation of benzo a pyrene induced dna adducts and thereby reduced the genotoxicity of pahs in the eom líbalová et al 2014 although caco 2 as a common human cell line for in vitro testing is less competent for intestinal oxidative metabolism study sambuy et al 2005 the metabolic rates of pahs in caco 2 were only half of those in hepg2 cells with the production of different metabolites audebert et al 2010 as a preliminary test we only examined differential gene expression of cyp1a1 and cyp1b1 genes in caco 2 cells upon exposure without addition of s9 to pure medium control medium prepared using szr and cl ws of szr using quantitative real time rt pcr qrt pcr the result showed that both szr and cl ws of szr significantly increased the gene expression levels 4 6 9 5 fold unpublished data this partially verified the metabolic capability of caco 2 cells and meanwhile supported our hypothesis that szr and chlorinated szr were genotoxic we therefore deduced that the genotoxicity might be able to be measured by the comet assay therefore we did not add s9 in the exposure of caco 2 cells among the treatments in the present study nevertheless if s9 is added in the exposure study the more sensitive response could allow us to gain a better insight of the chlorination to some extent this suggested that the lack of s9 in the genotoxicity experiments probably greatly lowered the sensitivity of the test relevant study should be conducted in the future overall through chemical analysis we verified the contamination gradient from xfjr to szr upon chlorination aromatic hocs were reduced while dbps were elevated chlorination also significantly increased dna damage in human caco 2 cells lastly protective effects of catalase and dietary antioxidants i e vc and egcg in cells against dbps genotoxicity were observed 3 1 basic property of sediments basic property of sediments was compared among the six reservoirs table 1 for nutrients and organic matter levels in the sediments xfjr and hir had the least tc 1 22 tn 0 68 g kg 1 tp 0 35 g kg 1 and tom 9 32 respectively in contrast pcr xlr and syr separately had the most tc 3 89 tn 1 46 g kg 1 tp 1 70 g kg 1 tom 15 59 while szr tc 1 26 tn 0 88 g kg 1 tp 1 24 g kg 1 tom 10 58 was intermediately contaminated these results are consistent with our previous observation from xfjr and hir sites liang et al 2008a which are subjected to the least impact from human activities while pcr and syr sites had the higher human impacts although szr is located in a region highly exposed to human activities it also has an enhanced biological treatment bio nitrification of the water within the reservoir therefore it was not unexpected to contain less nutrients and organic matter 3 2 chemical characterization of hocs pahs distribution in 6 reservoirs shared some common traits fig s2 16 pahs species were all detected in 6 reservoirs among which phenanthrene 16 1 26 5 of total pahs and fluoranthene 14 5 20 3 of total pahs were two species with highest concentration while dibenz a h anthracene 0 6 1 1 of t pahs and acenaphthylene 0 6 1 5 of total pahs were two species with the lowest levels yet in terms of total pahs table 1 their distribution in 6 reservoirs were quite different szr pcr and syr had the highest level exceeding 200 0 μg kg 1 followed by xlr which was 152 5 μg kg 1 and xfjr and hir had the lowest 64 3 93 6 μg kg 1 this pattern was also consistent with human activity related to these reservoirs see section 2 1 to further illustrate the total pah content we calculated the ratio of total pahs to tc table 1 the results showed that szr had much higher ratio values 22 9 μg g 1 than the other 5 reservoirs 5 1 9 4 μg g 1 this clearly indicates that the bio treatment in szr more effectively removed nutrients and organic contamination but not the less biodegradable micro pollutants such as pahs in addition uv254 values of sediment hocs in the 6 reservoirs were shown in fig s3 pcr contained the highest level of uv254 1 67 cm 1 followed by szr 0 96 cm 1 and other reservoirs had the lowest 0 71 0 90 cm 1 3 3 decomposition of hocs and formation of dbps during chlorination chlorination removed 16 6 63 6 of total pahs in hocs but substantially increased pahs with 2 3 4 rings while decreased those with 5 6 rings fig 1 a b fig s2 with the differences ranging between 1 6 and 16 6 fig 1a this suggests that pahs were transformed during chlorination and ring cleavage occurred in high ring containing pahs leading to the formation of low ring containing pahs zani et al 2005 horii et al 2008 the observation in the reduction of uv254 after chlorination also supported that aromatic compounds were degraded in the process fig s3 however the reduction in uv254 49 8 91 4 was much higher than that of pahs 16 6 63 6 fig 1b this suggests that non pahs aromatics such as humic substances are more susceptible to chlorination than pahs aromatics uv254 were less inclined to be removed from xfjr to syr but the reduction in pahs generally showed an opposite pattern except for syr fig 1b and c it implies that pahs had more chance to react with free chlorine and be transformed if lower percentage of the other aromatics non pahs were present in this study all of the targeted halogenated pahs compounds were detected in cl hocs fig 2 and highest level of cl3 phe were observed in szr we also observed that for syr the hydrophobic aromatics including both pahs and non pahs were more recalcitrant or less easily be removed by chlorine fig 1 b c but halogenation into cl phe and cl2 phe was the highest in cl hocs fig 2 among the 6 reservoirs considering the high organic matter contents tc 2 50 tom 15 59 in the sediments of syr table 1 a presence of non aromatic hydrophobic substances probably attributed to quenching chlorine and therefore a low reduction in the aromatics fig 1b and a trend to form less halogenated pahs such as cl phe and cl2 phe regular dbps including chcl3 82 5 108 2 μg kg dcan 5 3 88 4 μg kg and tcp 36 1 293 0 μg kg increased after chlorination fig 2 however dcaa and tcaa were only detected in one reservoir syr while tcan were not detectable in all the reservoirs fig 2 moreover no significant p 0 05 relationship was found between dbps formation chcl3 dcaa tcaa dcan tcan and tcp and uv254 level this was not consistent with previous studies that uv254 was a good indicator for the formation of these dbps which used hocs humic fulvic acid or whole organic matter in surface water in studying dbps formation reckhow et al 1990 hua et al 2015 hong et al 2016 lin et al 2018 this suggested that the aromatic hocs in these reservoirs differed greatly in terms of chlorine reactivity and dbps formation among the 6 reservoirs the yields of dcan and tcp were the highest in szr in spite that its uv254 and tom were only in a moderate level table 1 fig s3 suggesting that organic matter in szr was more potent precursor for dcan and tcp as compared to other reservoirs 3 4 genotoxicity change upon chlorination dna damage in caco 2 cells after treatment by sediment hocs 0 0018 0 0035 cl ws 0 0023 0 5320 and cl hocs 0 0025 0 2501 was presented in fig 3 these results showed no significant difference in the genotoxicity p 0 05 of sediment hocs among the six reservoirs although they contained remarkably different levels of pahs and uv254 table 1 figs s2 and s3 conversely despite the substantial decrease in pahs uv254 occurred following chlorination fig 1 fig s2 figs s3 and a significant increase in genotoxicity p 0 05 was detected except for xfjr fig 3 genotoxic effects via sos chromotest corroborated the results of dna damage in caco 2 cells fig s4a and a close correlation between the two responses was observed p 0 002 fig s4b the result indicated that the detected dbps such as dcaa tcaa dcan tcp as well as the chlorinated pahs may contribute to the increased genotoxicity le curieux et al 1994 muellner et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 chao et al 2018 and demonstrating that pahs were not the major contributor to the genotoxicity in cl hocs because the high molecular weight pahs major genotoxic components in pahs greatly reduced after chlorination fig s2 similarly uv254 also appeared not to be a good indicator predictor of the genotoxicity genotoxicity in the chlorinated solutions cl ws and cl hocs increased along the contamination gradient from less contaminated xfjr to highly contaminated syr fig 3 for example dna damage for the cl ws significantly p 0 0447 correlated with pattern in variation of tom in the sediments fig s5a and that for the cl hocs significantly p 0 0021 correlated with pahs in the sediments fig s5b the results demonstrated that 1 not all genotoxicants in the chlorinated solutions were hydrophobic chlorinated hydrophilic compounds substantially contributed to the genotoxicity and not both cl ws and cl hocs toxicity were correlated with tom in the sediments fig s5 and 2 level of pahs served as a good predictor of genotoxicity in the cl hocs figs s5b and c though pahs were not the greatest contributor to the genotoxicity this inferred that other persistent organic contaminants e g dioxins having similar contamination route and partitions in the aquatic environments as those of pahs accounted for the genotoxicity it can also be possible that pahs together with other hydrophobic aromatics served as genotoxic precursors of dbps while non aromatic compounds notably in syr were important precursors of genotoxic dbps chemical additive or synergistic effects in the chlorinated solutions possibly should also be taken into consideration since toxicity of the low molecular weight cl pahs generally increased with the increasing number of chlorine substitution egito et al 2007 the high dna damage observed in szr pcr and syr fig 3 was likely attributed to the high cl pahs in the chlorinated samples yet our experiments showed that dna damage in caco 2 tested against the maximum level of each individual dbps detected in the cl hocs chcl3 0 54 μg l 1 dcan 0 44 μg l 1 tcp 1 47 μg l 1 and cl phe 0 02 μg l 1 was insignificant average comet tail moment 0 00014 0 00022 compared with the control average comet tail moment 0 00018 therefore role of other cl pahs or key dbps responsible for the genotoxicity and the associated mechanisms remained to be identified and investigated in the future 3 5 effects of antioxidants against genotoxicity after 1 h treatment antioxidants did not significantly increase dna damage in caco 2 cells while the genotoxicity in cl ws decreased significantly p 0 05 in 7 out of the total of 18 treatments 38 9 fig 4 a c among 6 reservoirs the genotoxic cl ws of syr and pcr were the most prominently affected with average reduction of dna damage ranging between 63 7 and 88 9 egcg was the most effective among the three antioxidants that 4 out of 6 treatments for xfjr szr pcr and syr showed significant reduction 74 6 99 8 fig 4b effect of the antioxidants in reducing genotoxic response in sos sosip was similar as that in dna damage fig s6 but significant reduction p 0 05 occurred in catalase and egcg treated cl ws samples of szr and pcr respectively moreover exposure time of the antioxidants against genotoxicity was found to be a key parameter in designing the toxicity tests fig 5 a significant finding from our results reported here when the cl ws from hir was incubated with the three antioxidants respectively dna damage in caco 2 generally increased with time in both the control and treatments but the difference between the control and treatments became more remarkable and significantly lower dna damage p 0 05 was observed in antioxidants treatments at 1 5 h previously cemeli et al reported that catalase reduced iodoacetic acid one of drinking water dbps induced dna damage in chinese hamster ovary cho cells in vitro by 42 cemeli et al 2006 demonstrating that oxidative stress contributed to the genotoxicity our present result with catalase was in agreement with this hypothesis that dna damage from exposure to dbps partially resulted from oxidative stress more importantly this study for the first time demonstrated that dietary antioxidants i e vc and egcg protected human cells in vitro against dna damage from exposure to chlorinated solutions or dbps figs 4 and 5 s6 it suggested that vc or egcg may generate a low dose of h2o2 in cells within short period of incubation and thus serve as pro oxidant to increase resistance in cells against high dose oxidative stress afterwards noctor and foyer 2002 rivière et al 2006 on the other hand vc may play an important role in reducing ahr level chang et al 2009 which lead to the inhibition of cytochrome p450 1a1 gene cyp1a1 expression finally the exposure toxicity of dioxin like compounds such as pahs or cl pahs may be reduced 4 conclusion this study for the first time examined genotoxicity of chlorinated hocs derived from drinking water reservoirs and effects of dietary antioxidants in protecting cells against the genotoxicity overall chlorination changed the chemistry and genotoxicity of hocs while the contamination level of the reservoirs influenced the effects of the chlorination non pahs aromatics such as humic substances were less resistant to chlorination than pahs suggesting that the presence of humic substances might serve as diluents in shielding pahs or other micro pollutants from being attacked by chlorine genotoxicity significantly increased coupled by a remarkable decrease in pahs level after chlorination demonstrating that pahs were not the major genotoxicants in the chlorinated solutions although genotoxicity of the chlorinated solutions closely correlated with pahs contamination level in the reservoirs the pah level simply served as a good predictor of the genotoxicity and key genotixic dbps remained to be identified in the future it can also be concluded that not all genotoxicants in the chlorinated solutions were hydrophobic chlorinated hydrophilic compounds substantially contributed to the genotoxicity given that not both cl ws and cl hocs correlated with tom in the sediments lastly this study for the first time demonstrated that catalase and dietary antioxidants i e vc and egcg protected human cells in vitro against dna damage from exposure to chlorinated solutions or dbps and exposure time of the antioxidants against genotoxicity was a key parameter in designing the

18479,this study investigated formation and genotoxicities of disinfection by products dbps during chlorination of hydrophobic organic compounds hocs extracted from six drinking water reservoirs around the pearl river delta region china chemical analyses firstly showed that after chlorination aromatic hocs including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs decreased but dbps including chlorinated pahs increased while genotoxicity assays revealed that the chlorination increased dna damage in human caco 2 cells although the link between dbps and the genotoxicity was weak insignificant correlations p 0 05 we observed that chlorination of hocs from more contaminated reservoirs in general resulted in higher genotoxicity secondly remedial effects of catalase and dietary antioxidants i e vitamin c and epigallocatechin gallate in protecting cells against dbps genotoxicity were detected after 1 h treatment by the antioxidants the dna damage in caco 2 cells due to previous exposure to dbps significantly decreased p 0 05 in 7 out of a total of 18 treatments 38 9 this is the first study demonstrating that catalase vitamin c and epigallocatechin gallate protected human cells in vitro against dna damage upon exposure to chlorinated genotoxic dbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrophobic organic pollutants disinfection by products caco 2 cells dna damage dietary antioxidants 1 introduction hydrophobic organic compounds hocs are ubiquitous in aquatic environment it is reported that 38 61 of dissolved organic carbon in surface water was hydrophobic nikolaou and lekkas 2001 hua et al 2015 while high amount of hocs was detected in raw water entering water treatment plant hawker et al 2011 hocs tend to deposit and accumulate in particulate matter rügner et al 2019 that more retention time is usually needed to allow them settled down to the bottom however this approach becomes less effective in the future e g in hong kong and the pearl river delta region because extreme weathers caused by global climate change may lead to a rise in sediment flux due to heavy rainfalls and intense typhoons lu et al 2018 fan 2011 moreover nano sized fine particles 100 nm are in increasingly widespread use but they are less easily deposited to bottom sediments and more easily penetrate filters during water treatment oberdörster et al 2006 as a consequence hocs carried by the particles could be transported to water treatment and exposed to disinfection because hocs are rich in aromatic carbon phenolic structures and conjugated double bonds reckhow et al 1990 matilainen and sillanpää 2010 hong et al 2013 most hocs can be removed in coagulation and sedimentation process however water treatment plants often use pre chlorination measures before coagulation in order to improve the coagulation efficiency in this process hocs may react extensively with chlorine causing variable transformations such as oxidation and halogenations niu et al 2017 chu et al 2011 and eventually result in formation of variable disinfection by products dbps with enhanced shi et al 2009 wang et al 2011 or reduced egito et al 2007 toxicities dbps have been shown to causally link with urinary bladder cancer michaud et al 2007 du et al 2013 regli et al 2015 li and mitch 2018 therefore it is of practical significance to understand the changes of dbps and genotoxicity during chlorination of hocs which will be useful for better management and control of dbps for aquatic hocs most of them are from natural sources such as humic substances i e humic and fulvic acids that mainly originated from allochthonous plant and autochthonous algae wetzel 2001 nguyen et al 2005 only a small fraction of hocs are from anthropogenic sources such as persistence organic pollutants pops which usually include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls organochlorine pesticides and dioxin related compounds especially pahs they are highly toxic widely detected in surface water sediment and drinking water treatment and usually occurred in higher concentration as compared to the other pops zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 2018 pintado herrera et al 2017 many studies have shown that natural source hocs humic fulvic acid hydrophobic organic matter from algae and plant leaves etc are potent precursor for the formation of toxic dbps such as trihalomethane haloacetic acids haloketone and haloacetinitriles reckhow et al 1990 nikolaou et al 2004 abouleish and wells 2015 sun et al 2018 our previous study also showed hydrophobic algal protein served as potent precursors of genotoxicants during chlorination lui et al 2011 in contrast information on chlorination of anthropogenic hocs is very limited only a few studies showed that pahs could be transformed into chlorinated pahs cl pahs upon chlorination and some of which are more genotoxic than the parent pahs xu et al 2018 chao et al 2018 richardson et al reviewed that although chemical analysis has identified about 600 dbps the amount of uncharacterized organics suggests that 50 of the total organic halide remaining to be identified hockaday et al 2009 richardson et al 2007 liviac et al 2011 therefore one focus of this study was to identify formation patterns of dbps and genotoxicity after chlorination of hocs extracted from local drinking water reservoirs due to the fact that hocs in local drinking water reservoirs contained pahs liang et al 2008a 2008b and effect of chlorination as well as the associated toxicities have remained unknown following an understanding of dbps genotoxicity derived from chlorinating hocs the other focus of this study was to investigate effects of dietary antioxidants against dbps genotoxicity it was hoped that consumption of antioxidant containing foods or drinks might help protecting human cells from exposure to dbps in fact catalase has been shown to be effective in reducing dna damage induced by iodoacetic acid cemeli et al 2006 but effect of dietary antioxidants e g vitamin c vc and epigallocatechin gallate egcg against dbps toxicity have remained unknown for example vc is one of the most studied and powerful dietary antioxidant in directly scavenging reactive oxygen species ros and donating electrons in various enzymatic and non enzymatic reactions and therefore can reduce ros induced toxicity noctor and foyer 2002 vc can also reduce amount of aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr in inducing cyp1a1 gene so that genotoxic metabolites could be reduced chang et al 2009 in particular vc was found to inhibit tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin tcdd induced ecto atpase activity which is required for ahr translocation to the nucleus chang et al 2009 egcg performs its function similar to vc particularly that low dose of h2o2 in cells could be generated upon exposure to these antioxidants and thus served as pro oxidant to increase cell resistance against high dose oxidative stress in short period of incubation elbling et al 2010 therefore it was expected that vc and egcg might exert protective effects if dbps caused oxidative dna damage or ahr mediated genotoxicity in cells considering that sediment organic matter including hocs is the sink for the organic matter in surface water and the content of hocs in sediments is much higher than in surface water sediments was used to extract hocs in this study we collected sediment samples from drinking water reservoirs along a river in the pearl river delta region china from upstream low human activity to downstream high human activity hong et al 2008 2010 liang et al 2008a 2008b after characterizing basic sediment contamination hocs were extracted and subjected to chlorination and chemistry and genotoxicity of hocs before after the chlorination were examined lastly role of vc and egcg in protecting against genotoxicity was determined for the first time we utilized human colon carcinoma cell line caco 2 to test dna damage via single cell gel electrophoresis assay comet assay this cell line was rather relevant because the gastrointestinal tract presents the first and direct target of dbp exposure and was more metabolically competent possessing both the p 450 enzymes and phase ii enzymes similar to those observed in vivo metabolism studies sambuy et al 2005 meanwhile the sos chromotest a quantitative colorimetric assay for genotoxins at the microbial level was also conducted as a comparison janion 2001 overall our objectives were 1 to investigate effects of chlorination on genotoxicity of hocs 2 to examine link between the genotoxicity and contamination level of the drinking water reservoirs and 3 to identify effects of catalase vc and egcg on protecting cells against genotoxicity upon exposure to dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment sampling six drinking water reservoirs around the pearl river delta region china were selected for surface sediment sampling xfj reservoir xfjr was at upstream of the dongjiang river far away from urban areas xl reservoir xlr sy reservoir syr and sz reservoir szr in shenzhen city were at the lower reach of the dongjiang river more affected by human activities pc reservoir pcr and hi reservoir hir were in hong kong and received water from the dongjiang river and szr pcr was close to an industrial area while hir was located in a remote area within each reservoir three sampling sites water entrance center and outlet were selected and 2 kg of surface sediment approximately 10 cm in depth were collected at each site using a grab sampler all

bottle with glass septa and then dried by n2 gas after that chlorine with phosphate buffer ph 7 was added in the sediment hocs in order to keep a relative stable ph range during chlorination stock chlorine solution naocl 67 6 mg ml 1 was standardized by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd titrimetric method apha 1998 the chlorination experiments lasted for 24 h in the dark and chlorine dose required in each sample was preliminary determined so that the amount of residual chlorine was about 2 mg l 1 at the end of chlorination na2so3 was added to quench the residual chlorine in the chlorinated whole solutions cl ws 80 ml the cl ws were stored at 4 c before analysis of uv254 and toxicities 2 4 preparation of hocs extracts out of cl ws cl hocs via solid phase extraction according

respectively 4 ml per solvent per cartridge cl ws 80 ml was loaded into a cartridge and the adsorbed fraction in the cartridge was washed out by ethyl acetate 4 ml followed by dichloromethane 4 ml the eluents were then collected and dried using n2 gas which were regarded as cl hocs the cl hocs were stored at 4 c before further analysis of pahs chlorinated pahs uv254 in n hexane and toxicities 2 5 chemical analysis of sediments sediment hocs cl ws and cl hocs for total organic matter tom about 5 g dry sediment was transferred into a pre weighed crucible and the sample weight was determined

was determined by the weight difference total carbon tc and total nitrogen tn in the dry sediments were determined using a perkinelmer 2400 series ii chns o analyzer total phosphorus tp in the sediments was determined by ascorbic acid method apha 1998 after digesting the samples with a combination of nitric acid and perchloric acid the cl ws was analyzed of uv254 and toc shimadzu toc 5000 after sufficient acid washed copper powder was added into sediment hocs samples to remove sulfur a clean up using florisil for purification was conducted according to standard method 3620b usepa 1996b after a final clean up by florisil the samples were concentrated to 2 ml at 35 c using a rotary evaporator and ready for pahs and chlorinated pahs analysis deuterated pahs internal standard acenaphthene d10 phenanthrene d10 chrysene d12 and perylene d12 were added into all extracts to the concentration of 320 ng g 1 prior to instrumental analysis for quantification concentrations of pahs

phenanthrene was purchased from sigma aldrich since there is no internal standard and srm for our reference we simply presented relative concentrations of clphenanthrene cl2phenanthene cl3phenanthrene clfluoranthene and cl2fluoranthene through calculating the concentrations using the standard curve of 9 cl phenanthrene ranged between 0 and 200 ng g 1 2 6 comet assay using caco 2 cells human caco 2 cell line was obtained from the american type culture collection atcc rockville md the cells were cultured in dulbecco modified eagle s medium dmem supplemented with 20 fetal bovine serum fbs in a humidified atmosphere of 95 air and 5 co2 at 37 c the medium was changed every 3 days and the cells were sub cultured every 7 days when 95 of the cells confluenced oxiselect comet assay kit cell biolabs inc was used for comet assays procedures mainly followed the product manual with some modifications according to fairbairn et al 1995 and klaude et al 1996 cell viability was determined via observing color change of 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide mtt only cells with viability of more than 80 were used for toxicity tests the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs without mg2 and ca2 and treated with different samples sediment hocs cl ws and cl hocs cells treated simply with dmem medium were used as the control in particular sediment hocs and cl hocs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso final concentration 0 5 v v respectively before added into the medium dmso solution 0 5 was also used as solvent control for hocs and cl hocs for testing cl ws the dmem powder was dissolved directly into the respective cl ws solutions followed by filtration through 0 22 μm acetate cellulose membrane before incubation with the cells milli q water prepared dmem medium was used as the control for comparison the cell culture media contain 5 g sediment in 100 ml solution was used as 100 treated media for hocs cl ws and cl hocs respectively after treatment for 1 h at 37 c with 5 co2 the cells were collected and washed once with ice cold pbs and suspended in 100 μl ice cold pbs the cells then were mixed with low melting point agarose 37 c 1 10 briefly and spread on slide 4 c avoid light until solidification the cells were lysed in lysis buffer for 1 h and then in alkaline buffer for 30 min 4 c avoid light followed by being washed with ice cold tris borate edta tbe buffer twice electrophoresis was performed at 4 c 1 v cm 1 for 15 min in tbe afterwards the slides were neutralized using pre chilled di water dehydrated with 70 ethanol and stained using vista green dna dye for 15 min the cells were measured for their comet tail moment tm olive tail moment per cell using a fluorescence microscope with a ccd camera to indicate dna damage in the treated cells the tail moment tm was an index of dna damage calculated by the migrated dna density multiplied by the migration distance of the nuclei the digitalized data were transferred to a computer for subsequent statistical analysis liviac et al 2010 about 50 cells per treatment were randomly measured of tm per cell and the experiment was repeated three times using three different generations of cells respectively hence the average tm value per cell of each treatment was derived from the mean value among 150 cells additionally the dmem medium for culturing caco 2 cells was used as the negative control after 10 batches of preliminary test we identified that cl ws of szr demonstrated repeatable and comparable positive response we therefore used the same prepared cl ws sample of szr throughout the whole experiment as the internal quality control sample i e positive control sample 2 7 sos chromotest sos chromotest was performed without metabolic activation using sos chromo test kit and e coli pq37 strain supplied by ebpi brampton ontario canada which was then modified according to quillardet and hofnung 1985 and mersch sundermann et al 1991 briefly an overnight culture of bacterial suspension was appropriately diluted using 10 dmso saline six concentration levels of each sample were also prepared using 10 dmso saline a 10 μl sample and 100 μl of bacteria suspension were transferred into 96 well microplate and exposed 2 h at 37 c β galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase activities were then determined by using 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d galactoside x gal mym biological technology co ltd and p nitrophenyl phosphate pnpp mym biological technology co ltd disodium substrates respectively 4 nitro quinoline 1 oxide was used as the positive control the ratio of β galactosidase alkaline phosphatase activities divided by the values of control samples was calculated as the induction factor the induction factor increased with sample concentration and sos inducing potency sosip was calculated as the slope of the linear region 2 8 treatment by antioxidants catalase sigma vc sigma and egcg wako were added into caco 2 cell cultures respectively to investigate effect of antioxidants in protecting cells from dna damage the experiment was conducted using cl ws of the 6 reservoirs via comet assay and sos chromotest mtt test was firstly conducted for preliminary determination of antioxidant dose after 24 h incubation vc 25 5000 μm showed less than 10 cell death at concentrations below 500 μm fig s1 while egcg 10 350 μm fig s1 and catalase 500 u ml 1 and 1000 u ml 1 were not cytotoxic therefore in the experiment 500 u ml 1 catalase 500 μm vc and 90 μm egcg were mixed with cl ws respectively in comet assay mixtures of antioxidants and cl ws were used as diluents of dmem media for the treatments caco 2 cells were exposed to the dmem media containing variable mixtures of antioxidants and cl ws for 1 h with dmem media containing simply cl ws being used as the control effect of incubation time influencing function of the antioxidants was also investigated by using cl ws of hir three incubation time periods 0 5 h 1 h and 1 5 h were sampled for the observation for the sos chromotest antioxidants were dissolved in 0 85 nacl as stock solutions freshly prepared respectively stock solutions were diluted into the wells immediately after 10 μl samples and 100 μl bacteria suspension 2 9 data analysis one way anova correlation and regression analyses were conducted using spss 16 0 statistic package for social science software program for windows spss inc 3 results and discussions this study adopted the comet assay as a rapid sensitive and uncomplicated method for detecting dna damage at the level of the individual eukaryotic cell fairbairn et al 1995 for pahs in environmental complex mixtures conflicting dna damage in cells were reported previously for example pahs in soil extracts induced irreparable dna damage in hepg 2 cells niziolek kierecka et al 2012 children living in the surroundings of petrochemical industrial areas are exposed to high pah levels contributed to dna damage sánchez guerra et al 2012 the highest dna damage in blood cells of flounder paralichthys olivaceus was found in the sediments showing the highest pahs contamination woo et al 2006 however complex mixtures may also modify the carcinogenic potency of pahs by shifting the metabolic activation pathway from the production of pah diol epoxides to akr pathway derived metabolites courter et al 2007 non genotoxic substances in extractable organic matter eom from airborne particles showed to inhibit the formation of benzo a pyrene induced dna adducts and thereby reduced the genotoxicity of pahs in the eom líbalová et al 2014 although caco 2 as a common human cell line for in vitro testing is less competent for intestinal oxidative metabolism study sambuy et al 2005 the metabolic rates of pahs in caco 2 were only half of those in hepg2 cells with the production of different metabolites audebert et al 2010 as a preliminary test we only examined differential gene expression of cyp1a1 and cyp1b1 genes in caco 2 cells upon exposure without addition of s9 to pure medium control medium prepared using szr and cl ws of szr using quantitative real time rt pcr qrt pcr the result showed that both szr and cl ws of szr significantly increased the gene expression levels 4 6 9 5 fold unpublished data this partially verified the metabolic capability of caco 2 cells and meanwhile supported our hypothesis that szr and chlorinated szr were genotoxic we therefore deduced that the genotoxicity might be able to be measured by the comet assay therefore we did not add s9 in the exposure of caco 2 cells among the treatments in the present study nevertheless if s9 is added in the exposure study the more sensitive response could allow us to gain a better insight of the chlorination to some extent this suggested that the lack of s9 in the genotoxicity experiments probably greatly lowered the sensitivity of the test relevant study should be conducted in the future overall through chemical analysis we verified the contamination gradient from xfjr to szr upon chlorination aromatic hocs were reduced while dbps were elevated chlorination also significantly increased dna damage in human caco 2 cells lastly protective effects of catalase and dietary antioxidants i e vc and egcg in cells against dbps genotoxicity were observed 3 1 basic property of sediments basic property of sediments was compared among the six reservoirs table 1 for nutrients and organic matter levels in the sediments xfjr and hir had the least tc 1 22 tn 0 68 g kg 1 tp 0 35 g kg 1 and tom 9 32 respectively in contrast pcr xlr and syr separately had the most tc 3 89 tn 1 46 g kg 1 tp 1 70 g kg 1 tom 15 59 while szr tc 1 26 tn 0 88 g kg 1 tp 1 24 g kg 1 tom 10 58 was intermediately contaminated these results are consistent with our previous observation from xfjr and hir sites liang et al 2008a which are subjected to the least impact from human activities while pcr and syr sites had the higher human impacts although szr is located in a region highly exposed to human activities it also has an enhanced biological treatment bio nitrification of the water within the reservoir therefore it was not unexpected to contain less nutrients and organic matter 3 2 chemical characterization of hocs pahs distribution in 6 reservoirs shared some common traits fig s2 16 pahs species were all detected in 6 reservoirs among which phenanthrene 16 1 26 5 of total pahs and fluoranthene 14 5 20 3 of total pahs were two species with highest concentration while dibenz a h anthracene 0 6 1 1 of t pahs and acenaphthylene 0 6 1 5 of total pahs were two species with the lowest levels yet in terms of total pahs table 1 their distribution in 6 reservoirs were quite different szr pcr and syr had the highest level exceeding 200 0 μg kg 1 followed by xlr which was 152 5 μg kg 1 and xfjr and hir had the lowest 64 3 93 6 μg kg 1 this pattern was also consistent with human activity related to these reservoirs see section 2 1 to further illustrate the total pah content we calculated the ratio of total pahs to tc table 1 the results showed that szr had much higher ratio values 22 9 μg g 1 than the other 5 reservoirs 5 1 9 4 μg g 1 this clearly indicates that the bio treatment in szr more effectively removed nutrients and organic contamination but not the less biodegradable micro pollutants such as pahs in addition uv254 values of sediment hocs in the 6 reservoirs were shown in fig s3 pcr contained the highest level of uv254 1 67 cm 1 followed by szr 0 96 cm 1 and other reservoirs had the lowest 0 71 0 90 cm 1 3 3 decomposition of hocs and formation of dbps during chlorination chlorination removed 16 6 63 6 of total pahs in hocs but substantially increased pahs with 2 3 4 rings while decreased those with 5 6 rings fig 1 a b fig s2 with the differences ranging between 1 6 and 16 6 fig 1a this suggests that pahs were transformed during chlorination and ring cleavage occurred in high ring containing pahs leading to the formation of low ring containing pahs zani et al 2005 horii et al 2008 the observation in the reduction of uv254 after chlorination also supported that aromatic compounds were degraded in the process fig s3 however the reduction in uv254 49 8 91 4 was much higher than that of pahs 16 6 63 6 fig 1b this suggests that non pahs aromatics such as humic substances are more susceptible to chlorination than pahs aromatics uv254 were less inclined to be removed from xfjr to syr but the reduction in pahs generally showed an opposite pattern except for syr fig 1b and c it implies that pahs had more chance to react with free chlorine and be transformed if lower percentage of the other aromatics non pahs were present in this study all of the targeted halogenated pahs compounds were detected in cl hocs fig 2 and highest level of cl3 phe were observed in szr we also observed that for syr the hydrophobic aromatics including both pahs and non pahs were more recalcitrant or less easily be removed by chlorine fig 1 b c but halogenation into cl phe and cl2 phe was the highest in cl hocs fig 2 among the 6 reservoirs considering the high organic matter contents tc 2 50 tom 15 59 in the sediments of syr table 1 a presence of non aromatic hydrophobic substances probably attributed to quenching chlorine and therefore a low reduction in the aromatics fig 1b and a trend to form less halogenated pahs such as cl phe and cl2 phe regular dbps including chcl3 82 5 108 2 μg kg dcan 5 3 88 4 μg kg and tcp 36 1 293 0 μg kg increased after chlorination fig 2 however dcaa and tcaa were only detected in one reservoir syr while tcan were not detectable in all the reservoirs fig 2 moreover no significant p 0 05 relationship was found between dbps formation chcl3 dcaa tcaa dcan tcan and tcp and uv254 level this was not consistent with previous studies that uv254 was a good indicator for the formation of these dbps which used hocs humic fulvic acid or whole organic matter in surface water in studying dbps formation reckhow et al 1990 hua et al 2015 hong et al 2016 lin et al 2018 this suggested that the aromatic hocs in these reservoirs differed greatly in terms of chlorine reactivity and dbps formation among the 6 reservoirs the yields of dcan and tcp were the highest in szr in spite that its uv254 and tom were only in a moderate level table 1 fig s3 suggesting that organic matter in szr was more potent precursor for dcan and tcp as compared to other reservoirs 3 4 genotoxicity change upon chlorination dna damage in caco 2 cells after treatment by sediment hocs 0 0018 0 0035 cl ws 0 0023 0 5320 and cl hocs 0 0025 0 2501 was presented in fig 3 these results showed no significant difference in the genotoxicity p 0 05 of sediment hocs among the six reservoirs although they contained remarkably different levels of pahs and uv254 table 1 figs s2 and s3 conversely despite the substantial decrease in pahs uv254 occurred following chlorination fig 1 fig s2 figs s3 and a significant increase in genotoxicity p 0 05 was detected except for xfjr fig 3 genotoxic effects via sos chromotest corroborated the results of dna damage in caco 2 cells fig s4a and a close correlation between the two responses was observed p 0 002 fig s4b the result indicated that the detected dbps such as dcaa tcaa dcan tcp as well as the chlorinated pahs may contribute to the increased genotoxicity le curieux et al 1994 muellner et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 chao et al 2018 and demonstrating that pahs were not the major contributor to the genotoxicity in cl hocs because the high molecular weight pahs major genotoxic components in pahs greatly reduced after chlorination fig s2 similarly uv254 also appeared not to be a good indicator predictor of the genotoxicity genotoxicity in the chlorinated solutions cl ws and cl hocs increased along the contamination gradient from less contaminated xfjr to highly contaminated syr fig 3 for example dna damage for the cl ws significantly p 0 0447 correlated with pattern in variation of tom in the sediments fig s5a and that for the cl hocs significantly p 0 0021 correlated with pahs in the sediments fig s5b the results demonstrated that 1 not all genotoxicants in the chlorinated solutions were hydrophobic chlorinated hydrophilic compounds substantially contributed to the genotoxicity and not both cl ws and cl hocs toxicity were correlated with tom in the sediments fig s5 and 2 level of pahs served as a good predictor of genotoxicity in the cl hocs figs s5b and c though pahs were not the greatest contributor to the genotoxicity this inferred that other persistent organic contaminants e g dioxins having similar contamination route and partitions in the aquatic environments as those of pahs accounted for the genotoxicity it can also be possible that pahs together with other hydrophobic aromatics served as genotoxic precursors of dbps while non aromatic compounds notably in syr were important precursors of genotoxic dbps chemical additive or synergistic effects in the chlorinated solutions possibly should also be taken into consideration since toxicity of the low molecular weight cl pahs generally increased with the increasing number of chlorine substitution egito et al 2007 the high dna damage observed in szr pcr and syr fig 3 was likely attributed to the high cl pahs in the chlorinated samples yet our experiments showed that dna damage in caco 2 tested against the maximum level of each individual dbps detected in the cl hocs chcl3 0 54 μg l 1 dcan 0 44 μg l 1 tcp 1 47 μg l 1 and cl phe 0 02 μg l 1 was insignificant average comet tail moment 0 00014 0 00022 compared with the control average comet tail moment 0 00018 therefore role of other cl pahs or key dbps responsible for the genotoxicity and the associated mechanisms remained to be identified and investigated in the future 3 5 effects of antioxidants against genotoxicity after 1 h treatment antioxidants did not significantly increase dna damage in caco 2 cells while the genotoxicity in cl ws decreased significantly p 0 05 in 7 out of the total of 18 treatments 38 9 fig 4 a c among 6 reservoirs the genotoxic cl ws of syr and pcr were the most prominently affected with average reduction of dna damage ranging between 63 7 and 88 9 egcg was the most effective among the three antioxidants that 4 out of 6 treatments for xfjr szr pcr and syr showed significant reduction 74 6 99 8 fig 4b effect of the antioxidants in reducing genotoxic response in sos sosip was similar as that in dna damage fig s6 but significant reduction p 0 05 occurred in catalase and egcg treated cl ws samples of szr and pcr respectively moreover exposure time of the antioxidants against genotoxicity was found to be a key parameter in designing the toxicity tests fig 5 a significant finding from our results reported here when the cl ws from hir was incubated with the three antioxidants respectively dna damage in caco 2 generally increased with time in both the control and treatments but the difference between the control and treatments became more remarkable and significantly lower dna damage p 0 05 was observed in antioxidants treatments at 1 5 h previously cemeli et al reported that catalase reduced iodoacetic acid one of drinking water dbps induced dna damage in chinese hamster ovary cho cells in vitro by 42 cemeli et al 2006 demonstrating that oxidative stress contributed to the genotoxicity our present result with catalase was in agreement with this hypothesis that dna damage from exposure to dbps partially resulted from oxidative stress more importantly this study for the first time demonstrated that dietary antioxidants i e vc and egcg protected human cells in vitro against dna damage from exposure to chlorinated solutions or dbps figs 4 and 5 s6 it suggested that vc or egcg may generate a low dose of h2o2 in cells within short period of incubation and thus serve as pro oxidant to increase resistance in cells against high dose oxidative stress afterwards noctor and foyer 2002 rivière et al 2006 on the other hand vc may play an important role in reducing ahr level chang et al 2009 which lead to the inhibition of cytochrome p450 1a1 gene cyp1a1 expression finally the exposure toxicity of dioxin like compounds such as pahs or cl pahs may be reduced 4 conclusion this study for the first time examined genotoxicity of chlorinated hocs derived from drinking water reservoirs and effects of dietary antioxidants in protecting cells against the genotoxicity overall chlorination changed the chemistry and genotoxicity of hocs while the contamination level of the reservoirs influenced the effects of the chlorination non pahs aromatics such as humic substances were less resistant to chlorination than pahs suggesting that the presence of humic substances might serve as diluents in shielding pahs or other micro pollutants from being attacked by chlorine genotoxicity significantly increased coupled by a remarkable decrease in pahs level after chlorination demonstrating that pahs were not the major genotoxicants in the chlorinated solutions although genotoxicity of the chlorinated solutions closely correlated with pahs contamination level in the reservoirs the pah level simply served as a good predictor of the genotoxicity and key genotixic dbps remained to be identified in the future it can also be concluded that not all genotoxicants in the chlorinated solutions were hydrophobic chlorinated hydrophilic compounds substantially contributed to the genotoxicity given that not both cl ws and cl hocs correlated with tom in the sediments lastly this study for the first time demonstrated that catalase and dietary antioxidants i e vc and egcg protected human cells in vitro against dna damage from exposure to chlorinated solutions or dbps and exposure time of the antioxidants against genotoxicity was a key parameter in designing the
