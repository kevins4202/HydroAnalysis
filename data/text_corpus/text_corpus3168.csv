15840,supersaturation of total dissolved gas tdg caused by high dam discharge is an ecological risk that cannot be ignored in the operation of hydropower stations the establishment of an efficient and concise tdg generation prediction model is of great significance to the water ecology and water environment protection of hydropower development reaches the flow conditions and the process of water gas mass transfer in discharge and energy dissipation are very complicated and difficult to observe in the field bringing difficulties to the establishment of prediction model and parameter calibration increasingly abundant observations make it possible to establish an efficient machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg in this study extreme learning machine elm and support vector regression svr were used to establish the prediction model the main influencing factors of supersaturated tdg obtained by the analysis of the physical process of the generation of supersaturated tdg were used as the input of the machine learning model then this research took dagangshan hydropower station and xiluodu hydropower station as objects and established machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg with several years of observation data in different discharge scenarios four models including elm svr ga elm and ga svr were obtained through genetic algorithm optimization the relative errors of the simulation results of each model are mostly less than 5 mean absolute error mae values less than 1 6 and root mean square error rmse values less than 2 5 the results showed that these models are highly accurate and time saving based on this tdg saturation in downstream of dagangshan hydropower station with different discharge scenarios was simulated by machine learning model on which the discharge optimization scheme was put forward the proposed models as an important supplement to the prediction of supersaturated tdg enjoy practical significance

introduction to reduce the risk of flooding and ameliorate the energy mix large hydropower stations have been built in southwest china in addition to exerting great flood control benefits and providing enormous clean energy the hydropower station also has adverse effects on the ecological environment among them the supersaturated tdg caused by high dam discharge has become one of the ecological risks that must be paid attention to in reservoir operation qu et al 2011 wan et al 2021 during high dam discharge the flow entrains large amounts of gas and enters the stilling basin the aerated flow dissolves excess gas under high pressure thereby achieving total dissolved gas tdg supersaturation relative to the current environmental condition li et al 2009 lu et al 2019 a large number of field observations and laboratory experiments indicate that supersaturated tdg may lead to bubble disease and even death in fish thus threatening water ecological security geist et al 2013 witt et al 2017 fast and accurate prediction of the generation of downstream supersaturated tdg during discharge is helpful to assess the supersaturated risk in advance adjust the discharge scheduling scheme and provide time for the area of key fish to take early measures ji et al 2021 pleizier et al 2020 thus reducing the adverse effects of supersaturated tdg the prediction of supersaturated tdg is a complex multi factor related issue with highly nonlinear characteristics which can be realized through three models at present including empirical model numerical model as well as mechanical model these three models can indeed produce satisfactory prediction results under certain conditions however they do have limitations in the aspect of application scope conciseness and prediction efficiency respectively the empirical model has limited application due to its less consideration of the generation process of supersaturated tdg columbia basin research 2000 us army corps of engineers 1997 with the in depth understanding of the mechanism of supersaturated tdg and the improvement of computing ability the mechanical model and numerical model have been developed with clearer physical meaning and higher accuracy based on the observations of supersaturated tdg in several high dams such as ertan zipingpu and three gorges and combined with the generation process of supersaturated tdg in stilling basin li et al 2009 established a mechanical model for supersaturated tdg in high dams ma et al 2018 2019 and lu et al 2019 2021 studied the aeration and mass transfer process of water flow during air crushing through experiments and observations and further optimized the mechanical model thanks to them the physical process of the model is clearer and the prediction accuracy is further improved the physical significance of the mechanism analytical model is considered but the process of supersaturated tdg generation remains unclear leading to a complicated process of model establishment with many empirical parameters orlins and gulliver 2000 established a vertical two dimensional single phase flow tdg model based on mass transfer between bubbles and water gas interface by introducing turbulent mathematical model politano and carrica 2007 2009 developed the calculation of supersaturated tdg from two dimensional to three dimensional and introduced the bubble number density equation to calculate the bubble size distribution huang et al 2021a 2021b constructed a three dimensional two phase flow model of tdg saturation based on the aeration process of discharge flow and mass transfer and transport of supersaturated tdg the numerical model can simulate the spatial distribution of supersaturated tdg with high accuracy but it has lots of assumptions and takes a long time to construct the mesh adjust parameters and simulate therefore it is urgent to establish a supersaturated tdg prediction model with simple structure high efficiency and wide application range presently machine learning is instrumental in solving various complex issues compared with traditional methods machine learning does not call for sophisticated math models with an easy model structure and efficient simulation process it is a perfect choice to handle nonlinear problems with many influencing factors many water science fields including hydrology forecast water temperature and wave height prediction have witnessed its performance in gaining good results adnan and mostafa et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 shamshirband et al 2020 sulaiman et al 2019 the increasingly abundant supersaturated tdg observation data makes it possible to establish an efficient machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg some scholars have carried out research on tdg saturation prediction of hydropower station with the help of machine learning the tdg observations they used are mainly derived from monitoring stations of the united states geological survey usgs or of the u s army corps of engineers usace heddam 2017 2019 used water temperature barometric pressure spill from dam and discharge as the input and established multiple tdg saturation machine learning prediction models through several machine learning methods alomar et al 2020 selected discharge flow barometric pressure water temperature and tdg saturation in front of dam as the input combination to establish the prediction model for supersaturated tdg by extreme learning machine and support vector regression the above mentioned models are accurate but the problem lies in that the mechanisms of supersaturated tdg are not considered in the selection of main influencing factors the high accuracy of these models largely depends on the massive monitoring data most of which come from monitoring stations this explains why they are inapplicable for large hydropower stations in southwestern china that have not yet established a normalized monitoring system for supersaturated tdg based on the aforementioned considerations the existing supersaturated tdg observation data needs to be fully used for analyzing and screening the main influencing factors of supersaturated tdg through mechanical and mathematical statistics methods in this way an efficient machine learning prediction model of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge can be established based on the existing observation and research this paper compared and selected the main influencing factors of supersaturated tdg based on its generation mechanism and established efficient prediction models suitable for the tdg saturation in high dam discharge through machine learning the model could be a powerful tool for rapid assessment of downstream tdg supersaturation risk and discharge scheme drafting which is of great significance to the water ecology and water environmental protection of the hydropower development reaches 2 study area and data sets the data used in this study are derived from the supersaturated tdg observations conducted by the author s team at dagangshan hydropower station of dadu river in china during the flood season of 2016 2018 and xiluodu hydropower station of jinsha river in china during the flood season of 2019 2020 dagangshan hydropower station has a maximum dam height of 210m while xiluodu hydropower station has a maximum dam height of 285 5 m the orifice and discharge tunnel discharge mode and ski jump energy dissipation method adopted by these two hydropower stations are representative in china s high dam the locations of dagangshan hydropower station and xiluodu hydropower station are shown in fig 1 during the observation period discharge tunnel and deep orifice were observed at dagangshan hydropower station while only deep orifice was observed at xiluodu hydropower station the current researches can neither make clear the difference between different hydropower stations nor the difference of discharge structures of the same hydropower station for the above reasons it is difficult to establish a machine learning prediction model of supersaturated tdg for multiple dams or multiple discharge structures in view of that this research established supersaturated tdg generation prediction models for dagangshan discharge tunnel deep orifices discharge and xiluodu deep orifices discharge respectively the observation of each discharge scenario is shown in table 1 3 material and methodology 3 1 screening of influencing factors of supersaturated tdg 3 1 1 formation mechanism of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge the generation of supersaturated tdg for high dam discharge is divided into three stages li et al 2009 lu et al 2019 in the first stage the water flows through the discharge structure and entrains a large amount of gas to form aerated water flow then the aerated flow enters the bottom of the stilling basin and rolls gradually to the outlet of the stilling basin under the great pressure and turbulence the gas is over dissolved thus reaching the gas supersaturation relative to the current environmental conditions finally the supersaturated water moves to the surface of stilling basin and near the subsidiary dam during which the pressure decreases rapidly after the rapid release of supersaturated gas in water the saturation tends to be stable but it remains to be supersaturated the formation process of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge is shown in fig 2 3 1 2 influencing factor and its calculation according to the formation mechanism of supersaturated tdg it is preliminarily believed that the influencing factors of supersaturated tdg mainly include 3 kinds with a total of 10 factors they are the discharge situation discharge flow discharge per unit width power generation flow upstream and downstream water level difference energy dissipation efficiency aerated flow bubble pressure and retention time of flow in the stilling basin and initial conditions and external environment tdg saturation in front of dam barometric pressure and water temperature respectively the influence mechanism of each factor on supersaturated tdg is introduced separately in the case of discharge situation the discharge flow mainly determines the water depth in the stilling basin and together with the factor of upstream and downstream water level difference it can decide the initial potential energy of the discharge flow thus further affecting the turbulent intensity of the water flow in the stilling basin discharge per unit width can comprehensively characterize the physical quantities such as velocity momentum and flow turbulence a large number of observation results show that tdg saturation is significantly positively correlated with the discharge flow and discharge per unit width jiang et al 2008 qu et al 2011 tdg saturation of hydropower generation tail water is basically consistent with that of dam front li 2018 which mainly affects the downstream tdg saturation by water mixing the tdg saturation data used in this research have eliminated the influence of hydropower generation tail water in energy dissipation efficiency aeration is one of the necessary conditions for tdg supersaturation however it is generally believed that the water flow has entrained a sufficient amount of gas in the air during the discharge and the aeration amount is much greater than that of the water dissolving in the stilling basin so this study will not take aeration as a direct influence factor ma et al 2018 pressure is the direct cause of gas dissolution experiments show that within 10 standard atmospheric pressure ranges the effective solubility of gas will increase by 10 for one meter increase in water depth urban et al 2008 due to the high velocity and large aeration rate the duration of the flow in stilling basin is far less than the time required to reach the dissolution equilibrium therefore the bubble pressure and retention time in the stilling basin will directly affect the dissolution of gas in the stilling basin in the case of initial conditions and external environment the difference between the initial saturation and the equilibrium saturation serves as the main driving force for the mass transfer of tdg through experiments xue 2019 showed that the initial tdg saturation directly affects the tdg saturation before the water flow enters the stilling basin barometric pressure and water temperature determine the gas solubility of the water and characterize the surrounding environmental conditions during the discharge after the above analysis this paper mainly explores the effects of eight factors on supersaturated tdg including discharge flow q discharge per unit width q upstream and downstream water level difference δ h tdg saturation in front of dam g0 bubble pressure f and retention time ts in stilling basin barometric pressure bp and water temperature t among them discharge flow discharge per unit width power generation flow and upstream and downstream water level difference can be obtained by collecting and analyzing the hydropower station dispatching data factors of tdg saturation in front of dam barometric pressure and water temperature can be achieved by field observation with instruments the bubble pressure in the stilling basin is composed of hydrostatic pressure and hydrodynamic pressure in which hydrodynamic pressure δ p m m h2o is calculated by the eq 1 proposed by liu 2010 1 δ p m 0 95 sin 2 β 0 175 q 2 3 δ h 1 3 g 1 3 h 1 1 3 where β is the angle of discharge flow into water q is discharge per unit width m2 s δ h is the upstream and downstream water level difference m h1 is the water depth m in the stilling basin the water retention time ts s in stilling basin is calculated by eq 2 proposed by lu 2019 2 t s 27 73 λ 0 49 h k g 0 5 l 0 l 1 82 where λ is the dimensionless parameter of the outlet of the stilling basin hk is the water depth in the stilling basin m l0 is the distance m of the discharge flow l is the horizontal distance m from the discharge structure to the end of the stilling basin 3 1 3 screening of influencing factors in this section the above eight influencing factors will be further analyzed through the tdg observation results of dagangshan and xiluodu hydropower station the observation data of dagangshan and xiluodu hydropower stations were collated and the influencing factors were calculated the correlation between tdg saturation and each factor was analyzed through the correlation analysis the generation of supersaturated tdg is a typical nonlinear problem spearman correlation coefficient is a coefficient of measuring the monotonic correlation between two variables without strict requirement for data which can be embodied by that any two variables regardless of their overall distribution and sample size therefore it can be used to determine the correlation between tdg saturation and various factors due to the differences between different hydropower stations and various discharge structures in the same hydropower station three discharge scenarios are analyzed respectively the correlation coefficient calculation results are shown in fig 3 for the spearman correlation coefficient when it is positive it indicates positive correlation and when it is negative it represents negative correlation the closer the absolute value is to 1 the stronger the correlation is this study takes the absolute value of spearman correlation coefficient of 0 4 as the boundary if the absolute value of spearman correlation coefficient is greater than 0 4 with the tdg saturation it will be identified as a correlation factor it can be seen from fig 3 that under all three scenarios the absolute value of spearman correlation coefficient between both discharge flow and retention time with downstream tdg saturation is greater than 0 4 under dagangshan discharge tunnel and xiluodu deep orifices scenarios the absolute value of spearman correlation coefficient among barometric pressure the upstream and downstream water level difference bubble pressure and downstream tdg saturation is greater than 0 4 there is only one scenario where the absolute value of spearman correlation coefficient between both tdg saturation in front of dam and flow per unit width with downstream tdg saturation is greater than 0 4 in all three scenarios there is only one factor water temperature whose spearman correlation coefficient with downstream tdg saturation is less than 0 4 in order to make the machine learning model more representative and accurate the model excludes the water temperature t and takes seven influencing factors such as barometric pressure bp discharge flow q discharge per unit width q upstream and downstream water level difference δ h bubble pressure f and retention time ts in stilling basin tdg saturation in front of dam g0 as the input of the machine learning model 3 2 machine learning model the prediction of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge is a typical multi factor problem with highly nonlinear characteristics at present the amount of field observation data of supersaturated tdg during high dam discharge is still very limited let alone the continuous observation for single discharge scenario the research team s observational data of dagangshan and xiluodu hydropower stations are relatively abundant which is still insufficient for machine learning therefore the ability to deal with both nonlinear problems and small sample data are two key factors to be considered when choosing an appropriate machine learning method based on the above selection principle two models extreme learning machine elm and support vector regression svr stand out in the process of comparison and screening of models 3 2 1 extreme learning machine extreme learning machine is an efficient training algorithm for single layer feedforward neural network slfn unlike other training algorithms the extreme learning machine initializes the synaptic weights and biases of the hidden layer randomly and remains unchanged throughout the training process subsequently the minimum square difference between the network output and the target is taken as the network training target to calculate the output weight after derivation the output weights can be transformed into the product of the moore penrose generalized inverse matrix of the hidden layer output matrix and the target matrix so only the generalized inverse matrix needs to be solved ghazvinei 2018 compared with the traditional training algorithm of slfn the training efficiency of elm algorithm is tremendously improved and the randomly generated synaptic weights and biases of the hidden layer do not affect the approximation ability of slfn as a single hidden layer neural network algorithm elm enjoys strong generalization ability in dealing with small sample problems which endows elm with stronger nonlinear mapping ability and lower computational cost adnan et al 2021 ghazvinei et al 2018 therefore it can be well applied to the prediction of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge suppose that a slfn using elm training algorithm has m input variables xi xi r m i 1 2 n l hidden layer nodes one output value y and a total of n training sets then the structure of this neural network is shown in fig 4 taking the above assumed slfn as an example the input value enters the node of the hidden layer with randomly assigned weights and biases and after the activation function can be output as eq 3 shown 3 h i x j 1 m g i w i x j b i where hi x is the output value of the i th node of the hidden layer g represents the activation function of the hidden layer which is confirmed as sigmoid function after several trial attempts w and b are randomly determined weights and biases in their corresponding activation function all hi x make up the output matrix h the output of the hidden layer is connected to the output of the neural network by the output weight as shown in eq 4 4 y i 1 l β i h i x k ε where βi is the output weight k is the target value and ε is the prediction error the weight matrix of output layer is β the output value matrix is y and the target value matrix is k after the above steps the output weights β that minimizes the prediction error can be obtained by solving the following equations by least square method 5 min β h t β k after further derivation the least squares solution β of eq 6 is 6 β h t k where ht is the moore penrose generalized inverse matrix of the output matrix ht 3 2 2 support vector regression support vector regression is a supervised learning algorithm based on structural risk minimization which is suitable for solving multidimensional nonlinear problems with small and medium training sets sain 1996 besides it can effectively restrain the problem of under fitting and over fitting based on the above reasons it is appropriate to use svr to establish the prediction model of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge svr maps the sample space to the high dimensional feature space through nonlinear functions and converts the original problem into solving a linear fitting problem in this high dimensional space reducing the difficulty of fitting and avoiding the huge amount of calculation in high dimensional space su et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 the objective of svr is to solve a fitting function make sure that all sample fall within the maximum error ε of the fitting function and keep the minimal slope of the fitting function in the feature space the data sample is given as x1 y1 xi yi xn yn where xi rm yi r xi is the input vector yi is the target vector n is the number of samples and m is the dimension of input vector xi svr formulation is as follows 7 f x w φ x b where φ x is a nonlinear function which maps the input data to high dimensional space w and b represents the weight and the biases respectively the optimization problem of svr can be transformed into 8 minimize 1 2 w 2 c 1 n i 1 n l ε y i t i 9 subject to y i w i φ x i b ε where 10 l ε y i t i y i t i ε y i t i ε 0 otherwise the constant c is the penalty coefficient and determines the trade off between the empirical risk and model flatness c 0 and ε is a constant called the radius of the tube that represents the optimization performance lε yi ti represents the loss function in which yi is the actual value and ti is the forecasted value according to eq 10 the loss will be zero when the forecasted value is within the ε tube otherwise the loss will be the distance of the forecasted error and ε fig 5 a depicts the value of lε yi ti since some data may not lie inside the ε tube the slack variables ξ ξ must be introduced in order to enhance the generalization capability of svr slack variables represent the distance from actual values to the boundary of ε tube fig 5 b represents the schematic of svr in the sample space include slack variables now the optimization problem of svr can be transformed into 11 minimize 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i subject to y i w i φ x i b ε ξ i w i φ x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 by using lagrangian multipliers of eq 11 and the dual form of the original lagrangian function the final objective function is obtained under karush kuhn tucher condition by solving this objective function the svr formulation can be expressed as follows 12 f x i 1 n α i α i k x i x j b where αi and αi are lagrange multipliers k xi xj φ xj φ xj is called the kernel function which has the same value with the inner products of φ xi and φ xj in the feature space the commonly used kernel functions include polynomial kernel function radial basis function kernel function rbf and sigmoid kernel function with few parameters ref kernel function can effectively fit the complex nonlinear relationship between input and output and ensure high computational efficiency cheng et al 2022 and it is mainly used in the case of inseparability linearity therefore ref kernel function was adopted after comparison and analysis 3 3 machine learning model optimization 3 3 1 principal component analysis pca in machine learning data dimensionality reduction is of great significance to improve learning efficiency and enhance the robustness of the model principal component analysis pca is a commonly used data dimension reduction method by linearly transforming the original data and discarding some information the original variables are replaced by a few independent synthetic variables on the premise of ensuring the minimum loss of data information gajjar et al 2018 based on the observation data this paper reduces the dimension of the influence factor data of supersaturated tdg in each discharge scenario through pca the principal components obtained by dimensionality reduction are independent and are used as the input of the machine learning model to simplify the model s structure and improve its reliability and learning efficiency 3 3 2 genetic algorithm ga genetic algorithm is a global data optimization algorithm derived by imitating the evolutionary process of nature its ultimate goal is to encode the decision variables into chromosomes and assign them randomly to form the initial population and establish the fitness function to screen the optimal results through the selection crossover and mutation of chromosomes adequate individuals are generated and excellent individuals are selected to inherit their information to the next generation until the individuals who meet the termination conditions come out marchetti and wanke 2020 genetic algorithms have good parallelism if one path turns out to be a dead end it would be eliminated and other promising paths will be continued meanwhile the unique algorithm structure of ga can keep it away from getting local optimal solution in this research ga is used to optimize elm and svr machine learning models respectively ga elm the synaptic weights and biases of hidden layer in elm algorithm are assigned randomly while only the weights of output layer call for calculation however the difference of the training results caused by the random weights and biases play an unstable role in obtaining the optimal performance of the model ga could stand out to find the optimal initial weights and biases for elm model which can enjoy higher fitting accuracy in ga elm model the gene of each chromosome is the weights and biases of hidden layer of a elm network flowchart of the ga elm algorithm is shown in fig 6 ga svr penalty factor c pipe width ε kernel function parameters and other parameters call for determination in svr model however there is no reliable way at present to get these parameters therefore this research used the global optimization ability of genetic algorithm to determine the optimal parameters so as to improve the efficiency of svr model the genes of each chromosome in ga svr model are penalty factor c pipe width ε and kernel function parameters the flow of chart ga svr is shown in fig 7 3 4 model evaluation the effect of supersaturated tdg prediction model is mainly judged by fitting effect chart and statistical indicators statistical indicators include mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse which are expressed as follows 13 m a e 1 n i 1 n y p y o 14 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y p y o 2 where n represents the number of calculated samples yp and yo represent the model prediction results and the actual measurement results respectively the smaller mae and rmse the better the prediction effect of the model 4 results four machine learning prediction models including elm ga elm svr and ga svr for the generation of supersaturated tdg of high dam discharge were constructed in this study the model allocates observations in a ratio of about 3 1 between training and testing data and all data sets are randomly selected from the original observation data to ensure the reliability and generalization ability of the model 4 1 principal component analysis results the input of each model is the linear combination of supersaturated tdg influence factors after dimension reduction by pca and the output is the downstream tdg saturation table 2 shows the pca results of the impact factor data under the three discharge scenarios 4 2 model adjustment results some parameters need to be determined while the machine learning model selected in this paper and its corresponding optimization algorithm enjoy satisfactory effects inspired by relevant scholars research adnan et al 2021 darwiche et al 2022 mei et al 2017 and with several trial calculations and adjustments the parameter selection of each model and genetic algorithm in the three discharge scenarios are shown in tables 3 and 4 in table 3 the svr parameters in ga svr are the initial settings before the genetic algorithm runs and the final parameters are calculated by the genetic algorithm 4 3 prediction results and analysis the fitting effect of simulated value and measured value and statistical indexes of mae and rmse were used to evaluate the prediction effect of each model fig 8 shows the fitting effect of the predicted values of the models and the observed values in the testing set of the three discharge scenarios it can be seen from fig 8 a that the relative errors between the simulated tdg saturation of elm ga elm svr and ga svr models and the original observed values are all less than 5 during the flood discharge of dagangshan spillway tunnel in terms of trend fitting the simulation results of elm ga elm and ga svr are basically consistent with the change trend of the observed values and the change trend of svr simulation results is relatively gentle compared with that of the original values according to fig 8 b the relative errors of tdg saturation simulated by ga elm svr and ga svr models are less than 5 in dagangshan deep orifices discharge scenario and the relative error of a simulated value in elm model is 6 24 the variation trend of the simulation results is basically consistent with the observed values according to fig 8 c the maximum relative errors between the simulated tdg saturation of elm ga elm svr and ga svr models and the observed values are 6 94 5 68 5 02 and 4 76 respectively in xiluodu deep orifices discharge scenario only the relative error of ga svr model simulation results is less than 5 after removing two larger error values the accuracy of each model is higher with a basically consistent change trend between simulation and observation therefore from the perspective of fitting accuracy and trend all the four machine learning models can better simulate the generation of supersaturated tdg among which ga elm and ga svr models enjoy better fitting results in the simulation of training and testing set under various discharge scenarios the calculation results and comparison of mae and rmse of elm ga elm svr and ga svr models are shown in table 5 and fig 9 under the three discharge scenarios of dagangshan discharge tunnel dagangshan deep orifices and xiluodu deep orifices the mae values of ga svr model simulation testing data are 0 95 1 06 and 1 37 respectively and the rmse values are 1 43 1 45 and 2 00 respectively all of which are the minimum values of corresponding models it can also be found in the box diagram fig 9b d containing the simulation results of training and testing set that the medians of mae and rmse values of ga svr are smaller than those of other models which are 0 96 and 1 40 respectively therefore ga svr is the optimal model of four supersaturated tdg prediction models the performance of other models are shown in table 5 and fig 9 which indicates that the ga elm model has better effect followed by the svr model and elm has the worst simulation effect among the four models under three discharge scenarios mae values of ga elm model in simulating the testing set are 1 14 1 31 and 1 42 respectively which are 0 40 0 25 and 0 41 lower than those obtained in elm model 0 09 higher than that of svr model in dagangshan deep orifices discharge scenario and 0 10 and 0 23 lower than that of svr model in dagangshan discharge tunnel and xiluodu deep orifices scenario respectively rmse values under the three discharge scenarios are 1 61 1 48 and 2 18 respectively which are 0 19 0 68 and 0 27 lower than those of elm model and 0 33 0 11 and 0 01 lower than those of svr model according to the boxplot containing the simulation results of training and testing set fig 9b d the medians of mae and rmse values of ga elm model are 1 14 and 1 53 respectively lower than 1 45 and 1 87 of elm model and 1 34 and 1 87 of svr model in conclusion according to the generation simulation results and analysis of supersaturated tdg under three discharge scenarios the prediction ability of the four machine learning models established in this research is ranked as ga svr ga elm svr elm 5 discussion 5 1 applicability analysis of machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge compared with mechanical and numerical model machine learning model has no need for complex mathematical models and calibration parameters instead it relies on the powerful nonlinear mapping ability to mine the relationship between data the four supersaturated tdg machine learning prediction models established in this research are accurate efficient and time saving mechanical and numerical simulation models are more suitable for hydropower stations lacking monitoring data such as hydropower stations in the initial stage of design or construction some parameters in these models need to be obtained by analogy with similar hydropower stations prediction of tdg saturation by these two type of models can serve as an important reference for hydropower station design and discharge scheme formulation after the construction of hydropower station the observation conditions and data about supersaturated tdg will become increasingly abundant in this case it is of great significance to establish an efficient machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg alomar et al 2020 and heddam 2017 2019 used different machine learning methods to establish prediction models for supersaturated tdg of some low head hydropower stations in the united states with the data chosen from river hydrology stations the input of machine learning model is mainly spill from dam sp total flow tf barometric pressure bp water temperature t and other factors that can be directly measured see table 6 for details a normalized supersaturated tdg observation mechanism has not been established in china making the observation data of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge far less than alomar and heddam during the discharge of high dam the water flow is broken and aerated in the air the flow turbulence in the stilling basin is strong and the pressure distribution is uneven which makes the formation process of supersaturated tdg more complicated therefore the selection of model input factors based on the generation process of supersaturated tdg will clear the physical meaning the comparison between the model in this paper and that of alomar and heddam is shown in table 6 in view of the above reasons there is a potential problem in directly using the results of alomar and heddamr to predict the generation of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge in order to further verify the applicability of this paper s model the input selected by alomar and heddam was used to replace the input of the model built in this paper the field observation data were used to train and test the model and the prediction effects of the machine learning model under different input were compared and analyzed as shown in fig 10 the results show that the average mae and rmse of the model using the input in this paper are about 1 0 which is obviously better than that of alomar and heddam therefore the model established in this paper is more suitable for the prediction of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge 5 2 optimization of discharge scheme of dagangshan hydropower station based on machine learning the discharge scenarios of two discharge structures discharge tunnel and deep orifices of dagangshan hydropower station were observed during the observation period in order to compare and recommend the optimal discharge schemes the machine learning model constructed in this study is utilized the idea is as follows on the premise of similar discharge conditions the water originally discharged from the discharge tunnel is assumed to be discharged by deep orifices and its downstream tdg saturation would be simulated by the machine learning model of the discharge tunnel at the same time the water originally discharged from the deep orifices is assumed to be discharged by the discharge tunnel and its downstream tdg saturation would be simulated by the machine learning model of the deep orifices machine learning requires numerous and extensive training data to improve its accuracy and generalization ability it is difficult to have satisfactory simulation effects if there is a discrepancy between the testing set and the training set therefore when using machine learning model to simulate different discharge scenario it is necessary to ensure that the new discharge conditions are within the scope of the model s training set discharge conditions are divided by discharge flow according to the original observation data the discharge of dagangshan discharge tunnel is mainly between 700 1620 m3 s and the discharge of deep orifices is mainly between 1310 1340 m3 s single deep orifice and 2580 2680 m3 s double deep orifices that is to say in order to ensure that the simulation data are within the training set of machine learning the discharge tunnel model is able to simulate all single deep orifice conditions discharge while the deep orifices model can only simulate the conditions when the discharge flow of the discharge tunnel is between 1310 1340 m3 s as can be seen from fig 11 there is only one condition that meets the requirement that is when the discharge flow of the discharge tunnel is 1320 m3 s the simulation results as shown in fig 12 indicate that the downstream tdg saturation is lower than the observation results when the discharge tunnel is used to release the discharge flow of single deep orifice which becomes higher when the discharge flow of 1320m3 s is discharged by single deep orifice it can be concluded that when the discharge conditions are similar the tdg saturation downstream of discharge tunnel is lower than that of deep orifices discharge according to the above conclusions eight typical conditions were selected from the observation results to optimize the discharge scheme and the machine learning model was used to simulate the tdg saturation of the optimized scheme table 7 the discharge scheme and corresponding downstream tdg saturation before and after optimization in typical conditions are shown in table 7 it can be seen that when the discharge flow is in the range of 1310 1330 m3 s the tdg saturation of the optimized discharge scheme is 1 5 6 4 lower than the original results when the discharge flow is in the range of 2580 2680 m3 s the tdg saturation of the optimized discharge scheme is 12 0 17 0 lower than the original results the effect of the optimized scheme is obvious the optimal scheme for the discharge of dagangshan hydropower station can be put forward on this basis the discharge tunnel should be a prior choice under the premise of similar discharge conditions and under the requirement of power generation and flood control 6 conclusion in this paper a machine learning prediction model of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge was constructed the main influencing factors determined by the analysis of the generation process of supersaturated tdg were used as the input combination of machine learning model after pca dimensionality reduction which had strong physical significance with simple structure and high efficiency the model served as a powerful tool for rapid assessment of downstream tdg supersaturation risk and discharge scheme drafting and enjoys high practical significance and engineering value the main conclusions are as follows 1 the influencing factors were determined after the analysis of the formation process of supersaturated tdg through correlation analysis seven main influencing factors of supersaturated tdg were obtained namely barometric pressure bp discharge flow q discharge per unit width q upstream and downstream water level difference δ h bubble pressure f in stilling basin retention time ts as well as tdg saturation in front of dam g0 2 the machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg of high dam discharge was established four models including elm svr ga elm and ga svr were obtained it turned out that the prediction results of each machine learning model fit well with the original observations the relative error of simulation results of each model is less than 7 mae is less than 1 6 and rmse is less than 2 5 the prediction ability of the four machine learning models is ranked as ga svr ga elm svr elm 3 the tdg generation level of different discharge structures in dagangshan hydropower station under similar conditions was simulated through machine learning model the results showed that the downstream tdg saturation becomes lower when discharge tunnel discharge based on the findings the optimal scheme for the discharge of dagangshan hydropower station is put forward which is to give priority to the discharge tunnel under the premise of similar discharge conditions and under the requirement of power generation and flood control since the generation mechanism of supersaturated tdg has not been completely clarified and the amount of field observation data of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge remains small the application of existing machine learning models still has some limitations in the future more comprehensive influencing factors for the generation of supersaturated tdg should be refined and more field observations for different discharge scenarios of high dams should be carried out based on this more

15840,supersaturation of total dissolved gas tdg caused by high dam discharge is an ecological risk that cannot be ignored in the operation of hydropower stations the establishment of an efficient and concise tdg generation prediction model is of great significance to the water ecology and water environment protection of hydropower development reaches the flow conditions and the process of water gas mass transfer in discharge and energy dissipation are very complicated and difficult to observe in the field bringing difficulties to the establishment of prediction model and parameter calibration increasingly abundant observations make it possible to establish an efficient machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg in this study extreme learning machine elm and support vector regression svr were used to establish the prediction model the main influencing factors of supersaturated tdg obtained by the analysis of the physical process of the generation of supersaturated tdg were used as the input of the machine learning model then this research took dagangshan hydropower station and xiluodu hydropower station as objects and established machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg with several years of observation data in different discharge scenarios four models including elm svr ga elm and ga svr were obtained through genetic algorithm

introduction to reduce the risk of flooding and ameliorate the energy mix large hydropower stations have been built in southwest china in addition to exerting great flood control benefits and providing enormous clean energy the hydropower station also has adverse effects on the ecological environment among them the supersaturated tdg caused by high dam discharge has become one of the ecological risks that must be paid attention to in reservoir operation qu et al 2011 wan et al 2021 during high dam discharge the flow entrains large amounts of gas and enters the stilling basin the aerated flow dissolves excess gas under high pressure thereby achieving total dissolved gas tdg supersaturation relative to the current environmental condition li et al 2009 lu et al 2019 a large number of field observations and laboratory experiments indicate that supersaturated tdg may lead to bubble disease and even death in fish thus threatening water ecological security geist et al 2013 witt et al 2017 fast and accurate prediction of the generation of downstream supersaturated tdg during discharge is helpful to assess the supersaturated risk in advance adjust the discharge scheduling scheme and provide time for the area of key fish to take early measures ji et al 2021 pleizier et al 2020 thus reducing the adverse effects of supersaturated tdg the prediction of supersaturated tdg is a complex multi factor related issue with highly nonlinear characteristics which can be realized through three models at present including empirical model numerical model as well as mechanical model these three models can indeed produce satisfactory prediction results under certain conditions however they do have limitations in the aspect of application scope conciseness and prediction efficiency respectively the empirical model has limited application due to its less consideration of the generation process of supersaturated tdg columbia basin research 2000 us army corps of engineers 1997 with the in depth understanding of the mechanism of supersaturated tdg and the improvement of computing ability the mechanical model and numerical model have been developed with clearer physical meaning and higher accuracy based on the observations of supersaturated tdg in several high dams such as ertan zipingpu and three gorges and combined with the generation process of supersaturated tdg in stilling basin li et al 2009 established a mechanical model for supersaturated tdg in high dams ma et al 2018 2019 and lu et al 2019 2021 studied the aeration and mass transfer process of water flow during air crushing through experiments and observations and further optimized the mechanical model thanks to them the physical process of the model is clearer and the prediction accuracy is further improved the physical significance of the mechanism analytical model is considered but the process of supersaturated tdg generation remains unclear leading to a complicated process of model establishment with many empirical parameters orlins and gulliver 2000 established a vertical two dimensional single phase flow tdg model based on mass transfer between bubbles and water gas interface by introducing turbulent mathematical model politano and carrica 2007 2009 developed the calculation of supersaturated tdg from two dimensional to three dimensional and introduced the bubble number density equation to calculate the bubble size distribution huang et al 2021a 2021b constructed a three dimensional two phase flow model of tdg saturation based on the aeration process of discharge flow and mass transfer and transport of supersaturated tdg the numerical model can simulate the spatial distribution of supersaturated tdg with high accuracy but it has lots of assumptions and takes a long time to construct the mesh adjust parameters and simulate therefore it is urgent to establish a supersaturated tdg prediction model with simple structure high efficiency and wide application range presently machine learning is instrumental in solving various complex issues compared with traditional methods machine learning does not call for sophisticated math models with an easy model structure and efficient simulation process it is a perfect choice to handle nonlinear problems with many influencing factors many water science fields including hydrology forecast water temperature and wave height prediction have witnessed its performance in gaining good results adnan and mostafa et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 shamshirband et al 2020 sulaiman et al 2019 the increasingly abundant supersaturated tdg observation data makes it possible to establish an efficient machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg some scholars have carried out research on tdg saturation prediction of hydropower station with the help of machine learning the tdg observations they used are mainly derived from monitoring stations of the united states geological survey usgs or of the u s army corps of engineers usace heddam 2017 2019 used water temperature barometric pressure spill from dam and discharge as the input and established multiple tdg saturation machine learning prediction models through several machine learning methods alomar et al 2020 selected discharge flow barometric pressure water temperature and tdg saturation in front of dam as the input combination to establish the prediction model for supersaturated tdg by extreme learning machine and support vector regression the above mentioned models are accurate but the problem lies in that the mechanisms of supersaturated tdg are not considered in the selection of main influencing factors the high accuracy of these models largely depends on the massive monitoring data most of which come from monitoring stations this explains why they are inapplicable for large hydropower stations in southwestern china that have not yet established a normalized monitoring system for supersaturated tdg based on the aforementioned considerations the existing supersaturated tdg observation data needs to be fully used for analyzing and screening the main influencing factors of supersaturated tdg through mechanical and mathematical statistics methods in this way an efficient machine learning prediction model of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge can be established based on the existing observation and research this paper compared and selected the main influencing factors of supersaturated tdg based on its generation mechanism and established efficient prediction models suitable for the tdg saturation in high dam discharge through machine learning the model could be a powerful tool for rapid assessment of downstream tdg supersaturation risk and discharge scheme drafting which is of great significance to the water ecology and water environmental protection of the hydropower development reaches 2 study area and data sets the data used in this study are derived from the supersaturated tdg observations conducted by the author s team at dagangshan hydropower station of dadu river in china during the flood season of 2016 2018 and xiluodu hydropower station of jinsha river in china during the flood season of 2019 2020 dagangshan hydropower station has a maximum dam height of 210m while xiluodu hydropower station has a maximum dam height of 285 5 m the orifice and discharge tunnel discharge mode and ski jump energy dissipation method adopted by these two hydropower stations are representative in china s high dam the locations of dagangshan hydropower station and xiluodu hydropower station are shown in fig 1 during the observation period discharge tunnel and deep orifice were observed at dagangshan hydropower station while only deep orifice was observed at xiluodu hydropower station the current researches can neither make clear the difference between different hydropower stations nor the difference of discharge structures of the same hydropower station for the above reasons it is difficult to establish a machine learning prediction model of supersaturated tdg for multiple dams or multiple discharge structures in view of that this research established supersaturated tdg generation prediction models for dagangshan discharge tunnel deep orifices discharge and xiluodu deep orifices discharge respectively the observation of each discharge scenario is shown in table 1 3 material and methodology 3 1 screening of influencing factors of supersaturated tdg 3 1 1 formation mechanism of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge the generation of supersaturated tdg for high dam discharge is divided into three stages li et al 2009 lu et al 2019 in the first stage the water flows through the discharge structure and entrains a large amount of gas to form aerated water flow then the aerated flow enters the bottom of the stilling basin and rolls gradually to the outlet of the stilling basin under the great pressure and turbulence the gas is over dissolved thus reaching the gas supersaturation relative to the current environmental conditions finally the supersaturated water moves to the surface of stilling basin and near the subsidiary dam during which the pressure decreases rapidly after the rapid release of supersaturated gas in water the saturation tends to be stable but it remains to be supersaturated the formation process of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge is shown in fig 2 3 1 2 influencing factor and its calculation according to the formation mechanism of supersaturated tdg it is preliminarily believed that the influencing factors of supersaturated tdg mainly include 3 kinds with a total of 10 factors they are the discharge situation discharge flow discharge per unit width power generation flow upstream and downstream water level difference energy dissipation efficiency aerated flow bubble pressure and retention time of flow in the stilling basin and initial conditions and external environment tdg saturation in front of dam barometric pressure and water temperature respectively the influence mechanism of each factor on supersaturated tdg is introduced separately in the case of discharge situation the discharge flow mainly determines the water depth in the stilling basin and together with the factor of upstream and downstream water level difference it can decide the initial potential energy of the discharge flow thus further affecting the turbulent intensity of the water flow in the stilling basin discharge per unit width can comprehensively characterize the physical quantities such as velocity momentum and flow turbulence a large number of observation results show that tdg saturation is significantly positively correlated with the discharge flow and discharge per unit width jiang et al 2008 qu et al 2011 tdg saturation of hydropower generation tail water is basically consistent with that of dam front li 2018 which mainly affects the downstream tdg saturation by water mixing the tdg saturation data used in this research have eliminated the influence of hydropower generation tail water in energy dissipation efficiency aeration is one of the necessary conditions for tdg supersaturation however it is generally believed that the water flow has entrained a sufficient amount of gas in the air during the discharge and the aeration amount is much greater than that of the water dissolving in the stilling basin so this study will not take aeration as a direct influence factor ma et al 2018 pressure is the direct cause of gas dissolution experiments show that within 10 standard atmospheric pressure ranges the effective solubility of gas will increase by 10 for one meter increase in water depth urban et al 2008 due to the high velocity and large aeration rate the duration of the flow in stilling basin is far less than the time required to reach the dissolution equilibrium therefore the bubble pressure and retention time in the stilling basin will directly affect the dissolution of gas in the stilling basin in the case of initial conditions and external environment the difference between the initial saturation and the equilibrium saturation serves as the main driving force for the mass transfer of tdg through experiments xue 2019 showed that the initial tdg saturation directly affects the tdg saturation before the water flow enters the stilling basin barometric pressure and water temperature determine the gas solubility of the water and characterize the surrounding environmental conditions during the discharge after the above analysis this paper mainly explores the effects of eight factors on supersaturated tdg including discharge flow q discharge per unit width q upstream and downstream water level difference δ h tdg saturation in front of dam g0 bubble pressure f and retention time ts in stilling basin barometric pressure bp and water temperature t among them discharge flow discharge per unit width power generation flow and upstream and downstream water level difference can be obtained by collecting and analyzing the hydropower station dispatching data factors of tdg saturation in front of dam barometric pressure and water temperature can be achieved by field observation with instruments the bubble pressure in the stilling basin is composed of hydrostatic pressure and hydrodynamic pressure in which hydrodynamic pressure δ p m m h2o is calculated by the eq 1 proposed by liu 2010 1 δ p m 0 95 sin 2 β 0 175 q 2 3 δ h 1 3 g 1 3 h 1 1 3 where β is the angle of discharge flow into water q is discharge per unit width m2 s δ h is the upstream and downstream water level difference m h1 is the water depth m in the stilling basin the water retention time ts s in stilling basin is calculated by eq 2 proposed by lu 2019 2 t s 27 73 λ 0 49 h k g 0 5 l 0 l 1 82 where λ is the dimensionless parameter of the outlet of the stilling basin hk is the water depth in the stilling basin m l0 is the distance m of the discharge flow l is the horizontal distance m from the discharge structure to the end of the stilling basin 3 1 3 screening of influencing factors in this section the above eight influencing factors will be further analyzed through the tdg observation results of dagangshan and xiluodu hydropower station the observation data of dagangshan and xiluodu hydropower stations were collated and the influencing factors were calculated the correlation between tdg saturation and each factor was analyzed through the correlation analysis the generation of supersaturated tdg is a typical nonlinear problem spearman correlation coefficient is a coefficient of measuring the monotonic correlation between two variables without strict requirement for data which can be embodied by that any two variables regardless of their overall distribution and sample size therefore it can be used to determine the correlation between tdg saturation and various factors due to the differences between different hydropower stations and various discharge structures in the same hydropower station three discharge scenarios are analyzed respectively the correlation coefficient calculation results are shown in fig 3 for the spearman correlation coefficient when it is positive it indicates positive correlation and when it is negative it represents negative correlation the closer the absolute value is to 1 the stronger the correlation is this study takes the absolute value of spearman correlation coefficient of 0 4 as the boundary if the absolute value of spearman correlation coefficient is greater than 0 4 with the tdg saturation it will be identified as a correlation factor it can be seen from fig 3 that under all three scenarios the absolute value of spearman correlation coefficient between both discharge flow and retention time with downstream tdg saturation is greater than 0 4 under dagangshan discharge tunnel and xiluodu deep orifices scenarios the absolute value of spearman correlation coefficient among barometric pressure the upstream and downstream water level difference bubble pressure and downstream tdg saturation is greater than 0 4 there is only one scenario where the absolute value of spearman correlation coefficient between both tdg saturation in front of dam and flow per unit width with downstream tdg saturation is greater than 0 4 in all three scenarios there is only one factor water temperature whose spearman correlation coefficient with downstream tdg saturation is less than 0 4 in order to make the machine learning model more representative and accurate the model excludes the water temperature t and takes seven influencing factors such as barometric pressure bp discharge flow q discharge per unit width q upstream and downstream water level difference δ h bubble pressure f and retention time ts in stilling basin tdg saturation in front of dam g0 as the input of the machine learning model 3 2 machine learning model the prediction of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge is a typical multi factor problem with highly nonlinear characteristics at present the amount of field observation data of supersaturated tdg during high dam discharge is still very limited let alone the continuous observation for single discharge scenario the research team s observational data of dagangshan and xiluodu hydropower stations are relatively abundant which is still insufficient for machine learning therefore the ability to deal with both nonlinear problems and small sample data are two key factors to be considered when choosing an appropriate machine learning method based on the above selection principle two models extreme learning machine elm and support vector regression svr stand out in the process of comparison and screening of models 3 2 1 extreme learning machine extreme learning machine is an efficient training algorithm for single layer feedforward neural network slfn unlike other training algorithms the extreme learning machine initializes the synaptic weights and biases of the hidden layer randomly and remains unchanged throughout the training process subsequently the minimum square difference between the network output and the target is taken as the network training target to calculate the output weight after derivation the output weights can be transformed into the product of the moore penrose generalized inverse matrix of the hidden layer output matrix and the target matrix so only the generalized inverse matrix needs to be solved ghazvinei 2018 compared with the traditional training algorithm of slfn the training efficiency of elm algorithm is tremendously improved and the randomly generated synaptic weights and biases of the hidden layer do not affect the approximation ability of slfn as a single hidden layer neural network algorithm elm enjoys strong generalization ability in dealing with small sample problems which endows elm with stronger nonlinear mapping ability and lower computational cost adnan et al 2021 ghazvinei et al 2018 therefore it can be well applied to the prediction of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge suppose that a slfn using elm training algorithm has m input variables xi xi r m i 1 2 n l hidden layer nodes one output value y and a total of n training sets then the structure of this neural network is shown in fig 4 taking the above assumed slfn as an example the input value enters the node of the hidden layer with randomly assigned weights and biases and after the activation function can be output as eq 3 shown 3 h i x j 1 m g i w i x j b i where hi x is the output value of the i th node of the hidden layer g represents the activation function of the hidden layer which is confirmed as sigmoid function after several trial attempts w and b are randomly determined weights and biases in their corresponding activation function all hi x make up the output matrix h the output of the hidden layer is connected to the output of the neural network by the output weight as shown in eq 4 4 y i 1 l β i h i x k ε where βi is the output weight k is the target value and ε is the prediction error the weight matrix of output layer is β the output value matrix is y and the target value matrix is k after the above steps the output weights β that minimizes the prediction error can be obtained by solving the following equations by least square method 5 min β h t β k after further derivation the least squares solution β of eq 6 is 6 β h t k where ht is the moore penrose generalized inverse matrix of the output matrix ht 3 2 2 support vector regression support vector regression is a supervised learning algorithm based on structural risk minimization which is suitable for solving multidimensional nonlinear problems with small and medium training sets sain 1996 besides it can effectively restrain the problem of under fitting and over fitting based on the above reasons it is appropriate to use svr to establish the prediction model of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge svr maps the sample space to the high dimensional feature space through nonlinear functions and converts the original problem into solving a linear fitting problem in this high dimensional space reducing the difficulty of fitting and avoiding the huge amount of calculation in high dimensional space su et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 the objective of svr is to solve a fitting function make sure that all sample fall within the maximum error ε of the fitting function and keep the minimal slope of the fitting function in the feature space the data sample is given as x1 y1 xi yi xn yn where xi rm yi r xi is the input vector yi is the target vector n is the number of samples and m is the dimension of input vector xi svr formulation is as follows 7 f x w φ x b where φ x is a nonlinear function which maps the input data to high dimensional space w and b represents the weight and the biases respectively the optimization problem of svr can be transformed into 8 minimize 1 2 w 2 c 1 n i 1 n l ε y i t i 9 subject to y i w i φ x i b ε where 10 l ε y i t i y i t i ε y i t i ε 0 otherwise the constant c is the penalty coefficient and determines the trade off between the empirical risk and model flatness c 0 and ε is a constant called the radius of the tube that represents the optimization performance lε yi ti represents the loss function in which yi is the actual value and ti is the forecasted value according to eq 10 the loss will be zero when the forecasted value is within the ε tube otherwise the loss will be the distance of the forecasted error and ε fig 5 a depicts the value of lε yi ti since some data may not lie inside the ε tube the slack variables ξ ξ must be introduced in order to enhance the generalization capability of svr slack variables represent the distance from actual values to the boundary of ε tube fig 5 b represents the schematic of svr in the sample space include slack variables now the optimization problem of svr can be transformed into 11 minimize 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i subject to y i w i φ x i b ε ξ i w i φ x i b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 by using lagrangian multipliers of eq 11 and the dual form of the original lagrangian function the final objective function is obtained under karush kuhn tucher condition by solving this objective function the svr formulation can be expressed as follows 12 f x i 1 n α i α i k x i x j b where αi and αi are lagrange multipliers k xi xj φ xj φ xj is called the kernel function which has the same value with the inner products of φ xi and φ xj in the feature space the commonly used kernel functions include polynomial kernel function radial basis function kernel function rbf and sigmoid kernel function with few parameters ref kernel function can effectively fit the complex nonlinear relationship between input and output and ensure high computational efficiency cheng et al 2022 and it is mainly used in the case of inseparability linearity therefore ref kernel function was adopted after comparison and analysis 3 3 machine learning model optimization 3 3 1 principal component analysis pca in machine learning data dimensionality reduction is of great significance to improve learning efficiency and enhance the robustness of the model principal component analysis pca is a commonly used data dimension reduction method by linearly transforming the original data and discarding some information the original variables are replaced by a few independent synthetic variables on the premise of ensuring the minimum loss of data information gajjar et al 2018 based on the observation data this paper reduces the dimension of the influence factor data of supersaturated tdg in each discharge scenario through pca the principal components obtained by dimensionality reduction are independent and are used as the input of the machine learning model to simplify the model s structure and improve its reliability and learning efficiency 3 3 2 genetic algorithm ga genetic algorithm is a global data optimization algorithm derived by imitating the evolutionary process of nature its ultimate goal is to encode the decision variables into chromosomes and assign them randomly to form the initial population and establish the fitness function to screen the optimal results through the selection crossover and mutation of chromosomes adequate individuals are generated and excellent individuals are selected to inherit their information to the next generation until the individuals who meet the termination conditions come out marchetti and wanke 2020 genetic algorithms have good parallelism if one path turns out to be a dead end it would be eliminated and other promising paths will be continued meanwhile the unique algorithm structure of ga can keep it away from getting local optimal solution in this research ga is used to optimize elm and svr machine learning models respectively ga elm the synaptic weights and biases of hidden layer in elm algorithm are assigned randomly while only the weights of output layer call for calculation however the difference of the training results caused by the random weights and biases play an unstable role in obtaining the optimal performance of the model ga could stand out to find the optimal initial weights and biases for elm model which can enjoy higher fitting accuracy in ga elm model the gene of each chromosome is the weights and biases of hidden layer of a elm network flowchart of the ga elm algorithm is shown in fig 6 ga svr penalty factor c pipe width ε kernel function parameters and other parameters call for determination in svr model however there is no reliable way at present to get these parameters therefore this research used the global optimization ability of genetic algorithm to determine the optimal parameters so as to improve the efficiency of svr model the genes of each chromosome in ga svr model are penalty factor c pipe width ε and kernel function parameters the flow of chart ga svr is shown in fig 7 3 4 model evaluation the effect of supersaturated tdg prediction model is mainly judged by fitting effect chart and statistical indicators statistical indicators include mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse which are expressed as follows 13 m a e 1 n i 1 n y p y o 14 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y p y o 2 where n represents the number of calculated samples yp and yo represent the model prediction results and the actual measurement results respectively the smaller mae and rmse the better the prediction effect of the model 4 results four machine learning prediction models including elm ga elm svr and ga svr for the generation of supersaturated tdg of high dam discharge were constructed in this study the model allocates observations in a ratio of about 3 1 between training and testing data and all data sets are randomly selected from the original observation data to ensure the reliability and generalization ability of the model 4 1 principal component analysis results the input of each model is the linear combination of supersaturated tdg influence factors after dimension reduction by pca and the output is the downstream tdg saturation table 2 shows the pca results of the impact factor data under the three discharge scenarios 4 2 model adjustment results some parameters need to be determined while the machine learning model selected in this paper and its corresponding optimization algorithm enjoy satisfactory effects inspired by relevant scholars research adnan et al 2021 darwiche et al 2022 mei et al 2017 and with several trial calculations and adjustments the parameter selection of each model and genetic algorithm in the three discharge scenarios are shown in tables 3 and 4 in table 3 the svr parameters in ga svr are the initial settings before the genetic algorithm runs and the final parameters are calculated by the genetic algorithm 4 3 prediction results and analysis the fitting effect of simulated value and measured value and statistical indexes of mae and rmse were used to evaluate the prediction effect of each model fig 8 shows the fitting effect of the predicted values of the models and the observed values in the testing set of the three discharge scenarios it can be seen from fig 8 a that the relative errors between the simulated tdg saturation of elm ga elm svr and ga svr models and the original observed values are all less than 5 during the flood discharge of dagangshan spillway tunnel in terms of trend fitting the simulation results of elm ga elm and ga svr are basically consistent with the change trend of the observed values and the change trend of svr simulation results is relatively gentle compared with that of the original values according to fig 8 b the relative errors of tdg saturation simulated by ga elm svr and ga svr models are less than 5 in dagangshan deep orifices discharge scenario and the relative error of a simulated value in elm model is 6 24 the variation trend of the simulation results is basically consistent with the observed values according to fig 8 c the maximum relative errors between the simulated tdg saturation of elm ga elm svr and ga svr models and the observed values are 6 94 5 68 5 02 and 4 76 respectively in xiluodu deep orifices discharge scenario only the relative error of ga svr model simulation results is less than 5 after removing two larger error values the accuracy of each model is higher with a basically consistent change trend between simulation and observation therefore from the perspective of fitting accuracy and trend all the four machine learning models can better simulate the generation of supersaturated tdg among which ga elm and ga svr models enjoy better fitting results in the simulation of training and testing set under various discharge scenarios the calculation results and comparison of mae and rmse of elm ga elm svr and ga svr models are shown in table 5 and fig 9 under the three discharge scenarios of dagangshan discharge tunnel dagangshan deep orifices and xiluodu deep orifices the mae values of ga svr model simulation testing data are 0 95 1 06 and 1 37 respectively and the rmse values are 1 43 1 45 and 2 00 respectively all of which are the minimum values of corresponding models it can also be found in the box diagram fig 9b d containing the simulation results of training and testing set that the medians of mae and rmse values of ga svr are smaller than those of other models which are 0 96 and 1 40 respectively therefore ga svr is the optimal model of four supersaturated tdg prediction models the performance of other models are shown in table 5 and fig 9 which indicates that the ga elm model has better effect followed by the svr model and elm has the worst simulation effect among the four models under three discharge scenarios mae values of ga elm model in simulating the testing set are 1 14 1 31 and 1 42 respectively which are 0 40 0 25 and 0 41 lower than those obtained in elm model 0 09 higher than that of svr model in dagangshan deep orifices discharge scenario and 0 10 and 0 23 lower than that of svr model in dagangshan discharge tunnel and xiluodu deep orifices scenario respectively rmse values under the three discharge scenarios are 1 61 1 48 and 2 18 respectively which are 0 19 0 68 and 0 27 lower than those of elm model and 0 33 0 11 and 0 01 lower than those of svr model according to the boxplot containing the simulation results of training and testing set fig 9b d the medians of mae and rmse values of ga elm model are 1 14 and 1 53 respectively lower than 1 45 and 1 87 of elm model and 1 34 and 1 87 of svr model in conclusion according to the generation simulation results and analysis of supersaturated tdg under three discharge scenarios the prediction ability of the four machine learning models established in this research is ranked as ga svr ga elm svr elm 5 discussion 5 1 applicability analysis of machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge compared with mechanical and numerical model machine learning model has no need for complex mathematical models and calibration parameters instead it relies on the powerful nonlinear mapping ability to mine the relationship between data the four supersaturated tdg machine learning prediction models established in this research are accurate efficient and time saving mechanical and numerical simulation models are more suitable for hydropower stations lacking monitoring data such as hydropower stations in the initial stage of design or construction some parameters in these models need to be obtained by analogy with similar hydropower stations prediction of tdg saturation by these two type of models can serve as an important reference for hydropower station design and discharge scheme formulation after the construction of hydropower station the observation conditions and data about supersaturated tdg will become increasingly abundant in this case it is of great significance to establish an efficient machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg alomar et al 2020 and heddam 2017 2019 used different machine learning methods to establish prediction models for supersaturated tdg of some low head hydropower stations in the united states with the data chosen from river hydrology stations the input of machine learning model is mainly spill from dam sp total flow tf barometric pressure bp water temperature t and other factors that can be directly measured see table 6 for details a normalized supersaturated tdg observation mechanism has not been established in china making the observation data of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge far less than alomar and heddam during the discharge of high dam the water flow is broken and aerated in the air the flow turbulence in the stilling basin is strong and the pressure distribution is uneven which makes the formation process of supersaturated tdg more complicated therefore the selection of model input factors based on the generation process of supersaturated tdg will clear the physical meaning the comparison between the model in this paper and that of alomar and heddam is shown in table 6 in view of the above reasons there is a potential problem in directly using the results of alomar and heddamr to predict the generation of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge in order to further verify the applicability of this paper s model the input selected by alomar and heddam was used to replace the input of the model built in this paper the field observation data were used to train and test the model and the prediction effects of the machine learning model under different input were compared and analyzed as shown in fig 10 the results show that the average mae and rmse of the model using the input in this paper are about 1 0 which is obviously better than that of alomar and heddam therefore the model established in this paper is more suitable for the prediction of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge 5 2 optimization of discharge scheme of dagangshan hydropower station based on machine learning the discharge scenarios of two discharge structures discharge tunnel and deep orifices of dagangshan hydropower station were observed during the observation period in order to compare and recommend the optimal discharge schemes the machine learning model constructed in this study is utilized the idea is as follows on the premise of similar discharge conditions the water originally discharged from the discharge tunnel is assumed to be discharged by deep orifices and its downstream tdg saturation would be simulated by the machine learning model of the discharge tunnel at the same time the water originally discharged from the deep orifices is assumed to be discharged by the discharge tunnel and its downstream tdg saturation would be simulated by the machine learning model of the deep orifices machine learning requires numerous and extensive training data to improve its accuracy and generalization ability it is difficult to have satisfactory simulation effects if there is a discrepancy between the testing set and the training set therefore when using machine learning model to simulate different discharge scenario it is necessary to ensure that the new discharge conditions are within the scope of the model s training set discharge conditions are divided by discharge flow according to the original observation data the discharge of dagangshan discharge tunnel is mainly between 700 1620 m3 s and the discharge of deep orifices is mainly between 1310 1340 m3 s single deep orifice and 2580 2680 m3 s double deep orifices that is to say in order to ensure that the simulation data are within the training set of machine learning the discharge tunnel model is able to simulate all single deep orifice conditions discharge while the deep orifices model can only simulate the conditions when the discharge flow of the discharge tunnel is between 1310 1340 m3 s as can be seen from fig 11 there is only one condition that meets the requirement that is when the discharge flow of the discharge tunnel is 1320 m3 s the simulation results as shown in fig 12 indicate that the downstream tdg saturation is lower than the observation results when the discharge tunnel is used to release the discharge flow of single deep orifice which becomes higher when the discharge flow of 1320m3 s is discharged by single deep orifice it can be concluded that when the discharge conditions are similar the tdg saturation downstream of discharge tunnel is lower than that of deep orifices discharge according to the above conclusions eight typical conditions were selected from the observation results to optimize the discharge scheme and the machine learning model was used to simulate the tdg saturation of the optimized scheme table 7 the discharge scheme and corresponding downstream tdg saturation before and after optimization in typical conditions are shown in table 7 it can be seen that when the discharge flow is in the range of 1310 1330 m3 s the tdg saturation of the optimized discharge scheme is 1 5 6 4 lower than the original results when the discharge flow is in the range of 2580 2680 m3 s the tdg saturation of the optimized discharge scheme is 12 0 17 0 lower than the original results the effect of the optimized scheme is obvious the optimal scheme for the discharge of dagangshan hydropower station can be put forward on this basis the discharge tunnel should be a prior choice under the premise of similar discharge conditions and under the requirement of power generation and flood control 6 conclusion in this paper a machine learning prediction model of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge was constructed the main influencing factors determined by the analysis of the generation process of supersaturated tdg were used as the input combination of machine learning model after pca dimensionality reduction which had strong physical significance with simple structure and high efficiency the model served as a powerful tool for rapid assessment of downstream tdg supersaturation risk and discharge scheme drafting and enjoys high practical significance and engineering value the main conclusions are as follows 1 the influencing factors were determined after the analysis of the formation process of supersaturated tdg through correlation analysis seven main influencing factors of supersaturated tdg were obtained namely barometric pressure bp discharge flow q discharge per unit width q upstream and downstream water level difference δ h bubble pressure f in stilling basin retention time ts as well as tdg saturation in front of dam g0 2 the machine learning prediction model for supersaturated tdg of high dam discharge was established four models including elm svr ga elm and ga svr were obtained it turned out that the prediction results of each machine learning model fit well with the original observations the relative error of simulation results of each model is less than 7 mae is less than 1 6 and rmse is less than 2 5 the prediction ability of the four machine learning models is ranked as ga svr ga elm svr elm 3 the tdg generation level of different discharge structures in dagangshan hydropower station under similar conditions was simulated through machine learning model the results showed that the downstream tdg saturation becomes lower when discharge tunnel discharge based on the findings the optimal scheme for the discharge of dagangshan hydropower station is put forward which is to give priority to the discharge tunnel under the premise of similar discharge conditions and under the requirement of power generation and flood control since the generation mechanism of supersaturated tdg has not been completely clarified and the amount of field observation data of supersaturated tdg in high dam discharge remains small the application of existing machine learning models still has some limitations in the future more comprehensive influencing factors for the generation of supersaturated tdg should be refined and more field observations for different discharge scenarios of high dams should be carried out based on this more advanced machine learning methods will be tried to establish a prediction model of supersaturated tdg with better prediction effect and wider application range declaration of competing interest the

15841,during the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic wastewater surveillance has become an important tool for monitoring the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 within communities in particular reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr has been used to detect and quantify sars cov 2 rna in wastewater while monitoring viral genome mutations requires separate approaches such as deep sequencing a high throughput sequencing platform atoplex that uses a multiplex tiled pcr based enrichment technique has shown promise in detecting variants of concern voc while also providing virus quantitation data however detection sensitivities of both rt qpcr and sequencing can be impacted through losses occurring during sample handling virus concentration nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr therefore process limit of detection plod assessments are required to estimate the gene copies of target molecule to attain specific probability of detection in this study we compare the plod of four rt qpcr assays us cdc n1 and n2 china cdc n and orf1ab for detection of sars cov 2 to that of atoplex sequencing by seeding known concentrations of gamma irradiated sars cov 2 into wastewater results suggest that among the rt qpcr assays us cdc n1 was the most sensitive especially at lower sars cov 2 seed levels however when results from all rt qpcr assays were combined it resulted in greater detection rates than individual assays suggesting that application of multiple assays is better suited for the trace detection of sars cov 2 from wastewater samples furthermore while atoplex offers a promising approach to sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance this approach appears to be less sensitive compared to rt qpcr under the experimental conditions of this study and may require further refinements nonetheless the combination of rt qpcr and atoplex may be a powerful tool to simultaneously detect quantify sars cov 2 rna and monitor emerging voc in wastewater samples graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sars cov 2 covid 19 detection limit recovery concentration method enveloped virus wastewater 1 introduction over the past two years wastewater surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has grown to become a valuable tool for tracking coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 at the population level in many countries and regions https arcg is 1aummw furthermore many studies have described the potential of wastewater surveillance to provide early warning of covid 19 in the community medema et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 hata et al 2021 making it a valuable tool for public health agencies for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr and digital pcr rt dpcr have been widely applied ahmed et al 2020a ciesielski et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021 pecson et al 2021 gonzalez et al 2020 the advantages of pcr based assays include high sensitivity specificity and speed results can be obtained in 1 to 1 5 h a well optimized rt qpcr assay can theoretically detect a single dna rna molecules in a sample bustin et al 2009 however the assay limit of detection alod of currently used rt qpcr assays for wastewater surveillance varies widely sometimes up to two orders of magnitude within and between laboratories gonzalez et al 2020 bivins et al 2021 chik et al 2021 gerrity et al 2021 since the first publication of the sars cov 2 genome in january 2020 many rt qpcr assays have been developed including gene targets 67 158 bp fragments within nucleocapsid n envelope protein e rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp open reading frame orf membrane protein m and surface protein s regions of the sars cov 2 genome 30 000 bp kitajima et al 2020 despite the high analytical and diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of these assays in the clinical context their success in early detection of sars cov 2 rna circulating in community wastewater is somewhat mixed the high dilution and fragmentation of viral rna in wastewater pushes this technology to the limit and there is an ongoing need to improve method detection sensitivity and minimize false negative results ahmed et al 2020b limitations of rt qpcr include potentially reduced efficiency if mutations occur in the gene target region as was previously observed for assays targeting the s gene for the alpha variant in the uk grint et al 2021 another limitation of rt qpcr is low throughput only one genomic target can be analysed at a time to help overcome these limitations studies have used multiple rt qpcr assays for the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater ahmed et al 2020a medema et al 2020 however this can be time consuming while the issue of time could be resolved by developing multiplex rt qpcr assays that requires additional and more complex method optimization furthermore multiplex assay may not be as sensitive as a simplex assay parker et al 2015 several recent studies have highlighted the potential application of genome sequencing for sars cov 2 and its variants of concern voc detection in wastewater for example fontenele et al 2021 analysed wastewater using high throughput sequencing and single nucleotide variant analysis of sequences to describe sars cov 2 genetic lineage variations and population structure circulating within a community the sars cov 2 sequence data generated from wastewater indicated that there were more lineages circulating across communities than identified in the clinical data similarly it was demonstrated that metagenomic sequencing of wastewater samples could not only identify sars cov 2 and other viruses but track voc of the former concomitantly with those detected by clinical surveillance in california usa crits christoph et al 2021 this study also detected sars cov 2 voc in california wastewater not yet identified clinically in the state but present in other jurisdictions as well as completely novel voc indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for viral lineages before they are detected by clinical sequencing crits christoph et al 2021 izquierdo lara et al 2021 used nanopore sequencing of wastewater samples to evaluate the diversity of sars cov 2 at the community level in the netherlands and belgium phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of the most prevalent clades and clustering of wastewater samples with clinical samples from patients in the same region the authors also identified 57 unique mutations that were not present in the global database that like the other studies indicates heterogeneity of sars cov 2 variation in wastewater is greater than in clinically derived samples this might reflect the presence of defective viral particles in feces and or infections with novel virions along similar lines lin et al 2021 applied targeted metagenomic sequencing of sars cov 2 in wastewater and observed that the frequency and daily load of mutations associated with voc were highly correlated with clinical incidence rates within the region of british columbia canada taken together it is apparent that genomic sequencing of wastewater samples can be used to investigate the diversity of sars cov 2 circulating in a community and potentially identify new outbreaks genomic sequencing of wastewater may not only shed light on the evolution of sars cov 2 during an outbreak by identifying viral mutations but it could also be applied as an approach for quantifying genomic fragments of sars cov 2 as well a recent study used a high throughput sequencing platform atoplex that uses a multiplex tiled pcr based enrichment technique and reported that atoplex is capable of quantifying sars cov 2 rna in wastewater at concentrations that are at least one order of magnitude lower than rt qpcr quantitation ni et al 2021 this study compared the detection sensitivities of rt qpcr assays i e us cdc n1 and n2 and atoplex using a dilution series of cdna samples generated from a commercially available sars cov 2 rna positive control rather than seeding sars cov 2 in wastewater samples therefore the impacts of wastewater matrix interference on the atoplex assay limit of detection alod are not known collectively these studies demonstrate the potential application of sequencing approaches for monitoring the presence and allelic frequencies of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater along with clinical data sequencing approaches can potentially identify emerging voc of clinical importance within a community however benchmarking rt qpcr and sequencing approaches has not yet been assessed and requires further investigations the process limit of detection plod represents the analytical sensitivity of a sampling method after incorporating the efficiency of all the processing steps e g sample handling concentration nucleic acid extraction and pcr assays the plod estimates the copy number of a target molecule required in the wastewater sample matrix to achieve a specific probability of detection the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the plod of four rt qpcr assays us cdc n1 and n2 china cdc n and orf1ab ccdc n and ccdc orf1ab and atoplex sequencing for the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater this was achieved by seeding a dilution series of known concentrations of gamma irradiated sars cov 2 virions into wastewater followed by primary concentration nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr and atoplex sequencing to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to provide important insights on the analytical limitations for trace detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater using rt qpcr and atoplex sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 gamma irradiated sars cov 2 stock gamma irradiated

al 2020a 2 3 sars cov 2 seeding experiments two trials a and b were conducted to determine the detection sensitivity of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples by rt qpcr and atoplex sequencing workflows a dilution series with varying concentrations of gamma irradiated sars cov 2 were seeded into wastewater the dilution series had 10 fold decrements and were prepared by diluting the stock suspension using dnase and rnase free water and then seeding these serial dilutions into 50 ml wastewater samples for the trials a and b the seeded sars cov 2 concentrations ranged from 2 32 105 to 2 32 102 gc

a precellys 24 tissue homogenizer bertin technologies montigny le bretonneux fr was used for the homogenization of the sample precellys was set for 3 15 s at 10 000 rpm at a 10 s interval the bead beating tubes were centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min to separate the lysate from the pellet debris the resultant sample lysate was used for the nucleic acid extraction with two minor modifications i the use of dnase i solution was omitted to isolate both rna and dna ii 200 µl of dnase and rnase free water was used to eluate nucleic acid instead of 100 µl a denovix spectrophotometer fluorometer wilmington de usa was used to determine the purity of extracted nucleic acid by measuring 260 280 ratio 2 6 inhibition assessment known quantities 1 5 104 gc of murine hepatitis virus mhv were seeded into each homogenized lysate as an inhibition process control the same quantity of mhv was also added to a distilled water extraction control followed by nucleic acid extraction an mhv rt qpcr assay was used to determine pcr inhibition in nucleic acid samples extracted from wastewater besselsen et al 2002 the reference quantification cycle cq values obtained for nucleic acid samples mhv seeded into the distilled water were compared with the cq values of the mhv seeded into wastewater lysate to assess potential rt qpcr inhibition ahmed et al 2022a if the cq value resulting from the sample was greater than two cycles different from the reference cq value for the distilled water control the sample was interpreted as inhibited ahmed et al 2018 2 7 rt qpcr analysis for mhv besselsen et al

ccdc n1 44 4 rt qpcr assays the frequency of sars cov 2 rna detection at the 10 3 dilution containing 1 79 102 gc 50 ml of wastewater by all assays were lower than the 10 2 dilution at the 10 3 dilution in trial a the detection rate 66 6 by the us cdc n1 was greater than us cdc n2 11 1 ccdc n1 33 3 and ccdc orf1ab 11 1 however combined unique positive and negative results from all four rt

in trial b at 10 3 dilution detection rates of the us cdc n1 55 5 and ccdc orf1ab 66 6 assays outperformed us cdc n2 22 2 and ccdc n1 11 1 assays an increased detection rate 77 7 was observed when results from all rt qpcr assays were combined in comparison to results from any single rt qpcr assay which ranged from 11 1 to 55 5 atoplex sequencing produced three positives of nine seeded wastewater samples and the detection rate 33 3 was greater than the us cdc n2 22 2 and ccdc n1 11 1 assays but lower than us cdc n1 and ccdc orf1ab both 55 5 between trials a and b the us cdc n1 assay detection rates were relatively consistent while the us cdc n2 and ccdc orf1ab detection rates were greater for trial b than a and the ccdc n1 detection rate was greater for trial a than b fisher s exact test table 4 indicated no difference p 0 999 in the sars cov 2 rna positivity rate between rt qpcr assays individual and combined and atoplex when seeding concentrations were greater than 4 log10 gc 50 ml at the 3 log10 gc 50 ml seeding concentration positivity rates between individual rt qpcr assays and atoplex sequencing were still not significantly different p 0 121 however when unique detections were combined across all assays sars cov 2 rna positivity by rt qpcr was significantly greater than by atoplex p 0 041 at the lowest seeding concentration 2 log10 gc 50 ml sars cov 2 rna positivity was significantly greater by the us cdc n1 p 0 041 assay individually and all rt qpcr assays combined p 0 001 than by atoplex conversely the us cdc n2 ccdc n1 and ccdc orf1ab rt ppcr assays did not yield significantly different positivity from atoplex sequencing p 0 711 for the lowest two dilutions 10 2 and 10 3 of the nine sars cov 2 seeded wastewaters in each trial the mean cq values of rt qpcr assays were compared to the atoplex positive samples and the number of atoplex mapped sites table 5 in trial a at 10 2 dilution the atoplex produced positive results when the cq values of us cdc n1 and ccdc n1 rt qpcr assays ranged between 32 4 and 41 5 mean cq 36 7 and 35 3 to 37 9 mean cq 36 8 respectively in the trial b at 10 2 dilution atoplex yielded positive results when the cq values of the rt qpcr assays ranged between 34 4 and 39 6 mean cq 36 3 at this dilution three samples were classified as negative by atoplex when the rt qpcr assay in both trials being cq values ranged between 34 6 and 40 3 average cq 36 4 most instances cq values were greater than 35 in trial a and cq values were 35 in trial b for the trial a 10 3 dilution the majority of the samples were classified as negative by atoplex compared to rt qpcr and the cq vales of these positive samples were 35 for the trial b 10 3 dilution the majority of the samples were classified as negative by atoplex compared to rt qpcr with cq vales of these rt qpcr positive samples 35 interestingly sample ww36 was negative by all rt qpcr assays but atoplex mapped to 40 sars cov 2 genomic loci and was classified as positive 4 discussion multiple studies have reported the application of sequencing methods to detect and quantify the sars cov 2 virus and its voc in wastewater these methods were developed for clinical use but have been applied for the analysis of wastewater samples these include tiled amplicon approaches such as a nanopore based method utilizing 89 primer sets izquierdo lara et al 2021 oude munnink et al 2020 or ones that employ artic primer sets lin et al 2021 rios et al 2021 swift et al 2021 other tiling amplicon approaches include atoplex utilizing 259 primer sets ni et al 2021 or illumina sequencing with the swift nomalase amplicon sars cov 2 panel snap panel fontenele et al 2021 an oligo based enrichment capture approach has also been used crits christoph et al 2021 most of these studies were conducted in countries with high covid 19 prevalence such as usa canada belgium france and netherlands however analysis of wastewater based sars cov 2 detection sensitivities between sequencing i e targeting multiple genomic loci and rt qpcr i e targeting a single genomic locus has not been performed in view of this we compared diagnostic sensitivities from several rt qpcr assays and atoplex amplicon based sequencing by seeding serially diluted gamma irradiated sars cov 2 in wastewater we present detection results by rt qpcr and atoplex sequencing workflows for scenarios when the seeded numbers of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples are moderate to low 105 to 102 gc 50 ml while the data from this study allows a cross comparison among rt qpcr assays however making a direct comparison between rt qpcr assays and atoplex sequencing is difficult due to several differences in processing and worflow namely the rt qpcr assays used in this study are one step rt and pcr included in the same tube while atoplex sequencing is a two step multiplex pcr which amplifies the rna target region in a single tube and sequencing involved preparation of circularized single strand dna from rna another significant difference between these two strategies is that rt qpcr assays target a small fragment of the genome 60 to 160 bp while atoplex utilizes 259 primer sets along the sars cov 2 genome with amplicon tiles ranging in size from 159 to 199 bp there are also differences in input nucleic acid concentrations kits and in the designation of samples to positive or negative detections this study was carefully designed to include a number of wastewater samples to capture the inherent variations in the wastewater matrix rather than using a bulk wastewater two trials of experiments were conducted to obtain confirmatory results after seeding sars cov 2 in wastewater sample processing rna extraction and analysis were undertaken within 48 h to avoid rna degradation the purity of extracted nucleic acid was checked and rt pcr inhibition was assessed for both trials and seeding dilutions consistent sars cov 2 detections was achieved for rt qpcr assays and atoplex at the two higher seeding levels suggesting that detection using the adsorption extraction concentration method is quite robust when the numbers of seeded sars cov 2 on the order of 104 to 105 gc 50 ml however detection rates decreased at dilutions 10 2 and 10 3 by both rt qpcr and atoplex sequencing this is probably due to sub sampling error which can introduce errors in rna detection at low viral concentrations taylor et al 2019 after concentration some wastewater rna samples may contain 10 50 gc in a volume of 100 µl rna since we analyzed only a portion of the 200 µl rna 5 µl per rt qpcr and 10 µl for atoplex sequencing this will result in stochastic detection the impacts of sub sampling error in wastewater samples with low target rna concentrations have been discussed thoroughly ahmed et al 2022b while mhv seeding analysis suggested the absence of pcr inhibitors however the presence of low levels of inhibition could not be ruled out among the rt qpcr assays the detection rate of us cdc n1 assay was greater than other assays suggesting application of this assay may be advantageous when the level of sars cov 2 is low or near the limit of detection in wastewater however combining results from multiple rt qpcr assays produced a greater detection rate than the individual assays alone multiple assays including us cdc n1 should be used for trace detections and to avoid potential false negative results due to mismatches in the primer target sequence from mutations interestingly atoplex sequencing was not as sensitive as the us cdc n1 nor combined rt qpcr assay results despite its use of 259 multiplexed primer sets to amplify the sars cov 2 genome and despite 2 fold greater rna input in this study design a recent study has highlighted the potential application of atoplex sequencing for wastewater surveillance and reported that atoplex sequencing was capable of quantifying sars cov 2 rna at concentrations at least one order of magnitude lower than the detection limit of rt qpcr ni et al 2021 however atoplex and rt qpcr comparison was undertaken using a commercial rna positive control diluted in water and did not account for matrix interference or loss through viral concentration and rna extraction therefore a direct comparison of results from ni et al 2021 and this study is not possible targeting multiple loci along the sars cov 2 genome is expected to enhance sensitivity in a matrix such as wastewater where multiple species of viral rna are likely present i e fragmented genomic sub genomic in non stoichiometric amounts on the other hand this may increase error in wastewater surveillance where some of these primers may amplify off target sequences from other microorganisms also present in wastewater therefore a cut off of 5 amplicon tile mapping sites was used to designate a sample positive or negative with atoplex sequencing we acknowledge that in this study for atoplex multiple replicates were not used which could have reduced the detection sensitivity while the atoplex sequencing assay was not as sensitive as the us cdc n1 nor the combined rt qpcr assay results it nonetheless had similar sensitivity to three commonly utilized rt qpcr assays us cdc n2 ccdc n1 and ccdc orf1ab when analyzed independently at the lowest seed concentration 10 3 dilution this demonstrates that atoplex could be utilized not only for monitoring for voc but also for positive negative detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples however based on the observed trends in decreasing mapping rates and breadth of coverage with decreasing sars cov 2 concentrations the atoplex method seems more suited for wastewaters with medium to high viral concentrations e g at or above the 10 2 dilution level previous studies utilizing genomic sequencing of sars cov 2 in wastewater have observed mixed trends in genome coverage versus viral concentration based on the different methods employed crits christoph et al 2021 used hybridization based probe capture followed by metatranscriptomic sequencing and observed no correlation between the relative abundance of sars cov 2 and gc quantified by rt qpcr using multiplex tiling pcr with 500 bp amplicons for viral enrichment followed by sequencing with nanopore izquierdo lara et al 2021 found an inverse sigmoidal correlation between the breadth of genome coverage and the cq values of both the n2 and the e primers probe sets within a range of cq values from 27 to 36 however using multiplex tiling pcr with shorter amplicons swift normalase amplicon sars cov 2 panel fontenele et al 2021 did not observe any correlation between breadth of coverage and rt qpcr cq values in the range of 27 and 36 even though there was an apparent decreasing trend in depth of genome coverage with increasing cq thus the sensitivity of multiplex tiling pcr assays may be dependent on aspects of the primer panel design such as amplicon length such effects were systematically explored by lin et al 2021 by conducting a comparison of three different multiplex tiling pcr primer sets of different amplicon length 150 bp 400 bp 1200 bp with the same wastewater samples with cq values ranging from 29 to 36 which revealed that shorter amplicons e g 150 bp swift biosciences were less succeptible to decreasing detection rates at lower viral concentrations however it is also apparent that trade offs exist in the design of multiplex tiling pcr assays as lin et al 2021 found lower mapping rates and depth of genome coverage at high viral concentrations using the 150 bp amplicon panel versus 400 bp and 1200 bp which was attributed to more primer primer interactions and higher off target amplification rates as the atoplex assay used here relied on shorter amplicons 159 to 199 bp it is thus possible that observed detection sensitivity was impacted by higher rates of off target amplification and primer primer interactions it has also been shown that the sensitivity of multiplex tiling pcr is dependent on the wastewater matrix and or extraction method lin et al 2021 therefore it may be possible to optimize the sensitivity of multiplex tiling pcr for the application of sars cov 2 detection based on a combined selection of wastewater matrix type extraction method and multiplex primer assay design beyond what is presented in this current study here we show that the plod of rt qpcr for the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater was lower than that of atoplex therefore for applications where positive negative detection is critical and wastewater viral concentrations are low rt qpcr could be the preferred method there are additional benefits of rt qpcr such as its shorter turnaround time within 4 5 h from concentration to results for rt qpcr versus 48 60 h for atoplex as well as its lower cost per sample however the application of multiplex tiling pcr based sequencing offers several critical advantages for wastewater surveillance such as the ability to detect and monitor voc it could also be argued that sequencing provides more convincing detection of sars cov 2 genomic fragments at low viral concentrations with verification via read mapping at multiple sites across the genome as high cq values in rt qpcr can be difficult to discern between true detection from non target amplification for non specific rt qpcr assays this is especially an issue for the complex wastewater matrix compared to human clinical specimens and thus more opportunity for off target amplification or spurious probe hydrolysis therefore a strategy of frequent rt qpcr testing e g daily complemented by periodic multiplex tiling pcr sequencing e g weekly or fortnightly may represent a powerful combination for monitoring sars cov 2 concentrations and evolutionary dynamics throughout the covid 19 pandemic 5 conclusions among the four rt qpcr assays tested us cdc n1 us cdc n2 ccdc n ccdc orf1ab the us cdc n1 assay outperformed all other assays as well as atoplex sequencing especially in instances when sars cov 2 levels were close to detection thresholds combining multiple rt qpcr assays can increase sars cov 2 detection sensitivity over any individual assay this approach may be especially useful when sars cov 2 levels in wastewater are low while minimizing false negative results arising from mismatches in primer design due to viral genome mutations the atoplex sequencing displayed similar or relatively lesser sensitivity to rt qpcr assays in instances of low sars cov 2 concentrations but performance may be dependent on primer panel design features such as amplicon length or other variables such as wastewater matrix virus concentration and nucleic acid extraction the plod for rt qpcr assays for sars cov 2 detection in wastewater was lower than atoplex sequencing however combination of both approaches could boost detection sensitivity while enabling identification of voc as they emerge disclaimers the

15841,during the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic wastewater surveillance has become an important tool for monitoring the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 within communities in particular reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr has been used to detect and quantify sars cov 2 rna in wastewater while monitoring viral genome mutations requires separate approaches such as deep sequencing a high throughput sequencing platform atoplex that uses a multiplex tiled pcr based enrichment technique has shown promise in detecting variants of concern voc while also providing virus quantitation data however detection sensitivities of both rt qpcr and sequencing can be impacted through losses occurring during sample handling virus concentration nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr therefore process limit of detection plod assessments are required to estimate the gene copies of target molecule to attain specific probability of detection in this study we compare the plod of four rt qpcr assays us cdc n1 and n2 china cdc n and orf1ab for detection of sars cov 2 to that of atoplex sequencing by seeding known concentrations of gamma irradiated sars cov 2 into wastewater results suggest that among the rt qpcr assays us cdc n1 was the most sensitive especially at lower sars cov 2 seed levels however when results from all rt qpcr assays were combined it resulted in greater detection rates than individual assays suggesting that application of multiple assays is better suited for the trace detection of sars cov 2 from wastewater samples furthermore while atoplex offers a promising approach to sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance this approach appears to be less sensitive compared to rt qpcr under the experimental conditions of this study and may require further refinements nonetheless the combination of rt qpcr and atoplex may be a powerful tool to simultaneously detect quantify sars cov 2 rna and monitor emerging voc in wastewater samples graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sars cov 2 covid 19 detection limit recovery concentration method enveloped virus wastewater 1 introduction over the past two years wastewater surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has grown to become a valuable tool for tracking coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 at the population level in many countries and regions https arcg is 1aummw furthermore many studies have described the potential of wastewater surveillance to provide early warning of covid 19 in the community medema et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 hata et al 2021 making it a valuable tool for public health agencies for the detection and quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr and digital pcr rt dpcr have been widely applied ahmed et al 2020a ciesielski et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021 pecson et al 2021 gonzalez et al 2020 the advantages of pcr based assays include high sensitivity specificity and speed results can be obtained in 1 to 1 5 h a well optimized rt qpcr assay can theoretically detect a single dna rna molecules in a sample bustin et al 2009 however the assay limit of detection alod of currently used rt qpcr assays for wastewater surveillance varies widely sometimes up to two orders of magnitude within and between laboratories gonzalez et al 2020 bivins et al 2021 chik et al 2021 gerrity et al 2021 since the first publication of the sars cov 2 genome in january 2020 many rt qpcr assays have been developed including gene targets 67 158 bp fragments within nucleocapsid n envelope protein e rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp open reading frame orf membrane protein m and surface protein s regions of the sars cov 2 genome 30 000 bp kitajima et al 2020 despite the high analytical and diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of these assays in the clinical context their success in early detection of sars cov 2 rna circulating in community wastewater is somewhat mixed the high dilution and fragmentation of viral rna in wastewater pushes this technology to the limit and there is an ongoing need to improve method detection sensitivity and minimize false negative results ahmed et al 2020b limitations of rt qpcr include potentially reduced efficiency if mutations occur in the gene target region as was previously observed for assays targeting the s gene for the alpha variant in the uk grint et al 2021 another limitation of rt qpcr is low throughput only one genomic target can be analysed at a time to help overcome these limitations studies have used multiple rt qpcr assays for the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater ahmed et al 2020a medema et al 2020 however this can be time consuming while the issue of time could be resolved by developing multiplex rt qpcr assays that requires additional and more complex method optimization furthermore multiplex assay may not be as sensitive as a simplex assay parker et al 2015 several recent studies have highlighted the potential application of genome sequencing for sars cov 2 and its variants of concern voc detection in wastewater for example fontenele et al 2021 analysed wastewater using high throughput sequencing and single nucleotide variant analysis of sequences to describe sars cov 2 genetic lineage variations and population structure circulating within a community the sars cov 2 sequence data generated from wastewater indicated that there were more lineages circulating across communities than identified in the clinical data similarly it was demonstrated that metagenomic sequencing of wastewater samples could not only identify sars cov 2 and other viruses but track voc of the former concomitantly with those detected by clinical surveillance in california usa crits christoph et al 2021 this study also detected sars cov 2 voc in california wastewater not yet identified clinically in the state but present in other jurisdictions as well as completely novel voc indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for viral lineages before they are detected by clinical sequencing crits christoph et al 2021 izquierdo lara et al 2021 used nanopore sequencing of wastewater samples to evaluate the diversity of sars cov 2 at the community level in the netherlands and belgium phylogenetic analysis showed the presence of the most prevalent clades and clustering of wastewater samples with clinical samples from patients in the same region the authors also identified 57 unique mutations that were not present in the global database that like the other studies indicates heterogeneity of sars cov 2 variation in wastewater is greater than in clinically derived samples this might reflect the presence of defective viral particles in feces and or infections with novel virions along similar lines lin et al 2021 applied targeted metagenomic sequencing of sars cov 2 in wastewater and observed that the frequency and daily load of mutations associated with voc were highly correlated with clinical incidence rates within the region of british columbia canada taken together it is apparent that genomic sequencing of wastewater samples can be used to investigate the diversity of sars cov 2 circulating in a community and potentially identify new outbreaks genomic sequencing of wastewater may not only shed light on the evolution of sars cov 2 during an outbreak by identifying viral mutations but it could also be applied as an approach for quantifying genomic fragments of sars cov 2 as well a recent study used a high throughput sequencing platform atoplex that uses a multiplex tiled pcr based enrichment technique and reported that atoplex is capable of quantifying sars cov 2 rna in wastewater at concentrations that are at least one order of magnitude lower than rt qpcr quantitation ni et al 2021 this study compared the detection sensitivities of rt qpcr assays i e us cdc n1 and n2 and atoplex using a dilution series of cdna samples generated from a commercially available sars cov 2 rna positive control rather than seeding sars cov 2 in wastewater samples therefore the impacts of wastewater matrix interference on the atoplex assay limit of detection alod are not known collectively these studies demonstrate the potential application of sequencing approaches for monitoring the presence and allelic frequencies of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater along with clinical data sequencing approaches can potentially identify emerging voc of clinical importance within a community however benchmarking rt qpcr and sequencing approaches has not yet been assessed and requires further investigations the process limit of detection plod represents the analytical sensitivity of a sampling method after incorporating the efficiency of all the processing steps e g sample handling concentration nucleic acid extraction and pcr assays the plod estimates the copy number of a target molecule required in the wastewater sample matrix to achieve a specific probability of detection the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the plod of four rt qpcr assays us cdc n1 and n2 china cdc n and orf1ab ccdc n and ccdc orf1ab and atoplex sequencing for the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater this was achieved by seeding a dilution series of known concentrations of gamma irradiated sars cov 2 virions into wastewater followed by primary concentration nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr and atoplex sequencing to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to provide important insights on the analytical limitations for trace detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater using rt qpcr and atoplex sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 gamma irradiated sars cov 2 stock gamma irradiated

dilution series with varying concentrations of gamma irradiated sars cov 2 were seeded into wastewater the dilution series had 10 fold decrements and were prepared by diluting the stock suspension using dnase and rnase free water and then seeding these serial dilutions into 50 ml wastewater samples for the trials a and b the seeded sars cov 2 concentrations ranged from 2 32 105 to 2 32 102 gc

beating tubes were centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min to separate the lysate from the pellet debris the resultant sample lysate was used for the nucleic acid extraction with two minor modifications i the use of dnase i solution was omitted to isolate both rna and dna ii 200 µl of dnase and rnase free water was used to eluate nucleic acid instead of 100 µl a denovix spectrophotometer fluorometer wilmington de usa was used to determine the purity of extracted nucleic acid by measuring 260 280 ratio 2 6 inhibition assessment known quantities 1 5 104 gc of murine hepatitis virus mhv were seeded into each homogenized lysate as an inhibition process control the same quantity of mhv was also added to a distilled water extraction control followed by nucleic acid extraction an mhv rt qpcr assay

into the distilled water were compared with the cq values of the mhv seeded into wastewater lysate to assess potential rt qpcr inhibition ahmed et al 2022a if the cq value resulting from the sample

ccdc n1 44 4 rt qpcr assays the frequency of sars cov 2 rna detection at the 10 3 dilution containing 1 79 102 gc 50 ml of wastewater by all assays were lower than the 10 2 dilution at the 10 3 dilution in trial a the detection rate 66 6 by the us cdc n1 was greater than us cdc n2 11 1 ccdc n1 33 3 and ccdc orf1ab 11 1 however combined unique positive and negative results from all four rt

in trial b at 10 3 dilution detection rates of the us cdc n1 55 5 and ccdc orf1ab 66 6 assays outperformed us cdc n2 22 2 and ccdc n1 11 1 assays an increased detection rate 77 7 was observed when results from all rt qpcr assays were combined in comparison to results from any single rt qpcr assay which ranged from 11 1 to 55 5 atoplex sequencing produced three positives of nine seeded

when the cq values of the rt qpcr assays ranged between 34 4 and 39 6 mean cq 36 3 at this dilution three samples were classified as negative by atoplex when the rt qpcr assay in both trials being cq

were classified as negative by atoplex compared to rt qpcr and the cq vales of these positive samples were 35 for the trial b 10 3 dilution the majority of the samples were classified as negative by atoplex compared to rt qpcr with cq vales of these rt qpcr positive samples 35 interestingly sample ww36 was negative by all rt qpcr assays but atoplex mapped to 40 sars cov 2 genomic loci and was classified as positive 4 discussion multiple studies have reported the application of sequencing methods to detect and quantify the sars cov 2 virus and its voc in wastewater these methods were developed for clinical use but have been applied for the analysis of wastewater samples these include tiled amplicon approaches such as a nanopore based method utilizing 89 primer sets izquierdo lara et al 2021 oude munnink et al 2020 or ones that employ artic primer sets lin et al 2021 rios et al 2021 swift et al 2021 other tiling amplicon approaches include atoplex utilizing 259 primer sets ni et al 2021 or illumina sequencing with the swift nomalase amplicon sars cov 2 panel snap panel fontenele et al 2021 an oligo based enrichment capture approach has also been used crits christoph et al 2021 most of these studies were conducted in countries with high covid 19 prevalence such as usa canada belgium france and netherlands however analysis of wastewater based sars cov 2 detection sensitivities between sequencing i e targeting multiple genomic loci and rt qpcr i e targeting a single genomic locus has not been performed in view of this we compared diagnostic sensitivities from several rt qpcr assays and atoplex amplicon based sequencing by seeding serially diluted gamma irradiated sars cov 2 in wastewater we present detection results by rt qpcr and atoplex sequencing workflows for scenarios when the seeded numbers of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples are moderate to low 105 to 102 gc 50 ml while the data from this study allows a cross comparison among rt qpcr assays however making a direct comparison between rt qpcr assays and atoplex sequencing is difficult due to several differences in processing and worflow namely the rt qpcr assays used in this study are one step rt and pcr included in the same tube while atoplex sequencing is a two step multiplex pcr which amplifies the rna target region in a single tube and sequencing involved preparation of circularized single strand dna from rna another significant difference between these two strategies is that rt qpcr assays target a small fragment of the genome 60 to 160 bp while atoplex utilizes 259 primer sets along the sars cov 2 genome with amplicon tiles ranging in size from 159 to 199 bp there are also differences in input nucleic acid concentrations kits and in the designation of samples to positive or negative detections this study was carefully designed to include a number of wastewater samples to capture the inherent variations in the wastewater matrix rather than using a bulk wastewater two trials of experiments were conducted to obtain confirmatory results after seeding sars cov 2 in wastewater sample processing rna extraction and analysis were undertaken within 48 h to avoid rna degradation the purity of extracted nucleic acid was checked and rt pcr inhibition was assessed for both trials and seeding dilutions consistent sars cov 2 detections was achieved for rt qpcr assays and atoplex at the two higher seeding levels suggesting that detection using the adsorption extraction concentration method is quite robust when the numbers of seeded sars cov 2 on the order of 104 to 105 gc 50 ml however detection rates decreased at dilutions 10 2 and 10 3 by both rt qpcr and atoplex sequencing this is probably due to sub sampling error which can introduce errors in rna detection at low viral concentrations taylor et al 2019 after concentration some wastewater rna samples may contain 10 50 gc in a volume of 100 µl rna since we analyzed only a portion of the 200 µl rna 5 µl per rt qpcr and 10 µl for atoplex sequencing this will result in stochastic detection the impacts of sub sampling error in wastewater samples with low target rna concentrations have been discussed thoroughly ahmed et al 2022b while mhv seeding analysis suggested the absence of pcr inhibitors however the presence of low levels of inhibition could not be ruled out among the rt qpcr assays the detection rate of us cdc n1 assay was greater than other assays suggesting application of this assay may be advantageous when the level of sars cov 2 is low or near the limit of detection in wastewater however combining results from multiple rt qpcr assays produced a greater detection rate than the individual assays alone multiple assays including us cdc n1 should be used for trace detections and to avoid potential false negative results due to mismatches in the primer target sequence from mutations interestingly atoplex sequencing was not as sensitive as the us cdc n1 nor combined rt qpcr assay results despite its use of 259 multiplexed primer sets to amplify the sars cov 2 genome and despite 2 fold greater rna input in this study design a recent study has highlighted the potential application of atoplex sequencing for wastewater surveillance and reported that atoplex sequencing was capable of quantifying sars cov 2 rna at concentrations at least one order of magnitude lower than the detection limit of rt qpcr ni et al 2021 however atoplex and rt qpcr comparison was undertaken using a commercial rna positive control diluted in water and did not account for matrix interference or loss through viral concentration and rna extraction therefore a direct comparison of results from ni et al 2021 and this study is not possible targeting multiple loci along the sars cov 2 genome is expected to enhance sensitivity in a matrix such as wastewater where multiple species of viral rna are likely present i e fragmented genomic sub genomic in non stoichiometric amounts on the other hand this may increase error in wastewater surveillance where some of these primers may amplify off target sequences from other microorganisms also present in wastewater therefore a cut off of 5 amplicon tile mapping sites was used to designate a sample positive or negative with atoplex sequencing we acknowledge that in this study for atoplex multiple replicates were not used which could have reduced the detection sensitivity while the atoplex sequencing assay was not as sensitive as the us cdc n1 nor the combined rt qpcr assay results it nonetheless had similar sensitivity to three commonly utilized rt qpcr assays us cdc n2 ccdc n1 and ccdc orf1ab when analyzed independently at the lowest seed concentration 10 3 dilution this demonstrates that atoplex could be utilized not only for monitoring for voc but also for positive negative detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples however based on the observed trends in decreasing mapping rates and breadth of coverage with decreasing sars cov 2 concentrations the atoplex method seems more suited for wastewaters with medium to high viral concentrations e g at or above the 10 2 dilution level previous studies utilizing genomic sequencing of sars cov 2 in wastewater have observed mixed trends in genome coverage versus viral concentration based on the different methods employed crits christoph et al 2021 used hybridization based probe capture followed by metatranscriptomic sequencing and observed no correlation between the relative abundance of sars cov 2 and gc quantified by rt qpcr using multiplex tiling pcr with 500 bp amplicons for viral enrichment followed by sequencing with nanopore izquierdo lara et al 2021 found an inverse sigmoidal correlation between the breadth of genome coverage and the cq values of both the n2 and the e primers probe sets within a range of cq values from 27 to 36 however using multiplex tiling pcr with shorter amplicons swift normalase amplicon sars cov 2 panel fontenele et al 2021 did not observe any correlation between breadth of coverage and rt qpcr cq values in the range of 27 and 36 even though there was an apparent decreasing trend in depth of genome coverage with increasing cq thus the sensitivity of multiplex tiling pcr assays may be dependent on aspects of the primer panel design such as amplicon length such effects were systematically explored by lin et al 2021 by conducting a comparison of three different multiplex tiling pcr primer sets of different amplicon length 150 bp 400 bp 1200 bp with the same wastewater samples with cq values ranging from 29 to 36 which revealed that shorter amplicons e g 150 bp swift biosciences were less succeptible to decreasing detection rates at lower viral concentrations however it is also apparent that trade offs exist in the design of multiplex tiling pcr assays as lin et al 2021 found lower mapping rates and depth of genome coverage at high viral concentrations using the 150 bp amplicon panel versus 400 bp and 1200 bp which was attributed to more primer primer interactions and higher off target amplification rates as the atoplex assay used here relied on shorter amplicons 159 to 199 bp it is thus possible that observed detection sensitivity was impacted by higher rates of off target amplification and primer primer interactions it has also been shown that the sensitivity of multiplex tiling pcr is dependent on the wastewater matrix and or extraction method lin et al 2021 therefore it may be possible to optimize the sensitivity of multiplex tiling pcr for the application of sars cov 2 detection based on a combined selection of wastewater matrix type extraction method and multiplex primer assay design beyond what is presented in this current study here we show that the plod of rt qpcr for the detection of sars cov 2 in wastewater was lower than that of atoplex therefore for applications where positive negative detection is critical and wastewater viral concentrations are low rt qpcr could be the preferred method there are additional benefits of rt qpcr such as its shorter turnaround time within 4 5 h from concentration to results for rt qpcr versus 48 60 h for atoplex as well as its lower cost per sample however the application of multiplex tiling pcr based sequencing offers several critical advantages for wastewater surveillance such as the ability to detect and monitor voc it could also be argued that sequencing provides more convincing detection of sars cov 2 genomic fragments at low viral concentrations with verification via read mapping at multiple sites across the genome as high cq values in rt qpcr can be difficult to discern between true detection from non target amplification for non specific rt qpcr assays this is especially an issue for the complex wastewater matrix compared to human clinical specimens and thus more opportunity for off target amplification or spurious probe hydrolysis therefore a strategy of frequent rt qpcr testing e g daily complemented by periodic multiplex tiling pcr sequencing e g weekly or fortnightly may represent a powerful combination for monitoring sars cov 2 concentrations and evolutionary dynamics throughout the covid 19 pandemic 5 conclusions among the four rt qpcr assays tested us cdc n1 us cdc n2 ccdc n ccdc orf1ab the us cdc n1 assay outperformed all other assays as well as atoplex sequencing especially in instances when sars cov 2 levels were close to detection thresholds combining multiple rt qpcr assays can increase sars cov 2 detection sensitivity over any individual assay this approach may be especially useful when sars cov 2 levels in wastewater are low while minimizing false negative results arising from mismatches in primer design due to viral genome mutations the atoplex sequencing displayed similar or relatively lesser sensitivity to rt qpcr assays in instances of low sars cov 2 concentrations but performance may be dependent on primer panel design features such as amplicon length or other variables such as wastewater matrix virus concentration and nucleic acid extraction the plod for rt qpcr assays for sars cov 2 detection in wastewater was lower than atoplex sequencing however combination of both approaches could boost detection sensitivity while enabling identification of voc as they emerge disclaimers the

15842,reversible electrochemical separation based on flow electrodes e g flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is promising to desalinate brackish water a reliable alternative source of freshwater the deployment of redox mediators rms in fcdi offers an energy efficient means to improve the process performance but the nature of the rms mediated charge transfer remains poorly

ferricyanide fe cn 6 3 results showed that the desalination rate could be increased by over 260 with the addition of 10 mm fe cn 6 3 the lowest efficiency of aqs among the rms should be ascribed to its reduction potential of 0 84 v vs ag agcl exceeding the potential 0 48 v of the negatively charged current collector at 1 2 v while aqueous tempo and hq could facilitate salt removal their loss of efficiencies upon sorption onto the carbon surface indicated the insignificant pseudocapacitive contribution to ion migration in situ cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated the crucial role of the indirect charging of the flowable carbon materials to enhance the desalination performance in rms mediated fcdi to sum up results of this work pave a way to understand the rms mediated charge

sustainable solutions to alleviate the freshwater scarcity shannon et al 2008 suss et al 2015 apart from the conventional desalination processes such as multistage flash distillation and reverse osmosis capacitive deionization cdi has been attracting widespread attention owing to its easy operation at moderate conditions and environmental friendliness of no chemical dosing li et al 2021 tang et al 2019b driven by a small voltage typically 1 23 v ions in the feed migrate to the surface of oppositely charged electrodes and then are temporarily stored in the electrical double layers edls a subsequent discharge process is required to regenerate the electrode capacities which results in an intermittent operation of cdi ramachandran et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 in addition the electrode sorption capacities are limited by the projected areas of the static electrodes to address these challenges flow electrode cdi termed fcdi has been developed jeon et al 2013 by means of short circuited closed cycle scc operation fig 1 the saturated carbon particles are regenerated in a reservoir outside an fcdi cell and the neutralized particles are then fed into the system to impart the pseudo infinite sorption capacity folaranmi et al 2022 ma et al 2020a tang and zhou 2020 yang et al 2021 despite the merits mentioned above fcdi systems suffer from a significant increase in the internal circuit resistance because the electrolyte solution which contributes to 80 wt content of the flow electrodes has a conductivity e g 2 4 ms cm 1 lower than the static electrodes by 2 3 orders of magnitude cho et al 2019 luo et al 2021b ma et al 2020b to date various efforts such as increasing the carbon contents adding conductive additives e g carbon black or nanotubes and increasing the electrolyte concentration have been carried out to enhance fcdi performance cai et al 2020 doornbusch et al 2016 hatzell et al 2015 tang et al 2019a yang et al 2016 however an elevated carbon load inevitably results in a higher viscosity in the flow electrodes leading to not only a higher pumping energy but also clogging of the narrow flow path hatzell et al 2015 while the use of suspended conductive additives can develop a charge percolation network among the carbon particles the high price of nano engineered materials would increase the capital cost thereby sun et al 2021 in addition increasing the electrolyte concentration may decrease the charge efficiency because the counter ion back diffusion and co ion leakage have been observed at a high concentration gradient across the ion exchange membranes ma et al 2019 redox mediators rms can serve as efficient electron shuttles in the flow electrodes table s1 due to their electronic tunability at moderate potentials 1 2 v vs she chen et al 2020 nguyen anh thu et al 2020 ramalingam et al 2021 ma et al 2016 pioneered the incorporation of hydroquinone hq benzoquinone bq in fcdi which resulted in 130 increment of the desalination rate various rms including 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxyl tempo wei et al 2020 ferro ferricyanide fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 wei et al 2021 iodide i i3 and vanadium compounds v2 v3 luo et al 2021a nguyen anh thu et al 2020 wang et al 2021 have shown remarkable activities towards modulation of the charge transfer between the current collectors and the flowable electrode materials the main features of the rms mediated fcdi include the fast electron transfer and reversible redox reactions to maintain the enhanced desalination performance however most existing studies are limited to exploring the relationship between the rms contents and the improved desalination efficiencies essentially the electrochemical conversion of rms not only directly drives ion migration to achieve charge neutrality which has been deployed in flow desalination batteries dai et al 2021 but also may charge the flow electrodes e g pseudocapacitive and indirect charging processes to capture counter ions since the aqueous rms are expected to function at least when the applied electrode potential exceeds the redox equilibrium potential of rms zhang et al 2018 thermodynamic analysis of the potential distribution across an fcdi system is prerequisite to assess the nature of the rm mediated deionization which has been rarely discussed of particular note is that upon sorption onto the flowable electrode particles the surface rms may contribute to pseudocapacitive sorption rather than electron percolation tsao et al 2019 therefore a comprehensive investigation of these processes would pave a way to understand the fundamental mechanisms accounting for the enhanced desalination performance which is critical for the design and selection of high efficient rms for fcdi shin et al 2021 tang et al 2019b wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 in this work four common rms used in fcdi i e sodium anthraquinone 2 sulfonate aqs tempo hq and k3 fe cn 6 were systematically investigated to understand how their properties would influence the performance of rm mediated fcdi the salt removal rates and charge efficiencies were examined with adding rms to the flow electrodes that had

τ is the scan rate e 1 and e 2 represent the low and the high limit of the potential window respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 fcdi performance with different rms the desalination performances of fcdi with use of four kinds of rms were compared in scc mode the data of which are summarized in fig s3 and fig 2 similar to the results documented elsewhere porada et al 2014 there was a positive relationship between the desalination rate i e asrr and the carbon contents in the absence of rms a higher carbon content resulted in an obvious increase in asrr this indicated that the effective collision of particles in the flow electrodes at a high carbon load would facilitate charge percolation i e a higher current as shown in fig s4 and largely overcome the mass transfer limitation in the dilute solution the rms individually improved the asrr of fcdis following an order of hq 0 0344 mg min 1 cm 2 tempo 0 0241 mg min 1 cm 2 k3 fe cn 6 0 0167 mg min 1 cm 2 aqs 0 0079 mg min 1 cm 2 the blank 0 0023 mg min 1 cm 2 however their interaction with the flowable carbon materials resulted in different desalting performances figs 2 and s5 specifically adding 10 mm aqs tempo and hq into the flow electrodes of 5 wt 10 wt and 15 wt carbon contents had a marginal influence on asrr of the fcdi system compared to the control this may suggest that the contribution of pseudocapacitive electrosorption to salt removal was inconspicuous since almost all aqs tempo and hq were adsorbed onto the flowable ac when 10 mm rms were added figs s6 and table s2 similar phenomena have also been observed in a recent study of adding a relatively small amount of organic rms in the flow electrodes nguyen anh thu et al 2022 in contrast adding 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 into the flow electrodes containing 5 wt or 10 wt ac significantly improved asrr by 260 the ac particles used in this study had a much lower sorption capacity for k3 fe cn 6 than aqs tempo and hq fig s6 the residual k3 fe cn 6 concentrations 4 6 6 6 mm were detectable in the flow electrodes table s2 thus facilitating charge transfer and ion migration especially at a low carbon load the prompted charge transfer process in the flow electrodes can also be verified by the eis analysis fig s7 the arc in the medium and low frequency regions of eis curves reflects the charge transfer resistance in the flow electrodes yang et al 2021 significant decrease in the charge transfer resistance indicated that the presence of aqueous k3 fe cn 6 could prompt the ion diffusion into the pores and then the formation of edls on the electrode lenz et al 2020 therefore it is plausible to infer that aqueous rms in the flow electrodes should play a crucial role in enhancing the charge transfer rate and then the desalination rate of an rm mediated fcdi system 3 2 electrochemically driven ion migration in rm mediated fcdi fig 3 a demonstrates the electrochemically driven ion migration in rm mediated fcdi assume that the charge transfer in the flow electrodes can be described by a parallel equivalent circuit in which a few branch currents contribute to the total charge flow wang and lin 2019 the charge transfer at the current collector fig 3a should include i the direct charge transfer between the graphitic current collector and the acs by particle collision ii the redox reactions of rms that potentially induce ion migration and charging of the flowable acs and iii the unidentified side reactions data of charge balance in fig s5 indicated the unidentified electron loss accounted for around 20 of the total charge under the conditions tested in this study for rm mediated fcdi the asrr due to the direct charge transfer process between the graphitic current collector and the acs i e f ac in fig 3a could be estimated from the control tests in the absence of rms at different carbon contents chen et al 2021 ma et al 2018 pan et al 2021 yang et al 2019 i e 0 0064 0 0369 mg min 1 cm 2 at a carbon load of 5 15 wt in the flow electrodes the direct charge transfer process imparts advantages to rms mediated fcdi as compared to the redox mediated deionization with a static electrode system e g redox flow deionization because the asrr was improved by 110 6 171 8 and 267 2 respectively when 5 wt 10 wt and 15 wt carbon was added into 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 fig 2 we give an example of the charge transfer involving rms at the negatively charged current collector with the reactions occurring at the counter current collector discussed in si text s2 redox reactions of rms can either drive direct ion migration to maintain charge neutrality in a similar working mechanism as electrodialysis or charge the flowable acs to form edls for counter ion capture thereinto direct ion migration by rms in the cathode chamber can be described as follows eqs 4 5 4 rm n e r m n 5 nn a desalination chamber cem nn a cathode chamber alternatively ion removal in rm mediated fcdi can be achieved via charging of the flowable acs by aqueous and adsorbed rms to induce capacitive eqs 6 7 and pseudocapacitive sorption eqs 8 9 of ions 6 rm m e r m m r m m ac rm a c m 7 mn a desalination chamber cem mn a edl of flowable ac 8 rm ac ze rm ac z 9 zn a desalination chamber cem zn a flowable ac it can be concluded from eqs 4 9 that charged species e g rmn rmm and rm ac z are generated from rm redox reactions at the current collector in the processes of eqs 6 7 at an asrr of f m rms act as an electron shuttle because they further react with the flowable acs to complete the capacitive sorption of ions in the processes of eqs 4 5 at an asrr of f n and 8 9 at an asrr of f z reduced rms act as the counter charged species to sustain charge neutrality essentially the redox reactions of rms occurring in the flowable electrodes are dependent on the individual electrode potentials ϕ max and ϕ min in fig s8 the constant potential drop across the fcdi cell rommerskirchen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 therefore has significant impacts on the nature and kinetics of these faradaic reactions an applied electrode potential exceeding the redox equilibrium potential of rms would be crucial to the rms mediated charge transfer processes thus we measured the electrode potentials vs ag agcl reference of the fcdi cell under different operating conditions including a varied cell voltage of 0 2 1 2 v a feed flow rate of 1 4 ml min a carbon load of 5 15 wt and the use of different rms to assess the potential roles of eqs 4 9 in ion migration the data of which are summarized in figs s9 11 and 3b there was insignificant deviation between the anode cathode potential difference and the cell voltage indicating that i the electrode potential referring to the ag agcl had a minimal ir drop and ii the three electrode configuration could be used for the potentiometric analysis of the rms mediated processes overall the operating conditions e g feed flow rates carbon contents and rm species had minimal impacts on the electrode potentials vs ag agcl reference when the same voltage was applied to the cell figs s9 11 the slight excursion of the electrode potentials in the presence of k3 fe cn 6 fig s11 might be attributed to the redox reactions occurring on the current collector surface redox activities of the four rms and their working potential windows were then assessed by the cv tests in the three electrode fcdi cell to validate the results obtained from the in situ measurements a standard three electrode system fig s12 was used as a control the flowable ac electrodes in the absence of rm showed typical symmetrical capacitance curves with no redox peaks reflecting the fact that the charges are stored in edls fig s13 the oxidation and reduction peaks of the aqueous rms from cv scan of the three electrode fcdi system were almost identical to those obtained from the standard three electrode system fig s14 the consistency of the results highlighted the effectiveness of in situ characterization of the redox reactions in an fcdi system furthermore the redox potentials of different aqueous rms from cv tests are summarized in fig 3c it can be inferred that aqs with a reduction potential of 0 84 v vs ag agcl is not suitable for an fcdi system at a constant voltage of 1 2 v in which the cathode potential would be around 0 48 v vs ag agcl the irreversibility of aqs redox pairs at 1 2 v at least in the system tested in this study resulted in its lower efficiency compared to the other three rms fig 2 while aqueous tempo and hq can be activated by the electrodes according to the potentiometric analysis results no redox peak was observed in the mixed flow electrodes that contained acs and tempo or hq fig s13 this phenomenon might be ascribed to the absence of aqueous tempo and hq table s2 as these two rms demonstrated high affinities with the ac surface fig s6 while the adsorbed rms may undergo redox reactions when the carbon particles get charged via direct contact results of this study indicated that these charged particles prefer to form edls rather than drive the conversion of the adsorbed rms therefore we concluded that eqs 8 9 played a less important role in ion migration at least under the conditions tested in this study in contrast free fe cn 6 3 was detectable even at a high carbon load 15 wt the mixture demonstrated redox activity within the working potential window figs s13d and s14d therefore ion migration mediated by fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 contributed to an obvious desalination improvement over 260 in fcdi at a carbon content of 5 10 wt even when a typical potential drop across the flow electrodes ϕ anode ϕ cathode 0 15 v at a cell voltage of 1 2 v fig s8 luo et al 2021b is taken into consideration the fcdi system can still drive the reversible conversion of fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 fig 3c for ion migration from the thermodynamic analysis of the potential distribution across an fcdi system and the redox activities of aqueous and adsorbed rms it is plausible to conclude that the aqueous rm e g fe cn 6 3 with an appropriate reaction potential window could promote the charge transfer and salt removal in rm mediated fcdi i e processes of eqs 4 7 3 3 quantitative analysis of fe cn 6 3 mediated ion migration to illustrate the contributions of processes of eqs 4 5 and 6 7 to ion migration we compared the cv curves of a solution of 4 62 mm fe cn 6 3 control 15 wt acs and a mixture of 10 mm fe cn 6 3 and 15 wt acs in the three electrode fcdi cell note that the aqueous fe cn 6 3 concentration was 4 62 mm at sorption equilibrium in the mixture of 10 mm fe cn 6 3 and 15 wt acs the concentration of fe cn 6 3 in the control was set equal to the free fe cn 6 3 in the mixture in order to evaluate the role of processes eqs 4 5 playing in the charge transfer and ion removal as shown in fig 4 a the current response of each redox peak of the mixture is significantly higher than the sum of the current responses of the individual capacitive carbon material i e 15 wt acs and rm i e 4 62 mm aqueous fe cn 6 3 with regard to the minimal enhancement in deionization when most rms were adsorbed onto the carbon surface i e results of tempo and hq in figs 2 and s13 it is possible to conclude that rm mediated charging of the flowable electrodes eqs 6 7 should account for the difference between the total charge flow of the mixture and the sum of the subitems fig 3a fig 4b further demonstrates the increased capacitance from fe cn 6 3 mediated electron transfer between the current collector and the flowable carbon particles the capacitances of aqueous fe cn 6 3 15 wt acs and the mixture were 0 74 4 10 and 6 89 f respectively similar to the conclusion from the charge flow balance the indirect charging of the carbon materials via aqueous fe cn 6 3 should account for the capacitance gap ion migration i e asrr by the different pathways is discussed in fig 4c and d the asrr resulting from the direct charge transfer process f ac in the absence of fe cn 6 3 was determined from fig 2 the asrr of direct ion migration by the redox reaction of rms f n is shown in fig s15 which is dependent on the aqueous rm concentration as aforementioned the asrr of the fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 mediated charging of the carbon particles for ion capture f m could be estimated from the difference between asrrs fig 2 it can be seen from fig 4c and d that the improvement of asrr by dosing k3 fe cn 6 becomes less significant from 267 to 37 when the carbon content increases from 5 wt to 15 wt this is likely as a result of the formation of a charge percolation network at high carbon loads doornbusch et al 2016 notably fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 mediated charging of the carbon particles dominated the charge flow 45 55 at relatively low carbon contents 5 10 wt though the positive effects were compromised at a high carbon content 15 wt for the direct ion migration via fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 cycling f n decreased from 0 0094 to 0 0068 mg min 1 cm 2 with an increase of the carbon load from 5 wt to 15 wt the decreased asrr was due to the loss of free fe cn 6 3 from 6 12 to 4 62 mm at high carbon contents in general results of our study highlight the crucial role of rms in indirect charging of the flowable carbon materials to enhance the desalination performance of fcdi which was largely overlooked in the past research 3 4 desalination of brackish bore water in rm mediated fcdi to assess the efficiency of rm mediated fcdi to remove various ions from real brackish water we used two fcdi systems that is one with the flow electrodes consisting of 15 wt carbon and the other with 15 wt carbon and 10 mm fe cn 6 3 to treat bore water collected at xichuan town gansu province china the desalination experiments were conducted in the scc single pass mode the concentrations of the primary ions in the feed and treated brackish water were measured by ion chromatography the change of the effluent conductivity with time is depicted in fig s16a the effluent conductivity dropped sharply in the first 200 s and then reached a stable state it was evident that the addition of k3 fe cn 6 in the flow electrodes significantly improved the efficiency for bore water treatment but a further increase in the k3 fe cn 6 concentration had less remarkable effects on the desalination performance fig s17 table 2 summarizes the changes of the primary ions at steady state in the feed the concentrations of so4 2 and no3 n exceeded the limits in the chinese standards for drinking water quality i e 250 and 20 mg l 1 for so4 2 and no3 n respectively in addition the hardness ions in the bore water had higher concentrations than the values 100 200 mg l 1 based on caco3 recommended by the world health organization who after treatment the concentrations of so4 2 and no3 n in the effluent could meet the guideline values for drinking water k3 fe cn 6 mediated charging of the flowable carbon materials further improved the removal of magnesium 77 70 and calcium 79 25 ions as compared to the conventional fcdi table 2 the stability of the fcdi system with 10 mm fe cn 6 3 to treat real brackish water was further confirmed in a 24 times longer operating cycle fig s16b to achieve simultaneous production of a desalinated stream and a concentrate whilst avoid salt accumulation in the flow electrodes a four chamber integrated system fig s18a was constructed the system was operated under the same conditions as the two electrode system fig 1 that is the cell voltage 1 2 v and q of the dilute 2 0 ml min 1 the flow rate of the concentrate was 0 56 ml min 1 resulting in water recovery of 78 over 480 min operation of the integrated system the effluent conductivities were stable fig s18b the charge efficiency was relatively higher compared to that in the two electrode fcdi fig s18c potentially related to the lower salt accumulation in the flow electrode compartments due to the constant production of a concentrate in addition cems were used to separate the flow electrode compartments and the dilute and concentrate chambers in the integrated system this configuration is expected to prevent the membrane adsorption of the negatively charged ferric ferro cyanide and to inhibit ion migration into the concentrate chamber chen et al 2020 therefore an optimized architecture of rms mediate fcdi would prompt its practical application in brackish water deionization and softening this study investigated the fundamentals involved in the synergy between flowable carbon and aqueous redox mediators to improve the desalination performance which paves a way not only to understand the rms mediated charge transfer and ion migration in fcdi but also to optimize the process design in redox flow desalination redox flow battery and redox mediated electrodialysis are effective platforms for electrochemical ion separation ramalingam et al 2021 wei et al 2021 planar and static current collectors are widely used to drive the redox reactions of rms results of this study clearly showed that the indirect charging of the carbon could extend the pathways for charge transfer and ion migration in addition to that mediated by rm redox reactions this is expected to provide insight to the development of novel current collectors e g flowable or flow through current collectors in redox flow desalination to advance the desalination performance 4 conclusions in summary the mechanisms accounting for the enhanced desalination performance of rm mediated fcdi were systematically investigated in this study a three electrode fcdi system was developed to in situ assess the electrode potentials that would influence the reversible conversion of rms a correlation between the electrode potentials and the working potential window of rms was therefore established to evaluate the applicability of rms under different operating conditions the asrr values of fcdi were increased by 267 2 and 262 3 as a result of addition of 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 in the flow electrodes at 5 and 10 wt carbon loads respectively the excellent desalination performance was largely contributed by the indirect charging of the flowable carbon materials by the free fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 in the flow electrodes which accelerated the charge transfer between the current collector and the ac particles the high efficiency of fcdi with use of fe cn 6 3 was further validated in treatment of brackish bore water while aqueous tempo and hq were capable of facilitating ion migration they demonstrated low efficiencies when being adsorbed onto the carbon surface these findings suggested that the pseudocapacitive contribution of the rms carbon entirety to ion removal was minimal at least under the conditions tested in this study to sum up results of this work pave a way to understand the rms mediated charge transfer and ion migration in fcdi which would serve the purpose of design and

15842,reversible electrochemical separation based on flow electrodes e g flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi is promising to desalinate brackish water a reliable alternative source of freshwater the deployment of redox mediators rms in fcdi offers an energy efficient means to improve the process performance but the nature of the rms mediated charge transfer remains poorly understand we therefore systematically investigated commonly used rms including sodium anthraquinone 2 sulfonate aqs 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxyl tempo hydroquinone hq and ferricyanide fe cn 6 3 results showed that the desalination rate could be increased by over 260 with the addition of 10 mm fe cn 6 3 the lowest efficiency of aqs among the rms should be ascribed to its reduction potential of 0 84 v vs ag agcl exceeding the potential 0 48 v of the negatively charged current collector at 1 2 v while aqueous tempo and hq could facilitate salt removal their loss of efficiencies upon sorption onto the carbon surface indicated the insignificant pseudocapacitive contribution to ion migration in situ cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated the crucial role of the indirect charging of the flowable carbon materials to enhance the desalination performance in rms mediated fcdi to sum up results of this work pave a way to understand the rms mediated charge

sustainable solutions to alleviate the freshwater scarcity shannon et al 2008 suss et al 2015 apart from the conventional desalination processes such as multistage flash distillation and reverse osmosis capacitive deionization cdi has been attracting widespread attention owing to its easy operation at moderate conditions and environmental friendliness of no chemical dosing li et al 2021 tang et al 2019b driven by a small voltage typically 1 23 v ions in the feed migrate to the surface of oppositely charged electrodes and then are temporarily stored in the electrical double layers edls a subsequent discharge process is required to regenerate the electrode capacities which results in an intermittent operation of cdi ramachandran et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 in addition the electrode sorption capacities are limited by the projected areas of the static electrodes to address these challenges flow electrode cdi termed fcdi has been developed jeon et al 2013 by means of short circuited closed cycle scc operation fig 1 the saturated carbon particles are regenerated in a reservoir outside an fcdi cell and the neutralized particles are then fed into the system to impart the pseudo infinite sorption capacity folaranmi et al 2022 ma et al 2020a tang and zhou 2020 yang et al 2021 despite the merits mentioned above fcdi systems suffer from a significant increase in the internal circuit resistance because the electrolyte solution which contributes to 80 wt content of the flow electrodes has a conductivity e g 2 4 ms cm 1 lower than the static electrodes by 2 3 orders of magnitude cho et al 2019 luo et al 2021b ma et al 2020b to date various efforts such as increasing the carbon contents adding conductive additives e g carbon black or nanotubes and increasing the electrolyte concentration have been carried out to enhance fcdi performance cai et al 2020 doornbusch et al 2016 hatzell et al 2015 tang et al 2019a yang et al 2016 however an elevated carbon load inevitably results in a higher viscosity in the flow electrodes leading to not only a higher pumping energy but also clogging of the narrow flow path hatzell et al 2015 while the use of suspended conductive additives can develop a charge percolation network among the carbon particles the high price of nano engineered materials would increase the capital cost thereby sun et al 2021 in addition increasing the electrolyte concentration may decrease the charge efficiency because the counter ion back diffusion and co ion leakage have been observed at a high concentration gradient across the ion exchange membranes ma et al 2019 redox mediators rms can serve as efficient electron shuttles in the flow electrodes table s1 due to their electronic tunability at moderate potentials 1 2 v vs she chen et al 2020 nguyen anh thu et al 2020 ramalingam et al 2021 ma et al 2016 pioneered the incorporation of hydroquinone hq benzoquinone bq in fcdi which resulted in 130 increment of the desalination rate various rms including 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxyl tempo wei et al 2020 ferro ferricyanide fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 wei et al 2021 iodide i i3 and vanadium compounds v2 v3 luo et al 2021a nguyen anh thu et al 2020 wang et al 2021 have shown remarkable activities towards modulation of the charge transfer between the current collectors and the flowable electrode materials the main features of the rms mediated fcdi include the fast electron transfer and reversible redox reactions to maintain the enhanced desalination performance however most existing studies are limited to exploring the relationship between the rms contents and the improved desalination efficiencies essentially the electrochemical conversion of rms not only directly drives ion migration to achieve charge neutrality which has been deployed in flow desalination batteries dai et al 2021 but also may charge the flow electrodes e g pseudocapacitive and indirect charging processes to capture counter ions since the aqueous rms are expected to function at least when the applied electrode potential exceeds the redox equilibrium potential of rms zhang et al 2018 thermodynamic analysis of the potential distribution across an fcdi system is prerequisite to assess the nature of the rm mediated deionization which has been rarely discussed of particular note is that upon sorption onto the flowable electrode particles the surface rms may contribute to pseudocapacitive sorption rather than electron percolation tsao et al 2019 therefore a comprehensive investigation of these processes would pave a way to understand the fundamental mechanisms accounting for the enhanced desalination performance which is critical for the design and selection of high efficient rms for fcdi shin et al 2021 tang et al 2019b wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 in this work four common rms used in fcdi i e sodium anthraquinone 2 sulfonate aqs tempo hq and k3 fe cn 6 were systematically investigated to understand how their properties would influence the performance of rm mediated fcdi the salt removal rates and charge efficiencies were examined with adding rms to the flow electrodes that had different carbon contents to explore the nature of rms mediated charge transfer processes in fcdi a three electrode system was developed to carry out in situ cyclic voltammetry cv and electrode potential vs ag agcl measurements of the flow electrodes finally we evaluated the efficiency of an rm mediated fcdi system to treat brackish bore water 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents in this

the resultant desalination chamber was filled up with nylon sheets 100 mesh 112 mm 60 mm 0 2 mm the effective contact area a between the flow electrodes and the iem was 46 8 cm2 a three electrode fcdi

the ag agcl reference electrode was fixed in the graphitic and acrylic plates by epoxy resin the gap between the ag agcl reference electrode tip and the current collector was around 0 5 mm to minimize ir drop cv tests were firstly conducted and compared in the three electrode fcdi system at a scan rate of 10 mv s 1 in which a graphitic current collector was used as the working electrode the counter current collector as the counter electrode and ag agcl as the reference electrode for comparison cv tests were also carried out in a typical three electrode system in which a glassy carbon electrode was used as the working electrode a platinum wire as the counter electrode and ag agcl as the reference electrode all cv tests were conducted as soon as the flow electrodes were kept stationary the redox peaks of rms could be observed when i rms exist in aqueous state and or ii a carbon particle percolation network forms to drive the redox reactions of the adsorbed rms for the measurement of fcdi electrode potentials tests were conducted under various conditions by changing the feed flow rates carbon contents and species of rms the electric circuit was connected to a power supply etm

of fcdi with use of four kinds of rms were compared in scc mode the data of which are summarized in fig s3 and fig 2 similar to the results documented elsewhere porada et al 2014 there was a positive relationship between the desalination rate i e asrr and the carbon contents in the absence of rms a higher carbon content resulted in an obvious increase in asrr this indicated that the effective collision of particles in the flow electrodes at a high carbon load would facilitate charge percolation i e a higher current as shown in fig s4 and largely overcome the mass transfer limitation in the dilute solution the rms individually improved the asrr of fcdis following an order of hq 0 0344 mg min 1 cm 2 tempo 0 0241 mg min 1 cm 2 k3 fe cn 6 0 0167 mg min 1 cm 2 aqs 0 0079 mg min 1 cm 2 the

flow electrodes of 5 wt 10 wt and 15 wt carbon contents had a marginal influence on asrr of the fcdi system compared to the control this may suggest that the contribution of pseudocapacitive electrosorption to salt removal was inconspicuous since almost all aqs tempo and hq were adsorbed onto the flowable ac when 10 mm rms were added figs s6 and table s2 similar phenomena have also been observed in a recent study of adding a relatively small amount of organic rms in the flow electrodes nguyen anh thu et al 2022 in contrast adding 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 into the flow electrodes containing 5 wt or 10 wt ac significantly improved asrr by 260 the ac particles used in this study had a much lower sorption capacity for k3 fe cn 6 than aqs tempo and hq fig s6 the residual k3 fe cn 6 concentrations 4 6 6 6 mm were detectable in the flow electrodes table s2 thus facilitating charge transfer and ion migration especially at a low carbon load the prompted charge transfer process in the flow electrodes can also be verified by the eis analysis fig s7 the arc in the medium and low frequency regions of eis curves reflects the charge transfer resistance in the flow electrodes yang et al 2021 significant decrease in the charge transfer resistance indicated that the presence of aqueous k3 fe cn 6 could prompt the ion diffusion into the pores and then the formation of edls on the electrode lenz et al 2020 therefore it is plausible to infer that aqueous rms in the flow electrodes should play a crucial role in enhancing the charge transfer rate and then the desalination rate of an rm mediated fcdi system 3 2 electrochemically driven ion migration in rm mediated fcdi fig 3 a demonstrates the electrochemically driven ion migration in rm mediated fcdi assume that the charge transfer in the flow electrodes can be described by a parallel equivalent circuit in which a few branch currents contribute to the total charge flow wang and lin 2019 the charge transfer at the current collector fig 3a should include i the direct charge transfer between the graphitic current collector and the acs by particle collision ii the redox reactions of rms that potentially induce ion migration and charging of the flowable acs and iii the unidentified side reactions data of charge balance in fig s5 indicated the unidentified electron loss accounted for around 20 of the total charge under the conditions tested in this study for rm mediated fcdi the asrr due to the direct charge transfer process between the graphitic current collector and the acs i e f ac in fig 3a could be estimated from the control tests in the absence of rms at different carbon contents chen et al 2021 ma et al 2018 pan et al 2021 yang et al 2019 i e 0 0064 0 0369 mg min 1 cm 2 at a carbon load of 5 15 wt in the flow electrodes the direct charge transfer process imparts advantages to rms mediated fcdi as compared to the redox mediated deionization with a static electrode system e g redox flow deionization because the asrr was improved by 110 6 171 8 and 267 2 respectively when 5 wt 10 wt and 15 wt carbon was added into 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 fig 2 we give an example of the charge transfer involving rms at the negatively charged current collector with the reactions occurring at the counter current collector discussed in si text s2 redox reactions of rms can either drive direct ion migration to maintain charge neutrality in a similar working mechanism as electrodialysis or charge the flowable acs to form edls for counter ion capture thereinto direct ion migration by rms in the cathode chamber can be described as follows eqs 4 5 4 rm n e r m n 5 nn a desalination chamber cem nn a cathode chamber alternatively ion removal in rm mediated fcdi can be achieved via charging of the flowable acs by aqueous and adsorbed rms to induce capacitive eqs 6 7 and pseudocapacitive sorption eqs 8 9 of ions 6 rm m e r m m r m m ac rm a c m 7 mn a desalination chamber cem mn a edl of flowable ac 8 rm ac ze rm ac z 9 zn a desalination chamber cem zn a flowable ac it can be concluded from eqs 4 9 that charged species e g rmn rmm and rm ac z are generated from rm redox reactions at the current collector in the processes of eqs 6 7 at an asrr of f m rms act as an electron shuttle because they further react with the flowable acs to complete the capacitive sorption of ions in the processes of eqs 4 5 at an asrr of f n and 8 9 at an asrr of f z reduced rms act as the counter charged species to sustain charge neutrality essentially the redox reactions of rms occurring in the flowable electrodes are dependent on the individual electrode potentials ϕ max and ϕ min in fig s8 the constant potential drop across the fcdi cell rommerskirchen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 therefore has significant impacts on the nature and kinetics of these faradaic reactions an applied electrode potential exceeding the redox equilibrium potential of rms would be crucial to the rms mediated charge transfer processes thus we measured the electrode potentials vs ag agcl reference of the fcdi cell under different operating conditions including a varied cell voltage of 0 2 1 2 v a feed flow rate of 1 4 ml min a carbon load of 5 15 wt and the use of different rms to assess the potential roles of eqs 4 9 in ion migration the data of which are summarized in figs s9 11 and 3b there was insignificant deviation between the anode cathode potential difference and the cell voltage indicating that i the electrode potential referring to the ag agcl had a minimal ir drop and ii the three electrode configuration could be used for the potentiometric analysis of the rms mediated processes overall the operating conditions e g feed flow rates carbon contents and rm species had minimal impacts on the electrode potentials vs ag agcl reference when the same voltage was applied to the cell figs s9 11 the slight excursion of the electrode potentials in the presence of k3 fe cn 6 fig s11 might be attributed to the redox reactions occurring on the current collector surface redox activities of the four rms and their working potential windows were then assessed by the cv tests in the three electrode fcdi cell to validate the results obtained from the in situ measurements a standard three electrode system fig s12 was used as a control the flowable ac electrodes in the absence of rm showed typical symmetrical capacitance curves with no redox peaks reflecting the fact that the charges are stored in edls fig s13 the oxidation and reduction peaks of the aqueous rms from cv scan of the three electrode fcdi system were almost identical to those obtained from the standard three electrode system fig s14 the consistency of the results highlighted the effectiveness of in situ characterization of the redox reactions in an fcdi system furthermore the redox potentials of different aqueous rms from cv tests are summarized in fig 3c it can be inferred that aqs with a reduction potential of 0 84 v vs ag agcl is not suitable for an fcdi system at a constant voltage of 1 2 v in which the cathode potential would be around 0 48 v vs ag agcl the irreversibility of aqs redox pairs at 1 2 v at least in the system tested in this study resulted in its lower efficiency compared to the other three rms fig 2 while aqueous tempo and hq can be activated by the electrodes according to the potentiometric analysis results no redox peak was observed in the mixed flow electrodes that contained acs and tempo or hq fig s13 this phenomenon might be ascribed to the absence of aqueous tempo and hq table s2 as these two rms demonstrated high affinities with the ac surface fig s6 while the adsorbed rms may undergo redox reactions when the carbon particles get charged via direct contact results of this study indicated that these charged particles prefer to form edls rather than drive the conversion of the adsorbed rms therefore we concluded that eqs 8 9 played a less important role in ion migration at least under the conditions tested in this study in contrast free fe cn 6 3 was detectable even at a high carbon load 15 wt the mixture demonstrated redox activity within the working potential window figs s13d and s14d therefore ion migration mediated by fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 contributed to an obvious desalination improvement over 260 in fcdi at a carbon content of 5 10 wt even when a typical potential drop across the flow electrodes ϕ anode ϕ cathode 0 15 v at a cell voltage of 1 2 v fig s8 luo et al 2021b is taken into consideration the fcdi system can still drive the reversible conversion of fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 fig 3c for ion migration from the thermodynamic analysis of the potential distribution across an fcdi system and the redox activities of aqueous and adsorbed rms it is plausible to conclude that the aqueous rm e g fe cn 6 3 with an appropriate reaction potential window could promote the charge transfer and salt removal in rm mediated fcdi i e processes of eqs 4 7 3 3 quantitative analysis of fe cn 6 3 mediated ion migration to illustrate the contributions of processes of eqs 4 5 and 6 7 to ion migration we compared the cv curves of a solution of 4 62 mm fe cn 6 3 control 15 wt acs and a mixture of 10 mm fe cn 6 3 and 15 wt acs in the three electrode fcdi cell note that the aqueous fe cn 6 3 concentration was 4 62 mm at sorption equilibrium in the mixture of 10 mm fe cn 6 3 and 15 wt acs the concentration of fe cn 6 3 in the control was set equal to the free fe cn 6 3 in the mixture in order to evaluate the role of processes eqs 4 5 playing in the charge transfer and ion removal as shown in fig 4 a the current response of each redox peak of the mixture is significantly higher than the sum of the current responses of the individual capacitive carbon material i e 15 wt acs and rm i e 4 62 mm aqueous fe cn 6 3 with regard to the minimal enhancement in deionization when most rms were adsorbed onto the carbon surface i e results of tempo and hq in figs 2 and s13 it is possible to conclude that rm mediated charging of the flowable electrodes eqs 6 7 should account for the difference between the total charge flow of the mixture and the sum of the subitems fig 3a fig 4b further demonstrates the increased capacitance from fe cn 6 3 mediated electron transfer between the current collector and the flowable carbon particles the capacitances of aqueous fe cn 6 3 15 wt acs and the mixture were 0 74 4 10 and 6 89 f respectively similar to the conclusion from the charge flow balance the indirect charging of the carbon materials via aqueous fe cn 6 3 should account for the capacitance gap ion migration i e asrr by the different pathways is discussed in fig 4c and d the asrr resulting from the direct charge transfer process f ac in the absence of fe cn 6 3 was determined from fig 2 the asrr of direct ion migration by the redox reaction of rms f n is shown in fig s15 which is dependent on the aqueous rm concentration as aforementioned the asrr of the fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 mediated charging of the carbon particles for ion capture f m could be estimated from the difference between asrrs fig 2 it can be seen from fig 4c and d that the improvement of asrr by dosing k3 fe cn 6 becomes less significant from 267 to 37 when the carbon content increases from 5 wt to 15 wt this is likely as a result of the formation of a charge percolation network at high carbon loads doornbusch et al 2016 notably fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 mediated charging of the carbon particles dominated the charge flow 45 55 at relatively low carbon contents 5 10 wt though the positive effects were compromised at a high carbon content 15 wt for the direct ion migration via fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 cycling f n decreased from 0 0094 to 0 0068 mg min 1 cm 2 with an increase of the carbon load from 5 wt to 15 wt the decreased asrr was due to the loss of free fe cn 6 3 from 6 12 to 4 62 mm at high carbon contents in general results of our study highlight the crucial role of rms in indirect charging of the flowable carbon materials to enhance the desalination performance of fcdi which was largely overlooked in the past research 3 4 desalination of brackish bore water in rm mediated fcdi to assess the efficiency of rm mediated fcdi to remove various ions from real brackish water we used two fcdi systems that is one with the flow electrodes consisting of 15 wt carbon and the other with 15 wt carbon and 10 mm fe cn 6 3 to treat bore water collected at xichuan town gansu province china the desalination experiments were conducted in the scc single pass mode the concentrations of the primary ions in the feed and treated brackish water were measured by ion chromatography the change of the effluent conductivity with time is depicted in fig s16a the effluent conductivity dropped sharply in the first 200 s and then reached a stable state it was evident that the addition of k3 fe cn 6 in the flow electrodes significantly improved the efficiency for bore water treatment but a further increase in the k3 fe cn 6 concentration had less remarkable effects on the desalination performance fig s17 table 2 summarizes the changes of the primary ions at steady state in the feed the concentrations of so4 2 and no3 n exceeded the limits in the chinese standards for drinking water quality i e 250 and 20 mg l 1 for so4 2 and no3 n respectively in addition the hardness ions in the bore water had higher concentrations than the values 100 200 mg l 1 based on caco3 recommended by the world health organization who after treatment the concentrations of so4 2 and no3 n in the effluent could meet the guideline values for drinking water k3 fe cn 6 mediated charging of the flowable carbon materials further improved the removal of magnesium 77 70 and calcium 79 25 ions as compared to the conventional fcdi table 2 the stability of the fcdi system with 10 mm fe cn 6 3 to treat real brackish water was further confirmed in a 24 times longer operating cycle fig s16b to achieve simultaneous production of a desalinated stream and a concentrate whilst avoid salt accumulation in the flow electrodes a four chamber integrated system fig s18a was constructed the system was operated under the same conditions as the two electrode system fig 1 that is the cell voltage 1 2 v and q of the dilute 2 0 ml min 1 the flow rate of the concentrate was 0 56 ml min 1 resulting in water recovery of 78 over 480 min operation of the integrated system the effluent conductivities were stable fig s18b the charge efficiency was relatively higher compared to that in the two electrode fcdi fig s18c potentially related to the lower salt accumulation in the flow electrode compartments due to the constant production of a concentrate in addition cems were used to separate the flow electrode compartments and the dilute and concentrate chambers in the integrated system this configuration is expected to prevent the membrane adsorption of the negatively charged ferric ferro cyanide and to inhibit ion migration into the concentrate chamber chen et al 2020 therefore an optimized architecture of rms mediate fcdi would prompt its practical application in brackish water deionization and softening this study investigated the fundamentals involved in the synergy between flowable carbon and aqueous redox mediators to improve the desalination performance which paves a way not only to understand the rms mediated charge transfer and ion migration in fcdi but also to optimize the process design in redox flow desalination redox flow battery and redox mediated electrodialysis are effective platforms for electrochemical ion separation ramalingam et al 2021 wei et al 2021 planar and static current collectors are widely used to drive the redox reactions of rms results of this study clearly showed that the indirect charging of the carbon could extend the pathways for charge transfer and ion migration in addition to that mediated by rm redox reactions this is expected to provide insight to the development of novel current collectors e g flowable or flow through current collectors in redox flow desalination to advance the desalination performance 4 conclusions in summary the mechanisms accounting for the enhanced desalination performance of rm mediated fcdi were systematically investigated in this study a three electrode fcdi system was developed to in situ assess the electrode potentials that would influence the reversible conversion of rms a correlation between the electrode potentials and the working potential window of rms was therefore established to evaluate the applicability of rms under different operating conditions the asrr values of fcdi were increased by 267 2 and 262 3 as a result of addition of 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 in the flow electrodes at 5 and 10 wt carbon loads respectively the excellent desalination performance was largely contributed by the indirect charging of the flowable carbon materials by the free fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 in the flow electrodes which accelerated the charge transfer between the current collector and the ac particles the high efficiency of fcdi with use of fe cn 6 3 was further validated in treatment of brackish bore water while aqueous tempo and hq were capable of facilitating ion migration they demonstrated low efficiencies when being adsorbed onto the carbon surface these findings suggested that the pseudocapacitive contribution of the rms carbon entirety to ion removal was minimal at least under the conditions tested in this study to sum up results of this work pave a way to understand the rms mediated charge transfer and ion migration in fcdi which would serve the purpose of design and

15843,the generation of reactive oxygen species ros mediated by minerals and or microorganisms plays a vital but underappreciated role in affecting carbon and nutrient cycles at soil water interfaces it is currently unknown which interactions between microbial communities and iron fe minerals produce hydroxyl radical ho which is the strongest oxidant among ros using a series of well controlled anoxic incubations of soil slurries we demonstrated that interactions between microbial communities and fe minerals synergistically drove ho production up to 100 nm after 21 day incubation microorganisms drove ho generation in anoxic environments predominantly by modulating iron redox transformation that was more prominent than direct production of ros by microorganisms among the microbial communities geobacter paucimonas rhodocyclaceae k82 and desulfotomaculum were the key genera strongly affecting ho production in manured soils the former two species had higher abundances and were crucial for ho production in contrast the latter two species were mainly abundant and important in soils with mineral fertilizers our study suggests that abundant highly reactive oxidant ho can be generated in anoxic environments and the microbial community mediated redox transformations of iron oxyhydr oxides may be responsible for the ho production these findings shed light on the microbial generation of ho in fluctuating redox environments and on consequences for global c and nutrient cycling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fenton reaction iron minerals

affinity fe minerals are widely recognized as a rusty sink for c faust et al 2021 lalonde et al 2012 however fe minerals may play a dualistic role in c transformations emerging evidence demonstrates that fe mineral driven hydroxyl radical ho production plays a vital but underappreciated role in accelerating soc decomposition in humid environments chen et al 2020 hall and silver 2013 yu and

fluctuating redox conditions can drive 30 or even exceed 50 of total c losses georgiou et al 2015 wang et al 2017a yu and kuzyakov 2021 the uncertain role of fe minerals in soc stabilization under

et al 2021 yu and kuzyakov 2021 recent studies have observed ho production during the process of fe mineral transformation which is mediated by a single bacterial species du et al 2019 han et al 2020

date the regulation of ho production driven by microbial communities and succession in the presence of fe minerals remains poorly understood hampering our understanding of soil c cycling mediated by biotic and abiotic processes this study aimed i to establish a link between microbial community composition fe redox transformation and ho production ii to assess the relative contribution of soil microbial communities to the production of ho and iii to identify the keystone bacterial species responsible for ho production we hypothesized that microbial communities drive ho generation under anoxic conditions by i controlling the hydroxylation processes on the surface of iron minerals xian et al 2019 and or ii producing the trace amounts of oxygen by some microorganisms in the presence of electron donors kraft et al 2022 to test our hypotheses we first established a variety of microbial communities that were derived from topsoils 0 20 cm from four long term 26 years fertilization treatments wen et al 2018 this selection may also allow a better understanding of the formation of more reactive minerals and organo mineral associations under organic fertilizations yu et al 2017 2020 since soil organic matter som and minerals can interfere with ros determination page et al 2013 yu and kuzyakov 2021 we used the soil slurries that contained only enriched microbial communities

adding haematite a model fe iii bearing mineral with a ubiquitous distribution in ecosystems hochella et al 2019 schindler et al 2019 to the soil slurries our results provide crucial insights into the mechanisms of microbial community mediated ho generation in redox environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling the long term fertilization station was established on a ferric acrisol wrb

remove the possible oxygen contamination and then sealed with butyl rubber septa crimped with aluminum caps wrapped with tin foil all bottles were stored in an anaerobic glove box lab star braun germany at room temperature without shaking during the whole incubation period in total each treatment was conducted in 66 replicates bottles the fe iii reduction stage lasted for ca 21 days according to the measured fe ii concentrations and then 0 3 ml of 1 mol l 1 nano3 was re added to the enrichment cultures 100 ml to induce no3 dependent fe ii oxidation 21 days thus the incubation period was separated into fe iii reduction and fe ii oxidation stages during the fe iii reduction stage haematite was the sole terminal electron acceptor while acetate served as an electron donor during the fe

similar pattern of accumulation and consumption of fe ii and ho in all haematite treated soil slurries during the whole incubation fig 1 a and d in the presence of haematite fe ii was produced and increased in the soil slurries during the fe iii reduction stage the increase in fe ii in the manured soil slurries m and mnpk by ca 0 7 g l 1 was higher than that in the soil with mineral fertilizers npk by 0 5 g l 1 or without fertilization control by 0 4 g l 1 fig 1a accompanied by an increase in fe ii ho was generated and gradually increased and the accumulated amount of ho in all soil slurries at the end of the fe iii reduction stage followed the order mnpk 94 nm m 91 nm npk 82 nm control 56 nm fig 1d for the no3 dependent fe ii oxidation stage the introduction of no3 at day 21 resulted in rapid oxidation of fe ii with a faster oxidation rate observed in the manured soil slurries in the initial 10 days than that in the mineral fertilized or unfertilized soils fig 1a and c similarly a sharp decrease in the ho amounts in all soil slurries at the fe ii oxidation stage revealed that fe ii dominated ho generation fig 1d the addition of no3 at day 21 resulted in the rapid generation of nh4 and no2 fig s3 in the soil slurries with a higher rate observed in the manured soils which was consistent with changes in the fe ii content fig 1a in addition the total dissolved fe concentrations in all soil slurries have similar patterns as total fe ii fig 1b to further confirm the concerted effects of microbial communities and fe redox transformation on ho production additional control experiments without the addition of microbial communities or haematite i e with only haematite addition no soil slurry only slurry addition no haematite and soil sterilization sterile soil slurry plus haematite were conducted a small increase in fe ii was observed in the slurry by ca 0 3 g l 1 fig s4a and sterilized by ca 0 2 g l 1 fig s5b soil slurries during the fe iii reduction stage in the haematite only addition treatment the fe ii concentration was approximately 0 02 g l 1 during the whole incubation fig s4d a limited amount of ho was detected in the slurry only setups 20 nm fig s4c haematite only setup 0 nm fig s4f and sterilized soil setups ca 6 nm fig s5c during the fe iii reduction stage pointing to a strong linkage between ho production and microbially mediated fe redox cycling 3 2 transformation of fe minerals to investigate changes in the structure and mineralogy of haematite during microbially mediated fe redox cycling both xrd and fe k edge exafs were applied to identify the secondary fe minerals in the soil slurries at the end of the fe iii reduction and fe ii oxidation stages the xrd patterns of haematite strongly changed after incubation fig s6 indicating that the haematite was transformed to other fe bearing minerals during microbially mediated fe redox cycling goethite and ferrihydrite were identified by xrd in the m and npk fertilized soil slurries further supported by fe k edge exafs spectra fig 2 and table s5 quartz was also identified in the soil slurries fig s6 to further quantify the composition of fe minerals we performed linear combination fitting lcf of the fe k3 weighted exafs spectra fig 2 and table s5 at the initial incubation stage fe bearing minerals mainly consisted of haematite 91 97 intriguingly at the end of the fe iii reduction stage the highest percentage 25 27 of haematite was converted to goethite and ferrihydrite in the manured soil slurries i e m and mnpk followed by 23 in the unfertilized soil slurry control and only 15 in the mineral fertilized soil slurry npk pointing to the distinct microbial communities in the different fertilization soils these newly formed fe minerals may have higher chemical reactivities due to their nanometre particle sizes amorphous and poorly crystalline structure and more charged and rough surfaces than haematite notably more crystalline forms i e goethite were found in the unfertilized and mineral fertilized soil slurries while more poorly ordered phases i e ferrihydrite were formed in the manured soil slurries at the end of the fe ii oxidation stage the poorly ordered ferrihydrite increased in the unfertilized and mineral fertilized soil slurries 3 3 shifts in microbial communities and their linkage to fe redox and ho production to disentangle the contribution of microbial communities to fe redox reactions and ho generation we analyzed the microbial community composition in the initial soil slurries after the fe iii reduction period and after the fe ii oxidation period using illumina miseq sequencing optimized sequences and subsequently used sequences are listed in table s6 the observed otu counts table s7 otu richness ace and shannon diversity fig 3 a and b decreased with incubation duration indicating that the increase in environmental stresses led to a drop in bacterial abundance and diversity the venn diagrams revealed that the shared bacterial numbers decreased with anoxic fe incubations fig s7 and manure fertilized soils had a stronger capacity to conserve the shared bacterial groups than mineral fertilized soils fig s8 in particular manured soil i e m and mnpk slurries had higher otu counts otu richness and shannon diversity than mineral fertilized soil npk slurries during the whole incubation period shifts in microbial community composition were also supported by the dominant bacterial phyla fig s9 and text s12 rarefaction curves fig s10 and rank abundance curves fig s11 these results suggest a more robust microbial community structure in manured soils than in mineral fertilized soil a nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plot showed that microbial communities had high clustering similarity between replicates but exhibited clear differences among the treatments anosim r 0 52 p 0 001 fig 3c a mantel test was used to identify a possible correlation between the microbial community structures and ho production fig 3d bacterial communities were closely correlated with ho concentrations revealing that ho production may be strongly interlinked with microbial communities however bacterial communities and ho concentrations were significantly correlated with fe ii no3 ph goethite ferrihydrite and haematite fig 3d therefore a partial mantel test was used to further investigate the relationship between ho and bacterial community structures table s8 indeed ho had no significant relationship with bacterial community structures after the effect of fe ii was accounted for r 0 09 p 0 117 implying that the microbial community may be indirectly linked with ho through fe ii 3 4 potential microbial drivers of fe ii and ho production to identify the biological contribution of the dominant microbial genus to fe ii and ho production rf analysis was used fig 4 rf analysis screened only three and four microbial genera as predictors for fe ii r 2 0 74 p 0 001 and ho r 2 0 80 p 0 001 respectively k82 belonging to the family rhodocyclaceae was the most important for predicting fe ii p 0 01 and ho p 0 01 other important genera were i dissimilatory fe iii reducing geobacter lovley 2006 weber et al 2006b for fe ii p 0 01 and ho p 0 01 ii paucimonas family of burkholderiaceae characterized by rapid growth and rapid adaptation to mineralize soluble c jeewani et al 2020 or fe ii oxidizing ability peng et al 2019 for fe ii p 0 05 and ho p 0 01 and iii dissimilatory fe iii reducing desulfotomaculu weber et al 2006a for ho p 0 05 these contributions were further supported by multivariate regression analysis tables s9 and s10 the relative abundance of the potential microbial taxonomic predictors in the soil slurries was illustrated by a heatmap showing higher abundances of these microbes in the soil slurries at the end of the fe iii reduction stage fig 4c interestingly the potential microbial taxonomic predictors presented diverse abundances in different fertilized soil slurries at the end of the fe iii reduction stage geobacter and paucimonas showed higher abundances in manured soil slurries while k82 and desulfotomaculum showed higher abundances in mineral fertilized soil slurries independent of the addition of manure i e mnpk and npk 3 5 structural equation model linking microbial and iron to ho production sem was used for an in depth analysis of the direct and indirect effects of microbial drivers on ho production the sem explained 98 0 of the variation in ho production and provided a good fit using the χ2 test rmsea cfi and bollen stine bootstrap metrics fig 5 a grace 2006 schermelleh engel et al 2003 the model confirmed the importance of microbial drivers in ho production with the importance based on the total standardized coefficient following the order rhodocyclaceae k82 desulfotomaculum paucimonas geobacter fig 5b specifically our sem analysis suggested that rhodocyclaceae k82 and desulfotomaculum abundances and fe ii and newly formed fe mineral i e ferrihydrite plus goethite contents had direct positive effects on ho production fig 5b most importantly our sem analysis demonstrated that geobacter rhodocyclaceae k82 desulfotomaculum and paucimonas indirectly regulate ho production via a positive association with fe ii fig 5 furthermore compared with the standardized path coefficients for ho production the indirect effects of geobacter desulfotomaculum rhodocyclaceae k82 and paucimonas ranging from 0 18 to 0 45 were much stronger than their direct effects 0 00 to 0 14 fig 5b taken together sem analysis explained most of the variation in the contents of ho which is mainly indirectly driven by the microbial community structures through the regulating of fe redox cycling 4 discussion 4 1 effects of long term fertilizations on microbial communities and fe transformation high clustering similarity between replicates but significant differences among the soils fig 3c revealed that long term fertilization strongly shifted the soil microbial community composition which was consistent with previous observations in red soils luo et al 2020 wen et al 2018 xun et al 2016 we showed that long term 26 years manure fertilized soils i e m and mnpk had higher otu counts and microbial diversity than mineral fertilized soils npk during the reduction period fig 3a b and table s7 this is in line with changes in fe ii fig 1a and newly formed minerals fig 2 during anoxic incubation haematite as the most stable fe iii oxide may be transformed to highly reactive ferrihydrite and goethite either i via fe iii reduction followed by surface dependent fe ii oxidation or ii through dissolution and reprecipitation processes qafoku et al 2020 raiswell 2011 shi et al 2009 4 2 interactions between key microbial groups taxa with the fe ii and ho production in anoxic soil slurries random forest multiple regression model and sem analyses showed that the fe ii production was directly and significantly regulated by the abundance of rhodocyclaceae k82 geobacter paucimonas and desulfotomaculum figs 4a 5a s12 and table s9 pointing out that these four bacterial genera may act as the keystone fe reducing microorganisms in the anoxic soil slurries both geobacter and desulfotomaculum are widely recognized fe iii reducing microorganisms under anoxic conditions weber et al 2006a regarding the genus k82 the family rhodocyclaceae has been revealed to participate in fe iii reduction porsch et al 2009 since acetate was the sole terminal electron donor at the fe iii reduction stage we speculate that the genus k82 participated in fe iii reduction acetate may be rapidly utilized by microorganisms from soil within few hours fischer and kuzyakov 2010 qiu et al 2017 a strongly positive correlation between k82 and fe ii further confirmed this speculation fig s13 the genus paucimonas increased with fe ii concentration fig s13 and showed higher relative abundance in the soils at the fe iii reduction stage fig 4c similarly the genus paucimonas participated in soil n and fe cycles peng et al 2019 therefore we assume that paucimonas may be involved in fe iii reduction with haematite as the sole electron acceptor at the reduction stage similar to fe ii our findings also demonstrated that the ho production was closely linked to the keystone genera k82 geobacter paucimonas and desulfotomaculum figs 4b 5 and table s10 we further found small but significant direct control of ho production by k82 p 0 001 and desulfotomaculum p 0 001 fig 5a some keystone genera have the ability to produce trace o2 in anoxic environments kraft et al 2022 the produced trace o2 with acetate as the electron donor can be further converted to extracellular o2 and h2o2 the precursor to ho formation through enzymatic catalysis diaz et al 2013 gordon et al 1953 learman et al 2011 lieberman and barker 1954 moreover o2 can react with h2o2 to form ho hayyan et al 2016 through the haber weiss reaction haber et al 1934 the secretion of o2 and the reduction of fe iii are reported to connect with microbial oxidative stress removal and iron acquisition yu et al 2020 hence we assume that the direct control exerted by k82 and desulfotomaculum on ho production may occur by regulating microbial mediated o2 formation intriguingly k82 geobacter paucimonas and desulfotomaculum also control ho production through an indirect pathway fig 5b this is not surprising as fe ii is involved in catalyzing ho generation garrido ramírez et al 2010 georgiou et al 2015 page et al 2013 pereira et al 2012 petigara et al 2002 trusiak et al 2018 yu and kuzyakov 2021 and the fe ii production in our study was directly and significantly p 0 05 regulated by k82 geobacter paucimonas and desulfotomaculum figs 5a and s12 compared to other soil slurries a higher abundance of geobacter and paucimonas fig 4c in the manure fertilized soil slurries resulted in much more ho production fig 1d implying the importance of fertilization treatments in modulating ho production and its key drivers taken together these results indicated that microbial communities may drive ho production through mediating both the extracellular o2 formation and fe redox cycling indeed the stronger indirect impact of geobacter desulfotomaculum k82 and paucimonas on ho formation fig 5b suggests that microbial communities control ho generation in an anaerobic environment primarily through mediating fe redox cycling these results provide direct evidence for the microbial mediation of fe redox cycling linked to ho production in anoxic environments furthermore the production of ho radicals causes cell inactivation or inhibits the growth of cells through triggering membrane lipid peroxidation wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 during the fe iii reduction stage decrease in the observed otu counts table s7 otu richness ace and shannon diversity may be a result of the production of ho fig 3a and b consequently the production of ho radicals alters the activity and composition of microbial communities possibly through a damage of membrane lipid peroxidation the selective pressure of ho radicals on microbial communities further affected fe species transformation fig 3d 4 3 possible mechanisms of ho generation under anoxic environments ho radicals can be produced via photochemical georgiou et al 2015 page et al 2013 kappler et al 2021 biotic han et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 kappler et al 2021 or abiotic garrido ramírez et al 2010 kappler et al 2021 pathways yet it remains unclear how ho can be produced under anoxic environments recently xian et al 2019 showed that interactions between mineral defect sites of fe oxyhydr oxides and h2o in anoxic environments made the hydroxylation energetically favorable on the surface of iron minerals eq 1 1 fe iii h 2 o fe ii ho h this finding provides new insight into iron mineral assisted ho formation in anoxic conditions moreover kraft et al 2022 proposed the following oxygen production pathway in nitrosopumilus maritimus eq 2 2 4 no 2 4 e 4 no o 2 2 n 2 o this pathway requires electrons to produce o2 which may partly be supplied by acetate in our study in the presence of o2 traces ho radicals can be further produced by microbial modulation of iron redox transformation via fenton or fenton like reactions kappler et al 2021 yu and kuzyakov 2021 our sem results fig 5 showed that microorganisms drove ho generation in anoxic environments predominantly by modulation of iron redox transformation that was more prominent than microbial direct roles therefore the ho in anoxic environments may be mainly generated through abiotic eq 1 rather than biotic eq 2 processes which needs further exploration 4 4 environmental implications the oxidation of fe ii or fe ii bearing minerals in aerobic environments is the vital source of intensive ros fluxes at soil water interfaces chen et al 2021 chi et al 2022b du et al 2021 georgiou et al 2008 han et al 2021 melton et al 2014 op de beeck et al 2018 schoonen et al 2006 in anoxic soil slurries the cumulative amounts of ho were less than 100 nm fig 1d which were 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than those in the oxygenation processes of surface sediments tong et al 2016 or anoxic oxic cycles of sediments han et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 although the ho amounts produced in anoxic environments are low fig 1d it is very important to close a loop of the ho production in both anoxic and oxic environments these findings imply that 1 ho can be sustainably generated in natural ecosystems and 2 anoxic environments may be a new ho source the low ho production in anoxic environments may possess a limited impact on c emission but a profound impact on soil c persistence faust et al 2021 lehmann et al 2020 in humid soils however the ros mediated soc decomposition counteracts c protection by minerals chen et al 2020 fe minerals and microbial communities synergistically increased co2 efflux up to 15 times accompanied by a burst of ho in the presence of plant residues du et al 2020 pointing to the critical role of ros production in elucidating the mechanisms of priming effects in soil hotspots e g soil water interfaces kuzyakov et al 2000 merino et al 2020 moreover the ho burst is important for the bioavailability of the n pool in soils op de beeck et al 2018 wang et al 2021 on the other hand the generated ho can easily split chemical bonds in soc resulting in an increase in dissolved oc release and oc bioavailability du et al 2020 both charged small molecules and water soluble macromolecules are favorable for binding on mineral surfaces and then form newly organo mineral complexes to increase the persistence of c in soils faust et al 2021 lehmann et al 2020 kleber et al 2005 kögel knabner et al 2008 although ros species have a very short lifespan yu and kuzyakov 2021 at soil water interfaces microbial chelator mediated fenton catalysis can promote sustained ros generation tamaru et al 2019 which may have a profound impact on c and nutrient cycles in certain ecosystems e g flooded soils humid forest or lake sediments our finding also indicated that organic inputs e g manure strongly increased the ho concentrations when compared to unfertilized control or soil with solely mineral fertilization consequently this explains the higher mineral associated c content in soils with organic fertilization yu et al 2017 more broadly weather extremes e g extreme precipitation or drought events as well as climatic trends e g stratospheric ozone depletion may impart soil slurries with stronger redox fluctuations and uv and thus more ros production overland et al 2016 smith et al 2017 sulzberger et al 2019 which will definitely elevate the role of ros in c and nutrient cycles in some ecosystems e g humid forests or dry deserts therefore in a changing world we call for studying complex environmental gradients long term time series and modeling to establish causality between interconnected community interactions e g competition mutualism and commensalism and redox active minerals and their linkage to c and nutrient cycling in water ecosystems 4 conclusions and future perspectives our findings showed that interactions between microbial communities and fe minerals in soil slurries synergistically drive ho production through microbial fe iii reduction and transformation to newly formed minerals these microbially mediated fe iii reduction and transformation to new minerals were predominantly responsible for ho production in the anoxic environment ho production was closely linked to the keystone genera k82 geobacter paucimonas and desulfotomaculum the discrepancies in the abundance of these genera interpreted well the ho production in soil slurries under a wide range of fertilization practices because microorganisms in soil are present but frequently not active blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2013 hori et al 2010 further investigations should focus on the functions of the active microbial genera i e geobacter desulfotomaculum k82 and paucimonas producing ho stable isotope probing and pyrosequencing techniques seem very promising to link the microbial activities with the functions specific for ho production ding et al 2015 hori et al 2010 altogether our findings establish a causality between ho production and

15843,the generation of reactive oxygen species ros mediated by minerals and or microorganisms plays a vital but underappreciated role in affecting carbon and nutrient cycles at soil water interfaces it is currently unknown which interactions between microbial communities and iron fe minerals produce hydroxyl radical ho which is the strongest oxidant among ros using a series of well controlled anoxic incubations of soil slurries we demonstrated that interactions between microbial communities and fe minerals synergistically drove ho production up to 100 nm after 21 day incubation microorganisms drove ho generation in anoxic environments predominantly by modulating iron redox transformation that was more prominent than direct production of ros by microorganisms among the microbial communities geobacter paucimonas rhodocyclaceae k82 and desulfotomaculum were the key genera strongly affecting ho production in manured soils the former two species had higher abundances and were crucial for ho production in contrast the latter two species were mainly abundant and important in soils with mineral fertilizers our study suggests that abundant highly reactive oxidant ho can be generated in anoxic environments and the microbial community mediated redox transformations of iron oxyhydr oxides may be responsible for the ho production these findings shed light on the microbial generation of ho in fluctuating redox environments and on consequences for global c and nutrient cycling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fenton reaction iron minerals microorganism mineral interactions reactive oxygen species synergistic effect 1 introduction the preservation and decomposition of soil organic carbon soc has been the subject of scientific inquiry for decades owing to its extremely vital role in regulating atmospheric co2 concentrations chenu et al 2019 lal 2004 paustian et al 2016 because of their large surface area and high adsorption affinity fe minerals are widely recognized as a rusty sink for c faust et al 2021 lalonde et al 2012 however fe minerals may play a dualistic role in c transformations emerging evidence demonstrates that fe mineral driven hydroxyl radical ho production plays a vital but underappreciated role in accelerating soc decomposition in humid environments chen et al 2020 hall and silver 2013 yu and kuzyakov 2021 as a nonselective and strong oxidant ho radicals produced in some soils and ecosystems e g desiccated and aqueous deserts humid red soils in the tropics and wet subtropics soils with fluctuating redox conditions can drive 30 or even exceed 50 of total c losses georgiou et al 2015 wang et al 2017a yu and kuzyakov 2021 the uncertain role of fe minerals in soc stabilization under fluctuating redox conditions has resulted in a huge challenge in achieving a better understanding of individual processes and consequences for global c cycling kleber et al 2021 yu and kuzyakov 2021 the main pathways for ho production driven by fe minerals in environments are classified as homogeneous fenton reactions fe ii h2o2 and heterogeneous fenton like reactions du et al 2021 georgiou et al 2015 kappler et al 2021 melton et al 2014 page et al 2013 trusiak et al 2018 yu and kuzyakov 2021 during these reactions the catalytic activity of fe minerals is largely dependent on fe redox chemistry and mineral surface reactivity chen et al 2021 chi et al 2021 2022a pereira et al 2012 yu and kuzyakov 2021 yu et al 2020 such fe minerals e g goethite haematite lepidocrocite ferrihydrite and magnetite coexist in environments and can be converted to one another under fluctuating redox conditions kappler and straub 2005 weber et al 2006a making it difficult to identify their individual

et al 2021 yu and kuzyakov 2021 recent studies have observed ho production during the process of fe mineral transformation which is mediated by a single bacterial species du et al 2019 han et al 2020

date the regulation of ho production driven by microbial communities and succession in the presence of fe minerals remains poorly understood hampering our understanding of soil c cycling mediated by biotic and abiotic processes this study aimed i to establish a link between microbial community composition fe redox transformation and ho production ii to assess the relative contribution of soil microbial communities to the production of ho and iii to identify the keystone bacterial species responsible for ho production we hypothesized that microbial communities drive ho generation under anoxic conditions by i controlling the hydroxylation processes on the surface of iron minerals xian et al 2019 and or ii producing the trace amounts of oxygen by some microorganisms in the presence of electron donors kraft et al 2022 to test our hypotheses we first established a variety of microbial communities that were derived from topsoils 0 20 cm from four long term 26 years fertilization treatments wen et al 2018 this selection may also allow a better understanding of the formation of more reactive minerals and organo mineral associations under organic fertilizations yu et al 2017 2020 since soil organic matter som and minerals can interfere with ros determination page et al 2013 yu and kuzyakov 2021 we used the soil slurries that contained only enriched microbial communities but removed most ros quenchers e g som and minerals hori et al 2010 in this study we then conducted a series of sequential fe iii reduction and nitrate no3 dependent fe ii oxidation experiments by adding haematite a model fe iii bearing mineral with a ubiquitous distribution in ecosystems hochella et al 2019 schindler et al 2019 to the soil slurries our results provide crucial insights into the mechanisms of microbial community mediated ho generation in redox environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling the long term fertilization station was established on a ferric acrisol wrb

collected from a single plot the fresh soil was air dried sieved 2 mm and stored at 4 c until further use the basic soil properties are listed in table s1 2 2 microbial community fe mineral incubation experiments before incubation soil samples were thoroughly mixed and then partitioned into two subsamples one was stored at 4 c and the second was sterilized by gamma radiation 3 kgy hour 1 for 12 h berns et al 2008 soil slurries were prepared by mixing the dry soil with sterile ultrapure water at a ratio of 1 1 hori et al 2007 to allow for the activation of the soil microbes and the depletion of indigenous electron acceptors such as nitrate sulfate and fe iii minerals slurries were pre incubated under anoxic dark conditions at 25 c for 21 days ding et al 2015 hori et al 2010 the pre incubated

haematite surface area ca 200 m2 g 1 fig s1 was synthesized as previously described schwertmann and cornell 2008 and added at a final concentration of 25 mmol l 1 all bottles were flushed with n2 to remove the possible oxygen contamination and then sealed with butyl rubber septa crimped with aluminum caps wrapped with tin foil all bottles were stored in an anaerobic glove box lab star braun germany at room temperature without shaking during the whole incubation period in total each treatment was conducted in 66 replicates bottles the fe iii reduction stage lasted for ca 21 days according to the measured fe ii concentrations and then 0 3 ml of 1 mol l 1 nano3 was re added to the enrichment cultures 100 ml to induce no3 dependent fe ii oxidation 21 days thus the incubation period was separated into fe iii reduction and fe ii oxidation stages during the fe iii reduction stage haematite was the sole terminal electron acceptor while acetate served as an electron donor during the fe

similar pattern of accumulation and consumption of fe ii and ho in all haematite treated soil slurries during the whole incubation fig 1 a and d in the presence of haematite fe ii was produced and increased in the soil slurries during the fe iii reduction stage the increase in fe ii in the manured soil slurries m and mnpk by ca 0 7 g l 1 was higher than that in the soil with mineral fertilizers npk by 0 5 g l 1 or without fertilization control by 0 4 g l 1 fig 1a accompanied by an increase in fe ii ho was generated and gradually increased and the accumulated amount of ho in all soil slurries at the end of the fe iii reduction stage followed the order mnpk 94 nm m 91 nm npk 82 nm control 56 nm fig 1d for the no3 dependent fe ii oxidation stage the introduction of no3 at day 21 resulted in rapid oxidation of fe ii with a faster oxidation rate observed in the manured soil slurries in the initial 10 days than that in the mineral fertilized or unfertilized soils fig 1a and c similarly a sharp decrease in the ho amounts in all soil slurries at the fe ii oxidation stage revealed that fe ii dominated ho generation fig 1d the addition of no3 at day 21 resulted in the rapid generation of nh4 and no2 fig s3 in the soil slurries with a higher rate observed in the manured soils which was consistent with changes in the fe ii content fig 1a in addition the total dissolved fe concentrations in all soil slurries have similar patterns as total fe ii fig 1b to further confirm the concerted effects of microbial communities and fe redox transformation on ho production additional control experiments without the addition of microbial communities or haematite i e with only haematite addition no soil slurry only slurry addition no haematite and soil sterilization sterile soil slurry plus haematite were conducted a small increase in fe ii was observed in the slurry by ca 0 3 g l 1 fig s4a and sterilized by ca 0 2 g l 1 fig s5b soil slurries during the fe iii reduction stage in the haematite only addition treatment the fe ii concentration was approximately 0 02 g l 1 during the whole incubation fig s4d a limited amount of ho was detected in the slurry only setups 20 nm fig s4c haematite only setup 0 nm fig s4f and sterilized soil setups ca 6 nm fig s5c during the fe iii reduction stage pointing to a strong linkage between ho production and microbially mediated fe redox cycling 3 2 transformation of fe minerals to investigate changes in the structure and mineralogy of haematite during microbially mediated fe redox cycling both xrd and fe k edge exafs were applied to identify the secondary fe minerals in the soil slurries at the end of the fe iii reduction and fe ii oxidation stages the xrd patterns of haematite strongly changed after incubation fig s6 indicating that the haematite was transformed to other fe bearing minerals during microbially mediated fe redox cycling goethite and ferrihydrite were identified by xrd in the m and npk fertilized soil slurries further supported by fe k edge exafs spectra fig 2 and table s5 quartz was also identified in the soil slurries fig s6 to further quantify the composition of fe minerals we performed linear combination fitting lcf of the fe k3 weighted exafs spectra fig 2 and table s5 at the initial incubation stage fe bearing minerals mainly consisted of haematite 91 97 intriguingly at the end of the fe iii reduction stage the highest percentage 25 27 of haematite was converted to goethite and ferrihydrite in the manured soil slurries i e m and mnpk followed by 23 in the unfertilized soil slurry control and only 15 in the mineral fertilized soil slurry npk pointing to the distinct microbial communities in the different fertilization soils these newly formed fe minerals may have higher chemical reactivities due to their nanometre particle sizes amorphous and poorly crystalline structure and more charged and rough surfaces than haematite notably more crystalline forms i e goethite were found in the unfertilized and mineral fertilized soil slurries while more poorly ordered phases i e ferrihydrite were formed in the manured soil slurries at the end of the fe ii oxidation stage the poorly ordered ferrihydrite increased in the unfertilized and mineral fertilized soil slurries 3 3 shifts in microbial communities and their linkage to fe redox and ho production to disentangle the contribution of microbial communities to fe redox reactions and ho generation we analyzed the microbial community composition in the initial soil slurries after the fe iii reduction period and after the fe ii oxidation period using illumina miseq sequencing optimized sequences and subsequently used sequences are listed in table s6 the observed otu counts table s7 otu richness ace and shannon diversity fig 3 a and b decreased with incubation duration indicating that the increase in environmental stresses led to a drop in bacterial abundance and diversity the venn diagrams revealed that the shared bacterial numbers decreased with anoxic fe incubations fig s7 and manure fertilized soils had a stronger capacity to conserve the shared bacterial groups than mineral fertilized soils fig s8 in particular manured soil i e m and mnpk slurries had higher otu counts otu richness and shannon diversity than mineral fertilized soil npk slurries during the whole incubation period shifts in microbial community composition were also supported by the dominant bacterial phyla fig s9 and text s12 rarefaction curves fig s10 and rank abundance curves fig s11 these results suggest a more robust microbial community structure in manured soils than in mineral fertilized soil a nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plot showed that microbial communities had high clustering similarity between replicates but exhibited clear differences among the treatments anosim r 0 52 p 0 001 fig 3c a mantel test was used to identify a possible correlation between the microbial community structures and ho production fig 3d bacterial communities were closely correlated with ho concentrations revealing that ho production may be strongly interlinked with microbial communities however bacterial communities and ho concentrations were significantly correlated with fe ii no3 ph goethite ferrihydrite and haematite fig 3d therefore a partial mantel test was used to further investigate the relationship between ho and bacterial community structures table s8 indeed ho had no significant relationship with bacterial community structures after the effect of fe ii was accounted for r 0 09 p 0 117 implying that the microbial community may be indirectly linked with ho through fe ii 3 4 potential microbial drivers of fe ii and ho production to identify the biological contribution of the dominant microbial genus to fe ii and ho production rf analysis was used fig 4 rf analysis screened only three and four microbial genera as predictors for fe ii r 2 0 74 p 0 001 and ho r 2 0 80 p 0 001 respectively k82 belonging to the family rhodocyclaceae was the most important for predicting fe ii p 0 01 and ho p 0 01 other important genera were i dissimilatory fe iii reducing geobacter lovley 2006 weber et al 2006b for fe ii p 0 01 and ho p 0 01 ii paucimonas family of burkholderiaceae characterized by rapid growth and rapid adaptation to mineralize soluble c jeewani et al 2020 or fe ii oxidizing ability peng et al 2019 for fe ii p 0 05 and ho p 0 01 and iii dissimilatory fe iii reducing desulfotomaculu weber et al 2006a for ho p 0 05 these contributions were further supported by multivariate regression analysis tables s9 and s10 the relative abundance of the potential microbial taxonomic predictors in the soil slurries was illustrated by a heatmap showing higher abundances of these microbes in the soil slurries at the end of the fe iii reduction stage fig 4c interestingly the potential microbial taxonomic predictors presented diverse abundances in different fertilized soil slurries at the end of the fe iii reduction stage geobacter and paucimonas showed higher abundances in manured soil slurries while k82 and desulfotomaculum showed higher abundances in mineral fertilized soil slurries independent of the addition of manure i e mnpk and npk 3 5 structural equation model linking microbial and iron to ho production sem was used for an in depth analysis of the direct and indirect effects of microbial drivers on ho production the sem explained 98 0 of the variation in ho production and provided a good fit using the χ2 test rmsea cfi and bollen stine bootstrap metrics fig 5 a grace 2006 schermelleh engel et al 2003 the model confirmed the importance of microbial drivers in ho production with the importance based on the total standardized coefficient following the order rhodocyclaceae k82 desulfotomaculum paucimonas geobacter fig 5b specifically our sem analysis suggested that rhodocyclaceae k82 and desulfotomaculum abundances and fe ii and newly formed fe mineral i e ferrihydrite plus goethite contents had direct positive effects on ho production fig 5b most importantly our sem analysis demonstrated that geobacter rhodocyclaceae k82 desulfotomaculum and paucimonas indirectly regulate ho production via a positive association with fe ii fig 5 furthermore compared with the standardized path coefficients for ho production the indirect effects of geobacter desulfotomaculum rhodocyclaceae k82 and paucimonas ranging from 0 18 to 0 45 were much stronger than their direct effects 0 00 to 0 14 fig 5b taken together sem analysis explained most of the variation in the contents of ho which is mainly indirectly driven by the microbial community structures through the regulating of fe redox cycling 4 discussion 4 1 effects of long term fertilizations on microbial communities and fe transformation high clustering similarity between replicates but significant differences among the soils fig 3c revealed that long term fertilization strongly shifted the soil microbial community composition which was consistent with previous observations in red soils luo et al 2020 wen et al 2018 xun et al 2016 we showed that long term 26 years manure fertilized soils i e m and mnpk had higher otu counts and microbial diversity than mineral fertilized soils npk during the reduction period fig 3a b and table s7 this is in line with changes in fe ii fig 1a and newly formed minerals fig 2 during anoxic incubation haematite as the most stable fe iii oxide may be transformed to highly reactive ferrihydrite and goethite either i via fe iii reduction followed by surface dependent fe ii oxidation or ii through dissolution and reprecipitation processes qafoku et al 2020 raiswell 2011 shi et al 2009 4 2 interactions between key microbial groups taxa with the fe ii and ho production in anoxic soil slurries random forest multiple regression model and sem analyses showed that the fe ii production was directly and significantly regulated by the abundance of rhodocyclaceae k82 geobacter paucimonas and desulfotomaculum figs 4a 5a s12 and table s9 pointing out that these four bacterial genera may act as the keystone fe reducing microorganisms in the anoxic soil slurries both geobacter and desulfotomaculum are widely recognized fe iii reducing microorganisms under anoxic conditions weber et al 2006a regarding the genus k82 the family rhodocyclaceae has been revealed to participate in fe iii reduction porsch et al 2009 since acetate was the sole terminal electron donor at the fe iii reduction stage we speculate that the genus k82 participated in fe iii reduction acetate may be rapidly utilized by microorganisms from soil within few hours fischer and kuzyakov 2010 qiu et al 2017 a strongly positive correlation between k82 and fe ii further confirmed this speculation fig s13 the genus paucimonas increased with fe ii concentration fig s13 and showed higher relative abundance in the soils at the fe iii reduction stage fig 4c similarly the genus paucimonas participated in soil n and fe cycles peng et al 2019 therefore we assume that paucimonas may be involved in fe iii reduction with haematite as the sole electron acceptor at the reduction stage similar to fe ii our findings also demonstrated that the ho production was closely linked to the keystone genera k82 geobacter paucimonas and desulfotomaculum figs 4b 5 and table s10 we further found small but significant direct control of ho production by k82 p 0 001 and desulfotomaculum p 0 001 fig 5a some keystone genera have the ability to produce trace o2 in anoxic environments kraft et al 2022 the produced trace o2 with acetate as the electron donor can be further converted to extracellular o2 and h2o2 the precursor to ho formation through enzymatic catalysis diaz et al 2013 gordon et al 1953 learman et al 2011 lieberman and barker 1954 moreover o2 can react with h2o2 to form ho hayyan et al 2016 through the haber weiss reaction haber et al 1934 the secretion of o2 and the reduction of fe iii are reported to connect with microbial oxidative stress removal and iron acquisition yu et al 2020 hence we assume that the direct control exerted by k82 and desulfotomaculum on ho production may occur by regulating microbial mediated o2 formation intriguingly k82 geobacter paucimonas and desulfotomaculum also control ho production through an indirect pathway fig 5b this is not surprising as fe ii is involved in catalyzing ho generation garrido ramírez et al 2010 georgiou et al 2015 page et al 2013 pereira et al 2012 petigara et al 2002 trusiak et al 2018 yu and kuzyakov 2021 and the fe ii production in our study was directly and significantly p 0 05 regulated by k82 geobacter paucimonas and desulfotomaculum figs 5a and s12 compared to other soil slurries a higher abundance of geobacter and paucimonas fig 4c in the manure fertilized soil slurries resulted in much more ho production fig 1d implying the importance of fertilization treatments in modulating ho production and its key drivers taken together these results indicated that microbial communities may drive ho production through mediating both the extracellular o2 formation and fe redox cycling indeed the stronger indirect impact of geobacter desulfotomaculum k82 and paucimonas on ho formation fig 5b suggests that microbial communities control ho generation in an anaerobic environment primarily through mediating fe redox cycling these results provide direct evidence for the microbial mediation of fe redox cycling linked to ho production in anoxic environments furthermore the production of ho radicals causes cell inactivation or inhibits the growth of cells through triggering membrane lipid peroxidation wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 during the fe iii reduction stage decrease in the observed otu counts table s7 otu richness ace and shannon diversity may be a result of the production of ho fig 3a and b consequently the production of ho radicals alters the activity and composition of microbial communities possibly through a damage of membrane lipid peroxidation the selective pressure of ho radicals on microbial communities further affected fe species transformation fig 3d 4 3 possible mechanisms of ho generation under anoxic environments ho radicals can be produced via photochemical georgiou et al 2015 page et al 2013 kappler et al 2021 biotic han et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 kappler et al 2021 or abiotic garrido ramírez et al 2010 kappler et al 2021 pathways yet it remains unclear how ho can be produced under anoxic environments recently xian et al 2019 showed that interactions between mineral defect sites of fe oxyhydr oxides and h2o in anoxic environments made the hydroxylation energetically favorable on the surface of iron minerals eq 1 1 fe iii h 2 o fe ii ho h this finding provides new insight into iron mineral assisted ho formation in anoxic conditions moreover kraft et al 2022 proposed the following oxygen production pathway in nitrosopumilus maritimus eq 2 2 4 no 2 4 e 4 no o 2 2 n 2 o this pathway requires electrons to produce o2 which may partly be supplied by acetate in our study in the presence of o2 traces ho radicals can be further produced by microbial modulation of iron redox transformation via fenton or fenton like reactions kappler et al 2021 yu and kuzyakov 2021 our sem results fig 5 showed that microorganisms drove ho generation in anoxic environments predominantly by modulation of iron redox transformation that was more prominent than microbial direct roles therefore the ho in anoxic environments may be mainly generated through abiotic eq 1 rather than biotic eq 2 processes which needs further exploration 4 4 environmental implications the oxidation of fe ii or fe ii bearing minerals in aerobic environments is the vital source of intensive ros fluxes at soil water interfaces chen et al 2021 chi et al 2022b du et al 2021 georgiou et al 2008 han et al 2021 melton et al 2014 op de beeck et al 2018 schoonen et al 2006 in anoxic soil slurries the cumulative amounts of ho were less than 100 nm fig 1d which were 2 4 orders of magnitude lower than those in the oxygenation processes of surface sediments tong et al 2016 or anoxic oxic cycles of sediments han et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 although the ho amounts produced in anoxic environments are low fig 1d it is very important to close a loop of the ho production in both anoxic and oxic environments these findings imply that 1 ho can be sustainably generated in natural ecosystems and 2 anoxic environments may be a new ho source the low ho production in anoxic environments may possess a limited impact on c emission but a profound impact on soil c persistence faust et al 2021 lehmann et al 2020 in humid soils however the ros mediated soc decomposition counteracts c protection by minerals chen et al 2020 fe minerals and microbial communities synergistically increased co2 efflux up to 15 times accompanied by a burst of ho in the presence of plant residues du et al 2020 pointing to the critical role of ros production in elucidating the mechanisms of priming effects in soil hotspots e g soil water interfaces kuzyakov et al 2000 merino et al 2020 moreover the ho burst is important for the bioavailability of the n pool in soils op de beeck et al 2018 wang et al 2021 on the other hand the generated ho can easily split chemical bonds in soc resulting in an increase in dissolved oc release and oc bioavailability du et al 2020 both charged small molecules and water soluble macromolecules are favorable for binding on mineral surfaces and then form newly organo mineral complexes to increase the persistence of c in soils faust et al 2021 lehmann et al 2020 kleber et al 2005 kögel knabner et al 2008 although ros species have a very short lifespan yu and kuzyakov 2021 at soil water interfaces microbial chelator mediated fenton catalysis can promote sustained ros generation tamaru et al 2019 which may have a profound impact on c and nutrient cycles in certain ecosystems e g flooded soils humid forest or lake sediments our finding also indicated that organic inputs e g manure strongly increased the ho concentrations when compared to unfertilized control or soil with solely mineral fertilization consequently this explains the higher mineral associated c content in soils with organic fertilization yu et al 2017 more broadly weather extremes e g extreme precipitation or drought events as well as climatic trends e g stratospheric ozone depletion may impart soil slurries with stronger redox fluctuations and uv and thus more ros production overland et al 2016 smith et al 2017 sulzberger et al 2019 which will definitely elevate the role of ros in c and nutrient cycles in some ecosystems e g humid forests or dry deserts therefore in a changing world we call for studying complex environmental gradients long term time series and modeling to establish causality between interconnected community interactions e g competition mutualism and commensalism and redox active minerals and their linkage to c and nutrient cycling in water ecosystems 4 conclusions and future perspectives our findings showed that interactions between microbial communities and fe minerals in soil slurries synergistically drive ho production through microbial fe iii reduction and transformation to newly formed minerals these microbially mediated fe iii reduction and transformation to new minerals were predominantly responsible for ho production in the anoxic environment ho production was closely linked to the keystone genera k82 geobacter paucimonas and desulfotomaculum the discrepancies in the abundance of these genera interpreted well the ho production in soil slurries under a wide range of fertilization practices because microorganisms in soil are present but frequently not active blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2013 hori et al 2010 further investigations should focus on the functions of the active microbial genera i e geobacter desulfotomaculum k82 and paucimonas producing ho stable isotope probing and pyrosequencing techniques seem very promising to link the microbial activities with the functions specific for ho production ding et al 2015 hori et al 2010 altogether our findings establish a causality between ho production and microbial mineral interactions at soil water interfaces and show the profound impact on carbon and nutrient cycles in anoxic environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15844,biochar assisted microbial degradation technology is considered as an important strategy to eliminate organic pollutants but the mechanism of biochar in affecting biodegradation has not been systematically studied to address this knowledge gap the effect of various biochars on biodegradation of different initial concentrations of bde 47 by pseudomonas plecoglossicida was investigated the results showed that biochar exhibited significant promotion to the biodegradation of bde 47 especially at concentrations of bde 47 above 100 μg l the promotion effect was negatively influenced by the aromaticity and micropore volume of biochar biochar alleviated the cytotoxicity of bde 47 to p plecoglossicida and promoted cell proliferation based on toxicity assays additionally biochar acted as shelter and stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances which might support p plecoglossicida to struggle with extreme conditions metabolomic analysis indicated that biochar resulted in upregulation expression of 38 metabolites in p plecoglossicida these upregulated metabolites were mainly related to glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism citrate cycle and serial amino acid metabolism suggesting that biochar could improve the bde 47 biodegradation via enhancing oxidative metabolism and energy supply of the bacterial cells this work elucidates how biochar can affect bde 47 biodegradation and provides insights for the application prospect of biochar assisted microbial degradation technology in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bde 47 biodegradation biochar adsorption desorption cytotoxicity metabolomics 1 introduction as a class of brominated flame retardants polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are widely applied in a range of products rahman et al 2001 pbdes can easily migrate from the products to environment matrices because they are usually blended in the products rather than chemically bonded to them yao et al 2021 although pbdes have been banned by many countries and organizations they were still detected in various environmental and biological samples liu et al 2019b xiong et al 2016 the investigation on an e waste dismantling area in china showed that the contents of pbdes in soils and sediments were high up to 44 47 and 16 08 mg kg respectively ti et al 2020 wong et al 2007 among which 2 2 4 4 tetrabrominated diphenyl ether bde 47 was one of the common congeners tang et al 2021 pbdes are typically featured with high toxicity environmental persistence and bioaccumulation posing a significant threat to ecological security and human health xiang et al 2019 studies have demonstrated that pbdes could destroy the human thyroid function liver and nervous system even induce carcinogenicity jacobson et al 2016 man et al 2011 therefore how to efficiently eliminate pbdes from the polluted environment has always been an urgent demand bioremediation is considered as a promising technology of hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs because of its cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness ti et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the biodegradation of hocs by microorganisms is usually mediated by their metabolism many studies have been conducted to investigate the biodegradation of pbdes in both anaerobic and aerobic conditions for example tang et al 2021 reported that pseudomonas aeruginosa yh could degrade bde 47 0 5 mg l by 41 8 within 5 d guo et al 2021 reported a high efficiency bde 47 degrading bacterial consortium which was screened from an e waste dismantling site with a degradation rate up to 52 5 within a week nonetheless the biodegradation efficiency of hocs is not as high as expected in practical application which might be attributed to the unsatisfactory viability and bioactivity under adverse environmental constraints focusing on this problem researchers proposed biochar combined with bioremediation technology liu et al 2021 nie et al 2021 biochar has a porous structure and high environmental stability which can provide shelter sites for microorganisms to resist the adverse environmental impacts qi et al 2021 ouyang et al 2021 reported that biochar significantly improved metabolic ability and community stability of bacterial consortium gyb1 enhancing the biodegradation efficiency of pcb 118 similarly comparing with biodegradation efficiency of 29 6 without biochar pseudomonas citronellolis showed a high biodegradation efficiency of 46 9 for high concentrations of phenol 600 mg l with biochar addition zhao et al 2020 other investigators however proposed the adverse effects of biochar on biodegradation of hocs biochar has been reported to have a high affinity for hocs because of its hydrophobic surface and microporous structure liu et al 2019a which would greatly decrease the bioavailability of hocs to microorganisms and lead to high residual levels for example xin et al 2014 observed that the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 was significantly decreased by biochar and suspected that the biodegradation of bde 47 was restricted by its slow desorption from biochar from this point of view understanding the physicochemical interaction between hocs and biochar is crucial for their biodegradation however the effect of adsorption desorption of hocs by biochar on their biodegradation and their mutual relationship is poorly understood to help understand their relationship it is presumed that the initial concentration of hocs and the physicochemical properties of biochar could dramatically influence this process the adsorption of hocs on biochar was driven by multiple mechanisms including pore filling and surface adsorption xin et al 2013 the parts of hocs adsorbed on biochar were easily desorbed while the other parts were strongly bound the easy desorption fractions adsorbed on biochar were conducive to the control of hocs concentration and would not affect their further degradation the adsorption and desorption capacity to hocs was closely related to the physicochemical properties of biochar while biochar properties vary greatly with the feedstock sources and pyrolysis conditions additionally the effects of biochar on the biodegradation of hocs were a complex process except for adsorption desorption to hocs it was reported that biochar could promote extracellular polymer eps production shi et al 2019 which might affect the biodegradation of hocs besides the biodegradation of hocs by microorganisms is usually mediated by their metabolism therefore the change of microbial metabolomics caused by biochar was an indispensable factor for this process this work aimed to investigate the mechanisms of how biochar can affect the biodegradation of bde 47 to systematically explore the underlying mechanisms a series of well designed experiments were conducted such as the relationship between abiotic adsorption desorption and biodegradation kinetics of bde 47 the effect of biochar on cytotoxicity of bde 47 to microorganism and the changes of microbial surface properties biofilm formation and esp secretion and microbial metabolomics in the present of biochar the results of this study are vital to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of biochar combined with bioremediation technology for pbdes remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

biochar on bde 47 biodegradation were investigated via doping 0 5 w v of various biochars into the degradation system with the different initial concentrations of bde 47 the samples were shaken 160 rpm at 30 for 168 h bde 47 was extracted according to the previous report tang et al 2021 and subsequently quantified the samples by gc ms as described in section s3 additionally the ultrasonic extraction method was used for the samples containing biochar to distinguish the adsorbed bde 47 by biochar from the degraded bde 47 by bacteria the recovery efficiency of bde 47 for samples without biochar was 92 9 103 5 for samples containing biochar the recovery of bde 47 ranged from 89 9 to 101 4 2 3 biochar adsorption desorption experiments to clarify the role of storage and release of bde 47 by biochar in the biodegradation system bde 47 adsorption desorption experiments by biochar without the strain inoculation were conducted the freundlich model and three phase model were used to fit the bde 47 adsorption isotherm and desorption kinetics respectively the detailed information on the experimental methods and models were presented in section s4 2 4 determination of antioxidant

reactive oxygen species ros cell apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry gallios usa and the methods were based on previous studies tang et al 2018 briefly the 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da was used as an indicator to measure ros generation annexin v fitc and pi staining was used for the quantification of cell apoptosis cells were fixed by 70 ethanol for 12 h at 4 c and then stained with propidium iodide pi for cell cycle determination 2 5 determination of the bacterial surface properties the surface and ultrastructure of planktonic bacteria or bacteria attached on biochar were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem and the procedure of sample preparation was described in section s5 the eps produced by bacteria was extracted using an oscillation ultrasound method combining with the cation exchange resin technique han et al 2021 detailed information on the extraction method of eps can be seen in section s6 the

experimental treatment the effect of biochar on the metabolism of p plecoglossicida during bde 47 biodegradation was investigated p plecoglossicida was exposed to 1000 μg l of bde 47 with or without biochar addition for 48 h respectively bacterial cells after exposure were separated at 9000 rpm and washed three times with pbs the washed cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for metabolomic analysis based on gc ms each treatment was performed in six biological replicates 2 6 2 gc ms analysis metabolites in bacterial cells were extracted with methanol and chloroform the

adsorption by p plecoglossicida the heat killed bacteria were used as the control group to study the removal of bde 47 by the strain in the control there was no significant change in bde 47 concentration during the incubation of 168 h fig s1 so that the removal of bde 47 by the strain was mainly attributed to biodegradation the degradation dynamics of bde 47 with different initial concentrations by p plecoglossicida were showed in fig 1 a the rapid degradation of bde 47 occurred in the initial 72 h followed by a slow increase and lasted for about 120 h to reach degradation equilibrium several degradation products of bde 47 were identified by hplc qtof ms section s3 including hydroxylated pbdes bromophenol phenol and ring opening products table s3 indicating that aerobic biodegradation of bde 47 by p plecoglossicida was mainly through debromination hydroxylation ether bond breaking and ring opening an elevation of biodegradation efficiency was observed at bde 47 concentrations from 50 μg l to 100 μg l at which the biodegradation efficiencies were 58 4 and 63 2 as the initial concentrations increased from 100 μg l to 2000 μg l the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 showed a decreased tendency and the value was only 17 3 at 2000 μg l of bde 47 the temporary augmentation of biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 might be attributed to the rise of bioavailable contents nevertheless the further increasing concentrations of bde 47 were unfavorable for biodegradation which might be related to the inhibition of the activity of relevant degrading enzymes the influence of different initial bde 47 concentrations on cell proliferation of p plecoglossicida was investigated and expressed using od450 value fig 1b the cell numbers in the presence of bde 47 were a little lower than in control without bde 47 addition at 24 h at 48 h the low level of bde 47 slightly promoted cell proliferation while the high concentration of bde 47 still slightly inhibited the proliferation studies have shown that pbdes can act partially as a carbon source to promote microorganism growth robrock et al 2009 ti et al 2020 previous studies have suggested that more exposure to hocs would increase the oxidative stress level and accumulate redundant intracellular ros souza et al 2013 yu et al 2020 oxidative damage provoked by excessive ros might lead to cell viability reduction and further impede the biodegradation of bde 47 the changes of intracellular ros in p plecoglossicida at different initial bde 47 concentrations were investigated as shown in figs 1c and s2 the ros contents elevated with bde 47 concentrations suggesting a gradual increase of intracellular oxidative stress cellular oxidative stress can activate the antioxidant defense system and generate antioxidant enzymes to eliminate excessive ros zhang et al 2016 as depicted in fig 1d there were no significant changes of sod and cat activities at 100 and 200 μg l of bde 47 as compared to control without bde 47 addition these two enzyme activities were enhanced gradually at bde 47 concentrations from 200 μg l to 2000 μg l which implied that enzymes were maintaining the physiological balance through the elimination of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxides therefore the biodegradation reduction might be related to the oxidative damage induced by high concentration bde 47 in p plecoglossicida 3 2 effects of biochar on the biodegradation efficiency the removal of bde 47 in the biochar bacteria system might be attributed not only to the microbial metabolism but also the adsorption by biochar the ultrasonic extraction method eliminated the contribution of bde 47 adsorption by biochar to removal efficiency hence the removal of bde 47 through biodegradation was regarded as the primary mechanism under the tested conditions fig 2 showed the effects of the various biochars on biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 which was closely related to the initial concentration of bde 47 the biodegradation efficiency with higher initial bde 47 concentrations 200 500 and 1000 μg l was promoted by biochars in the presence of biochars the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 was increased by 10 3 23 3 19 2 40 5 and 54 9 83 6 at initial bde 47 concentrations of 200 500 and 1000 μg l respectively based on the results in section 3 1 the biodegradation of bde 47 was largely restricted by its high initial concentration because of the oxidative stress therefore the enhancement of biodegradation of bde 47 by biochars might be attributed to the reduction of initial bde 47 concentration by adsorption of biochars other investigators also proposed that biochar can act as an adsorbent carbon source and shelter of microorganisms to promote biodegradation of hocs liu et al 2021 tao et al 2019 yang et al 2021 the highest strengthening effect was obtained by eb400 and it resulted in final biodegradation efficiency of 66 2 59 7 and 47 8 for initial bde 47 concentrations of 200 500 and 1000 μg l respectively the difference in the effects of various biochars on biodegradation might be ascribed to their physicochemical properties zhao et al 2020 however biochar addition had no significant effect on bde 47 biodegradation and even slightly reduced its biodegradation efficiency when the initial concentration of bde 47 was 50 μg l and 100 μg l the adsorption desorption process might be the main influence factor for the concentration dependent effect 3 3 adsorption desorption of bde 47 by biochar related to biodegradation the adsorption capacity of eb400 eb500 eb600 fb400 fb500 and fb600 for bde 47 was tested in the absence of p plecoglossicida the rapid adsorption occurred in the initial 8 h fig 3 a it was followed by a slow increase in the bde 47 adsorption by biochars and lasted for more than 24 h to reach apparent equilibrium the adsorption capacity varied a great deal 3 58 7 39 mg g for various biochars this result might be attributed to the physicochemical properties of biochars such as specific surface area micropore structure and surface functional groups liu et al 2019a the freundlich model was found to accurately describe the adsorption thermodynamics experiments of the bde 47 fig 3b all the freundlich exponential coefficients n values were less than 1 table s4 which confirmed the heterogeneous adsorption process of bde 47 on the biochars and the co existence of multiple mechanisms chen et al 2008 additionally the adsorption ability varied with the bde 47 concentration which could be exhibited by the adsorption distribution coefficient k d calculated at different ce levels as shown in table s4 the order of log k d was different at three ce levels ce 0 01s w ce 0 1s w ce 1s w for six biochars this result indicated that the predominant adsorption mechanisms might be changed with the concentration variation xin et al 2013 chen et al 2008 demonstrated pore filling was the predominant mechanism for hocs adsorption at low concentration levels while the dominant role of the pore filling mechanism was replaced by surface adsorption as the concentration gradually increased thus the reduction of biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 at the lower initial concentration of bde 47 might be attributed to that the contact between p plecoglossicida and bde 47 adsorbed in micropores of biochar was obstructed besides studies have shown that hocs adsorbed in micropore of biochar was harder to be desorbed as compared to that on the surface of biochar which adverse to their degradation xin et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 therefore desorption process of bde 47 adsorbed on biochar might also be a significant influence factor for biodegradation as depicted in fig 3c and table s5 the desorption kinetics of bde 47 adsorbed on various biochars were well fitted by a triphasic model r2 0 99 the whole desorption process firstly showed a rapid fall phase followed by an interim stage and then a very slow fall phase until equilibrium the order of maximum desorption amounts of bde 47 adsorbed on various biochars was eb400 fb400 eb500 fb500 fb600 eb600 table s5 the relationship between the biodegradation efficiencies of bde 47 in the biochar bacteria system and the rapid slow and very slow desorption fractions f r f s and f v were examined as shown in fig 3d the biodegradation efficiencies had significant and positive correlations p 0 05 with f r and f s this result indicated that the f r and f s could be considered as an indicator to predict the bioavailability of bde 47 in the biochar bacteria system the bde 47 adsorbed on biochar external surfaces or in meso and macro pore might be desorbed firstly with increasing time while the bde 47 adsorbed in micropores or within biochar matrix was harder to be desorbed xin et al 2014 a few previous studies have suggested that desorption capacity of hocs adsorbed on biochar was related to the physicochemical properties of biochar hilber et al 2017 marchal et al 2013 the desorption experiments further showed that the porosity of biochar inhibited the desorption capacity of bde 47 from biochar significant and negative correlations between the desorption amounts of bde 47 f r and f s and the micropore volumes of biochar were observed fig s3 this result further demonstrated that biochar exerted an inhibitory effect on biodegradation at the low concentration of bde 47 owing to the pore filling mechanism our results showed that desorption amounts of bde 47 were also significantly and negatively correlated with the aromatic carbon contents of biochars figs s3 and s4 the π structures of bde 47 molecules were deficient in electron π electron acceptors because of the strong electron withdrawing ability of the br and ether groups in the bde 47 molecules which could interact strongly with the π structures with electron rich π electron donors of the aromatic carbon domains of biochar xin et al 2013 this strong binding force would impede desorption of bde 47 from biochar the effect of biochars on the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 was also related to their aromatic carbon contents and micropore volumes as shown in fig s3 the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 increased with a decrease in these two parameters most of the bde 47 adsorbed in fb400 and eb400 was easily desorbed suggesting a weaker binding force between bde 47 and them which was advantageous to the biodegradation of bde 47 the ftir spectra fig s5 demonstrated that the stronger vibration peaks of some organic functional groups were found in fb400 and eb400 thus the binding of bde 47 was mainly via the partition of these organic functional groups additionally it can be observed that the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 was positively correlated with its maximum desorption amounts fig 3d to further clarify the effect of desorption process on biodegradation of bde 47 in the biochar bacteria system an assisted desorption experiment was conducted by the addition of rhamnolipid a model biosurfactant to facilitate desorption of adsorbed bde 47 firstly the effect of rhamnolipid concentrations within a critical micelle concentration cmc on bde 47 biodegradation by p plecoglossicida was investigated fig s6 the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 increased first and then decreased with increasing rhamnolipid concentration the addition of rhamnolipid with 0 2 cmc increased the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 by 13 8 while there was no obvious effect of 1 cmc of rhamnolipid on bde 47 biodegradation therefore 1 cmc of rhamnolipid was used to assist the desorption of bde 47 in the presence of rhamnolipid the maximum desorption amounts of adsorbed bde 47 in biochar were increased by 7 3 15 6 compared to the desorption amounts without rhamnolipid addition fig 4 a the increase of desorption amounts of bde 47 induced by rhamnolipid resulted in an increase in the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 rhamnolipid enhanced the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 by 10 5 18 2 fig 4b in general the biochar decreased the biodegradation efficiency at lower initial bde 47 concentration which can be attributed to the limitation of desorption in contrast it promoted the biodegradation efficiency of the higher concentration of bde 47 when the initial bde 47 concentration was 500 μg l the desorption amounts of bde 47 were more than its degradation percentage before reaching the degradation equilibrium which indicated that the desorption amounts of bde 47 were enough to satisfy the demand of the strain for reproduction and degradation therefore the degradation percentage of bde 47 was primarily restricted by its degradation efficiency as mentioned in section 3 1 the high concentration of bde 47 could inhibit biodegradation the toxicity of bde 47 to bacterial cells was alleviated owing to the initial adsorption of biochar and the subsequent gradual desorption kept the roles of bde 47 in balance between a toxin and a carbon source in this respect eb400 had more potential for balancing the toxicity and bioavailability of bde 47 to bacteria because of its higher desorption potential 3 4 effects of biochar on bacterial surface properties sem was used to demonstrate the surface morphology of biochars p plecoglossicida and p plecoglossicida attached to biochar the surface of various biochars was observed to be porous and coarse fig s7 such a structure was believed to serve as a shelter or supporter for p plecoglossicida as shown in fig 5 a when biochars were introduced to the biodegradation system biofilms were clearly observed on the surface of biochars there were also morphological differences with close structures forming on some biochars such as fb400 and eb400 and loose structures forming on the others it was suggested that the composition and spatial distribution of biofilms were closely associated with the physicochemical properties of carriers han et al 2021 the formation of biofilms was affected by the interaction between the carrier surfaces and the extracellular polymeric matrix such as hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding interaction hill et al 2019 in fact most of these features differed significantly in various biochars which might make the morphological differences of biofilms the ftir results also confirmed that large amounts of bacterial cells adhere to the surface of biochar figs 5b and s8 compared with eb400 the spectrum of eb400 attached with p plecoglossicida p eb400 exhibited additional peaks the vibrational peak at 1643 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 was assigned to nh bending vibration of amide i and amide ii bands from proteins han et al 2021 eps is a main component of biofilms and it is mainly composed of proteins and polysaccharides bu et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 polysaccharides and proteins were extracted and measured to study the effect of various biochars on the property of eps the concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins were significantly increased with the introduction of various biochars to the biodegradation system especially the addition of fb400 and eb400 fig 5c this is consistent with zhu et al 2021 who observed that biochar could stimulate eps secretion additionally studies have shown that biochar addition can protect microorganisms against hocs toxicity by regulating eps secretion premnath et al 2021 shi et al 2019 therefore except reducing the initial bde 47 concentration by adsorption biochar could promote more eps production to alleviate the stress of bde 47 and enhance biodegradation efficiency in summary the effect of biochar on bde 47 biodegradation by p plecoglossicida was regulated by its physicochemical properties biochar with a well developed pore structure acted as shelter and stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances which might support the strain to struggle with extreme conditions the composition and spatial distribution of biofilms were closely associated with the physicochemical properties of biochar besides the adsorption desorption process of bde 47 by biochar was closely related to the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 in biochar bacteria system and this process was affected by the physicochemical properties of biochar for example biochar with less aromatic carbon contents and micropore volumes had weaker binding force with bde 47 which was conducive to the desorption of bde 47 from biochar and thus promoted bde 47 biodegradation 3 5 effect of biochar on cytotoxicity of bde 47 to investigate the effect of biochar on the toxicity of bde 47 to p plecoglossicida cytotoxicity assays including cell proliferation ros cell cycle and cell apoptosis were conducted with or without biochar addition as shown in fig 6 c bde 47 slightly inhibited cell proliferation while significant promotion on cell proliferation was observed in the presence of biochar additionally a decrease in ros level was observed in the presence of both bde 47 and biochar compared to bde 47 alone this suggests that biochar could alleviate the bde 47 stress to p plecoglossicida dissolved organic matters released from biochar were reported as growth substrates that can enhance the metabolism of microorganisms and reduce oxidative stress levels zhao et al 2020 fig s9 showed dissolved organic matters extracted from eb400 eb500 and eb600 promoted bde 47 biodegradation the effect of biochar on the genotoxicity of the bde 47 was estimated by cell cycle changes and results were illustrated in fig 6a and d in the control group there were 30 2 66 9 and 2 9 of cells in stage b c and d of the cell cycle respectively the cells in stage d significantly increased to 10 1 after exposure to bde 47 alone suggesting that cells arrested in stage d in which the main biological process was protein synthesis thus the cell cycle might be perturbed by bde 47 through inhibiting protein synthesis this result was consistent with previous studies which reported that bde 32 and bde 47 exposure inhibited protein synthesis saquib et al 2016 tang et al 2018 the proportions of cells in stage d reduced to 1 2 when bde 47 and biochar existed together this demonstrated that biochar addition weakened the genotoxicity of bde 47 when cells are irreversibly damaged by the adverse environment apoptosis is usually triggered to remove the disabled cell as shown in fig 6b and e the proportion of apoptotic cells increased from 12 4 to 19 4 after exposure to bde 47 which further confirmed the cytotoxicity of bde 47 this is in accordance with the results reported by guo et al 2021 who found that the apoptotic rate in bacterial consortium qy2 was significantly increased by bde 47 stress notably the proportion of apoptotic cells decreased to 2 3 in the case of coexisting bde 47 and biochar and biochar significantly increased the number of live cells the trend of the proportion of live cells basically coincided with the changes of cell proliferation consequently these results proved that biochar could alleviate cytotoxicity of bde 47 and promote cell proliferation which was conducive to the biodegradation process 3 6 metabolomic changes during biodegradation environmental stimuli can lead to the change in the contents of small molecules known as metabolites in living cells which is a sensitive index for intracellular responses to external stressors hence the study of bacterial metabolites is conducive to clearly understanding the difference in biological response of p plecoglossicida to bde 47 with or without biochar addition during biodegradation a total of 285 metabolites were identified in two groups of samples mainly including amino acids fatty acids sugars nucleotides pls da analysis was performed on these metabolites to assess the metabolic variance induced by biochar in the biodegradation process of bde 47 as shown in fig 7 a a clear separation was observed in two groups of samples suggesting that biochar addition altered the bacterial metabolite profile among these metabolites 48 metabolites with statistically significant differences were identified by further screened differentially expressed metabolites were normalized and hierarchy clustered and represented in a heatmap fig 7b among which 10 metabolites were downregulated expression and 38 metabolites were upregulated expression fig s10 such dominant upregulation indicated that biochar addition exerted promoting effect on bacterial metabolism the analysis of kegg pathways reflected that these upregulated metabolites were mainly related to glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism citrate cycle tca cycle and aminoacyl trna biosynthesis fig 7c the metabolism of carbohydrate and amino acid are strongly connected via glycolysis and tca cycle the changes in the related products involved in the tca cycle and amino acid metabolism were summarized in a simplified schematic of metabolic network fig 8 the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and the tca cycle are the main ways of material metabolism and energy supply in bacterial cells the upregulation of metabolites involved in these two metabolic pathways including fumaric acid isocitric acid malic acid serine glycine l glutamate and aspartate indicated that biochar enhanced oxidative metabolism and energy supply of bacterial cells this was consistent with the observed result of cell proliferation in treatment with biochar it might be attributed that biochar released dissolved organic matter to provide additional carbon sources for bacteria li et al 2020 reported that biochar can enhance soil bacterial carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism thereby alleviating pah stress amino acid metabolism plays a key role in cell physiological processes including regulating the transport of substances across the cell membranes and participating in the synthesis and activity of key cellular enzymes thereby affecting the degradation of organic pollutants multiple amino acids were up regulated which involved a variety of metabolic pathways including arginine biosynthesis lysine degradation alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis specifically aspartate and glutamate are significant nitrogen donors for the synthesis of various amino acids and bases reitzer 2013 their upregulation indicated that material transformations in p plecoglossicida were enhanced by biochar l glutamine can be used as a substrate participating in the synthesis of various biomolecules such as aminosugars purine and pyrimidine liu et al 2019c a large increase in l glutamine was observed in bc treatment suggesting that biochar might enhance cell replication and activities of p plecoglossicida additionally l glutamine is closely relevant to the utilization of inorganic nitrogen therefore biochar might promote the bio assimilation of inorganic nitrogen the contents of glycine l 2 hydroxyglutaric acid and alpha aminoadipic acid increased in the pathway of lysine degradation signifying the promotion of lysine degradation which could accelerate cell proliferation de mello serrano et al 2012 besides glycine was also related to the formation of biofilm it was reported that glycine was involved in the synthesis of cell wall anchored protein that was responsible for intercellular adhesion within the biofilm yarawsky et al 2017 this result was consistent with the formation of biofilm on biochar amino acids must be activated to obtain additional energy before synthesizing polypeptide chains this activation reaction is catalyzed by aminoacyl trna synthase novoa et al 2010 as mentioned in section 3 5 bde 47 exposure resulted in the obstruction of protein synthesis arresting cells in stage d this might be attributed to the obstruction of aminoacyl trna biosynthesis biochar addition up regulated metabolites involved in aminoacyl trna biosynthesis pathway suggesting that biochar eliminated the inhibition of bde 47 on protein synthesis this result was consistent with our result in cell cycle assay in which cell cycle progression was restored after biochar addition 4 conclusions this study systemically investigated the mechanism of biochar in affecting bde 47 biodegradation by p plecoglossicida the results demonstrated that biochar exhibited significant promotion to the biodegradation of bde 47 especially at concentrations of bde 47 above 100 μg l biochar with less aromatic carbon contents and micropore volumes had weaker binding force with bde 47 which was conducive to the desorption of bde 47 from biochar and thus promoted bde 47 biodegradation the enhancement of bde 47 biodegradation caused by biochar was partly because the initial adsorption of bde 47 by biochar alleviated the cytotoxicity of bde 47 to the bacteria and then gradual desorption regulated its bioavailability another reason is that biochar acted as shelter and stimulated eps secretion protecting the bacteria against extreme conditions moreover the metabolomic analysis indicated that biochar addition exerted promoting effect on the metabolism of p plecoglossicida during bde 47 biodegradation the kegg pathway analysis showed biochar enhanced the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism citrate cycle and serial amino acid metabolism in p plecoglossicida this study more comprehensively revealed the possible mechanisms of enhancing biodegradation by biochar and helped expand the application of biochar in the removal of

15844,biochar assisted microbial degradation technology is considered as an important strategy to eliminate organic pollutants but the mechanism of biochar in affecting biodegradation has not been systematically studied to address this knowledge gap the effect of various biochars on biodegradation of different initial concentrations of bde 47 by pseudomonas plecoglossicida was investigated the results showed that biochar exhibited significant promotion to the biodegradation of bde 47 especially at concentrations of bde 47 above 100 μg l the promotion effect was negatively influenced by the aromaticity and micropore volume of biochar biochar alleviated the cytotoxicity of bde 47 to p plecoglossicida and promoted cell proliferation based on toxicity assays additionally biochar acted as shelter and stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances which might support p plecoglossicida to struggle with extreme conditions metabolomic analysis indicated that biochar resulted in upregulation expression of 38 metabolites in p plecoglossicida these upregulated metabolites were mainly related to glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism citrate cycle and serial amino acid metabolism suggesting that biochar could improve the bde 47 biodegradation via enhancing oxidative metabolism and energy supply of the bacterial cells this work elucidates how biochar can affect bde 47 biodegradation and provides insights for the application prospect of biochar assisted microbial degradation technology in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bde 47 biodegradation biochar adsorption desorption cytotoxicity metabolomics 1 introduction as a class of brominated flame retardants polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are widely applied in a range of products rahman et al 2001 pbdes can easily migrate from the products to environment matrices because they are usually blended in the products rather than chemically bonded to them yao et al 2021 although pbdes have been banned by many countries and organizations they were still detected in various environmental and biological samples liu et al 2019b xiong et al 2016 the investigation on an e waste dismantling area in china showed that the contents of pbdes in soils and sediments were high up to 44 47 and 16 08 mg kg respectively ti et al 2020 wong et al 2007 among which 2 2 4 4 tetrabrominated diphenyl ether bde 47 was one of the common congeners tang et al 2021 pbdes are typically featured with high toxicity environmental persistence and bioaccumulation posing a significant threat to ecological security and human health xiang et al 2019 studies have demonstrated that pbdes could destroy the human thyroid function liver and nervous system even induce carcinogenicity jacobson et al 2016 man et al 2011 therefore how to efficiently eliminate pbdes from the polluted environment has always been an urgent demand bioremediation is considered as a promising technology of hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs because of its cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness ti et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the biodegradation of hocs by microorganisms is usually mediated by their metabolism many studies have been conducted to investigate the biodegradation of pbdes in both anaerobic and aerobic conditions for example tang et al 2021 reported that pseudomonas aeruginosa yh could degrade bde 47 0 5 mg l by 41 8 within 5 d guo et al 2021 reported a high efficiency bde 47 degrading bacterial consortium which was screened from an e waste dismantling site with a degradation rate up to 52 5 within a week nonetheless the biodegradation efficiency of hocs is not as high as expected in practical application which might be attributed to the unsatisfactory viability and bioactivity under adverse environmental constraints focusing on this problem researchers proposed biochar combined with bioremediation technology liu et al 2021 nie et al 2021 biochar has a porous structure and high environmental stability which can provide shelter sites for microorganisms to resist the adverse environmental impacts qi et al 2021 ouyang et al 2021 reported that biochar significantly improved metabolic ability and community stability of bacterial consortium gyb1 enhancing the biodegradation efficiency of pcb 118 similarly comparing with biodegradation efficiency of 29 6 without biochar pseudomonas citronellolis showed a high biodegradation efficiency of 46 9 for high concentrations of phenol 600 mg l with biochar addition zhao et al 2020 other investigators however proposed the adverse effects of biochar on biodegradation of hocs biochar has been reported to have a high affinity for hocs because of its hydrophobic surface and microporous structure liu et al 2019a which would greatly decrease the bioavailability of hocs to microorganisms and lead to high residual levels for example xin et al 2014 observed that the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 was significantly decreased by biochar and suspected that the biodegradation of bde 47 was restricted by its slow desorption from biochar from this point of view understanding the physicochemical interaction between hocs and biochar is crucial for their biodegradation however the effect of adsorption desorption of hocs by biochar on their biodegradation and their mutual relationship is poorly understood to help understand their relationship it is presumed that the initial concentration of hocs and the physicochemical properties of biochar could dramatically influence this process the adsorption of hocs on biochar was driven by multiple mechanisms including pore filling and surface adsorption xin et al 2013 the parts of hocs adsorbed on biochar were easily desorbed while the other parts were strongly bound the easy desorption fractions adsorbed on biochar were conducive to the control of hocs concentration and would not affect their further degradation the adsorption and desorption capacity to hocs was closely related to the physicochemical properties of biochar while biochar properties vary greatly with the feedstock sources and pyrolysis conditions additionally the effects of biochar on the biodegradation of hocs were a complex process except for adsorption desorption to hocs it was reported that biochar could promote extracellular polymer eps production shi et al 2019 which might affect the biodegradation of hocs besides the biodegradation of hocs by microorganisms is usually mediated by their metabolism therefore the change of microbial metabolomics caused by biochar was an indispensable factor for this process this work aimed to investigate the mechanisms of how biochar can affect the biodegradation of bde 47 to systematically explore the underlying mechanisms a series of well designed experiments were conducted such as the relationship between abiotic adsorption desorption and biodegradation kinetics of bde 47 the effect of biochar on cytotoxicity of bde 47 to microorganism and the changes of microbial surface properties biofilm formation and esp secretion and microbial metabolomics in the present of biochar the results of this study are vital to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of biochar combined with bioremediation technology for pbdes remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials bde 47 was purchased from purchased from j k scientific ltd with a purity 98 it has a solubility s w of 94 7 μg l the methanol n hexane and methyl tertiary butyl ether of chromatographic pure were purchased from waters corp usa other chemicals used for bacterial culture were of analytical grade and were purchased from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd china tenax ta was obtained from beijing kanglin science technology co ltd china pseudomonas plecoglossicida p plecoglossicida was originally isolated from an e waste dismantling site in qingyuan guangdong province the feedstock materials used for biochar production were waste eichhornia crassipes and fish scales they were pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace at 400 500 and 600 c for 2 h under oxygen limited conditions these biochars were passed through a 150 mesh sieve and labelled as eb400 eb500 eb600 fb400 fb500 and fb600 according to the first letter of their feedstock and the pyrolysis temperature the physiological characteristics of these biochars have been analyzed by various characterization technologies which were described in section s1 of the supplementary material biochar properties were shown in table s1 and s2 2 2 biodegradation of bde 47 the nutrient medium nm and mineral salt medium msm were used as culture media for bacterial cells and their specific information was shown in section s2 p plecoglossicida was inoculated to nm and cultivated for 12 h in a shaking incubator 160 rpm then the cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min cells were washed three times with sterile msm and then added to a solution containing bde 47 in 50 ml of erlenmeyer flask for biodegradation experiment the inoculation amounts of cells were set at an absorbance of approximately 0 4 the initial concentration of bde 47 was set as 50 100 200 500 1000 and 2000 μg l all treatments were shaken 160 rpm at 30 in the dark and cultivated for 24 48 72 96 120 144 and 168 h then effects of biochar on bde 47 biodegradation were investigated via doping 0 5 w v of various biochars into the degradation system with the different initial concentrations of bde 47 the samples were shaken 160 rpm at 30 for 168 h bde 47 was extracted according to the previous report tang et al 2021 and subsequently quantified the samples by gc ms as described in section s3 additionally the ultrasonic extraction method was used for the samples containing biochar to distinguish the adsorbed bde 47 by biochar from the degraded bde 47 by bacteria the recovery efficiency of bde 47 for samples without biochar was 92 9 103 5 for samples containing biochar the recovery of bde 47 ranged from 89 9 to 101 4 2 3 biochar adsorption desorption experiments to clarify the role of storage and release of bde 47 by biochar in the biodegradation system bde 47 adsorption desorption experiments by biochar without the strain inoculation were conducted the freundlich model and three phase model were used to fit the bde 47 adsorption isotherm and desorption kinetics respectively the detailed information on the experimental methods and models were presented in section s4 2 4 determination of antioxidant responses and cytotoxicity after 24 h and 48 h of incubation the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min and then washed three times with pbs the superoxide dismutase

reactive oxygen species ros cell apoptosis and cell cycle were detected by flow cytometry gallios usa and the methods were based on previous studies tang et al 2018 briefly the 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da was used as an indicator to measure ros generation annexin v fitc and pi staining was used for the quantification of cell apoptosis cells were fixed by 70 ethanol for 12 h at 4 c and then stained with propidium iodide pi for cell cycle determination 2 5 determination of the bacterial surface properties the surface and ultrastructure of planktonic bacteria or bacteria attached on biochar were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem and the procedure of sample preparation was described in section s5 the eps produced by bacteria was extracted using an oscillation ultrasound method combining with the cation exchange resin technique han et al 2021 detailed information on the extraction method of eps can be seen in section s6 the contents of protein and polysaccharide in the eps were determined using the bradford protein assay kit and the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 respectively 2 6 metabolomic analysis 2 6 1 experimental treatment the effect of biochar on the metabolism of p plecoglossicida during bde 47 biodegradation was investigated p plecoglossicida was exposed to 1000 μg l of bde 47 with or without biochar addition for 48 h respectively bacterial cells after exposure were separated at 9000 rpm and washed three times with pbs the washed cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for metabolomic analysis based on gc ms each treatment was performed in six biological replicates 2 6 2 gc ms analysis metabolites in bacterial cells were extracted with methanol and chloroform the derivatized sample extracts were analyzed using an agilent 7890b gas chromatography system coupled to an agilent 5977a system agilent technologies inc ca usa the conditions of chromatographic and mass spectrometry were described in section s7 the metabolites were annotated using the nist database https webbook nist gov chemistry partial least squares discriminate analysis pls da was used to distinguish the overall difference in metabolic profile between groups and was performed on metaboanalyst 4 0 the variable importance projection vip value and p value t test in the pls da model were used as two standards to identify the differentially expressed metabolites vip value 1 and p value 0 05 the differentially expressed metabolites were further mapped to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg to determine their metabolic pathways 2 7 statistical analysis statistical analysis and correlation analysis were performed using spss software version 18 0 the data are presented as the mean standard deviation one way anova with a tukey post hoc was used to determine the statistical significance p 0 05 of each parameter among treatments the data of the cell cycle was analyzed using multicycle software metaboanalyst 4 0 and r studio were used to perform metabolomic analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 biodegradation of bde 47 to lessen the effect of abiotic processes like adsorption by p plecoglossicida the heat killed bacteria were used as the control group to study the removal of bde 47 by the strain in the control there was no significant change in bde 47 concentration during the incubation of 168 h fig s1 so that the removal of bde 47 by the strain was mainly attributed to biodegradation the degradation dynamics of bde 47 with different initial concentrations by p plecoglossicida were showed in fig 1 a the rapid degradation of bde 47 occurred in the initial 72 h followed by a slow increase and lasted for about 120 h to reach degradation equilibrium several degradation products of bde 47 were identified by hplc qtof ms section s3 including hydroxylated pbdes bromophenol phenol and ring opening products table s3 indicating that aerobic biodegradation of bde 47 by p plecoglossicida was mainly through debromination hydroxylation ether bond breaking and ring opening an elevation of biodegradation efficiency was observed at bde 47 concentrations from 50 μg l to 100 μg l at which the biodegradation efficiencies were 58 4 and 63 2 as the initial concentrations increased from 100 μg l to 2000 μg l the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 showed a decreased tendency and the value was only 17 3 at 2000 μg l of bde 47 the temporary augmentation of biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 might be attributed to the rise of bioavailable contents nevertheless the further increasing concentrations of bde 47 were unfavorable for biodegradation which might be related to the inhibition of the activity of relevant degrading enzymes the influence of different initial bde 47 concentrations on cell proliferation of p plecoglossicida was investigated and expressed using od450 value fig 1b the cell numbers in the presence of bde 47 were a little lower than in control without bde 47 addition at 24 h at 48 h the low level of bde 47 slightly promoted cell proliferation while the high concentration of bde 47 still slightly inhibited the proliferation studies have shown that pbdes can act partially as a carbon source to promote microorganism growth robrock et al 2009 ti et al 2020 previous studies have suggested that more exposure to hocs would increase the oxidative stress level and accumulate redundant intracellular ros souza et al 2013 yu et al 2020 oxidative damage provoked by excessive ros might lead to cell viability reduction and further impede the biodegradation of bde 47 the changes of intracellular ros in p plecoglossicida at different initial bde 47 concentrations were investigated as shown in figs 1c and s2 the ros contents elevated with bde 47 concentrations suggesting a gradual increase of intracellular oxidative stress cellular oxidative stress can activate the antioxidant defense system and generate antioxidant enzymes to eliminate excessive ros zhang et al 2016 as depicted in fig 1d there were no significant changes of sod and cat activities at 100 and 200 μg l of bde 47 as compared to control without bde 47 addition these two enzyme activities were enhanced gradually at bde 47 concentrations from 200 μg l to 2000 μg l which implied that enzymes were maintaining the physiological balance through the elimination of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxides therefore the biodegradation reduction might be related to the oxidative damage induced by high concentration bde 47 in p plecoglossicida 3 2 effects of biochar on the biodegradation efficiency the removal of bde 47 in the biochar bacteria system might be attributed not only to the microbial metabolism but also the adsorption by biochar the ultrasonic extraction method eliminated the contribution of bde 47 adsorption by biochar to removal efficiency hence the removal of bde 47 through biodegradation was regarded as the primary mechanism under the tested conditions fig 2 showed the effects of the various biochars on biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 which was closely related to the initial concentration of bde 47 the biodegradation efficiency with higher initial bde 47 concentrations 200 500 and 1000 μg l was promoted by biochars in the presence of biochars the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 was increased by 10 3 23 3 19 2 40 5 and 54 9 83 6 at initial bde 47 concentrations of 200 500 and 1000 μg l respectively based on the results in section 3 1 the biodegradation of bde 47 was largely restricted by its high initial concentration because of the oxidative stress therefore the enhancement of biodegradation of bde 47 by biochars might be attributed to the reduction of initial bde 47 concentration by adsorption of biochars other investigators also proposed that biochar can act as an adsorbent carbon source and shelter of microorganisms to promote biodegradation of hocs liu et al 2021 tao et al 2019 yang et al 2021 the highest strengthening effect was obtained by eb400 and it resulted in final biodegradation efficiency of 66 2 59 7 and 47 8 for initial bde 47 concentrations of 200 500 and 1000 μg l respectively the difference in the effects of various biochars on biodegradation might be ascribed to their physicochemical properties zhao et al 2020 however biochar addition had no significant effect on bde 47 biodegradation and even slightly reduced its biodegradation efficiency when the initial concentration of bde 47 was 50 μg l and 100 μg l the adsorption desorption process might be the main influence factor for the concentration dependent effect 3 3 adsorption desorption of bde 47 by biochar related to biodegradation the adsorption capacity of eb400 eb500 eb600 fb400 fb500 and fb600 for bde 47 was tested in the absence of p plecoglossicida the rapid adsorption occurred in the initial 8 h fig 3 a it was followed by a slow increase in the bde 47 adsorption by biochars and lasted for more than 24 h to reach apparent equilibrium the adsorption capacity varied a great deal 3 58 7 39 mg g for various biochars this result might be attributed to the physicochemical properties of biochars such as specific surface area micropore structure and surface functional groups liu et al 2019a the freundlich model was found to accurately describe the adsorption thermodynamics experiments of the bde 47 fig 3b all the freundlich exponential coefficients n values were less than 1 table s4 which confirmed the heterogeneous adsorption process of bde 47 on the biochars and the co existence of multiple mechanisms chen et al 2008 additionally the adsorption ability varied with the bde 47 concentration which could be exhibited by the adsorption distribution coefficient k d calculated at different ce levels as shown in table s4 the order of log k d was different at three ce levels ce 0 01s w ce 0 1s w ce 1s w for six biochars this result indicated that the predominant adsorption mechanisms might be changed with the concentration variation xin et al 2013 chen et al 2008 demonstrated pore filling was the predominant mechanism for hocs adsorption at low concentration levels while the dominant role of the pore filling mechanism was replaced by surface adsorption as the concentration gradually increased thus the reduction of biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 at the lower initial concentration of bde 47 might be attributed to that the contact between p plecoglossicida and bde 47 adsorbed in micropores of biochar was obstructed besides studies have shown that hocs adsorbed in micropore of biochar was harder to be desorbed as compared to that on the surface of biochar which adverse to their degradation xin et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 therefore desorption process of bde 47 adsorbed on biochar might also be a significant influence factor for biodegradation as depicted in fig 3c and table s5 the desorption kinetics of bde 47 adsorbed on various biochars were well fitted by a triphasic model r2 0 99 the whole desorption process firstly showed a rapid fall phase followed by an interim stage and then a very slow fall phase until equilibrium the order of maximum desorption amounts of bde 47 adsorbed on various biochars was eb400 fb400 eb500 fb500 fb600 eb600 table s5 the relationship between the biodegradation efficiencies of bde 47 in the biochar bacteria system and the rapid slow and very slow desorption fractions f r f s and f v were examined as shown in fig 3d the biodegradation efficiencies had significant and positive correlations p 0 05 with f r and f s this result indicated that the f r and f s could be considered as an indicator to predict the bioavailability of bde 47 in the biochar bacteria system the bde 47 adsorbed on biochar external surfaces or in meso and macro pore might be desorbed firstly with increasing time while the bde 47 adsorbed in micropores or within biochar matrix was harder to be desorbed xin et al 2014 a few previous studies have suggested that desorption capacity of hocs adsorbed on biochar was related to the physicochemical properties of biochar hilber et al 2017 marchal et al 2013 the desorption experiments further showed that the porosity of biochar inhibited the desorption capacity of bde 47 from biochar significant and negative correlations between the desorption amounts of bde 47 f r and f s and the micropore volumes of biochar were observed fig s3 this result further demonstrated that biochar exerted an inhibitory effect on biodegradation at the low concentration of bde 47 owing to the pore filling mechanism our results showed that desorption amounts of bde 47 were also significantly and negatively correlated with the aromatic carbon contents of biochars figs s3 and s4 the π structures of bde 47 molecules were deficient in electron π electron acceptors because of the strong electron withdrawing ability of the br and ether groups in the bde 47 molecules which could interact strongly with the π structures with electron rich π electron donors of the aromatic carbon domains of biochar xin et al 2013 this strong binding force would impede desorption of bde 47 from biochar the effect of biochars on the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 was also related to their aromatic carbon contents and micropore volumes as shown in fig s3 the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 increased with a decrease in these two parameters most of the bde 47 adsorbed in fb400 and eb400 was easily desorbed suggesting a weaker binding force between bde 47 and them which was advantageous to the biodegradation of bde 47 the ftir spectra fig s5 demonstrated that the stronger vibration peaks of some organic functional groups were found in fb400 and eb400 thus the binding of bde 47 was mainly via the partition of these organic functional groups additionally it can be observed that the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 was positively correlated with its maximum desorption amounts fig 3d to further clarify the effect of desorption process on biodegradation of bde 47 in the biochar bacteria system an assisted desorption experiment was conducted by the addition of rhamnolipid a model biosurfactant to facilitate desorption of adsorbed bde 47 firstly the effect of rhamnolipid concentrations within a critical micelle concentration cmc on bde 47 biodegradation by p plecoglossicida was investigated fig s6 the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 increased first and then decreased with increasing rhamnolipid concentration the addition of rhamnolipid with 0 2 cmc increased the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 by 13 8 while there was no obvious effect of 1 cmc of rhamnolipid on bde 47 biodegradation therefore 1 cmc of rhamnolipid was used to assist the desorption of bde 47 in the presence of rhamnolipid the maximum desorption amounts of adsorbed bde 47 in biochar were increased by 7 3 15 6 compared to the desorption amounts without rhamnolipid addition fig 4 a the increase of desorption amounts of bde 47 induced by rhamnolipid resulted in an increase in the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 rhamnolipid enhanced the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 by 10 5 18 2 fig 4b in general the biochar decreased the biodegradation efficiency at lower initial bde 47 concentration which can be attributed to the limitation of desorption in contrast it promoted the biodegradation efficiency of the higher concentration of bde 47 when the initial bde 47 concentration was 500 μg l the desorption amounts of bde 47 were more than its degradation percentage before reaching the degradation equilibrium which indicated that the desorption amounts of bde 47 were enough to satisfy the demand of the strain for reproduction and degradation therefore the degradation percentage of bde 47 was primarily restricted by its degradation efficiency as mentioned in section 3 1 the high concentration of bde 47 could inhibit biodegradation the toxicity of bde 47 to bacterial cells was alleviated owing to the initial adsorption of biochar and the subsequent gradual desorption kept the roles of bde 47 in balance between a toxin and a carbon source in this respect eb400 had more potential for balancing the toxicity and bioavailability of bde 47 to bacteria because of its higher desorption potential 3 4 effects of biochar on bacterial surface properties sem was used to demonstrate the surface morphology of biochars p plecoglossicida and p plecoglossicida attached to biochar the surface of various biochars was observed to be porous and coarse fig s7 such a structure was believed to serve as a shelter or supporter for p plecoglossicida as shown in fig 5 a when biochars were introduced to the biodegradation system biofilms were clearly observed on the surface of biochars there were also morphological differences with close structures forming on some biochars such as fb400 and eb400 and loose structures forming on the others it was suggested that the composition and spatial distribution of biofilms were closely associated with the physicochemical properties of carriers han et al 2021 the formation of biofilms was affected by the interaction between the carrier surfaces and the extracellular polymeric matrix such as hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding interaction hill et al 2019 in fact most of these features differed significantly in various biochars which might make the morphological differences of biofilms the ftir results also confirmed that large amounts of bacterial cells adhere to the surface of biochar figs 5b and s8 compared with eb400 the spectrum of eb400 attached with p plecoglossicida p eb400 exhibited additional peaks the vibrational peak at 1643 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 was assigned to nh bending vibration of amide i and amide ii bands from proteins han et al 2021 eps is a main component of biofilms and it is mainly composed of proteins and polysaccharides bu et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 polysaccharides and proteins were extracted and measured to study the effect of various biochars on the property of eps the concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins were significantly increased with the introduction of various biochars to the biodegradation system especially the addition of fb400 and eb400 fig 5c this is consistent with zhu et al 2021 who observed that biochar could stimulate eps secretion additionally studies have shown that biochar addition can protect microorganisms against hocs toxicity by regulating eps secretion premnath et al 2021 shi et al 2019 therefore except reducing the initial bde 47 concentration by adsorption biochar could promote more eps production to alleviate the stress of bde 47 and enhance biodegradation efficiency in summary the effect of biochar on bde 47 biodegradation by p plecoglossicida was regulated by its physicochemical properties biochar with a well developed pore structure acted as shelter and stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances which might support the strain to struggle with extreme conditions the composition and spatial distribution of biofilms were closely associated with the physicochemical properties of biochar besides the adsorption desorption process of bde 47 by biochar was closely related to the biodegradation efficiency of bde 47 in biochar bacteria system and this process was affected by the physicochemical properties of biochar for example biochar with less aromatic carbon contents and micropore volumes had weaker binding force with bde 47 which was conducive to the desorption of bde 47 from biochar and thus promoted bde 47 biodegradation 3 5 effect of biochar on cytotoxicity of bde 47 to investigate the effect of biochar on the toxicity of bde 47 to p plecoglossicida cytotoxicity assays including cell proliferation ros cell cycle and cell apoptosis were conducted with or without biochar addition as shown in fig 6 c bde 47 slightly inhibited cell proliferation while significant promotion on cell proliferation was observed in the presence of biochar additionally a decrease in ros level was observed in the presence of both bde 47 and biochar compared to bde 47 alone this suggests that biochar could alleviate the bde 47 stress to p plecoglossicida dissolved organic matters released from biochar were reported as growth substrates that can enhance the metabolism of microorganisms and reduce oxidative stress levels zhao et al 2020 fig s9 showed dissolved organic matters extracted from eb400 eb500 and eb600 promoted bde 47 biodegradation the effect of biochar on the genotoxicity of the bde 47 was estimated by cell cycle changes and results were illustrated in fig 6a and d in the control group there were 30 2 66 9 and 2 9 of cells in stage b c and d of the cell cycle respectively the cells in stage d significantly increased to 10 1 after exposure to bde 47 alone suggesting that cells arrested in stage d in which the main biological process was protein synthesis thus the cell cycle might be perturbed by bde 47 through inhibiting protein synthesis this result was consistent with previous studies which reported that bde 32 and bde 47 exposure inhibited protein synthesis saquib et al 2016 tang et al 2018 the proportions of cells in stage d reduced to 1 2 when bde 47 and biochar existed together this demonstrated that biochar addition weakened the genotoxicity of bde 47 when cells are irreversibly damaged by the adverse environment apoptosis is usually triggered to remove the disabled cell as shown in fig 6b and e the proportion of apoptotic cells increased from 12 4 to 19 4 after exposure to bde 47 which further confirmed the cytotoxicity of bde 47 this is in accordance with the results reported by guo et al 2021 who found that the apoptotic rate in bacterial consortium qy2 was significantly increased by bde 47 stress notably the proportion of apoptotic cells decreased to 2 3 in the case of coexisting bde 47 and biochar and biochar significantly increased the number of live cells the trend of the proportion of live cells basically coincided with the changes of cell proliferation consequently these results proved that biochar could alleviate cytotoxicity of bde 47 and promote cell proliferation which was conducive to the biodegradation process 3 6 metabolomic changes during biodegradation environmental stimuli can lead to the change in the contents of small molecules known as metabolites in living cells which is a sensitive index for intracellular responses to external stressors hence the study of bacterial metabolites is conducive to clearly understanding the difference in biological response of p plecoglossicida to bde 47 with or without biochar addition during biodegradation a total of 285 metabolites were identified in two groups of samples mainly including amino acids fatty acids sugars nucleotides pls da analysis was performed on these metabolites to assess the metabolic variance induced by biochar in the biodegradation process of bde 47 as shown in fig 7 a a clear separation was observed in two groups of samples suggesting that biochar addition altered the bacterial metabolite profile among these metabolites 48 metabolites with statistically significant differences were identified by further screened differentially expressed metabolites were normalized and hierarchy clustered and represented in a heatmap fig 7b among which 10 metabolites were downregulated expression and 38 metabolites were upregulated expression fig s10 such dominant upregulation indicated that biochar addition exerted promoting effect on bacterial metabolism the analysis of kegg pathways reflected that these upregulated metabolites were mainly related to glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism citrate cycle tca cycle and aminoacyl trna biosynthesis fig 7c the metabolism of carbohydrate and amino acid are strongly connected via glycolysis and tca cycle the changes in the related products involved in the tca cycle and amino acid metabolism were summarized in a simplified schematic of metabolic network fig 8 the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and the tca cycle are the main ways of material metabolism and energy supply in bacterial cells the upregulation of metabolites involved in these two metabolic pathways including fumaric acid isocitric acid malic acid serine glycine l glutamate and aspartate indicated that biochar enhanced oxidative metabolism and energy supply of bacterial cells this was consistent with the observed result of cell proliferation in treatment with biochar it might be attributed that biochar released dissolved organic matter to provide additional carbon sources for bacteria li et al 2020 reported that biochar can enhance soil bacterial carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism thereby alleviating pah stress amino acid metabolism plays a key role in cell physiological processes including regulating the transport of substances across the cell membranes and participating in the synthesis and activity of key cellular enzymes thereby affecting the degradation of organic pollutants multiple amino acids were up regulated which involved a variety of metabolic pathways including arginine biosynthesis lysine degradation alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis specifically aspartate and glutamate are significant nitrogen donors for the synthesis of various amino acids and bases reitzer 2013 their upregulation indicated that material transformations in p plecoglossicida were enhanced by biochar l glutamine can be used as a substrate participating in the synthesis of various biomolecules such as aminosugars purine and pyrimidine liu et al 2019c a large increase in l glutamine was observed in bc treatment suggesting that biochar might enhance cell replication and activities of p plecoglossicida additionally l glutamine is closely relevant to the utilization of inorganic nitrogen therefore biochar might promote the bio assimilation of inorganic nitrogen the contents of glycine l 2 hydroxyglutaric acid and alpha aminoadipic acid increased in the pathway of lysine degradation signifying the promotion of lysine degradation which could accelerate cell proliferation de mello serrano et al 2012 besides glycine was also related to the formation of biofilm it was reported that glycine was involved in the synthesis of cell wall anchored protein that was responsible for intercellular adhesion within the biofilm yarawsky et al 2017 this result was consistent with the formation of biofilm on biochar amino acids must be activated to obtain additional energy before synthesizing polypeptide chains this activation reaction is catalyzed by aminoacyl trna synthase novoa et al 2010 as mentioned in section 3 5 bde 47 exposure resulted in the obstruction of protein synthesis arresting cells in stage d this might be attributed to the obstruction of aminoacyl trna biosynthesis biochar addition up regulated metabolites involved in aminoacyl trna biosynthesis pathway suggesting that biochar eliminated the inhibition of bde 47 on protein synthesis this result was consistent with our result in cell cycle assay in which cell cycle progression was restored after biochar addition 4 conclusions this study systemically investigated the mechanism of biochar in affecting bde 47 biodegradation by p plecoglossicida the results demonstrated that biochar exhibited significant promotion to the biodegradation of bde 47 especially at concentrations of bde 47 above 100 μg l biochar with less aromatic carbon contents and micropore volumes had weaker binding force with bde 47 which was conducive to the desorption of bde 47 from biochar and thus promoted bde 47 biodegradation the enhancement of bde 47 biodegradation caused by biochar was partly because the initial adsorption of bde 47 by biochar alleviated the cytotoxicity of bde 47 to the bacteria and then gradual desorption regulated its bioavailability another reason is that biochar acted as shelter and stimulated eps secretion protecting the bacteria against extreme conditions moreover the metabolomic analysis indicated that biochar addition exerted promoting effect on the metabolism of p plecoglossicida during bde 47 biodegradation the kegg pathway analysis showed biochar enhanced the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism citrate cycle and serial amino acid metabolism in p plecoglossicida this study more comprehensively revealed the possible mechanisms of enhancing biodegradation by biochar and helped expand the application of biochar in the removal of
