19750,gut microbiota exerts a fundamental role on host physiology and how extrinsic perturbations influence its composition has been increasingly examined however the effect of drinking water on gut microbiota is still poorly understood in this study we explored the response of mouse gut bacterial community fecal and mucosa adhered to the ingestion of different types of drinking water the experimental cohort was divided according to different water sources into four groups of mice that consumed autoclaved tap water control group water collected directly from a drinking water treatment plant tap water and commercial bottled mineral water differences among groups were observed especially related to control group which exhibited the smallest intra group variation and the largest distance from test groups on the last experimental day clinically important taxa such as acinetobacter and staphylococcus increased in feces of mice that drank tap water and in mucosa adhered samples of animals from disinfected and tap water groups furthermore statistical analyses showed that both time elapsed between samplings and water type significantly influenced the variation observed in the samples our results reveal that drinking water potentially affects gut microbiota composition additionally the increase of typical drinking water clinically relevant and antibiotic resistance associated bacteria in gut microbiota is a cause of concern keywords mouse gut microbiota drinking water 16s rrna gene 1 introduction the establishment of mammalian newborn gut microbiota occurs through the contact with maternal and environmental microorganisms after a gradual increase in its complexity which may be influenced by several factors such as breast feeding the intestinal microbiota stabilizes with a composition similar to that of an adult which happens around the third year of life for humans hooper 2004 koenig et al 2011 yatsunenko et al 2012 derrien and van hylckama vlieg 2015 in adults the mammalian gut bacterial community is largely dominated by the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes followed by proteobacteria and actinobacteria although the taxonomic profile varies between different species ley et al 2008 russell et al 2014 shin et al 2015 knight et al 2017 interpersonal variations are also expected however the individual microbial composition remains relatively stable through time which is important for host health koenig et al 2011 coyte et al 2015 it is well established that gut microbiota influences many organism functions from immune response to brain activity cryan et al 2012 furthermore the resident bacterial community helps to prevent colonization by exogenous and potentially pathogenic organisms to which the host is regularly exposed through food and water intake waaij and vries 1971 derrien and van hylckama vlieg 2015 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless recent studies report that transient organisms might be incorporated temporarily to gut microbiota and affect the resident community derrien and van hylckama vlieg 2015 zhang et al 2016 many studies have addressed the question of how intestinal microorganisms are affected by external variables such as diet and antibiotics use muegge et al 2011 francino 2016 however there are factors that might contribute to gut microbiota modulation which have been little explored so far such as the microbial community present in drinking water conventional drinking water treatment plants dwtps usually perform flocculation decantation filtration and disinfection to remove particles and pathogens chao et al 2013 loubet et al 2016 chlorination is the most widespread disinfection strategy that causes cell damage due to chlorine strong oxidant activity dodd 2012 nevertheless even high quality treated drinking water harbors considerably diverse microbiota which is mainly composed of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria including clinically relevant genera such as acinetobacter pseudomonas and mycobacterium pinto et al 2012 vaz moreira and nunes 2014 vaz moreira et al 2017 bottled mineral water is another common drinking water type the same main phyla found in dwtp water proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria have been reported in bottled mineral water although the bacterial community might differ considerably between these two water sources because bottled water does not pass through disinfection and reflects its source characteristics loy et al 2005 frança et al 2015 an important and controversial aspect of chlorination is its association with enhanced bacterial antibiotic resistance xi et al 2009 chao et al 2013 karumathil et al 2014 although there is currently no consensus regarding the co selective effect of chlorination on antibiotic resistance lin et al 2016 some studies have reported that chlorine compounds increase the expression of efflux pumps directly involved in antibiotic resistance xi et al 2009 karumathil et al 2014 furthermore many studies described an upsurge of resistant microbes in distribution networks in spite of residual disinfectants in treated water wingender and flemming 2011 chao et al 2013 shi et al 2013 karumathil et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge only one study so far lee et al 2010 has experimentally addressed the question of drinking water bacteria influence on gut microbiota through a culture dependent method in that study lee et al investigated the colonization of germ free mice by water microorganisms and found a correlation between bacterial diversity in water and gut microbiota nevertheless as most microorganisms cannot be cultivated culture dependent techniques have considerable limitations to accurately determine microbial diversity in order to contribute to the current knowledge on the link between drinking water and intestinal microbiota and also provide in depth data about microbiota in both environments in the present study we investigated the response of mouse gut bacterial profile to four different types of drinking water by using 16s rrna gene deep sequencing the presence of typical drinking water taxa in the intestinal tract might suggest a potential of water bacteria to interact with gut microbiota promoting the spread of mobile genetic elements through horizontal gene transfer a major cause of antibiotic resistance development this may pose a health problem especially for immunocompromised individuals lee et al 2010 vaz moreira and nunes 2014 2 material and methods 2 1 drinking water the following four types of water were evaluated

ética no uso de animais from ufmg protocol number 297 2015 2 3 experimental design and sampling the following four experimental groups five animals per group were established according to the origin of the water supplied atw dw tw and bmw the experiment was divided into three phases summarized in fig 1 first animals received the water assigned to each group for 9 days then in order to assess if the possible changes in bacterial community during the first phase would be permanent all groups received the same water provided to the control group atw for 5 days finally the original water type of each group was restored for 9 days at the beginning of each experimental phase feces of all animals were sampled and maintained at 20 c at the last day of the experiment 23rd day besides feces mucosa adhered microorganisms from jejunum to rectum were collected after mice were anesthetized and euthanized for that the following procedure was performed the intestine was sectioned longitudinally with sterile scissors and its content was detached from the proximal to the distal portion of the gut with surgical tweezers so that the visible material adhered to the superficial layer of the intestine was collected the surface adhered content was transferred to sterile microtubes in its totality as a single sample per animal and then stored at 20 c for water bacterial community analysis 10 l of each type of water were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane millipore usa and stored at 20 c until dna extraction 2 4 dna extraction library construction and sequencing total dna from all samples was extracted with an e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and quantified with qubit fluorometer thermofisher scientific usa purity was assessed with a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermofisher scientific usa and dna was then stored at 20 c to investigate bacterial community structure a 16s rrna gene deep sequencing analysis was performed paired

mothur web site kozich et al 2013 processing included removal of low quality singleton and chimeric sequences according to the uchime algorithm edgar et al 2011 filtered reads were aligned classified against silva v 123 16s rrna gene database reads of non prokaryotes were discarded and grouped into operational taxonomic units otus the average neighbor algorithm was used for de novo otu picking approach with 97 similarity the affiliation of clinically relevant otus at the species level was assessed through a blastn search in pathosystems resource integration center patric 16s rrna gene database and in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi only alignments with 100 of sequence coverage and identity were considered raw reads were submitted to ncbi sequence read archive project accession number prjna394891 2 6 diversity and statistical analysis alpha and beta diversity analyses were conducted with the r packages phyloseq and vegan oksanen et al 2016 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 after rarefying the number of reads observed otus chao1 estimator shannon and inverted simpson indices were calculated with the estimate richness function in phyloseq unweighted unifrac distances lozupone et al 2010 were determined for each type of sample separately water fecal and mucosa adhered and ordinated by principal coordinate analysis pcoa significant differences in alpha diversity measures among groups and phases were tested with generalized linear models by using r platform the residual analysis of the models was conducted with rt4bio package reis et al 2015 in order to verify the best error distribution deseq2 package love et al 2014 was used to test for significant differences in otu abundance between groups venn diagrams were constructed with gplots r package warnes et al 2016 to identify the source of variation observed in samples the permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed in the unweighted unifrac distance matrices of fecal and mucosa adhered samples with adonis function available in the r package vegan oksanen et al 2016 3 results 3 1 general features of 16s rrna gene deep sequencing sequencing on miseq platform generated a total of 11 753 548 raw reads mean of 109 810 141 177 and 33 302 per fecal mucosa adhered and water samples respectively after assembly in contigs processing and filtering 4 234 923 clean reads mean of 40 202 48 835 and 10 518 per fecal mucosa adhered and water samples with 253 bp on average were grouped into 281 403 and 874 otus for water mucosa adhered and fecal samples respectively 3 2 drinking water microbiota microbiota analysis revealed a distinct taxonomic composition between water samples that passed through a conventional dwtp like drinking water treatment with chlorination atw dw and tw and bmw fig 2 in dwtp water samples proteobacteria predominated 83 4 on average followed by firmicutes 11 1 actinobacteria 2 5 and bacteroidetes 1 5 the most representative proteobacteria otus were related to gammaproteobacteria 73 9 of which a single otu otu 10 assigned as acinetobacter corresponded to most of the reads 81 5 67 1 and 71 1 in atw dw and tw samples respectively a blastn search in patric 16s rrna gene database showed highly significant alignments of this otu with a radioresistens id 596318 3 rna 7 which was confirmed by a blastn query in ncbi database ku060113 1 alphaproteobacteria 8 7 mainly of unclassified rhizobiales 6 7 was also representative most of firmicutes reads were assigned as bacilli class 10 3 of which bacillales was the dominating order followed by geobacillus genus 8 1 and 1 4 on average respectively actinobacteria reads were affiliated with many genera at low relative frequency 1 such as arthrobacter streptomyces corynebacterium microbacterium and mycobacterium bacteroidetes phylum was represented mostly by sphingobacterium and sediminibacterium genera with relative frequency also 1 in atw dw and tw samples in bmw sample proteobacteria and firmicutes phyla prevailed 99 8 of all the reads as was also the case in dwtp samples nevertheless at finer taxonomic resolution a markedly different profile was detected fig 2b a single betaproteobacterial otu assigned as comamonadaceae 41 1 was the most representative alphaproteobacteria were also present 18 3 mainly related to rhizobiaceae family 10 7 and bradyrhizobium 3 3 and phenylobacterium 1 5 genera within firmicutes phylum which corresponded to 39 9 of all bmw sample reads bacilli class prevailed with enterococcus bacillales and lactococcus comprising respectively 26 6 10 1 and 2 1 of the total 3 3 fecal and mucosa adhered microbiota taxonomical profile analysis of fecal samples showed that the same four phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes tenericutes and proteobacteria comprised the majority of the reads at all sampling days fig 2a in general firmicutes prevailed 53 on average represented mainly by clostridia 47 3 and bacilli classes 4 5 bacteroidetes 40 7 represented almost exclusively by bacteroidales 40 6 was the second most frequent phylum followed by tenericutes 4 6 and proteobacteria 1 6 within clostridia class ruminococcaceae 22 5 on average and lachnospiraceae 22 1 families predominated reads of ruminococcaceae classified at the genus level were mainly assigned as ruminococcus 4 2 of fecal samples microbiota on average and ruminiclostridium 2 9 a high proportion of unclassified otus within lachnospiraceae family was observed in addition to minor proportions of diverse genera e g lachnoclostridium acetatifactor and roseburia bacilli class included lactobacillus 3 4 and other genera with frequency 1 such as staphylococcus streptococcus and enterococcus mollicutes reads were assigned as mollicutes rf9 order 4 and anaeroplasma genus 0 6 proteobacteria related reads 1 5 were predominantly affiliated with acinetobacter otu 1 corresponding to a single otu in mucosa adhered samples firmicutes phylum 62 3 on average was represented mostly by clostridia 38 7 bacilli 21 4 and erysipelotrichia 2 2 classes bacteroidetes 35 corresponding to unclassified bacteroidales and tenericutes unclassified mollicutes rf9 1 8 were next most abundant phyla clostridia class was represented mainly by lachnospiraceae 27 6 on average from these 24 3 of the reads were assigned as unclassified lachnospiraceae 2 3 as lachnoclostridium genus and the remaining 1 as different otus in low abundance ruminococcaceae family 10 3 was represented mainly by unclassified ruminococcaceae and ruminiclostridium genus comprising 6 4 and 2 9 respectively bacilli related reads belonged to lactobacillus and staphylococcus genera 20 and 1 3 respectively erysipelotrichia class was essentially represented by turicibacter genus 2 according to deseq2 analysis bacterial communities in mucosa adhered and fecal samples collected at the same day were significantly different supplementary fig s1 in general bacilli and coriobacteriia respectively firmicutes and actinobacteria phyla were enriched in the former with one exception in tw group for bacillales whereas the abundance of mollicutes was low clostridia and erysipelotrichia otus had variable distribution 3 4 drinking water and gut microbiota common taxa exploratory venn diagrams were constructed with gplots r package in order to determine otus with relative frequency 0 1 shared by water mucosa adhered and fecal samples on the first and last experimental days see supplementary fig s2 the otus detected in each of these samples are shown in table 1 only a few common otus between water and fecal mucosa adhered samples were observed and most of them were already present in feces collected at day 0 although there were exceptions such as otu 10 for bmw and otu117 for tw samples overall this result indicates that no significant otus were introduced to the intestinal tract by water over the course of this study nevertheless statistical changes in the frequency of some otus were observed as discussed in the next paragraphs 3 5 temporal diversity in fecal and mucosa adhered communities prior to diversity analysis reads of fecal and mucosa adhered samples were rarefied to 7777 and 10 676 reads per sample respectively alpha diversity metrics observed otus chao1 estimator and shannon and inverted simpson diversity indices were calculated and significant differences between groups and phases were assessed by using generalized linear models implemented in r platform for feces samples none of the metrics were significantly affected by water type however phase showed a statistically significant effect p 05 on all of them fig 3 fig 3 shows a progressive increase in alpha diversity throughout the experiment with the last phase iii exhibiting significantly higher values the shift to the control condition in phase ii did not produce a considerable effect compared to phase i considering mucosa adhered samples there were no significant differences in alpha diversity metrics pcoa ordination of unweighted unifrac distances fig 4 showed that although separation of fecal samples according to water type was not pronounced during the first two experimental phases fig 4a and b at the end of the experiment fig 4c communities from different treatments were clearly more distant particularly from those of control group this result indicates that distances among individuals of the same group decreased over time particularly in the group that received water with no viable microorganisms control mucosa adhered samples showed a similar pattern in which a noticeable distance of control samples from those of the experimental groups was observed fig 4d although these samples did not group as markedly as fecal samples it should be noted that these results do not provide conclusive information given the relatively low values of pcoa axis unweighted unifrac pcoa of water samples fig 4e revealed a considerable distance in the diversity of samples from mice exposed to different types of water atw community grouped closer to tw which was expected given the same origin of these waters whereas bmw was the most distant from the other three atw dw and tw 3 6 differences between experimental groups a deseq2 analysis of feces collected throughout the experiment as well as mucosa adhered samples revealed statistical differences in otu abundance of bmw dw and tw groups compared to control figs 5 and 6 considering the changes over time when compared to control most of statistical differences for feces corresponded to samples collected at day 0 on the subsequent days the majority of the enriched otus were related to firmicutes particularly lachnospiraceae and ruminococaceae families and turicibacter genus for all tested groups the decreased otus were associated mainly with firmicutes a similar result was observed for mucosa adhered samples additionally a significant increase in one otu otu 10 classified as acinetobacter proteobacteria was observed in feces from tw group another clinically relevant otu classified as staphylococcus was more abundant in dw and tw mucosa adhered samples compared to control group a permanova was performed in unweighted unifrac distance matrix based on fecal and mucosa adhered samples rarefied separately in order to test for statistical differences associated with water type and sampling day both variables had a significant effect in fecal samples p 001 r2 0 09 and p 001 r2 0 19 for water and day respectively and their interaction was also significant p 001 r2 0 13 for mucosa adhered samples water type also had a statistical significant effect p 001 r2 0 25 4 discussion gut microbiota has been recognized as an important factor for host health and has broad effects on body functions koenig et al 2011 coyte et al 2015 accordingly important questions concerning how extrinsic perturbations can influence gut microbiota have been addressed in recent years prompted by the development of powerful genomics proteomics and metabolomics technologies nevertheless there is still much to be understood for example the possible effects of drinking water on gut community composition and diversity the present work is to the best of our knowledge the first in depth analysis of drinking water influence on intestinal tract microbiota we demonstrate that diversity of bacterial communities in mice that consumed different types of drinking water was significantly affected by water origin actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and principally proteobacteria are the main phyla observed in drinking water from different sources despite the variation of bacterial communities at lower taxonomic levels vaz moreira and nunes 2014 alpha and betaproteobacteria are frequently reported as prevailing proteobacteria classes in drinking water pinto et al 2012 vaz moreira and nunes 2014 gomez alvarez et al 2016 however the dominance of gammaproteobacteria has also been described lin et al 2014 forbes et al 2016 in accordance with these studies high prevalence of proteobacteria was observed in the present work particularly of gamma atw dw and tw samples and betaproteobacteria bmw sample classes importantly gammaproteobacteria class was represented almost exclusively by a single otu otu 10 affiliated to acinetobacter genus to which more than 73 of sequences from atw dw and tw water samples were assigned on average in a study conducted by lin et al 2014 pseudomonadales family which includes acinetobacter genus corresponded to more than 60 of sequences identified in the treated drinking water sample supporting the notion of high proportion of gammaproteobacteria in all three samples that underwent dwtp like treatment in our study the genus acinetobacter is widespread in nature and harbors more than 50 species lin et al 2014 forbes et al 2016 gomez alvarez et al 2016 vaz moreira et al 2017 some of which are multiresistant pathogens wong et al 2017 in ncbi and patric blastn queries otu 10 was classified as a radioresistens although it is not possible to assert the taxonomy at the species level based on a short dna fragment this result is an indication of the possibility of its occurrence in the samples that have gone through disinfection by chlorination this species can be found in many environments from water to human skin atrouni et al 2016 although it has not been described in the gut of mammals so far a radioresistens was previously detected in clinical samples and despite the fact that its pathogenicity is still inconclusive it has been associated with biofilm formation cytoxic activity and carbapenem resistance poirel et al 2008 fulsundar et al 2015 savov et al 2016 it is notable that besides being highly resistant to radiation and desiccation jawad et al 1998 a radioresistens has been identified as the original host of the blaoxa 23 like genes which confer resistance to carbapenem these genes may be disseminated among other species of acinetobacter including a baumannii poirel et al 2008 an important human pathogen that can also be resistant to high concentrations of free chlorine karumathil et al 2014 therefore it is possible that a radioresistens related bacteria have survived and even been enriched during drinking water treatment which could explain its high prevalence in treated drinking water the same processes may also take place in water distribution systems notably the frequency of this otu was significantly higher in tw feces sampled at the last day of the experiment comprising 5 8 of all reads on average fig 5 however more studies are necessary in order to confirm the existence and prevalence of this species in treated water one otu affiliated to staphylococcus otu 20 another ubiquitous and clinically relevant genus was observed in very low relative frequency in water samples 0 05 however it was enriched in tw feces at the end of the experiment and in dw and tw mucosa adhered samples figs 5 and 6 this otu was classified by ncbi and patric database as staphylococcus saprophyticus frequently related to urinary tract and other nosocomial infections widerström et al 2012 this species may also exhibit antibiotic resistance recent studies have reported the presence of the erythromycin ribosome methylase erm genes in s saprophyticus isolates from aquatic environments wendlandt et al 2015 and human skin strauss et al 2017 the higher proportion of otus possibly affiliated with antibiotic resistant lineages in tw gut microbiota might be associated with the passage of water through the distribution networks because sub lethal chlorine concentrations could co select antibiotic resistant bacteria through enhanced expression of efflux pumps xi et al 2009 karumathil et al 2014 furthermore biofilm formation in water pipes can act as a barrier for residual chlorine activity facilitating the spread of resistant bacteria wingender and flemming 2011 chao et al 2013 shi et al 2013 karumathil et al 2014 in contrast bmw taxonomic profile differed considerably from profiles in samples of mice that consumed treated drinking waters figs 2 and 3e bmw dominant otus were classified as comamonadaceae 41 1 betaproteobacteria and enterococcus 26 6 firmicutes natural mineral waters usually contain a specific bacterial community with predominance of proteobacteria mostly of betaproteobacteria loy et al 2005 although other phyla e g firmicutes actinobacteria and bacteroidetes have been observed at a lesser frequency falcone dias et al 2012 nevertheless the high proportion of firmicutes in the bmw sample found in this study 39 9 is difficult to explain it might be a characteristic of the water spring at the time of collection or a result of contamination during bottling process which can change bacterial composition of water frança et al 2015 it is worth mentioning that although enterococcus genus is considered an important indicator of fecal contamination recent studies have shown that enterococci can also be found in non contaminated environments including freshwater ran et al 2013 weigand et al 2014 a ncbi blastn search for the bmw enterococcus related otu otu 96 showed multiple possible alignments of which the top three were associated to e hirae nr 114783 2 and nr 075022 1 and e olivae nr 125610 1 e hirae has been identified in different habitats including animals and plants and it is not a human pathogen as reviewed by byappanahalli et al 2012 e olivae isolated from green olive fermenters gonza et al 2014 was first described in 2014 and there is still little information about this species a study on bacterial diversity in water habitats conducted by vaz moreira and nunes vaz moreira and nunes 2014 revealed that representatives of 35 and 19 taxa present in treated and bottled mineral water respectively have also been observed in the human microbiome in line with these results lee et al 2010 reported a correlation between the type of water consumed and gastrointestinal microbiota of germ free mice in accordance with our present data representatives of the same taxa were observed in both water and gut cf table 1 and supplementary fig s2 although it does not imply that the latter necessarily originated from the former because most of the common taxa were already present in feces collected at day 0 however these observations suggest that water microorganisms might play a role in intestinal microbiota dynamics the mammalian intestinal tract microbiota has been associated with four dominant phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes actinobacteria and proteobacteria although others have been identified in minor proportions e g cyanobacteria and tenericutes tilg and kaser 2011 gu et al 2013 with the exception of cyanobacteria all those taxa were observed in fecal and mucosa adhered samples in the present study the overall taxonomic composition of both types of samples at the phylum level did not vary considerably which is in accordance with previous studies on gut microbiota because large changes in bacterial community are uncommon and frequently related to unhealthy states at lower taxonomic levels however differences in diversity and frequency of some otus have been observed as shown in fig 2 hsiao et al 2013 coyte et al 2015 alpha diversity metrics showed a progressive increase throughout the experiment associated with time which was significant at phase iii for all groups fig 3 this could be a result of natural changes that occur with weaning hooper 2004 koenig et al 2011 derrien and van hylckama vlieg 2015 and aging and it was not possible to conclude that water type had a significant effect on the tested metrics nevertheless beta diversity analysis showed a clear decrease in intra group distances throughout the experiment fig 4 which was also more pronounced at the end of phase iii in accordance with these results permanova indicated that water day and the interaction between these two variables were significant although a major part of the variation in gut microbiota observed was still unexplained nevertheless because biological systems and gut microbiota in particular are subjected to many uncontrolled processes it is frequently difficult to point out a single factor that would be predominantly responsible for observed differences it is worth noting that the physicochemical and nutritional conditions are very different in the intestinal lumen when compared to those found on the intestinal surface and consequently there is also a difference in bacterial communities which was reflected in the taxonomic composition of fecal and mucosa adhered samples in the present study whereas in the intestinal lumen the conditions are extremely anaerobic and the substrates available are essentially of exogenous origin components remaining form the digestion the intestinal mucosa has a certain exposure to oxygen from the underlying blood vessels and the available nutrients are more endogenous mucus host secretions desquamated cells therefore drinking water can have different effects depending on these two microenvironments altogether a significant rise in richness and diversity in bacterial communities was observed although distance between samples of the same group decreased with time this suggests a possible effect of water on gut microbiota which was corroborated by permanova interestingly the decrease in intra group distances was conspicuous in control group in both fecal and mucosa adhered samples which did not have contact with food or water borne microorganisms after the beginning of the experiment this result suggests that transient microbiota compose an important fraction of gut microbiome as pointed out in recent studies derrien and van hylckama vlieg 2015 zhang et al 2016 and that the absence of contact with external living microorganisms might lead to the development of a less varied bacterial community in young mice it is worth noting that comparisons among mucosa adhered and fecal samples revealed specific bacterial community features in each type of sample lactobacillus genus for example was significantly enriched in mucosa adhered compared to fecal samples in all groups supplementary fig s1 lactobacillus is abundant in the proximal intestine where it can form biofilm like structures on the epithelium explaining its prevalence in mucosa adhered samples keersmaecker and vanderleyden 2007 this result highlights the importance of sampling strategy for a reliable assessment of gut microbiota 5 conclusions significant differences in gut bacterial community structure associated with the type of water supplied to the animals were observed especially in control group although only a small proportion of the variation found in samples could be attributed to it beta diversity and differential abundance analysis suggest that drinking water may among other variables influence gut microbiota composition an effect which is still little explored it is also important to note that significant changes over time were observed furthermore the absence of contact of resident bacteria with water and food borne live microorganisms had a pronounced effect on the structure of gut microbiota leading to a more homogeneous community notably a significant increase in acinetobacter and staphylococcus genera commonly associated with antibiotic resistance is a relevant aspect that should be addressed by further studies because the interaction of drinking water and gut microbiota could be a route for dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes altogether our results provide new information on the effect of extrinsic perturbations on gut microbiota

varies between different species ley et al 2008 russell et al 2014 shin et al 2015 knight et al 2017 interpersonal variations are also expected however the individual microbial composition remains relatively stable through time which is important for host health koenig et al 2011 coyte et al 2015 it is well established that gut microbiota influences many organism functions from immune response to brain activity cryan et al 2012 furthermore the resident bacterial community helps to prevent colonization by exogenous and potentially pathogenic organisms to which the host is regularly exposed through food and water intake waaij and vries 1971 derrien and van hylckama vlieg 2015 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless recent studies report that transient organisms might be incorporated temporarily to gut microbiota and affect the resident community derrien and van hylckama vlieg 2015 zhang et al 2016 many studies have addressed the question of how intestinal microorganisms are affected by external variables such as diet and antibiotics use muegge et al 2011 francino 2016 however there are factors that might contribute to gut microbiota modulation which have been little explored so far such as the microbial community present in drinking water conventional drinking water treatment plants dwtps usually perform flocculation decantation filtration and disinfection to remove particles and pathogens chao et al 2013 loubet et al 2016 chlorination is the most widespread disinfection strategy that causes cell damage due to chlorine strong oxidant activity dodd 2012 nevertheless even high quality treated drinking water harbors considerably diverse microbiota which is mainly composed of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria including clinically relevant genera such as acinetobacter pseudomonas and mycobacterium pinto et al 2012 vaz moreira and nunes 2014 vaz moreira et al 2017 bottled mineral water is another common drinking water type the same main phyla found in dwtp water proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria have been reported in bottled mineral water although the bacterial community might differ considerably between these two water sources because bottled water does not pass through disinfection and reflects its source characteristics loy et al 2005 frança et al 2015 an important and controversial aspect of chlorination is its association with enhanced bacterial antibiotic resistance xi et al 2009 chao et al 2013 karumathil et al 2014 although there is currently no consensus regarding the co selective effect of chlorination on antibiotic resistance lin et al 2016 some studies have reported that chlorine compounds increase the expression of efflux pumps directly involved in antibiotic resistance xi et al 2009 karumathil et al 2014 furthermore many studies described an upsurge of resistant microbes in distribution networks in spite of residual disinfectants in treated water wingender and flemming 2011 chao et al 2013 shi et al 2013 karumathil et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge only one study so far lee et al 2010 has experimentally addressed the question of drinking water bacteria influence on gut microbiota through a culture dependent method in that study lee et al investigated the colonization of germ free mice by water microorganisms and found a correlation between bacterial diversity in water and gut microbiota nevertheless as most microorganisms cannot be cultivated culture dependent techniques have considerable limitations to accurately determine microbial diversity in order to contribute to the current knowledge on the link between drinking water and intestinal microbiota and also provide in depth data about microbiota in both environments in the present study we investigated the response of mouse gut bacterial profile to four different types of drinking water by using 16s rrna gene deep sequencing the presence of typical drinking water taxa in the intestinal tract might suggest a potential of water bacteria to interact with gut microbiota promoting the spread of mobile genetic elements through horizontal gene transfer a major cause of antibiotic resistance development this may pose a health problem especially for immunocompromised individuals lee et al 2010 vaz moreira and nunes 2014 2 material and methods 2 1 drinking water the following four types of water were evaluated

ética no uso de animais from ufmg protocol number 297 2015 2 3 experimental design and sampling the following four experimental groups five animals per group were established according to the origin of the water supplied atw dw tw and bmw the experiment was divided into three phases summarized in fig 1 first animals received the water assigned to each group for 9 days then in order to assess if the possible changes in bacterial community during the first phase would be permanent all groups received the same water provided to the control group atw for 5 days finally the original water type of each group was restored for 9 days at the beginning of each experimental phase feces of all animals were sampled and maintained at 20 c at the last day of the experiment 23rd day besides feces mucosa adhered microorganisms from jejunum to rectum were collected after mice were anesthetized and euthanized for that the following procedure was performed the intestine was sectioned longitudinally with sterile scissors and its content was detached from the proximal to the distal portion of the gut with surgical tweezers so that the visible material adhered to the superficial layer of the intestine was collected the surface adhered content was transferred to sterile microtubes in its totality as a single sample per animal and then stored at 20 c for water bacterial community analysis 10 l of each type of water were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane millipore usa and stored at 20 c until dna extraction 2 4 dna extraction library construction and sequencing total dna from all samples was extracted with an e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and quantified with qubit fluorometer thermofisher scientific usa purity was assessed with a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermofisher scientific usa and dna was then stored at 20 c to investigate bacterial community structure a 16s rrna gene deep sequencing analysis was performed paired

platform with a miseq reagent kit v2 500 cycles 2 5 sequence processing bioinformatics analysis was carried out with mothur software version 1 37 5 schloss et al 2009 based on miseq sop available on mothur web site kozich et al 2013 processing included removal of low quality singleton and chimeric sequences according to the uchime algorithm edgar et al 2011 filtered reads were aligned classified against silva v 123 16s rrna gene database reads of non prokaryotes were discarded and grouped into operational taxonomic units otus the average neighbor algorithm was used for de novo otu picking approach with 97 similarity the affiliation of clinically relevant otus at the species level was assessed through a blastn search in pathosystems resource integration center patric 16s rrna gene database and in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi only alignments with 100 of sequence coverage and identity were considered raw reads were submitted to ncbi sequence read archive project accession number prjna394891 2 6 diversity and statistical analysis alpha and beta diversity analyses were conducted with the r packages phyloseq and vegan oksanen et al 2016 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 after rarefying the number of reads observed otus chao1 estimator shannon and inverted simpson indices were calculated with the estimate richness function in phyloseq unweighted unifrac distances lozupone et al 2010 were determined for each type of sample separately water fecal and mucosa adhered and ordinated by principal coordinate analysis pcoa significant differences in alpha diversity measures among groups and phases were tested with generalized linear models by using r platform the residual analysis of the models was conducted with rt4bio package reis et al 2015 in order to verify the best error distribution deseq2 package love et al 2014 was used to test for significant differences in otu abundance between groups venn diagrams were constructed with gplots r package warnes et al 2016 to identify the source of variation observed in samples the permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed in the unweighted unifrac distance matrices of fecal and mucosa adhered samples with adonis function available in the r package vegan oksanen et al 2016 3 results 3 1 general features of 16s rrna gene deep sequencing sequencing on miseq platform generated a total of 11 753 548 raw reads mean of 109 810 141 177 and 33 302 per fecal mucosa adhered and water samples respectively after assembly in contigs processing and filtering 4 234 923 clean reads mean of 40 202 48 835 and 10 518 per fecal mucosa adhered and water samples with 253 bp on average were grouped into 281 403 and 874 otus for water mucosa adhered and fecal samples respectively 3 2 drinking water microbiota microbiota analysis revealed a distinct taxonomic composition between water samples that passed through a conventional dwtp like drinking water treatment with chlorination atw dw and tw and bmw fig 2 in dwtp water samples proteobacteria predominated 83 4 on average followed by firmicutes 11 1 actinobacteria 2 5 and bacteroidetes 1 5 the most representative proteobacteria otus were related to gammaproteobacteria 73 9 of which a single otu otu 10 assigned as acinetobacter corresponded to most of the reads 81 5 67 1 and 71 1 in atw dw and tw samples respectively a blastn search in patric 16s rrna gene database showed highly significant alignments of this otu with a radioresistens id 596318 3 rna 7 which was confirmed by a blastn query in ncbi database ku060113 1 alphaproteobacteria 8 7 mainly of unclassified rhizobiales 6 7 was also representative most of firmicutes reads were assigned as bacilli class 10 3 of which bacillales was the dominating order followed by geobacillus genus 8 1 and 1 4 on average respectively actinobacteria reads were affiliated with many genera at low relative frequency 1 such as arthrobacter streptomyces corynebacterium microbacterium and mycobacterium bacteroidetes phylum was represented mostly by sphingobacterium and sediminibacterium genera with relative frequency also 1 in atw dw and tw samples in bmw sample proteobacteria and firmicutes phyla prevailed 99 8 of all the reads as was also the case in dwtp samples nevertheless at finer taxonomic resolution a markedly different profile was detected fig 2b a single betaproteobacterial otu assigned as comamonadaceae 41 1 was the most representative alphaproteobacteria were also present 18 3 mainly related to rhizobiaceae family 10 7 and bradyrhizobium 3 3 and phenylobacterium 1 5 genera within firmicutes phylum which corresponded to 39 9 of all bmw sample reads bacilli class prevailed with enterococcus bacillales and lactococcus comprising respectively 26 6 10 1 and 2 1 of the total 3 3 fecal and mucosa adhered microbiota taxonomical profile analysis of fecal samples showed that the same four phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes tenericutes and proteobacteria comprised the majority of the reads at all sampling days fig 2a in general firmicutes prevailed 53 on average represented mainly by clostridia 47 3 and bacilli classes 4 5 bacteroidetes 40 7 represented almost exclusively by bacteroidales 40 6 was the second most frequent phylum followed by tenericutes 4 6 and proteobacteria 1 6 within clostridia class ruminococcaceae 22 5 on average and lachnospiraceae 22 1 families predominated reads of ruminococcaceae classified at the genus level were mainly assigned as ruminococcus 4 2 of fecal samples microbiota on average and ruminiclostridium 2 9 a high proportion of unclassified otus within lachnospiraceae family was observed in addition to minor proportions of diverse genera e g lachnoclostridium acetatifactor and roseburia bacilli class included lactobacillus 3 4 and other genera with frequency 1 such as staphylococcus streptococcus and enterococcus mollicutes reads were assigned as mollicutes rf9 order 4 and anaeroplasma genus 0 6 proteobacteria related reads 1 5 were predominantly affiliated with acinetobacter otu 1 corresponding to a single otu in mucosa adhered samples firmicutes phylum 62 3 on average was represented mostly by clostridia 38 7 bacilli 21 4 and erysipelotrichia 2 2 classes bacteroidetes 35 corresponding to unclassified bacteroidales and tenericutes unclassified mollicutes rf9 1 8 were next most abundant phyla clostridia class was represented mainly by lachnospiraceae 27 6 on average from these 24 3 of the reads were assigned as unclassified lachnospiraceae 2 3 as lachnoclostridium genus and the remaining 1 as different otus in low abundance ruminococcaceae family 10 3 was represented mainly by unclassified ruminococcaceae and ruminiclostridium genus comprising 6 4 and 2 9 respectively bacilli related reads belonged to lactobacillus and staphylococcus genera 20 and 1 3 respectively erysipelotrichia class was essentially represented by turicibacter genus 2 according to deseq2 analysis bacterial communities in mucosa adhered and fecal samples collected at the same day were significantly different supplementary fig s1 in general bacilli and coriobacteriia respectively firmicutes and actinobacteria phyla were enriched in the former with one exception in tw group for bacillales whereas the abundance of mollicutes was low clostridia and erysipelotrichia otus had variable distribution 3 4 drinking water and gut microbiota common taxa exploratory venn diagrams were constructed with gplots r package in order to determine otus with relative frequency 0 1 shared by water mucosa adhered and fecal samples on the first and last experimental days see supplementary fig s2 the otus detected in each of these samples are shown in table 1 only a few common otus between water and fecal mucosa adhered samples were observed and most of them were already present in feces collected at day 0 although there were exceptions such as otu 10 for bmw and otu117 for tw samples overall this result indicates that no significant otus were introduced to the intestinal tract by water over the course of this study nevertheless statistical changes in the frequency of some otus were observed as discussed in the next paragraphs 3 5 temporal diversity in fecal and mucosa adhered communities prior to diversity analysis reads of fecal and mucosa adhered samples were rarefied to 7777 and 10 676 reads per sample respectively alpha diversity metrics observed otus chao1 estimator and shannon and inverted simpson diversity indices were calculated and significant differences between groups and phases were assessed by using generalized linear models implemented in r platform for feces samples none of the metrics were significantly affected by water type however phase showed a statistically significant effect p 05 on all of them fig 3 fig 3 shows a progressive increase in alpha diversity throughout the experiment with the last phase iii exhibiting significantly higher values the shift to the control condition in phase ii did not produce a considerable effect compared to phase i considering mucosa adhered samples there were no significant differences in alpha diversity metrics pcoa ordination of unweighted unifrac distances fig 4 showed that although separation of fecal samples according to water type was not pronounced during the first two experimental phases fig 4a and b at the end of the experiment fig 4c communities from different treatments were clearly more distant particularly from those of control group this result indicates that distances among individuals of the same group decreased over time particularly in the group that received water with no viable microorganisms control mucosa adhered samples showed a similar pattern in which a noticeable distance of control samples from those of the experimental groups was observed fig 4d although these samples did not group as markedly as fecal samples it should be noted that these results do not provide conclusive information given the relatively low values of pcoa axis unweighted unifrac pcoa of water samples fig 4e revealed a considerable distance in the diversity of samples from mice exposed to different types of water atw community grouped closer to tw which was expected given the same origin of these waters whereas bmw was the most distant from the other three atw dw and tw 3 6 differences between experimental groups a deseq2 analysis of feces collected throughout the experiment as well as mucosa adhered samples revealed statistical differences in otu abundance of bmw dw and tw groups compared to control figs 5 and 6 considering the changes over time when compared to control most of statistical differences for feces corresponded to samples collected at day 0 on the subsequent days the majority of the enriched otus were related to firmicutes particularly lachnospiraceae and ruminococaceae families and turicibacter genus for all tested groups the decreased otus were associated mainly with firmicutes a similar result was observed for mucosa adhered samples additionally a significant increase in one otu otu 10 classified as acinetobacter proteobacteria was observed in feces from tw group another clinically relevant otu classified as staphylococcus was more abundant in dw and tw mucosa adhered samples compared to control group a permanova was performed in unweighted unifrac distance matrix based on fecal and mucosa adhered samples rarefied separately in order to test for statistical differences associated with water type and sampling day both variables had a significant effect in fecal samples p 001 r2 0 09 and p 001 r2 0 19 for water and day respectively and their interaction was also significant p 001 r2 0 13 for mucosa adhered samples water type also had a statistical significant effect p 001 r2 0 25 4 discussion gut microbiota has been recognized as an important factor for host health and has broad effects on body functions koenig et al 2011 coyte et al 2015 accordingly important questions concerning how extrinsic perturbations can influence gut microbiota have been addressed in recent years prompted by the development of powerful genomics proteomics and metabolomics technologies nevertheless there is still much to be understood for example the possible effects of drinking water on gut community composition and diversity the present work is to the best of our knowledge the first in depth analysis of drinking water influence on intestinal tract microbiota we demonstrate that diversity of bacterial communities in mice that consumed different types of drinking water was significantly affected by water origin actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and principally proteobacteria are the main phyla observed in drinking water from different sources despite the variation of bacterial communities at lower taxonomic levels vaz moreira and nunes 2014 alpha and betaproteobacteria are frequently reported as prevailing proteobacteria classes in drinking water pinto et al 2012 vaz moreira and nunes 2014 gomez alvarez et al 2016 however the dominance of gammaproteobacteria has also been described lin et al 2014 forbes et al 2016 in accordance with these studies high prevalence of proteobacteria was observed in the present work particularly of gamma atw dw and tw samples and betaproteobacteria bmw sample classes importantly gammaproteobacteria class was represented almost exclusively by a single otu otu 10 affiliated to acinetobacter genus to which more than 73 of sequences from atw dw and tw water samples were assigned on average in a study conducted by lin et al 2014 pseudomonadales family which includes acinetobacter genus corresponded to more than 60 of sequences identified in the treated drinking water sample supporting the notion of high proportion of gammaproteobacteria in all three samples that underwent dwtp like treatment in our study the genus acinetobacter is widespread in nature and harbors more than 50 species lin et al 2014 forbes et al 2016 gomez alvarez et al 2016 vaz moreira et al 2017 some of which are multiresistant pathogens wong et al 2017 in ncbi and patric blastn queries otu 10 was classified as a radioresistens although it is not possible to assert the taxonomy at the species level based on a short dna fragment this result is an indication of the possibility of its occurrence in the samples that have gone through disinfection by chlorination this species can be found in many environments from water to human skin atrouni et al 2016 although it has not been described in the gut of mammals so far a radioresistens was previously detected in clinical samples and despite the fact that its pathogenicity is still inconclusive it has been associated with biofilm formation cytoxic activity and carbapenem resistance poirel et al 2008 fulsundar et al 2015 savov et al 2016 it is notable that besides being highly resistant to radiation and desiccation jawad et al 1998 a radioresistens has been identified as the original host of the blaoxa 23 like genes which confer resistance to carbapenem these genes may be disseminated among other species of acinetobacter including a baumannii poirel et al 2008 an important human pathogen that can also be resistant to high concentrations of free chlorine karumathil et al 2014 therefore it is possible that a radioresistens related bacteria have survived and even been enriched during drinking water treatment which could explain its high prevalence in treated drinking water the same processes may also take place in water distribution systems notably the frequency of this otu was significantly higher in tw feces sampled at the last day of the experiment comprising 5 8 of all reads on average fig 5 however more studies are necessary in order to confirm the existence and prevalence of this species in treated water one otu affiliated to staphylococcus otu 20 another ubiquitous and clinically relevant genus was observed in very low relative frequency in water samples 0 05 however it was enriched in tw feces at the end of the experiment and in dw and tw mucosa adhered samples figs 5 and 6 this otu was classified by ncbi and patric database as staphylococcus saprophyticus frequently related to urinary tract and other nosocomial infections widerström et al 2012 this species may also exhibit antibiotic resistance recent studies have reported the presence of the erythromycin ribosome methylase erm genes in s saprophyticus isolates from aquatic environments wendlandt et al 2015 and human skin strauss et al 2017 the higher proportion of otus possibly affiliated with antibiotic resistant lineages in tw gut microbiota might be associated with the passage of water through the distribution networks because sub lethal chlorine concentrations could co select antibiotic resistant bacteria through enhanced expression of efflux pumps xi et al 2009 karumathil et al 2014 furthermore biofilm formation in water pipes can act as a barrier for residual chlorine activity facilitating the spread of resistant bacteria wingender and flemming 2011 chao et al 2013 shi et al 2013 karumathil et al 2014 in contrast bmw taxonomic profile differed considerably from profiles in samples of mice that consumed treated drinking waters figs 2 and 3e bmw dominant otus were classified as comamonadaceae 41 1 betaproteobacteria and enterococcus 26 6 firmicutes natural mineral waters usually contain a specific bacterial community with predominance of proteobacteria mostly of betaproteobacteria loy et al 2005 although other phyla e g firmicutes actinobacteria and bacteroidetes have been observed at a lesser frequency falcone dias et al 2012 nevertheless the high proportion of firmicutes in the bmw sample found in this study 39 9 is difficult to explain it might be a characteristic of the water spring at the time of collection or a result of contamination during bottling process which can change bacterial composition of water frança et al 2015 it is worth mentioning that although enterococcus genus is considered an important indicator of fecal contamination recent studies have shown that enterococci can also be found in non contaminated environments including freshwater ran et al 2013 weigand et al 2014 a ncbi blastn search for the bmw enterococcus related otu otu 96 showed multiple possible alignments of which the top three were associated to e hirae nr 114783 2 and nr 075022 1 and e olivae nr 125610 1 e hirae has been identified in different habitats including animals and plants and it is not a human pathogen as reviewed by byappanahalli et al 2012 e olivae isolated from green olive fermenters gonza et al 2014 was first described in 2014 and there is still little information about this species a study on bacterial diversity in water habitats conducted by vaz moreira and nunes vaz moreira and nunes 2014 revealed that representatives of 35 and 19 taxa present in treated and bottled mineral water respectively have also been observed in the human microbiome in line with these results lee et al 2010 reported a correlation between the type of water consumed and gastrointestinal microbiota of germ free mice in accordance with our present data representatives of the same taxa were observed in both water and gut cf table 1 and supplementary fig s2 although it does not imply that the latter necessarily originated from the former because most of the common taxa were already present in feces collected at day 0 however these observations suggest that water microorganisms might play a role in intestinal microbiota dynamics the mammalian intestinal tract microbiota has been associated with four dominant phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes actinobacteria and proteobacteria although others have been identified in minor proportions e g cyanobacteria and tenericutes tilg and kaser 2011 gu et al 2013 with the exception of cyanobacteria all those taxa were observed in fecal and mucosa adhered samples in the present study the overall taxonomic composition of both types of samples at the phylum level did not vary considerably which is in accordance with previous studies on gut microbiota because large changes in bacterial community are uncommon and frequently related to unhealthy states at lower taxonomic levels however differences in diversity and frequency of some otus have been observed as shown in fig 2 hsiao et al 2013 coyte et al 2015 alpha diversity metrics showed a progressive increase throughout the experiment associated with time which was significant at phase iii for all groups fig 3 this could be a result of natural changes that occur with weaning hooper 2004 koenig et al 2011 derrien and van hylckama vlieg 2015 and aging and it was not possible to conclude that water type had a significant effect on the tested metrics nevertheless beta diversity analysis showed a clear decrease in intra group distances throughout the experiment fig 4 which was also more pronounced at the end of phase iii in accordance with these results permanova indicated that water day and the interaction between these two variables were significant although a major part of the variation in gut microbiota observed was still unexplained nevertheless because biological systems and gut microbiota in particular are subjected to many uncontrolled processes it is frequently difficult to point out a single factor that would be predominantly responsible for observed differences it is worth noting that the physicochemical and nutritional conditions are very different in the intestinal lumen when compared to those found on the intestinal surface and consequently there is also a difference in bacterial communities which was reflected in the taxonomic composition of fecal and mucosa adhered samples in the present study whereas in the intestinal lumen the conditions are extremely anaerobic and the substrates available are essentially of exogenous origin components remaining form the digestion the intestinal mucosa has a certain exposure to oxygen from the underlying blood vessels and the available nutrients are more endogenous mucus host secretions desquamated cells therefore drinking water can have different effects depending on these two microenvironments altogether a significant rise in richness and diversity in bacterial communities was observed although distance between samples of the same group decreased with time this suggests a possible effect of water on gut microbiota which was corroborated by permanova interestingly the decrease in intra group distances was conspicuous in control group in both fecal and mucosa adhered samples which did not have contact with food or water borne microorganisms after the beginning of the experiment this result suggests that transient microbiota compose an important fraction of gut microbiome as pointed out in recent studies derrien and van hylckama vlieg 2015 zhang et al 2016 and that the absence of contact with external living microorganisms might lead to the development of a less varied bacterial community in young mice it is worth noting that comparisons among mucosa adhered and fecal samples revealed specific bacterial community features in each type of sample lactobacillus genus for example was significantly enriched in mucosa adhered compared to fecal samples in all groups supplementary fig s1 lactobacillus is abundant in the proximal intestine where it can form biofilm like structures on the epithelium explaining its prevalence in mucosa adhered samples keersmaecker and vanderleyden 2007 this result highlights the importance of sampling strategy for a reliable assessment of gut microbiota 5 conclusions significant differences in gut bacterial community structure associated with the type of water supplied to the animals were observed especially in control group although only a small proportion of the variation found in samples could be attributed to it beta diversity and differential abundance analysis suggest that drinking water may among other variables influence gut microbiota composition an effect which is still little explored it is also important to note that significant changes over time were observed furthermore the absence of contact of resident bacteria with water and food borne live microorganisms had a pronounced effect on the structure of gut microbiota leading to a more homogeneous community notably a significant increase in acinetobacter and staphylococcus genera commonly associated with antibiotic resistance is a relevant aspect that should be addressed by further studies because the interaction of drinking water and gut microbiota could be a route for dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes altogether our results provide new information on the effect of extrinsic perturbations on gut microbiota

19751,we analyzed a coal tar polluted aquifer of a former gasworks site in thuringia germany for the presence and function of aromatic compound degrading bacteria acdb by 16s rrna illumina sequencing bama clone library sequencing and cultivation attempts the relative abundance of acdb was highest close to the source of contamination up to 44 of total 16s rrna sequences were affiliated to acdb including genera such as azoarcus georgfuchsia rhodoferax sulfuritalea all betaproteobacteria and pelotomaculum firmicutes sequencing of bama a functional gene marker for the anaerobic benzoyl coa pathway allowed further insights into electron accepting processes in the aquifer bama sequences of mainly nitrate reducing betaproteobacteria were abundant in all groundwater samples whereas an additional sulfate reducing and or fermenting microbial community deltaproteobacteria firmicutes was restricted to a highly contaminated sulfate depleted groundwater sampling well by conducting growth experiments with groundwater as inoculum and nitrate as electron acceptor organisms related to azoarcus spp were identified as key players in the degradation of toluene and ethylbenzene an organism highly related to georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 was enriched with p xylene a particularly recalcitrant compound the anaerobic degradation of p xylene requires a metabolic trait that was not described for members of the genus georgfuchsia before in line with this we were able to identify a putative 4 methylbenzoyl coa reductase gene cluster in the respective enrichment culture which is possibly involved in the anaerobic degradation of p xylene graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental pollutions microbial communities bioremediation box pathway functional gene marker benzoyl coa reductase 1 introduction in germany at least 1000 former gasworks sites are known mansfeldt 2003 which are potential sources of pollutants that pose a risk to human health the main contaminations at these sites derive from inappropriately stored coal tar which is a complex mixture of mostly aromatic compounds zander 1995 especially btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes are of concern since these low molecular weight toxic compounds are mobile with the groundwater flow in general the biodegradation of btex can occur under oxic conditions or at reduced rates in the absence of oxygen with alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate sulfate fe iii or co2 for reviews see weelink et al 2010 fuchs et al 2011 contaminated aquifers are usually oxygen depleted and therefore facultative and or obligate anaerobic bacteria are assumed to dominate the aromatic compound degrading communities all of the so far described isolates of aromatic compound degrading anaerobes belong

remediated so far coal tar derived pollutants are still leaking into the groundwater the geology of the test field was analyzed by the jena geos ingenieurbüro gmbh jena germany the gasworks area is characterized by horizontal layers of an anthropogenic backfill at the top 2 3 m thickness followed by alluvial loam 1 m thickness holocene a layer of gravel 2 2 5 m thickness pleistocene and sandstone sediment start 5 6 m below ground rotliegend the loam functions as aquiclude with low water permeability in general the loam hampers the infiltration of rainwater and pollutants from the anthropogenic backfill into deeper layers however it was partially removed below buildings located at the site the layer of gravel represents the main water bearing aquifer the approximate groundwater

pit from which organic pollutants are leaking into the groundwater a profile of the gasworks site and the location of the three groundwater sampling wells is depicted in fig 1 for a detailed description of the geology and the physico chemical parameters see section 2 1 and table s1 median concentrations of selected groundwater parameters are given in the following btex compounds were the major contaminants with highest concentrations close to the coal tar pit in well a 9 8 mg l 1 and decreasing concentrations downstream in well b 1 7 mg l 1 and c 0 16 mg l 1 oxygen concentrations were 0 6 0 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 in well a b and c respectively reflecting the almost anoxic conditions of the aquifer the concentration of ammonium a waste product formed during gas production was highest in the vicinity of the coal tar pit and decreased further downstream a 23 7 mg l 1 b 14 9 mg l 1 c 5 1 mg l 1 probably due to ammonium oxidation the concentration of nitrate was elevated in well a 13 1 mg l 1 compared to b 1 4 mg ml 1 and c 1 0 mg ml 1 the concentration of sulfate was lowest in well a 71 mg l 1 and increased further downstream b 317 mg l 1 c 561 mg l 1 indicating sulfate reducing conditions close to the coal tar pit schirmer et al 2006 dissolved iron which is formed in the absence of oxygen by the reduction of insoluble fe iii to soluble fe ii was detected in well b and c a 0 1 mg l 1 b 0 7 mg l 1 c 1 9 mg l 1 3 2 the microbial community of the aquifer with emphasis on aromatic compound degrading bacteria the microbial community of the aquifer which was analyzed by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing on an illumina miseq platform for a complete list of otus including the taxon affiliation see table s2 for a general summary of illumina output data including the abundance of genera see table s3 was dominated by proteobacteria with relative abundances of 78 well a 83 well b and 70 well c respectively fig 2 a within the proteobacteria the majority of sequences were classified as betaproteobacteria well a 53 well b 35 well c 40 many betaproteobacteria are facultative anaerobes frequently found in waste waters wagner et al 2002 nielsen et al 2009 wang et al 2012 they can degrade a variety of organic compounds and seem to play a major role in the nitrate dependent degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons parales 2010 in well b also epsilonproteobacteria mainly represented by arcobacter spp were highly abundant 36 its role in groundwater is not clear since free living arcobacter spp have a versatile metabolism however they are often associated with sulfur and nitrogen cycling roalkvam et al 2015 their occurrence in contaminated environments was reported before gevertz et al 2000 collado et al 2011 levican et al 2013 other prominent phyla detected in all three groundwater wells included actinobacteria 3 3 8 8 bacteroidetes 3 0 5 4 and firmicutes 2 8 6 7 the illumina dataset was analyzed for the presence of aromatic compound degrading bacteria acdb since the aquifer was oxygen depleted we focused on microorganisms which have the potential to degrade aromatic compounds in the absence of oxygen via coa thioesters using the benzoyl coa pathway designated as oxygen independent acdb short no ox acdb furthermore a literature search was conducted to identify taxa abundant in the aquifer that were previously associated with the degradation of aromatic compounds in oxygen depleted environments but for which the presence of the anaerobic benzoyl coa pathway was not yet described for references and explanations see table s4 the majority of these taxa possess the oxygen dependent box pathway for aromatic compound degradation as deduced from a blast analysis data not shown initially described by rather et al 2010 the box pathway is considered as an adaptation to low oxygen conditions fuchs 2008 in this pathway aromatic compounds are also degraded via coa thioesters as intermediates however an oxygen dependent dearomatization step is involved for review see fuchs et al 2011 these taxa are designated as low oxygen dependent acdb low ox acdb the highest relative abundance of total acdb was detected in well a with 44 fig 2b the amount decreased in well b 31 and c 21 the number of acdb was consistent with the concentration of btex in groundwater which was highest in well a and lowest in well c the most abundant no ox acdb in the aquifer were sulfuritalea well a 10 7 well b 7 8 and well c 5 8 pelotomaculum 4 7 2 1 and 4 1 azoarcus 0 5 5 4 and 1 4 georgfuchsia 0 2 0 2 and 1 4 and geobacter 0 5 0 5 and 0 9 the presence of sulfuritalea spp in all groundwater wells is noticeable so far the only pure culture of this genus is sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans sk43h kojima and fukui 2011 it was isolated from a freshwater lake in japan and is the closest relative of the strictly anaerobic acdb georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 aside from the ability of s hydrogenivorans sk43h to degrade benzoate with nitrate kojima and fukui 2011 its role as acdb was not investigated so far this question will be addressed in future studies whereas the total amount of no ox acdb was roughly similar in all three sampling wells a considerably increased abundance of low ox acdb including acidovorax polaromonas pseudomonas and rhodoferax was observed in well a this was in consistence with an increased oxygen concentration in this well well a 0 6 mg l 1 well b 0 1 mg l 1 well c 0 2 mg l 1 this observation indicates that the increase of total acdb in well a fig 2b is possibly caused by oxygen and not by btex concentrations the availability of nitrate in well a table s1 might also positively affect the low ox acdb community as it was shown for pseudomonas sp svenningsen et al 2016 the most abundant low ox acdb was rhodoferax previously described to degrade benzoate with a variety of electron acceptors including fe iii nitrate and oxygen finneran et al 2003 because of its versatility the role of rhodoferax in aromatic compound degradation is difficult to interpret and needs to be further elucidated other genera that were characteristic for the groundwater but so far not described to degrade aromatic compounds include arcobacter well a 0 8 well b 32 4 and well c 0 5 gallionella 0 2 0 9 and 11 3 and giesbergeria 18 3 0 1 and 0 1 see also table s3 all reported to commonly occur in ground and wastewater rice et al 1999 grabovich et al 2006 hanert 2006 3 3 application of the functional marker gene bama since the taxa predicted to be involved in aromatic compound degradation based on 16s rrna analysis do not necessarily possess the genes for biodegradation bama was applied as functional marker to target the anaerobic benzoyl coa pathway kuntze et al 2008 2011 staats et al 2011 with the bama assay no ox acdb are targeted whereas low ox acdb cannot be detected fig 3 shows a phylogenetic tree of the bama nucleotide sequences recovered from clone libraries prepared with dna from groundwater of well a b and c see also table 1 for comparison bama reference nucleotide sequences of isolated and enriched acdb were included in the cladogram table s5 the obtained sequences were categorized into three clades clade i comprises azoarcus sulfuritalea and georgfuchsia related bama sequences clade ii includes geobacter magnetospirillum and thauera related bama sequences and clade iii contains bama sequences of various members of mainly sulfate reducing fermenting deltaproteobacteria and versatile often syntrophic clostridia firmicutes the majority of groundwater bama sequences 116 of 183 clones 63 belonged to clade i the bama sequences within this clade were highly related to nitrate reducing azoarcus sp ebn1 93 6 identity and sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans sk43h 92 1 identity this finding is in accordance with the 16s rrna analysis which revealed a high abundance of the no ox acdb genera azoarcus and sulfuritalea in groundwater of the aquifer clade ii includes 39 bama sequences a single sequence within this clade was related to magnetospirillum sp pmbn1 94 2 identity the remaining sequences either belonged to a cluster related to fe iii reducing geobacteraceae 86 5 88 5 identity which were also identified by the 16s rrna analysis or showed similarity to phototrophic and nitrate reducing alphaproteobacteria 83 5 86 5 identity the 28 sequences affiliated to clade iii originated with one exception from sulfate depleted groundwater of well a these sequences were similar to sulfate reducing fermenting deltaproteobacteria such as desulfatiglans anilini 80 2 identity and desulfomonile tiedjei 77 1 identity or were affiliated to syntrophic firmicutes related to desulfotomaculum sp bica1 6 78 8 identity low similarities to reference sequences indicate the presence of so far uncharacterized members of deltaproteobacteria and firmicutes the increased occurrence of these obligate anaerobic bacteria in well a was not apparent from analyzing the 16s rrna sequences the only dominant genus which would group into clade iii identified by 16s rrna analysis was pelotomaculum however 16s rrna sequences affiliated to this genus were present in all sampling wells instead of being restricted to well a this example highlights the advantage of combining 16s rrna profiling with bama analysis while 16s rrna sequencing allows a refined taxonomic classification bama is superior in identifying microbial degradation processes in this case a sulfate reducing fermenting acdb community in sulfate depleted groundwater the bama gene was also used by other researchers to target acdb but a deep 16s rrna based community profiling was not performed in these studies e g kuntze et al 2011 staats et al 2011 porter and young 2013 verde et al 2013 sun et al 2014b ruan et al 2016 sampling sites that were analyzed included contaminated soil or sludge deep subsurface oil fields and btex contaminated aquifers each site or sample was characterized by a specific bama community some of the researchers suggested that the electron acceptor available in the habitat or sample had a major influence on the composition of the bama community according to this the iron reducing geobacteraceae were the most abundant acdb in the iron containing aquifer analyzed by staats et al 2011 strictly anaerobic deltaproteobacteria and or firmicutes dominated the microbial communities in production waters of deep subsurface oil fields where the presence of oxygen is unlikely verde et al 2013 ruan et al 2016 the aquifer of the thuringia gasworks site we have analyzed in this study was dominated by bama sequences of presumably nitrate reducing betaproteobacteria indicating the importance of nitrate as electron acceptor for aromatic compound degradation at this site this finding has considerable implications for the design of future bioremediation strategies and suggests the infiltration of nitrate as suitable approach to promote the indigenous microbial community in aromatic compound degradation previously nitrate was successfully applied by other researchers as stimulating agent for in situ bioremediation cunningham et al 2001 eckert and appelo 2002 rivett et al 2008 xu et al 2014 2015 besides the occurrence of nitrate reducing betaproteobacteria in all sampling wells additional bama sequences affiliated to strictly anaerobic deltaproteobacteria and firmicutes were present in the aquifer but mainly restricted to the highly contaminated sulfate depleted well a these strictly anaerobic microorganisms are often involved in sulfate reduction or fermentation the utilization of sulfate as electron acceptor would explain the observed decrease in the sulfate concentration in well a in addition well a was characterized by an increased abundance of low ox acdb which require at least small amounts of oxygen for aromatic compound degradation see fig 2b at a first glance the presence of nitrate reducing strictly anaerobic and low ox acdb in the same well is contradictory to the assumption that contaminant plumes are separated into distinct redox zones lovley 1997 however recent findings indicate that different redox processes can occur in parallel especially close to the source of contamination at the plume fringe where no limitation of the electron donor is expected meckenstock et al 2015 the excess of electron donor in well a would also explain why microorganisms using energetically less favorable electron acceptors such as sulfate or co2 can compete in this well against microorganisms that utilize e g oxygen nitrate or iron in conclusion our results provide further evidence that bama profiling is a valuable method to predict electron accepting processes in environmental samples and a future application is suggested to assist in the design and or monitoring of bioremediation approaches preferentially by the use of next generation sequencing techniques 3 4 groundwater enrichment cultures the involvement of nitrate reducing acdb in the degradation of aromatic compounds at the site was verified by cultivation attempts anoxic groundwater of well a b and c was amended with nitrate as electron acceptor and single btex compounds as electron donor under the conditions applied ethylbenzene toluene p and m xylene were degraded table 2 the consumption rates and the lag phases differed among the btex tested and the groundwater wells used for sampling table 2 toluene and ethylbenzene were degraded fastest in all groundwater samples with consumption rates ranging from 4 to 7 μmol d 1 the degradation started either immediately well b or after 4 7 days of incubation wells a and c for p and m xylene consumption started after prolonged lag phases of 2 and 5 weeks in groundwater obtained from well a and b respectively the average consumption rate was 1 4 μmol d 1 for p xylene and 0 6 μmol d 1 for m xylene higher consumption rates for p xylene than for m xylene are noteworthy since earlier studies implied that p xylene and other p alkylated monoaromatics are particularly recalcitrant in comparison to their meta or ortho substituted homologs rabus et al 1996 1999 wilkes et al 2000 the nitrate btex treated groundwater of well b was used as inoculum to obtain stable enrichment cultures in a defined mineral salt medium amended with nitrate and either toluene ethylbenzene p or m xylene enrichment cultures were obtained with toluene ethylbenzene and p xylene for representative growth curves and microphotographs see fig s1 in the presence of m xylene no stable culture was achieved possibly caused by the accumulation of nitrite or toxic m xylene concentrations the 16s rrna and bama profiling revealed that toluene and ethylbenzene favored the enrichment of azoarcus species analyzed after 14 transfers into fresh medium the relative abundance of azoarcus affiliated 16s rrna sequences increased approximately 16fold from 5 4 in groundwater to about 85 in the enrichment cultures see table s3 in accordance all bama gene fragments recovered from these enrichment cultures showed highest similarity to azoarcus sp ebn1 fig 3 sequences designated as tol ethb enrich highlighted in blue in groundwater of well b which was used for the enrichment azoarcus spp showed a considerably higher abundance than in the other two wells this result in combination with the observation that the genus azoarcus seems to be adapted to the degradation of toluene and ethylbenzene led to the assumption that well b is a hotspot of azoarcus dependent toluene and ethylbenzene degradation this finding also explains the enrichment of azoarcus dominated cultures without lag phases from this well table 2 in contrast the p xylene degrading enrichment culture analyzed after 5 transfers into fresh medium was dominated by georgfuchsia spp with a relative abundance of 60 8 of total 16s rrna sequences see table s3 this corresponds to a 250fold enrichment compared to its abundance in groundwater of well b 0 24 also azoarcus 4 4 sulfuritalea 3 8 geobacter 2 8 and rhodoferax 1 1 were detected however relative abundances were similar to those initially detected in groundwater samples in accordance to 16s rrna based community analysis the majority of bama gene fragments retrieved from the p xylene degrading enrichment culture were closely related to georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 99 1 identity fig 3 sequences designated as p xyl enrich clones 5 to 22 highlighted in blue georgfuchsia related 16s rrna sequences were considerably less abundant in the aquifer than azoarcus related sequences fig 2b for bama georgfuchsia related sequences were even below the detection limit table 1 this suggests that the here enriched georgfuchsia sp is rather rare in the aquifer which also explains the prolonged lag phases observed for georgfuchsia dominated enrichments with p xylene table 2 3 5 identification of a putative 4 methylbenzoyl coa reductase in the p xylene degrading enrichment culture whereas the genus azoarcus is well known for the degradation of toluene and ethylbenzene under denitrifying conditions e g fries et al 1994 rabus and widdel 1995 zhou et al 1995 ball et al 1996 georgfuchsia spp were so far not reported to degrade p xylene the only isolated representative within this genus georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 was described to grow with ethylbenzene and toluene but no growth was observed with p xylene when nitrate was applied as electron acceptor weelink et al 2009 under the conditions we applied p xylene degradation was coupled to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite fig s1 as reported for the type strain in our study nitrate could be replaced by fe iii as electron acceptor data not shown the ability of the enriched georgfuchsia sp to degrade p xylene suggests the presence of a novel type of class i benzoyl coa reductase specific for aromatic ring reduction of the p methylated benzoyl coa intermediate previously found in the alphaproteobacterium magnetospirillum sp pmbn1 lahme et al 2012 to check for the presence of genes putatively encoding this novel type of enzyme degenerated primers targeting the 4 methylbenzoyl coa reductase subunit c mbrc were developed and applied on dna of the p xylene degrading enrichment culture a 700 bp fragment was amplified the translated protein sequence showed 75 identity to the mbrc subunit of magnetospirillum sp pmbn1 genome walking was used to identify the gene region containing mbra mbrb mbrc and mbrd the results are shown in fig 4 all subunits showed highest protein identity 72 80 to the corresponding mbr subunits of magnetospirillum sp pmbn1 the identity to conventional class i benzoyl coa reductase subunits was equal or below 32 these data indicate the presence of a benzoyl coa reductase specific for p alkylated substrates in the p xylene degrading enrichment culture dominated by georgfuchsia sp however it cannot be excluded that other genera present in this culture e g sulfuritalea geobacter are involved in the degradation of p xylene the occurrence of a specific 4 methylbenzoyl coa reductase is rare in so far characterized acdb rabus et al 2016 nevertheless the genetic potential to utilize p alkylated aromatic compounds is established at the thuringia gasworks site which is supported by higher degradation rates observed for p xylene than for m and o xylene table 2 so far a few enrichment cultures have been described to degrade p xylene under different electron accepting conditions häner et al 1995 morasch and meckenstock 2005 nakagawa et al 2008 rotaru et al 2010 among these a highly enriched nitrate reducing culture was described which was dominated by a denitratisoma related phylotype a close relative of georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 rotaru et al 2010 the only isolated p xylene degrading bacterium reported so far uses sulfate as electron acceptor and is related to the genus desulfosarcina deltaproteobacteria higashioka et al 2012 our study provides a new p xylene degrading enrichment culture dominated by georgfuchsia sp ongoing studies aim for the isolation of the microorganism s responsible for the degradation of p xylene this might allow further insights into the pathways involved in the anaerobic degradation of p xylene and other p alkylated monoaromatics a microbial feature which is still to date rarely reported 4 conclusion deep 16s rrna and bama clone library sequencing were combined to characterize the microbial community of a coal tar polluted aquifer with emphasis on aromatic compound degrading bacteria the importance of nitrate as electron acceptor for aromatic compound degradation at the site was confirmed by the enrichment of nitrate reducing toluene ethylbenzene and p xylene degrading microorganisms from groundwater of the gasworks site a close relative of georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 was found to be involved in the degradation of p xylene a compound which is rarely observed to be degraded under anoxic conditions the methods applied here allowed the identification of hotspots for aromatic compound degradation and the prediction of the prevailing electron accepting processes in

19751,we analyzed a coal tar polluted aquifer of a former gasworks site in thuringia germany for the presence and function of aromatic compound degrading bacteria acdb by 16s rrna illumina sequencing bama clone library sequencing and cultivation attempts the relative abundance of acdb was highest close to the source of contamination up to 44 of total 16s rrna sequences were affiliated to acdb including genera such as azoarcus georgfuchsia rhodoferax sulfuritalea all betaproteobacteria and pelotomaculum firmicutes sequencing of bama a functional gene marker for the anaerobic benzoyl coa pathway allowed further insights into electron accepting processes in the aquifer bama sequences of mainly nitrate reducing betaproteobacteria were abundant in all groundwater samples whereas an additional sulfate reducing and or fermenting microbial community deltaproteobacteria firmicutes was restricted to a highly contaminated sulfate depleted groundwater sampling well by conducting growth experiments with groundwater as inoculum and nitrate as electron acceptor organisms related to azoarcus spp were identified as key players in the degradation of toluene and ethylbenzene an organism highly related to georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 was enriched with p xylene a particularly recalcitrant compound the anaerobic degradation of p xylene requires a metabolic trait that was not described for members of the genus georgfuchsia before in line with this we were able to identify a putative 4 methylbenzoyl coa reductase gene cluster in the respective enrichment culture which is possibly involved in the anaerobic degradation of p xylene graphical abstract image 1 keywords environmental pollutions microbial communities bioremediation box pathway functional gene marker benzoyl coa reductase 1 introduction in germany at least 1000 former gasworks sites are known mansfeldt 2003 which are potential sources of pollutants that pose a risk to human health the main contaminations at these sites derive from inappropriately stored coal tar which is a complex mixture of mostly aromatic compounds zander 1995 especially btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes are of concern since these low molecular weight toxic compounds are mobile with the groundwater flow in general the biodegradation of btex can occur under oxic conditions or at reduced rates in the absence of oxygen with alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate sulfate fe iii or co2 for reviews see weelink et al 2010 fuchs et al 2011 contaminated aquifers are usually oxygen depleted and therefore facultative and or obligate anaerobic bacteria are assumed to dominate the aromatic compound degrading communities all of the so far described isolates of aromatic compound degrading anaerobes belong to the proteobacteria or firmicutes for reviews see widdel et al 2010 kleinsteuber et al 2012 boll et al 2014 lueders 2017 within the proteobacteria magnetospirillum spp alphaproteobacteria azoarcus spp and thauera spp both betaproteobacteria degrade aromatic compounds under nitrate reducing conditions evans et al 1991 fries et al 1994 anders et al 1995 rabus and widdel 1995 shinoda et al 2005 the use of fe iii as electron acceptor was mainly reported for geobacter spp deltaproteobacteria lovley and lonergan 1990 coates et al 2001 but also for georgfuchsia spp betaproteobacteria which additionally uses nitrate or mn iv as electron acceptor weelink et al 2009 sulfate is common for desulfobulbaceae and desulfobacteraceae both deltaproteobacteria bak and widdel 1986 meckenstock 1999

al 2012 sun et al 2014b in this study 16s rrna and bama sequencing were applied for the functional description of a microbial community of a coal tar polluted aquifer this approach allowed a rapid and easy identification of potential aromatic compound degrading bacteria as well as the prediction of prevailing electron accepting processes in the aquifer further a cultivation based approach was used to identify microorganisms involved in the nitrate dependent bioremediation of btex this is the first combined application of deep 16s rrna sequencing bama profiling and cultivation attempts to characterize a microbial community of a btex contaminated site 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling site the sampling site was a former gasworks area located in thuringia germany which was not remediated so far coal tar derived pollutants are still leaking into the groundwater the geology of the test field was analyzed by the jena geos ingenieurbüro gmbh jena germany the gasworks area is characterized by horizontal layers of an anthropogenic backfill at the top 2 3 m thickness followed by alluvial loam 1 m thickness holocene a layer of gravel 2 2 5 m thickness pleistocene and sandstone sediment start 5 6 m below ground rotliegend the loam functions as aquiclude with low water permeability in general the loam hampers the infiltration of rainwater and pollutants from the anthropogenic backfill into deeper layers however it was partially removed below buildings located at the site the layer of gravel represents the main water bearing aquifer the approximate groundwater flow rate is 10 cm per day groundwater was sampled from three wells 2 inch in diameter originally designated as p2 98 rp 12 12 and p1 98 and renamed for convenience to a b and c respectively the wells are located downstream from the coal tar pit along a pollution gradient fig 1 the wells have a depth of about six meter below ground with a 1 m screen section 5 6 m below ground 1 mm pore size which covers approximate half of the thickness of the aquifer groundwater samples were collected between 2012 and 2014 by jena geos ingenieurbüro gmbh jena germany before sampling groundwater was pumped for

at the european nucleotide archive http www ebi ac uk ena under the accession number lt934314 3 results and discussion 3 1 the sampling site the gasworks site studied here has an unsecured coal tar pit from which organic pollutants are leaking into the groundwater a profile of the gasworks site and the location of the three groundwater sampling wells is depicted in fig 1 for a detailed description of the geology and the physico chemical parameters see section 2 1 and table s1 median concentrations of selected groundwater parameters are given in the following btex compounds were the major contaminants with highest concentrations close to the coal tar pit in well a 9 8 mg l 1 and decreasing concentrations downstream in well b 1 7 mg l 1 and c 0 16 mg l 1 oxygen concentrations were 0 6 0 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 in well a b and c respectively reflecting the almost anoxic conditions of the aquifer the concentration of ammonium a waste product formed during gas production was highest in the vicinity of the coal tar pit and decreased further downstream a 23 7 mg l 1 b 14 9 mg l 1 c 5 1 mg l 1 probably due to ammonium oxidation the concentration of nitrate was elevated in well a 13 1 mg l 1 compared to b 1 4 mg ml 1 and c 1 0 mg ml 1 the concentration of sulfate was lowest in well a 71 mg l 1 and increased further downstream b 317 mg l 1 c 561 mg l 1 indicating sulfate reducing conditions close to the coal tar pit schirmer et al 2006 dissolved iron which is formed in the absence of oxygen by the reduction of insoluble fe iii to soluble fe ii was detected in well b and c a 0 1 mg l 1 b 0 7 mg l 1 c 1 9 mg l 1 3 2 the microbial community of the aquifer with emphasis on aromatic compound degrading bacteria the microbial community of the aquifer which was analyzed by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing on an illumina miseq platform for a complete list of otus including the taxon affiliation see table s2 for a general summary of illumina output data including the abundance of genera see table s3 was dominated by proteobacteria with relative abundances of 78 well a 83 well b and 70 well c respectively fig 2 a within the proteobacteria the majority of sequences were classified as betaproteobacteria well a 53 well b 35 well c 40 many betaproteobacteria are facultative anaerobes frequently found in waste waters wagner et al 2002 nielsen et al 2009 wang et al 2012 they can degrade a variety of organic compounds and seem to play a major role in the nitrate dependent degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons parales 2010 in well b also epsilonproteobacteria mainly represented by arcobacter spp were highly abundant 36 its role in groundwater is not clear since free living arcobacter spp have a versatile metabolism however they are often associated with sulfur and nitrogen cycling roalkvam et al 2015 their occurrence in contaminated environments was reported before gevertz et al 2000 collado et al 2011 levican et al 2013 other prominent phyla detected in all three groundwater wells included actinobacteria 3 3 8 8 bacteroidetes 3 0 5 4 and firmicutes 2 8 6 7 the illumina dataset was analyzed for the presence of aromatic compound degrading bacteria acdb since the aquifer was oxygen depleted we focused on microorganisms which have the potential to degrade aromatic compounds in the absence of oxygen via coa thioesters using the benzoyl coa pathway designated as oxygen independent acdb short no ox acdb furthermore a literature search was conducted to identify taxa abundant in the aquifer that were previously associated with the degradation of aromatic compounds in oxygen depleted environments but for which the presence of the anaerobic benzoyl coa pathway was not yet described for references and explanations see table s4 the majority of these taxa possess the oxygen dependent box pathway for aromatic compound degradation as deduced from a blast analysis data not shown initially described by rather et al 2010 the box pathway is considered as an adaptation to low oxygen conditions fuchs 2008 in this pathway aromatic compounds are also degraded via coa thioesters as intermediates however an oxygen dependent dearomatization step is involved for review see fuchs et al 2011 these taxa are designated as low oxygen dependent acdb low ox acdb the highest relative abundance of total acdb was detected in well a with 44 fig 2b the amount decreased in well b 31 and c 21 the number of acdb was consistent with the concentration of btex in groundwater which was highest in well a and lowest in well c the most abundant no ox acdb in the aquifer were sulfuritalea well a 10 7 well b 7 8 and well c 5 8 pelotomaculum 4 7 2 1 and 4 1 azoarcus 0 5 5 4 and 1 4 georgfuchsia 0 2 0 2 and 1 4 and geobacter 0 5 0 5 and 0 9 the presence of sulfuritalea spp in all groundwater wells is noticeable so far the only pure culture of this genus is sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans sk43h kojima and fukui 2011 it was isolated from a freshwater lake in japan and is the closest relative of the strictly anaerobic acdb georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 aside from the ability of s hydrogenivorans sk43h to degrade benzoate with nitrate kojima and fukui 2011 its role as acdb was not investigated so far this question will be addressed in future studies whereas the total amount of no ox acdb was roughly similar in all three sampling wells a considerably increased abundance of low ox acdb including acidovorax polaromonas pseudomonas and rhodoferax was observed in well a this was in consistence with an increased oxygen concentration in this well well a 0 6 mg l 1 well b 0 1 mg l 1 well c 0 2 mg l 1 this observation indicates that the increase of total acdb in well a fig 2b is possibly caused by oxygen and not by btex concentrations the availability of nitrate in well a table s1 might also positively affect the low ox acdb community as it was shown for pseudomonas sp svenningsen et al 2016 the most abundant low ox acdb was rhodoferax previously described to degrade benzoate with a variety of electron acceptors including fe iii nitrate and oxygen finneran et al 2003 because of its versatility the role of rhodoferax in aromatic compound degradation is difficult to interpret and needs to be further elucidated other genera that were characteristic for the groundwater but so far not described to degrade aromatic compounds include arcobacter well a 0 8 well b 32 4 and well c 0 5 gallionella 0 2 0 9 and 11 3 and giesbergeria 18 3 0 1 and 0 1 see also table s3 all reported to commonly occur in ground and wastewater rice et al 1999 grabovich et al 2006 hanert 2006 3 3 application of the functional marker gene bama since the taxa predicted to be involved in aromatic compound degradation based on 16s rrna analysis do not necessarily possess the genes for biodegradation bama was applied as functional marker to target the anaerobic benzoyl coa pathway kuntze et al 2008 2011 staats et al 2011 with the bama assay no ox acdb are targeted whereas low ox acdb cannot be detected fig 3 shows a phylogenetic tree of the bama nucleotide sequences recovered from clone libraries prepared with dna from groundwater of well a b and c see also table 1 for comparison bama reference nucleotide sequences of isolated and enriched acdb were included in the cladogram table s5 the obtained sequences were categorized into three clades clade i comprises azoarcus sulfuritalea and georgfuchsia related bama sequences clade ii includes geobacter magnetospirillum and thauera related bama sequences and clade iii contains bama sequences of various members of mainly sulfate reducing fermenting deltaproteobacteria and versatile often syntrophic clostridia firmicutes the majority of groundwater bama sequences 116 of 183 clones 63 belonged to clade i the bama sequences within this clade were highly related to nitrate reducing azoarcus sp ebn1 93 6 identity and sulfuritalea hydrogenivorans sk43h 92 1 identity this finding is in accordance with the 16s rrna analysis which revealed a high abundance of the no ox acdb genera azoarcus and sulfuritalea in groundwater of the aquifer clade ii includes 39 bama sequences a single sequence within this clade was related to magnetospirillum sp pmbn1 94 2 identity the remaining sequences either belonged to a cluster related to fe iii reducing geobacteraceae 86 5 88 5 identity which were also identified by the 16s rrna analysis or showed similarity to phototrophic and nitrate reducing alphaproteobacteria 83 5 86 5 identity the 28 sequences affiliated to clade iii originated with one exception from sulfate depleted groundwater of well a these sequences were similar to sulfate reducing fermenting deltaproteobacteria such as desulfatiglans anilini 80 2 identity and desulfomonile tiedjei 77 1 identity or were affiliated to syntrophic firmicutes related to desulfotomaculum sp bica1 6 78 8 identity low similarities to reference sequences indicate the presence of so far uncharacterized members of deltaproteobacteria and firmicutes the increased occurrence of these obligate anaerobic bacteria in well a was not apparent from analyzing the 16s rrna sequences the only dominant genus which would group into clade iii identified by 16s rrna analysis was pelotomaculum however 16s rrna sequences affiliated to this genus were present in all sampling wells instead of being restricted to well a this example highlights the advantage of combining 16s rrna profiling with bama analysis while 16s rrna sequencing allows a refined taxonomic classification bama is superior in identifying microbial degradation processes in this case a sulfate reducing fermenting acdb community in sulfate depleted groundwater the bama gene was also used by other researchers to target acdb but a deep 16s rrna based community profiling was not performed in these studies e g kuntze et al 2011 staats et al 2011 porter and young 2013 verde et al 2013 sun et al 2014b ruan et al 2016 sampling sites that were analyzed included contaminated soil or sludge deep subsurface oil fields and btex contaminated aquifers each site or sample was characterized by a specific bama community some of the researchers suggested that the electron acceptor available in the habitat or sample had a major influence on the composition of the bama community according to this the iron reducing geobacteraceae were the most abundant acdb in the iron containing aquifer analyzed by staats et al 2011 strictly anaerobic deltaproteobacteria and or firmicutes dominated the microbial communities in production waters of deep subsurface oil fields where the presence of oxygen is unlikely verde et al 2013 ruan et al 2016 the aquifer of the thuringia gasworks site we have analyzed in this study was dominated by bama sequences of presumably nitrate reducing betaproteobacteria indicating the importance of nitrate as electron acceptor for aromatic compound degradation at this site this finding has considerable implications for the design of future bioremediation strategies and suggests the infiltration of nitrate as suitable approach to promote the indigenous microbial community in aromatic compound degradation previously nitrate was successfully applied by other researchers as stimulating agent for in situ bioremediation cunningham et al 2001 eckert and appelo 2002 rivett et al 2008 xu et al 2014 2015 besides the occurrence of nitrate reducing betaproteobacteria in all sampling wells additional bama sequences affiliated to strictly anaerobic deltaproteobacteria and firmicutes were present in the aquifer but mainly restricted to the highly contaminated sulfate depleted well a these strictly anaerobic microorganisms are often involved in sulfate reduction or fermentation the utilization of sulfate as electron acceptor would explain the observed decrease in the sulfate concentration in well a in addition well a was characterized by an increased abundance of low ox acdb which require at least small amounts of oxygen for aromatic compound degradation see fig 2b at a first glance the presence of nitrate reducing strictly anaerobic and low ox acdb in the same well is contradictory to the assumption that contaminant plumes are separated into distinct redox zones lovley 1997 however recent findings indicate that different redox processes can occur in parallel especially close to the source of contamination at the plume fringe where no limitation of the electron donor is expected meckenstock et al 2015 the excess of electron donor in well a would also explain why microorganisms using energetically less favorable electron acceptors such as sulfate or co2 can compete in this well against microorganisms that utilize e g oxygen nitrate or iron in conclusion our results provide further evidence that bama profiling is a valuable method to predict electron accepting processes in environmental samples and a future application is suggested to assist in the design and or monitoring of bioremediation approaches preferentially by the use of next generation sequencing techniques 3 4 groundwater enrichment cultures the involvement of nitrate reducing acdb in the degradation of aromatic compounds at the site was verified by cultivation attempts anoxic groundwater of well a b and c was amended with nitrate as electron acceptor and single btex compounds as electron donor under the conditions applied ethylbenzene toluene p and m xylene were degraded table 2 the consumption rates and the lag phases differed among the btex tested and the groundwater wells used for sampling table 2 toluene and ethylbenzene were degraded fastest in all groundwater samples with consumption rates ranging from 4 to 7 μmol d 1 the degradation started either immediately well b or after 4 7 days of incubation wells a and c for p and m xylene consumption started after prolonged lag phases of 2 and 5 weeks in groundwater obtained from well a and b respectively the average consumption rate was 1 4 μmol d 1 for p xylene and 0 6 μmol d 1 for m xylene higher consumption rates for p xylene than for m xylene are noteworthy since earlier studies implied that p xylene and other p alkylated monoaromatics are particularly recalcitrant in comparison to their meta or ortho substituted homologs rabus et al 1996 1999 wilkes et al 2000 the nitrate btex treated groundwater of well b was used as inoculum to obtain stable enrichment cultures in a defined mineral salt medium amended with nitrate and either toluene ethylbenzene p or m xylene enrichment cultures were obtained with toluene ethylbenzene and p xylene for representative growth curves and microphotographs see fig s1 in the presence of m xylene no stable culture was achieved possibly caused by the accumulation of nitrite or toxic m xylene concentrations the 16s rrna and bama profiling revealed that toluene and ethylbenzene favored the enrichment of azoarcus species analyzed after 14 transfers into fresh medium the relative abundance of azoarcus affiliated 16s rrna sequences increased approximately 16fold from 5 4 in groundwater to about 85 in the enrichment cultures see table s3 in accordance all bama gene fragments recovered from these enrichment cultures showed highest similarity to azoarcus sp ebn1 fig 3 sequences designated as tol ethb enrich highlighted in blue in groundwater of well b which was used for the enrichment azoarcus spp showed a considerably higher abundance than in the other two wells this result in combination with the observation that the genus azoarcus seems to be adapted to the degradation of toluene and ethylbenzene led to the assumption that well b is a hotspot of azoarcus dependent toluene and ethylbenzene degradation this finding also explains the enrichment of azoarcus dominated cultures without lag phases from this well table 2 in contrast the p xylene degrading enrichment culture analyzed after 5 transfers into fresh medium was dominated by georgfuchsia spp with a relative abundance of 60 8 of total 16s rrna sequences see table s3 this corresponds to a 250fold enrichment compared to its abundance in groundwater of well b 0 24 also azoarcus 4 4 sulfuritalea 3 8 geobacter 2 8 and rhodoferax 1 1 were detected however relative abundances were similar to those initially detected in groundwater samples in accordance to 16s rrna based community analysis the majority of bama gene fragments retrieved from the p xylene degrading enrichment culture were closely related to georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 99 1 identity fig 3 sequences designated as p xyl enrich clones 5 to 22 highlighted in blue georgfuchsia related 16s rrna sequences were considerably less abundant in the aquifer than azoarcus related sequences fig 2b for bama georgfuchsia related sequences were even below the detection limit table 1 this suggests that the here enriched georgfuchsia sp is rather rare in the aquifer which also explains the prolonged lag phases observed for georgfuchsia dominated enrichments with p xylene table 2 3 5 identification of a putative 4 methylbenzoyl coa reductase in the p xylene degrading enrichment culture whereas the genus azoarcus is well known for the degradation of toluene and ethylbenzene under denitrifying conditions e g fries et al 1994 rabus and widdel 1995 zhou et al 1995 ball et al 1996 georgfuchsia spp were so far not reported to degrade p xylene the only isolated representative within this genus georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 was described to grow with ethylbenzene and toluene but no growth was observed with p xylene when nitrate was applied as electron acceptor weelink et al 2009 under the conditions we applied p xylene degradation was coupled to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite fig s1 as reported for the type strain in our study nitrate could be replaced by fe iii as electron acceptor data not shown the ability of the enriched georgfuchsia sp to degrade p xylene suggests the presence of a novel type of class i benzoyl coa reductase specific for aromatic ring reduction of the p methylated benzoyl coa intermediate previously found in the alphaproteobacterium magnetospirillum sp pmbn1 lahme et al 2012 to check for the presence of genes putatively encoding this novel type of enzyme degenerated primers targeting the 4 methylbenzoyl coa reductase subunit c mbrc were developed and applied on dna of the p xylene degrading enrichment culture a 700 bp fragment was amplified the translated protein sequence showed 75 identity to the mbrc subunit of magnetospirillum sp pmbn1 genome walking was used to identify the gene region containing mbra mbrb mbrc and mbrd the results are shown in fig 4 all subunits showed highest protein identity 72 80 to the corresponding mbr subunits of magnetospirillum sp pmbn1 the identity to conventional class i benzoyl coa reductase subunits was equal or below 32 these data indicate the presence of a benzoyl coa reductase specific for p alkylated substrates in the p xylene degrading enrichment culture dominated by georgfuchsia sp however it cannot be excluded that other genera present in this culture e g sulfuritalea geobacter are involved in the degradation of p xylene the occurrence of a specific 4 methylbenzoyl coa reductase is rare in so far characterized acdb rabus et al 2016 nevertheless the genetic potential to utilize p alkylated aromatic compounds is established at the thuringia gasworks site which is supported by higher degradation rates observed for p xylene than for m and o xylene table 2 so far a few enrichment cultures have been described to degrade p xylene under different electron accepting conditions häner et al 1995 morasch and meckenstock 2005 nakagawa et al 2008 rotaru et al 2010 among these a highly enriched nitrate reducing culture was described which was dominated by a denitratisoma related phylotype a close relative of georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 rotaru et al 2010 the only isolated p xylene degrading bacterium reported so far uses sulfate as electron acceptor and is related to the genus desulfosarcina deltaproteobacteria higashioka et al 2012 our study provides a new p xylene degrading enrichment culture dominated by georgfuchsia sp ongoing studies aim for the isolation of the microorganism s responsible for the degradation of p xylene this might allow further insights into the pathways involved in the anaerobic degradation of p xylene and other p alkylated monoaromatics a microbial feature which is still to date rarely reported 4 conclusion deep 16s rrna and bama clone library sequencing were combined to characterize the microbial community of a coal tar polluted aquifer with emphasis on aromatic compound degrading bacteria the importance of nitrate as electron acceptor for aromatic compound degradation at the site was confirmed by the enrichment of nitrate reducing toluene ethylbenzene and p xylene degrading microorganisms from groundwater of the gasworks site a close relative of georgfuchsia toluolica g5g6 was found to be involved in the degradation of p xylene a compound which is rarely observed to be degraded under anoxic conditions the methods applied here allowed the identification of hotspots for aromatic compound degradation and the prediction of the prevailing electron accepting processes in

biotechnology and food sciences norwegian university of life sciences ås norway corresponding author post anaerobic digestion pad treatment technologies have been suggested for anaerobic digestion ad to improve process efficiency and assure hygenization of organic waste because ad reduces the amount of organic waste pad can be applied to a much smaller volume of waste compared to pre digestion treatment thereby improving efficiency in this study dewatered digestate cakes from two different ad plants were thermally hydrolyzed and dewatered and the liquid fraction was recirculated to a semi continuous ad reactor the thermal hydrolysis was more efficient in relation to methane yields and extent of dewaterability for the cake from a plant treating waste activated sludge than the cake from a plant treating source separated food waste ssfw temperatures above 165 c yielded the best results post treatment improved volumetric methane yields by 7 and the cod reduction increased from 68 to 74 in a mesophilic 37 c semi continuous system despite lowering the solid retention time from 17 to 14 days compared to a conventional system with pre treatment of feed substrates at 70 c results from thermogravimetric analysis showed an expected increase in maximum ts content of dewatered digestate cake from 34 up to 46 for the ssfw digestate cake and from 17 up to 43 in the sludge digestate cake after the pad thermal hydrolysis process pad thp the increased dewatering alone accounts for a reduction in wet mass of cake leaving the plant of 60 in the case of sludge digestate cake additionaly the increased vs reduction will contribute to further reduce the mass of wet cake graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion post treatment thp steam explosion sewage sludge biogas 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is commonly used in waste management for treatment of organic wastes such as sewage sludge and food waste with the aim of waste stabilization methane generation and production of a digestate that can be used as a fertilizer ad processes typically have long retention times meaning large digesters and thus large plant footprints the waste stabilization efficiency and digestate quality depends on the characteristics of the waste and the ad technology technologies assuring a high hygienic quality of the digestate as well as high waste stabilization rates are key for a successful ad plant and pre treatment technologies such as the thermal hydrolysis process thp has been extensively used to improve process performance barber 2016 carrere et al 2016 neyens and baeyens 2003 thp has increased degradation rates and biogas yields for a wide range of wastes including sewage sludge and lignocellulosic biomasses bauer et al 2014 dereix et al 2006 estevez et al 2012 horn et al 2011b lizasoain et al 2016 vivekanand et al 2013 wilson and novak 2009 the optimum temperature and time combination during thp pretreatment depends on the type of substrate thp treatment has resulted in reduced capillary suction time cst and filtration time of sludge both parameters important for the rate of the dewatering process dereix et al 2006 everett 1972 haug et al 1978 however cst and filtration methods are not necessarily correlated with maximum cake solids kopp and dichtl 2001 technologies that increases the total solids ts in dewatered digestate have a large potential for reducing the storage silo footprint as well as transportation costs for disposal of the digestate cake although improved dewaterability is well documented in sludge after thp everett 1972 haug et al 1978 neyens and baeyens 2003 skinner et al 2015 the mechanism is not well understood and the optimum thp treatment conditions for different wastes are largely unknown thp based technologies result in solubilization of organic material and thus release of readily degradable organic matter to the liquid fraction dereix et al 2006 in norway pre treatment of waste is mainly applied to meet health regulations where the minimum requirement is heating for 1 h at 70 c for sludge and waste of animal origin nærings og fiskeridepartementet 2007 although pre treatment results in a reduction of pathogenic bacteria in the digestate and improved process performance bagge et al 2005 lang and smith 2008 wang et al 1997 large fractions of the waste are readily bio degradable and do not benefit from such treatment post anaerobic digestion treatment pad has recently been suggested as an alternative sambusiti et al 2015 thygesen et al 2014 this means that only a fraction of the original waste needs to be treated while still ensuring a hygienic end product for land application in a typical pad thp setup the digestate would be dewatered treated with thp and then after thp undergo a subsequent dewatering where the liquid fraction is recirculated to the anaerobic digester the patented cambi solidstream kjorlaug et al 2015 kolovos et al 2016 solheim and nilsen 2014 is based on this idea and involves post treatment of digestate cake using thp so far only one full scale plant has installed a pad thp process which is the cambi solidstream amperverband in olching germany no laboratory scale studies have been published on this topic thus many of the mechanisms of the technology are not well documented and understood for example recirculation of the centrate from the post treated digestate can result in a reduction of sludge retention time srt which could reduce the efficiency of the ad process jang et al 2014 possibly counteracting the beneficial effect of post treatment in addition optimal thp conditions found for other substrates will not necessarily apply to biogas digestates and studies of how digestate cakes of different origin respond to thp are lacking a third unknown factor of thp is the effect on digestate dewaterability up to now the effect of thp treatment on different digestate cakes is not described in the literature the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of 1 thermal hydrolysis conditions time and temperature on the solubilization of cod and resulting biogas production from digestate cakes using biochemical methane potential bmp tests and 2 pad thp on digester performance and overall solids reduction using semi continuous anaerobic digesters 2 materials and methods the experimental work was in part performed at the biogas laboratory at the norwegian university of life sciences ås norway and at the environmental engineering laboratory at bucknell university lewisburg pa usa due to differences in the laboratory equipment at the two locations it was not possible to use the same methods for all analyses however we consider the methods used compatible 2 1 experimental design this study is based on two experiments the first experiment was designed to find the optimal thp conditions for two digestate cakes using the biochemical methane potential bmp test the second experiment was designed to investigate how the solid stream approach affects the performance of semi continuous anaerobic digesters operated until steady state conditions were achieved 2 2 materials for thp conditions experiment we obtained centrifuged digestate cake from two different full scale ad plants one cake was from a food waste anaerobic digester operating in the thermophilic range 52 53 c hadeland and ringerike waste company hra ringerike norway and source separated food waste ssfw was its sole substrate hra pretreats the ssfw according to norwegian regulations at 70 c for 1 h the second cake was from an anaerobic digester operating in the mesophilic range 35 c treating sludge and collected at hampton roads sanitation district s hrsd nansemond treatment plant suffolk virginia usa hrsd s plant treats a mix of primary and waste activated sludge was from a bio p process both plants use high solids centrifuges for dewatering 2 3 thp conditions experiment the digestate cakes hra and hrsd were used for testing different post treatment conditions the post treatment of hra digestate cake was performed in norway using a small cambi mini test steam explosion unit with a reactor volume of 1 l cambi group as asker norway while the hrsd digestate cake was post treated in a larger cambi mini test steam explosion unit at bucknell university with a reactor volume of 5 l cambi group as asker norway the characteristics of the two cakes prior to post treatment are presented in table 1 to examine the effect of different thp conditions on bmp and dewatering properties of digestate cakes a set of seven different pre incubation times and temperatures spanning from 134 c to 175 c and from 20 min to 30 min was applied the lowest temperature was not tested with the 20 min treatment because this combination of time and temperature does not fulfill the current regulations for sanitation pre incubation time was measured from the time the desired temperature in the reactor was reached the post treated digestate cakes were separated in a centrifuge at 2000 relative centrifugal force rcf for 30 min and the liquid and solid fractions were used in bmp and dewatering tests the bmp results for the liquid fraction is presented on the basis of cod and the solid fraction on the basis of ts because much of the liquid cod was volatiles that would result in falsely low ts measurements and the solid fraction contained particulates making cod measurements less reliable bmp results of the solid fraction is given on the basis of ts instead of vs to directly relate the methane yield of the cake to predicted cake solids 2 4 semi continuous stirred tank reactors experiment pad thp for the semi continuous stirred tank reactor cstr experiments feed sludge primary sludge and waste activated sludge was was shipped overnight from hrsd weekly and stored at 5 c until use waste used for the digester fed with conventional pre treated waste was pretreated upon arrival by heating in closed containers in a water bath for one hour at 70 c the initial heating of the waste to reach 70 c took approximately 1 h a preprocessed food waste called an engineered bioslurry ebs was supplied by waste management inc the food waste was a homogenized product of different commercial food wastes including pre consumer and post consumer organic waste streams such as waste from restaurants grocery stores expired packaged goods food processors and residential organics the food waste samples were stored in a freezer until use in order to get enough centrate for the pad thp digester it was decided to only use centrate from post treatment of hrsd cake from the full scale digester and not from the laboratory digesters this decision was based on the results from the thp conditions experiment on dewatering properties which revealed that we were not able to dewater the post treated cake to the final cake solids achieved by a full scale centrifuge with a laboratory centrifuge hence much of the centrate would be left in the pellet and not recirculated to the laboratory digester another reason for the decision was that digestate is lost both in the initial dewatering before thp to reach a ts of 16 but even more in the cambi unit because some of the digestate is deposited on the inside walls of the thp reactor the treated digestate cake was separated by centrifugation while still hot at 3000 rcf for 30 min in the laboratory centrifuge and this centrate was used in the pad thp digester fig 1 two 10 l cstrs were used in the experiment one control digester using conventional technology fed with hygenized sludge and food waste 70 c for 1 h and one pad thp digester fed with untreated sludge food waste and centrate from thp treated hrsd cake treated for 30 min at 165 c the feed characteristics are presented in table 2 the ratio of food waste sludge and centrate was 15 100 10 on a wet weight basis and approximately 10 20 1 on the basis of cod table 3 the digesters were fed once a day immediately after digester wasting biogas was transported through a tube in the headspace of the digester to a pf 8000 respirometer from respirometer systems and applications springdale arkansas usa which recorded total gas volume and gas production rates in addition a second tube was connected to a gas bag that collects or supplies gas during the brief periods of wasting and feeding in order to maintain a stable concentration of gases in the headspace and not create a vacuum or pressure in the digester the bag has a valve that is opened only during the feeding and wasting operation a sealed septum port in the top of each reactor allows sampling of the headspace for gas composition both reactors were inoculated with digestate from two lab scale digesters digesting sewage sludge from hrsd at day 0 of the experiment a co digestion scenario with mixing of food waste and sewage sludge for digester feed was chosen in order to test the effect of pad thp on a digester

commercial kits merck in norway and chemetrics in the usa for determination of soluble fraction of cod the samples were prepared by centrifugation rcf of 23 907 for 10 min prior to filtration a 0 2 μm syringe filter was used for thp conditions experiments as this excludes more particulates than the 0 45 μm filter and will give a more correct measure of true solubles for the cstr experiment 0 45 μm

constant flow of nitrogen 20 ml h the drying curve was analyzed to find the amount of free water this amount of water was assumed to correspond to the maximum water mass possible to remove from the digestate by high solids centrifuges and hence a theoretical maximum ts of the sludge cake was estimated the setup was calibrated using monodisperse silica particles of diameters 1 86 μm 4 08 μm 7 75

equations are formulated in the supplemental material statistical analysis were performed with the software r for the thp conditions experiment a 2 way analysis of variance anova was used with the parameters time temperature and cake origin a paired t test was conducted to test if the daily methane production of the two cstrs were significantly different and if the pre treatment of the substrates in the cstr experiment influenced the measured parameters all statistical tests were performed at the significance level of 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 testing of different thp conditions for post treatment digestate cakes from two ad plants were thermally hydrolyzed with different combinations of time and temperature ranging from 20 to 30 min and 134 175 c respectively the aim was to investigate how different post treatment conditions affected the two cakes with regards to solubilization specific methane yield and dewaterability the results from these experiments are presented and discussed in this section 3 1 1 solubilization and methane potential in centrate the amount of soluble cod relative to the total cod can be used as a measure of solubilization during thermal hydrolysis the effect of thp treatment time and temperature on digestate cakes from hra and hrsd are presented in fig 2 a anova showed that thp temperature and cake origin had a significant effect on the solubilization of the digested cake p value 001 and 01 respectively the anova also showed that the response to thp temperature was significantly different for the two cakes p value 01 where soluble cod increased more in hrsd cake compared to hra cake the highest solubilization of the hrsd cake was 187 higher than the lowest for hra cake the highest solubilization was 50 higher than the lowest additionally the highest solubilization of hrsd cake was 113 higher than the highest solubilization of the hra cake for the hrsd cake digested sludge the highest solubilization was achieved for the 30 min treatment at 175 c 32 while the lowest solubilization for the 30 min treatment at 134 c 10 the increase in solubilization is greater between 152 c and 165 c compared to 165 c and 175 c for both the 20 min and the 30 min treatment time for the hra cake digested food waste the increase in solubilization over the temperature range 134 c 175 c is small here the 30 min treatment at 175 c gave the highest solubilization 15 while 30 min at 134 c gave the lowest solubilization 9 several authors have observed that solubilization increased with increasing temperature and time of the thp haug et al 1978 li and noike 1992 wilson and novak 2009 haug et al 1984 found that solubilization of was was highest for 30 min at 175 200 c li and noike 1992 tested was at temperatures up to 175 c for 30 min and found that generally the solubilization increased with increasing temperature wilson and novak 2009 tested was and primary sludge with pretreatment temperatures up to 220 c for 2 h and also found that the solubilization increased with increasing temperature the results presented here agree with the previous findings in published literature on was and primary sludge however the degree of solubilization seems to be feedstock dependent in a pad thp the centrate after post treatment will be recirculated to the ad for additional biogas production therefore in this study the bmp of the centrate produced from the different post treatment conditions was determined anova showed that the thermal treatment resulted in significantly different specific methane yields of the centrate from the two post treated cakes p value 001 the different centrates originating from hrsd cake in all cases yielded more methane compared to the centrates from the hra cake fig 2b temperature of the thp treatment also had a significant impact on methane yields of the centrates p value 01 and the response to the temperature of the thp treatment was significantly different for the two cakes p value 05 increasing temperatures made the centrate from pad thp of hra cake more available for conversion to methane for centrates from pad thp of hrsd cake the response to higher temperature was smaller than for hra cake but the overall conversion to methane was significantly higher for centrates from hrsd cake several authors have observed that methane yields increase with increasing temperature and time up to a certain level as a result of the treatment before the effect levels off or decreases li and noike 1992 stuckey and mccarty 1984 stuckey and mccarty 1984 found the optimum temperature for was to be 175 c li and noike 1992 found that the methane yield of was leveled off at a temperature of around 150 c our results show increase in methane yields for the centrate from both cakes for temperatures up to 175 c and treatment time 30 min the differences in solubilization and specific methane yield between the hrsd and hra cakes can have several explanations first the pretreatment was performed with two different thp pilots and with different water content in the incoming sludge cake 14 2 ts in hrsd cake and 18 5 ts in hra cake data not shown this could have had an effect on the mixing of steam and digestate cake in the mini cambi se test unit giving a lower treatment efficiency for the hra compared to hrsd second it has been shown that the effect of thp depends on waste characteristics bougrier et al 2008 wilson and novak 2009 and the characteristics of the two cakes used in this experiment were different table 1 the hrsd cake coming from an anaerobic digester treating sludge from a bio p plant had a higher ash content compared to the hra cake from the food waste plant and a lower cod vs ratio the hrsd cake also had a lower carbon content and higher nitrogen and sulfur contents plant material and lipids generally have a high c n ratio while protein have lower c n ratios a high cod vs ratio is an indication of a more energy dense material containing for instance more lipids further analysis of acid detergent fiber adf confirmed a larger fiber fraction 74 higher adf in the digestate cake from hra compared to the digestate cake from hrsd the larger fiber fraction in hra digestate cake indicates that this waste contains more plant material compared to the hrsd digestate cake primary sludge and was has previously been reported to be efficiently solubilized at 165 c wilson and novak 2009 and the maximum increase in methane yield have also been found around 30 min treatment time at 165 c haug et al 1978 li and noike 1992 stuckey and mccarty 1984 bougrier et al 2008 found that at temperatures lower than 150 c carbohydrate solubilization was more important than protein solubilization in activated sludge several authors have found that lignocellulosic biomass solubilizes more at treatment temperatures higher than 175 c horn et al 2011a 2011b vivekanand et al 2013 bauer et al 2014 found only small increases in methane yields when treating late harvested straw at temperatures between 160 c and 220 c and treatment times of 15 min while lizasoain et al 2016 tested treatment temperatures between 160 c and 220 c and treatment times of 5 20 min and found that the methane yield of reed was highest for the treatment at 200 c for 15 min while only a small increase in methane yield was observed at 160 c hence a possible explanation of the lower solubilization and lower increase in methane yield of digestate from hra compared to hrsd could be that the hra digestate cake has more resemblance to lignocellulosic wastes i e high fiber content while the hrsd digestate cake may have more resemblance to primary sludge and was i e higher protein content the larger increase in solubilization observed for hrsd cake between temperatures 152 c and 165 c compared to the increase in solubilization of hra cake could also be explained by a lower protein content in the hra cake bougrier et al 2008 3 1 2 dewatering properties the costs associated with the transport and disposal of the digestate cake are significant for many ad plants and with a typical water content of around 80 in the cake improved dewatering would be beneficial we determined the dewatering properties as predicted maximum solids for the digestate cakes after post treatment fig 2c according to the thermogravimetric method described by kopp and dichtl 2001 anova showed that both temperature and cake origin had a significant effect on the maximum cake solids p value 001 and 01 respectively where higher temperature resulted in better dewaterability above a temperature of 152 c the cake solids increased with increasing temperature and treatment time for both digestate cakes maximum predicted ts for the treated cakes were 43 and 46 for the hrsd and hra cakes respectively the dewatering properties of the original untreated cakes were very different the hra cake showed the ability to be dewatered to the predicted ts of 34 0 data not shown while the hrsd cake only achieved the predicted ts of 17 0 data not shown thus the post treatment was clearly most efficient for the hrsd cake the observed difference in efficiency of the thermal hydrolysis could again be explained by the origin of the two digestate cakes in sludge water is bound inside viable cells vesilind 1994 and between microbial cells in flocs higgins and novak 1997 li and yang 2007 the amount of bound water is effected by high concentrations of phosphate disturbing the cation bridging of the sludge flocs as well as the concentration of extracellular polymeric substances eps if the amount of intracellular and floc bound water is less in food waste cakes such as the hra cake the potential for improving the dewaterability of these types of digestate cakes will also be lower the results presented here demonstrate that post treatment could increase the maximum cake solids in digestate cakes and thereby cut the transportation costs of ad plants significantly the predicted increase in maximum cake solids was from 34 up to 46 for the hra digestate cake and from 17 up to 43 for the hrsd digestate cake fig 2c alone the increase in maximum cake solids contributes to the reduction of final wet cake mass after post treatment by 26 of the original untreated cake for the hra digestate cake and 60 of the original untreated cake for the hrsd digestate cake hence the practical implication for plants similar to hrsd of implementation of pad thp technology will be that for every ten trucks that is needed for digestate cake transportation today only four will be needed if thermal hydrolysis post treatment is implemented in addition the relative reduction in wet cake mass will depend on the digestate cake treated a digestate cake that is already dewatered to 30 before pad thp will have less potential for reduced wet cake mass compared to a digestate cake that only dewaters to 15 it will therefore be of paramount importance to take several considerations into account when making decisions on post treatment 3 1 3 residual methane potential in cake the residual methane potential of the cake fraction is of interest when evaluating to what extent the remaining methane potential in the digestate cake has been exploited by pad thp because of the small volume of post treated digestate available and the limitations of the laboratory equipment it was not possible to produce a cake with equal properties as full scale cake the separation in the laboratory centrifuge resulted in a pellet with higher water content compared to the predictions of water content after full scale dewatering presented in section 3 1 2 to overcome this challenge bmp was measured on the pellet and the results were then corrected by subtracting the bmp coming from the centrate which would be removed during dewatering in a full scale plant the bmp based on these calculations are presented in fig 2d anova showed no significant difference in bmp of the two cakes at different thp treatment times or temperatures bmp of the untreated hra digestate cake and the hrsd digestate cake treated for 60 min at 70 c and centrifuged was found to be 75 and 63 ml ch4 g tsadded respectively data not shown the bmp of the treated hra cakes was in all cases lower compared to the untreated cake and ranged from 41 to 53 ml g tsadded the bmp of the treated hrsd cakes was in all cases lower than the cake treated at 70 c for 60 min and ranged from 38 to 59 ml g tsadded the bmp of the centrates was observed to be much higher fig 2b compared to the bmp of the cake presented here and improved separation of the liquid fraction will lower the methane yield from the cake although there still is some methane potential left in the digestate cakes it is not evident that this will be emitted as methane during storage or after land application bmp tests are designed to give the maximum methane yield from a test material and will therefore give a worst case scenario other parameter such as oxygen and moisture access will influence the methane production from the cake during storage and after land application 3 2 cstr experiment based on the batch testing the treatment of digestate cake for 30 min at 165 175 c gave the best results in regard to solubilization specific methane yields of the centrate and dewaterability in a full scale system the centrate after post treatment will be recirculated to a continuous digester hence results from batch experiments do not give the full picture of the impact of solid stream on an ad system in order to evaluate the impact of the recirculation on continuous processes two semi continuous cstrs were run in parallel co digesting food waste and sewage sludge with a low srt and high olr table 2 the control digester received hygenized feed which was a mix of sewage sludge and food waste to meet the health regulations heat treated at 70 c for 60 min while the pad thp digester received unhygenized feed and centrate from the pad thp 30 min at 165 c hrsd cake during the first phase of the experiment the first two srts the pad thp digester was operated without adding centrate in this period the control digester had a higher volumetric methane yield compared to the pad thp digester fig 3 from day 28 the second phase of the experiment centrate was added with the feed to the pad thp digester every day during the second phase both reactors performed well achieving cod reduction of around 70 with low residual vfa concentrations in the effluent and a close to neutral ph table 4 the pad thp digester performed better than the control in regard to volumetric methane yield and cod reduction with an average increase in volumetric methane yield of 7 it also had marginally higher concentration of acetic propionic and total volatile fatty acids as well as higher tan po4 p and s cod in the effluent after the pad thp centrate was added the volumetric yield of the pad thp digester was higher compared to the control digester for all days both the daily volumetric methane yield and specific methane yield was significantly higher in the pad thp digester p value 001 and 01 respectively compared to the control digester the relative moderate increase in volumetric methane yield 7 compared to the observed 25 kjorlaug et al 2015 and 50 kolovos et al 2016 increase in volumetric biogas yield in the full scale plant in germany could be a result of a higher methane yield in the control digester in this study due to the pretreatment of the feed substrates the hygenization of the feed for the control digester resulted in a different feed sludge composition for the two digesters based on the paired t test three of the measured parameters were significantly different for untreated and hygenized sludge s cod p value 001 tan p value 01 and ph p value 05 while none of the parameters were significantly different for untreated and hygenized food waste this difference indicates that the pre treatment solubilized some of the feed sludge and degraded some of the proteins in the sludge table 2 the feed for the pad thp digester included centrate in order to get enough and consistent centrate it was decided to only use centrate from post treatment of hrsd cake and not from the laboratory digesters the cod content of the centrate was to a large degree soluble with a ratio of s cod cod of 92 had a strength of 39 g cod l and the ts was 88 organic table 2 in comparison analyses of samples from the full scale cambi plant in germany showed a centrate strength of 40 g cod l and a vs of 85 90 kjorlaug et al 2015 a high conversion rate of food waste to methane could explain why a smaller difference in methane yields was observed in this study compared to the results from the full scale plant kjorlaug et al 2015 kolovos et al 2016 the full scale plant does not receive food waste and the higher the conversion rate in the control digester the less will the potential of improvement of methane yields be in addition to feed composition the srt of the two digesters were different the srt was set to be 17 days for the control digester resulting in a srt of 14 days for the pad thp digester both srts are low compared to the srts of conventional full scale plants which commonly operates with average srts of 20 25 days in the us we chose a low srt in order to evaluate the suitability of pad thp for digesters that is already operating close to their limit as many sewage plants implement co digestion of sludge and food waste srts are also lowered as long as the digester volume remains unchanged however the low srt in this study could have contributed to the smaller difference between methane yields of the control digester and the pad thp digester compared to what has been observed in the full scale plant in germany kjorlaug et al 2015 kolovos et al 2016 differences in laboratory scale and full scale configuration may also have influenced the results presented in this section in a full scale pad thp system the solids content of the influent can be higher than in a pre hygienization system and because of this the srt can be higher the centrate will be continuously produced from the effluent and will respond to changes in solids reduction and effluent characteristics another difference in full scale digesters is that they receive feed continuously contrary to the laboratory reactors that was fed once per day the effects of feeding frequency on anaerobic digesters is not well documented we think that by using the adaptations described in section 2 4 the results presented in section 3 2 is a conservative estimate of what can be achieved in full scale 3 3 major differences between pre treatment and post treatment researchers have shown that pre pasteurization processes can experience reactivation and regrowth of indicator organisms such as fecal coliforms and e coli chen et al 2011 higgins et al 2007 this is thought to be due to inadequate time temperature treatment associated with pre pasteurization which does not completely inactivate the organisms with pad thp all digestate cake is treated at 165 c for 30 min which effectively inactivates pathogens minimizing the risk of reactivation and regrowth pre thp would also achieve the same effect and minimize the risk of reactivation and regrowth post digestion treatment will improve the overall energy balance the amount of solids that are heat treated is less with pad thp compared to pre ad hygienization or pre thp because of the solids reduction that occurs during digestion for example in comparing pre thp to pad thp the heat treatment is applied at the same solids concentration around 16 but with pad thp the total solids to be treated could be reduced by 50 or more due to biodegradation that occurs in the digester increased solids reduction and conversion to biogas influences the energy balance both directly through methane production and indirectly through lowering the heat loss of the pad thp system with pad thp most of the energy used for sterilization is returned to the digester for heating by returning the centrate another advantage of pad thp compared to pre thp and pre hygenization is the improvement in cake solids during final dewatering which can have a large beneficial impact on economics pre thp has been shown to improve final dewaterability after digestion however digestion reduces the extent of dewaterability compared to the solids immediately after pre thp hasan et al 2017 reported that the cake solids after dewatering of a mixed primary and secondary sludge that had undergone pre thp was around 43 but after subsequent anaerobic digestion the cake solids decreased to around 31 in the pad thp scheme the solids are thermally hydrolyzed and dewatered immediately which improves cake solids in addition the solids are dewatered at higher temperatures immediately following pad thp which further improves cake solids 4 conclusion this study obtained novel insights into the differences in the effect of pad thp on digestate cakes from a food waste plant and a wastewater treatment plant post treatment improved methane yields both in batch and in a semi continuous system and improved the extent of dewaterability of the digestate cakes the effect of the post treatment was influenced by digestate cake characteristics and the treatment was more efficient for the cake from a plant treating sewage sludge compared to the cake from a plant treating source separated food waste improved vs reduction in the anaerobic digester and improved dewatering of the treated digestate cake assured that the final cake product was stable with low residual methane potential our estimates suggests a reduction in final wet cake mass due to improved dewatering from pad thp of 60 of the original wet cake mass for digestate cake from an anaerobic digester treating sewage sludge from a bio p plant our results indicate that thermal hydrolysis of digestate cake is an efficient technology for improving methane production and dewaterability in conventional anaerobic digesters and performs better compared to the conventional pre treatment technology at 70 c practically the technology will improve methane yields and the extent of digestate dewaterability increase the ad plants income through higher methane production and reduce the ad plants transportation and disposal costs through reduction of final wet cake mass acknowledgement this work was financially supported by the norwegian

to improve process efficiency and assure hygenization of organic waste because ad reduces the amount of organic waste pad can be applied to a much smaller volume of waste compared to pre digestion treatment thereby improving efficiency in this study dewatered digestate cakes from two different ad plants were thermally hydrolyzed and dewatered and the liquid fraction was recirculated to a semi continuous ad reactor the thermal hydrolysis was more efficient in relation to methane yields and extent of dewaterability for the cake from a plant treating waste activated sludge than the cake from a plant treating source separated food waste ssfw temperatures above 165 c yielded the best results post treatment improved volumetric methane yields by 7 and the cod reduction increased from 68 to 74 in a mesophilic 37 c semi continuous system despite lowering the solid retention time from 17 to 14 days compared to a conventional system with pre treatment of feed substrates at 70 c results from thermogravimetric analysis showed an expected increase in maximum ts content of dewatered digestate cake from 34 up to 46 for the ssfw digestate cake and from 17 up to 43 in the sludge digestate cake after the pad thermal hydrolysis process pad thp the increased dewatering alone accounts for a reduction in wet mass of cake leaving the plant of 60 in the case of sludge digestate cake additionaly the increased vs reduction will contribute to further reduce the mass of wet cake graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion post treatment thp steam explosion sewage sludge biogas 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is commonly used in waste management for treatment of organic wastes such as sewage sludge and food waste with the aim of waste stabilization methane generation and production of a digestate that can be used as a fertilizer ad processes typically have long retention times meaning large digesters and thus large plant footprints the waste stabilization efficiency and digestate quality depends on the characteristics of the waste and the ad technology technologies assuring a high hygienic quality of the digestate as well as high waste stabilization rates are key for a successful ad plant and pre treatment technologies such as the thermal hydrolysis process thp has been extensively used to improve process performance barber 2016 carrere et al 2016 neyens and baeyens 2003 thp has increased degradation rates and biogas yields for a wide range of wastes including sewage sludge and lignocellulosic biomasses bauer et al 2014 dereix et al 2006 estevez et al 2012 horn et al 2011b lizasoain et al 2016 vivekanand et al 2013 wilson and novak 2009 the optimum temperature and time combination during thp pretreatment depends on the type of substrate thp treatment has resulted in reduced capillary suction time cst and filtration time of sludge both parameters important for the rate of the dewatering process dereix et al 2006 everett 1972 haug et al 1978 however cst and filtration methods are not necessarily correlated with maximum cake solids kopp and dichtl 2001 technologies that increases the total solids ts in dewatered digestate have a large potential for reducing the storage silo footprint as well as transportation costs for disposal of the digestate cake although improved dewaterability is well documented in sludge after thp everett 1972 haug et al 1978 neyens and baeyens 2003 skinner et al 2015 the mechanism is not well understood and the optimum thp treatment conditions for different wastes are largely unknown thp based technologies result in solubilization of organic material and thus release of readily degradable organic matter to the liquid fraction dereix et al 2006 in norway pre treatment of waste is mainly applied to meet health regulations where the minimum requirement is heating for 1 h at 70 c for sludge and waste of animal origin nærings og fiskeridepartementet 2007 although pre treatment results in a reduction of pathogenic bacteria in the digestate and improved process performance bagge et al 2005 lang and smith 2008 wang et al 1997 large fractions of the waste are readily bio degradable and do not benefit from such treatment post anaerobic digestion treatment pad has recently been suggested as an alternative sambusiti et al 2015 thygesen et al 2014 this means that only a fraction of the original waste needs to be treated while still ensuring a hygienic end product for land application in a typical pad thp setup the digestate would be dewatered treated with thp and then after thp undergo a subsequent dewatering where the liquid fraction is recirculated to the anaerobic digester the patented cambi solidstream kjorlaug et al 2015 kolovos et al 2016 solheim and nilsen 2014 is based on this idea and involves post treatment of digestate cake using thp so far only one full scale plant has installed a pad thp process which is the cambi solidstream amperverband in olching germany no laboratory scale studies have been published on this topic thus many of the mechanisms of the technology are not well documented and understood for example recirculation of the centrate from the post treated digestate can result in a reduction of sludge retention time srt which could reduce the efficiency of the ad process jang et al 2014 possibly counteracting the beneficial effect of post treatment in addition optimal thp conditions found for other substrates will not necessarily apply to biogas digestates and studies of how digestate cakes of different origin respond to thp are lacking a third unknown factor of thp is the effect on digestate dewaterability up to now the effect of thp treatment on different digestate cakes is not described in the literature the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of 1 thermal hydrolysis conditions time and temperature on the solubilization of cod and resulting biogas production from digestate cakes using biochemical methane potential bmp tests and 2 pad thp on digester performance and overall solids reduction using semi continuous anaerobic digesters 2 materials and methods the experimental work was in part performed at the biogas laboratory at the norwegian university of life sciences ås norway and at the environmental engineering laboratory at bucknell university lewisburg pa usa due to differences in the laboratory equipment at the two locations it was not possible to use the same methods for all analyses however we consider the methods used compatible 2 1 experimental design this study is based on two experiments the first experiment was designed to find the optimal thp conditions for two digestate cakes using the biochemical methane potential bmp test the second experiment was designed to investigate how the solid stream approach affects the performance of semi continuous anaerobic digesters operated until steady state conditions were achieved 2 2 materials for thp conditions experiment we obtained centrifuged digestate cake from two different full scale ad plants one cake was from a food waste anaerobic digester operating in the thermophilic range 52 53 c hadeland and ringerike waste company hra ringerike norway and source separated food waste ssfw was its sole substrate hra pretreats the ssfw according to norwegian regulations at 70 c for 1 h the second cake was from an anaerobic digester operating in the mesophilic range 35 c treating sludge and collected at hampton roads sanitation district s hrsd nansemond treatment plant suffolk virginia usa hrsd s plant treats a mix of primary and waste activated sludge was from a bio p process both plants use high solids centrifuges for dewatering 2 3 thp conditions experiment the digestate cakes hra and hrsd were used for testing different post treatment conditions the post treatment of hra digestate cake was performed in norway using a small cambi mini test steam explosion unit with a reactor volume of 1 l cambi group as asker norway while the hrsd digestate cake was post treated in a larger cambi mini test steam explosion unit at bucknell university with a reactor volume of 5 l cambi group as asker norway the characteristics of the two cakes prior to post treatment are presented in table 1 to examine the effect of different thp conditions on bmp and dewatering properties of digestate cakes a set of seven different pre incubation times and temperatures spanning from 134 c to 175 c and from 20 min to 30 min was applied the lowest temperature was not tested with the 20 min treatment because this combination of time and temperature does not fulfill the current regulations for sanitation pre incubation time was measured from the time the desired temperature in the reactor was reached the post treated digestate cakes were separated in a centrifuge at 2000 relative centrifugal force rcf for 30 min and the liquid and solid fractions were used in bmp and dewatering tests the bmp results for the liquid fraction is presented on the basis of cod and the solid fraction on the basis of ts because much of the liquid cod was volatiles that would result in falsely low ts measurements and the solid fraction contained particulates making cod measurements less reliable bmp results of the solid fraction is given on the basis of ts instead of vs to directly relate the methane yield of the cake to predicted cake solids 2 4 semi continuous stirred tank reactors experiment pad thp for the semi continuous stirred tank reactor cstr experiments feed sludge primary sludge and waste activated sludge was was shipped overnight from hrsd weekly and stored at 5 c until use waste used for the digester fed with conventional pre treated waste was pretreated upon arrival by heating in closed containers in a water bath for one hour at 70 c the initial heating of the waste to reach 70 c took approximately 1 h a preprocessed food waste called an engineered bioslurry ebs was supplied by waste management inc the food waste was a homogenized product of different commercial food wastes including pre consumer and post consumer organic waste streams such as waste from restaurants grocery stores expired packaged goods food processors and residential organics the food waste samples were stored in a freezer until use in order to get enough centrate for the pad thp digester it was decided to only use centrate from post treatment of hrsd cake from the full scale digester and not from the laboratory digesters this decision was based on the results from the thp conditions experiment on dewatering properties which revealed that we were not able to dewater the post treated cake to the final cake solids achieved by a full scale centrifuge with a laboratory centrifuge hence much of the centrate would be left in the pellet and not recirculated to the laboratory digester another reason for the decision was that digestate is lost both in the initial dewatering before thp to reach a ts of 16 but even more in the cambi unit because some of the digestate is deposited on the inside walls of the thp reactor the treated digestate cake was separated by centrifugation while still hot at 3000 rcf for 30 min in the laboratory centrifuge and this centrate was used in the pad thp digester fig 1 two 10 l cstrs were used in the experiment one control digester using conventional technology fed with hygenized sludge and food waste 70 c for 1 h and one pad thp digester fed with untreated sludge food waste and centrate from thp treated hrsd cake treated for 30 min at 165 c the feed characteristics are presented in table 2 the ratio of food waste sludge and centrate was 15 100 10 on a wet weight basis and approximately 10 20 1 on the basis of cod table 3 the digesters were fed once a day immediately after digester wasting biogas was transported through a tube in the headspace of the digester to a pf 8000 respirometer from respirometer systems and applications springdale arkansas usa which recorded total gas volume and gas production rates in addition a second tube was connected to a gas bag that collects or supplies gas during the brief periods of wasting and feeding in order to maintain a stable concentration of gases in the headspace and not create a vacuum or pressure in the digester the bag has a valve that is opened only during the feeding and wasting operation a sealed septum port in the top of each reactor allows sampling of the headspace for gas composition both reactors were inoculated with digestate from two lab scale digesters digesting sewage sludge from hrsd at day 0 of the experiment a co digestion scenario with mixing of food waste and sewage sludge for digester feed was chosen in order to test the effect of pad thp on a digester already operating under high organic loading rates and low srt concentrated food waste have 2 3 times the cod concentration of sewage sludge table 2 and can be used to improve volumetric biogas yields of sewage sludge digesters organic loading rate olr and sludge retention time srt is presented in table 3 the srt is lowered as a consequence of the recirculation stream a low srt 17 and 14 d compared to conventional plants was used in the experiment in order to be able to observe a possible reduced efficiency due to the lowering of srt 2 5 analyses total solids ts and volatile solids vs were determined gravimetrically by drying at 105 c and subsequent burning at 550 c volatile fatty acids vfas in the cstr effluent were measured using an agilent 5890 agilent technologies santa clara

centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min and then supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter next 0 5 ml of sample was placed in a gas chromatography vial and diluted with 0 5 ml of deionized water then 50 μl of methanesulfonic acid was added to the vial and the vial was capped samples were autoinjected into the gas chromatograph at a volume of 1 μl the injector temperature was 238 c and the oven was first held at 105 c for 4 00 min followed by a 5 c min ramp to 145 c followed by a 10 c min ramp to 190 c and a hold of 5 50 min the detector temperature was 200 c cod was determined using commercial kits merck in norway and chemetrics in the usa for determination of soluble fraction of cod the samples were prepared by centrifugation rcf of 23 907 for 10 min prior to filtration a 0 2 μm syringe filter was used for thp conditions experiments as this excludes more particulates than the 0 45 μm filter and will give a more correct measure of true solubles for the cstr experiment 0 45 μm filters were used as this filter pore size is more common when evaluating effluent quality from anaerobic digesters chns analysis was performed on a vario el cube elemental analyzer elementar

manometer gmh 3161 greisinger electronic regenstauf germany and an agilent 3000a gc agilent technologies santa clara california usa for 30 days all bmp tests were performed in triplicate including blanks with only inoculum and positive controls containing cellulose substrate to inoculum ratio was 1 3 on the basis of vs prediction of cake solids were measured with a thermogravimetric method using the conditions described by kopp and dichtl 2001 in brief a netzsch simultaneous tg dta dsc apparatus sta 449 f1 jupiter netzsch geräutebau gmbh selb germany was used with drying at 35 c and a constant flow of nitrogen 20 ml h the drying curve was analyzed to find the amount of free water this amount of water was assumed to correspond to the maximum water mass possible to remove from the digestate by high solids centrifuges and hence a theoretical maximum ts of the sludge cake was estimated the setup was calibrated using monodisperse silica particles of diameters 1 86 μm 4 08 μm 7 75

equations are formulated in the supplemental material statistical analysis were performed with the software r for the thp conditions experiment a 2 way analysis of variance anova was used with the parameters time temperature and cake origin a paired t test was conducted to test if the daily methane production of the two cstrs were significantly different and if the pre treatment of the substrates in the cstr experiment influenced the measured parameters all statistical tests were performed at the significance level of 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 testing of different thp conditions for post treatment digestate cakes from two ad plants were thermally hydrolyzed with different combinations of time and temperature ranging from 20 to 30 min and 134 175 c respectively the aim was to investigate how different post treatment conditions affected the two cakes with regards to solubilization specific methane yield and dewaterability the results from these experiments are presented and discussed in this section 3 1 1 solubilization and methane potential in centrate the amount of soluble cod relative to the total cod can be used as a measure of solubilization during thermal hydrolysis the effect of thp treatment time and temperature on digestate cakes from hra and hrsd are presented in fig 2 a anova showed that thp temperature and cake origin had a significant effect on the solubilization of the digested cake p value 001 and 01 respectively the anova also showed that the response to thp temperature was significantly different for the two cakes p value 01 where soluble cod increased more in hrsd cake compared to hra cake the highest solubilization of the hrsd cake was 187 higher than the lowest for hra cake the highest solubilization was 50 higher than the lowest additionally the highest solubilization of hrsd cake was 113 higher than the highest solubilization of the hra cake for the hrsd cake digested sludge the highest solubilization was achieved for the 30 min treatment at 175 c 32 while the lowest solubilization for the 30 min treatment at 134 c 10 the increase in solubilization is greater between 152 c and 165 c compared to 165 c and 175 c for both the 20 min and the 30 min treatment time for the hra cake digested food waste the increase in solubilization over the temperature range 134 c 175 c is small here the 30 min treatment at 175 c gave the highest solubilization 15 while 30 min at 134 c gave the lowest solubilization 9 several authors have observed that solubilization increased with increasing temperature and time of the thp haug et al 1978 li and noike 1992 wilson and novak 2009 haug et al 1984 found that solubilization of was was highest for 30 min at 175 200 c li and noike 1992 tested was at temperatures up to 175 c for 30 min and found that generally the solubilization increased with increasing temperature wilson and novak 2009 tested was and primary sludge with pretreatment temperatures up to 220 c for 2 h and also found that the solubilization increased with increasing temperature the results presented here agree with the previous findings in published literature on was and primary sludge however the degree of solubilization seems to be feedstock dependent in a pad thp the centrate after post treatment will be recirculated to the ad for additional biogas production therefore in this study the bmp of the centrate produced from the different post treatment conditions was determined anova showed that the thermal treatment resulted in significantly different specific methane yields of the centrate from the two post treated cakes p value 001 the different centrates originating from hrsd cake in all cases yielded more methane compared to the centrates from the hra cake fig 2b temperature of the thp treatment also had a significant impact on methane yields of the centrates p value 01 and the response to the temperature of the thp treatment was significantly different for the two cakes p value 05 increasing temperatures made the centrate from pad thp of hra cake more available for conversion to methane for centrates from pad thp of hrsd cake the response to higher temperature was smaller than for hra cake but the overall conversion to methane was significantly higher for centrates from hrsd cake several authors have observed that methane yields increase with increasing temperature and time up to a certain level as a result of the treatment before the effect levels off or decreases li and noike 1992 stuckey and mccarty 1984 stuckey and mccarty 1984 found the optimum temperature for was to be 175 c li and noike 1992 found that the methane yield of was leveled off at a temperature of around 150 c our results show increase in methane yields for the centrate from both cakes for temperatures up to 175 c and treatment time 30 min the differences in solubilization and specific methane yield between the hrsd and hra cakes can have several explanations first the pretreatment was performed with two different thp pilots and with different water content in the incoming sludge cake 14 2 ts in hrsd cake and 18 5 ts in hra cake data not shown this could have had an effect on the mixing of steam and digestate cake in the mini cambi se test unit giving a lower treatment efficiency for the hra compared to hrsd second it has been shown that the effect of thp depends on waste characteristics bougrier et al 2008 wilson and novak 2009 and the characteristics of the two cakes used in this experiment were different table 1 the hrsd cake coming from an anaerobic digester treating sludge from a bio p plant had a higher ash content compared to the hra cake from the food waste plant and a lower cod vs ratio the hrsd cake also had a lower carbon content and higher nitrogen and sulfur contents plant material and lipids generally have a high c n ratio while protein have lower c n ratios a high cod vs ratio is an indication of a more energy dense material containing for instance more lipids further analysis of acid detergent fiber adf confirmed a larger fiber fraction 74 higher adf in the digestate cake from hra compared to the digestate cake from hrsd the larger fiber fraction in hra digestate cake indicates that this waste contains more plant material compared to the hrsd digestate cake primary sludge and was has previously been reported to be efficiently solubilized at 165 c wilson and novak 2009 and the maximum increase in methane yield have also been found around 30 min treatment time at 165 c haug et al 1978 li and noike 1992 stuckey and mccarty 1984 bougrier et al 2008 found that at temperatures lower than 150 c carbohydrate solubilization was more important than protein solubilization in activated sludge several authors have found that lignocellulosic biomass solubilizes more at treatment temperatures higher than 175 c horn et al 2011a 2011b vivekanand et al 2013 bauer et al 2014 found only small increases in methane yields when treating late harvested straw at temperatures between 160 c and 220 c and treatment times of 15 min while lizasoain et al 2016 tested treatment temperatures between 160 c and 220 c and treatment times of 5 20 min and found that the methane yield of reed was highest for the treatment at 200 c for 15 min while only a small increase in methane yield was observed at 160 c hence a possible explanation of the lower solubilization and lower increase in methane yield of digestate from hra compared to hrsd could be that the hra digestate cake has more resemblance to lignocellulosic wastes i e high fiber content while the hrsd digestate cake may have more resemblance to primary sludge and was i e higher protein content the larger increase in solubilization observed for hrsd cake between temperatures 152 c and 165 c compared to the increase in solubilization of hra cake could also be explained by a lower protein content in the hra cake bougrier et al 2008 3 1 2 dewatering properties the costs associated with the transport and disposal of the digestate cake are significant for many ad plants and with a typical water content of around 80 in the cake improved dewatering would be beneficial we determined the dewatering properties as predicted maximum solids for the digestate cakes after post treatment fig 2c according to the thermogravimetric method described by kopp and dichtl 2001 anova showed that both temperature and cake origin had a significant effect on the maximum cake solids p value 001 and 01 respectively where higher temperature resulted in better dewaterability above a temperature of 152 c the cake solids increased with increasing temperature and treatment time for both digestate cakes maximum predicted ts for the treated cakes were 43 and 46 for the hrsd and hra cakes respectively the dewatering properties of the original untreated cakes were very different the hra cake showed the ability to be dewatered to the predicted ts of 34 0 data not shown while the hrsd cake only achieved the predicted ts of 17 0 data not shown thus the post treatment was clearly most efficient for the hrsd cake the observed difference in efficiency of the thermal hydrolysis could again be explained by the origin of the two digestate cakes in sludge water is bound inside viable cells vesilind 1994 and between microbial cells in flocs higgins and novak 1997 li and yang 2007 the amount of bound water is effected by high concentrations of phosphate disturbing the cation bridging of the sludge flocs as well as the concentration of extracellular polymeric substances eps if the amount of intracellular and floc bound water is less in food waste cakes such as the hra cake the potential for improving the dewaterability of these types of digestate cakes will also be lower the results presented here demonstrate that post treatment could increase the maximum cake solids in digestate cakes and thereby cut the transportation costs of ad plants significantly the predicted increase in maximum cake solids was from 34 up to 46 for the hra digestate cake and from 17 up to 43 for the hrsd digestate cake fig 2c alone the increase in maximum cake solids contributes to the reduction of final wet cake mass after post treatment by 26 of the original untreated cake for the hra digestate cake and 60 of the original untreated cake for the hrsd digestate cake hence the practical implication for plants similar to hrsd of implementation of pad thp technology will be that for every ten trucks that is needed for digestate cake transportation today only four will be needed if thermal hydrolysis post treatment is implemented in addition the relative reduction in wet cake mass will depend on the digestate cake treated a digestate cake that is already dewatered to 30 before pad thp will have less potential for reduced wet cake mass compared to a digestate cake that only dewaters to 15 it will therefore be of paramount importance to take several considerations into account when making decisions on post treatment 3 1 3 residual methane potential in cake the residual methane potential of the cake fraction is of interest when evaluating to what extent the remaining methane potential in the digestate cake has been exploited by pad thp because of the small volume of post treated digestate available and the limitations of the laboratory equipment it was not possible to produce a cake with equal properties as full scale cake the separation in the laboratory centrifuge resulted in a pellet with higher water content compared to the predictions of water content after full scale dewatering presented in section 3 1 2 to overcome this challenge bmp was measured on the pellet and the results were then corrected by subtracting the bmp coming from the centrate which would be removed during dewatering in a full scale plant the bmp based on these calculations are presented in fig 2d anova showed no significant difference in bmp of the two cakes at different thp treatment times or temperatures bmp of the untreated hra digestate cake and the hrsd digestate cake treated for 60 min at 70 c and centrifuged was found to be 75 and 63 ml ch4 g tsadded respectively data not shown the bmp of the treated hra cakes was in all cases lower compared to the untreated cake and ranged from 41 to 53 ml g tsadded the bmp of the treated hrsd cakes was in all cases lower than the cake treated at 70 c for 60 min and ranged from 38 to 59 ml g tsadded the bmp of the centrates was observed to be much higher fig 2b compared to the bmp of the cake presented here and improved separation of the liquid fraction will lower the methane yield from the cake although there still is some methane potential left in the digestate cakes it is not evident that this will be emitted as methane during storage or after land application bmp tests are designed to give the maximum methane yield from a test material and will therefore give a worst case scenario other parameter such as oxygen and moisture access will influence the methane production from the cake during storage and after land application 3 2 cstr experiment based on the batch testing the treatment of digestate cake for 30 min at 165 175 c gave the best results in regard to solubilization specific methane yields of the centrate and dewaterability in a full scale system the centrate after post treatment will be recirculated to a continuous digester hence results from batch experiments do not give the full picture of the impact of solid stream on an ad system in order to evaluate the impact of the recirculation on continuous processes two semi continuous cstrs were run in parallel co digesting food waste and sewage sludge with a low srt and high olr table 2 the control digester received hygenized feed which was a mix of sewage sludge and food waste to meet the health regulations heat treated at 70 c for 60 min while the pad thp digester received unhygenized feed and centrate from the pad thp 30 min at 165 c hrsd cake during the first phase of the experiment the first two srts the pad thp digester was operated without adding centrate in this period the control digester had a higher volumetric methane yield compared to the pad thp digester fig 3 from day 28 the second phase of the experiment centrate was added with the feed to the pad thp digester every day during the second phase both reactors performed well achieving cod reduction of around 70 with low residual vfa concentrations in the effluent and a close to neutral ph table 4 the pad thp digester performed better than the control in regard to volumetric methane yield and cod reduction with an average increase in volumetric methane yield of 7 it also had marginally higher concentration of acetic propionic and total volatile fatty acids as well as higher tan po4 p and s cod in the effluent after the pad thp centrate was added the volumetric yield of the pad thp digester was higher compared to the control digester for all days both the daily volumetric methane yield and specific methane yield was significantly higher in the pad thp digester p value 001 and 01 respectively compared to the control digester the relative moderate increase in volumetric methane yield 7 compared to the observed 25 kjorlaug et al 2015 and 50 kolovos et al 2016 increase in volumetric biogas yield in the full scale plant in germany could be a result of a higher methane yield in the control digester in this study due to the pretreatment of the feed substrates the hygenization of the feed for the control digester resulted in a different feed sludge composition for the two digesters based on the paired t test three of the measured parameters were significantly different for untreated and hygenized sludge s cod p value 001 tan p value 01 and ph p value 05 while none of the parameters were significantly different for untreated and hygenized food waste this difference indicates that the pre treatment solubilized some of the feed sludge and degraded some of the proteins in the sludge table 2 the feed for the pad thp digester included centrate in order to get enough and consistent centrate it was decided to only use centrate from post treatment of hrsd cake and not from the laboratory digesters the cod content of the centrate was to a large degree soluble with a ratio of s cod cod of 92 had a strength of 39 g cod l and the ts was 88 organic table 2 in comparison analyses of samples from the full scale cambi plant in germany showed a centrate strength of 40 g cod l and a vs of 85 90 kjorlaug et al 2015 a high conversion rate of food waste to methane could explain why a smaller difference in methane yields was observed in this study compared to the results from the full scale plant kjorlaug et al 2015 kolovos et al 2016 the full scale plant does not receive food waste and the higher the conversion rate in the control digester the less will the potential of improvement of methane yields be in addition to feed composition the srt of the two digesters were different the srt was set to be 17 days for the control digester resulting in a srt of 14 days for the pad thp digester both srts are low compared to the srts of conventional full scale plants which commonly operates with average srts of 20 25 days in the us we chose a low srt in order to evaluate the suitability of pad thp for digesters that is already operating close to their limit as many sewage plants implement co digestion of sludge and food waste srts are also lowered as long as the digester volume remains unchanged however the low srt in this study could have contributed to the smaller difference between methane yields of the control digester and the pad thp digester compared to what has been observed in the full scale plant in germany kjorlaug et al 2015 kolovos et al 2016 differences in laboratory scale and full scale configuration may also have influenced the results presented in this section in a full scale pad thp system the solids content of the influent can be higher than in a pre hygienization system and because of this the srt can be higher the centrate will be continuously produced from the effluent and will respond to changes in solids reduction and effluent characteristics another difference in full scale digesters is that they receive feed continuously contrary to the laboratory reactors that was fed once per day the effects of feeding frequency on anaerobic digesters is not well documented we think that by using the adaptations described in section 2 4 the results presented in section 3 2 is a conservative estimate of what can be achieved in full scale 3 3 major differences between pre treatment and post treatment researchers have shown that pre pasteurization processes can experience reactivation and regrowth of indicator organisms such as fecal coliforms and e coli chen et al 2011 higgins et al 2007 this is thought to be due to inadequate time temperature treatment associated with pre pasteurization which does not completely inactivate the organisms with pad thp all digestate cake is treated at 165 c for 30 min which effectively inactivates pathogens minimizing the risk of reactivation and regrowth pre thp would also achieve the same effect and minimize the risk of reactivation and regrowth post digestion treatment will improve the overall energy balance the amount of solids that are heat treated is less with pad thp compared to pre ad hygienization or pre thp because of the solids reduction that occurs during digestion for example in comparing pre thp to pad thp the heat treatment is applied at the same solids concentration around 16 but with pad thp the total solids to be treated could be reduced by 50 or more due to biodegradation that occurs in the digester increased solids reduction and conversion to biogas influences the energy balance both directly through methane production and indirectly through lowering the heat loss of the pad thp system with pad thp most of the energy used for sterilization is returned to the digester for heating by returning the centrate another advantage of pad thp compared to pre thp and pre hygenization is the improvement in cake solids during final dewatering which can have a large beneficial impact on economics pre thp has been shown to improve final dewaterability after digestion however digestion reduces the extent of dewaterability compared to the solids immediately after pre thp hasan et al 2017 reported that the cake solids after dewatering of a mixed primary and secondary sludge that had undergone pre thp was around 43 but after subsequent anaerobic digestion the cake solids decreased to around 31 in the pad thp scheme the solids are thermally hydrolyzed and dewatered immediately which improves cake solids in addition the solids are dewatered at higher temperatures immediately following pad thp which further improves cake solids 4 conclusion this study obtained novel insights into the differences in the effect of pad thp on digestate cakes from a food waste plant and a wastewater treatment plant post treatment improved methane yields both in batch and in a semi continuous system and improved the extent of dewaterability of the digestate cakes the effect of the post treatment was influenced by digestate cake characteristics and the treatment was more efficient for the cake from a plant treating sewage sludge compared to the cake from a plant treating source separated food waste improved vs reduction in the anaerobic digester and improved dewatering of the treated digestate cake assured that the final cake product was stable with low residual methane potential our estimates suggests a reduction in final wet cake mass due to improved dewatering from pad thp of 60 of the original wet cake mass for digestate cake from an anaerobic digester treating sewage sludge from a bio p plant our results indicate that thermal hydrolysis of digestate cake is an efficient technology for improving methane production and dewaterability in conventional anaerobic digesters and performs better compared to the conventional pre treatment technology at 70 c practically the technology will improve methane yields and the extent of digestate dewaterability increase the ad plants income through higher methane production and reduce the ad plants transportation and disposal costs through reduction of final wet cake mass acknowledgement this work was financially supported by the norwegian

19753,bisphenol s bps an alternative product to bisphenol a bpa has been the focus of increasing public concern due to its potential endocrine disrupting effect and its adverse effects related to metabolic disorders such as obesity the detection of its residue in drinking water supply systems suggests that bps can be chlorinated however whether its endocrine disrupting effect can be disrupted by this chlorination remains unclear in the present study we identified the byproducts of the reaction of bps with chlorine and assessed the effect of the main byproducts on peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma pparγ bps was chlorinated in a simulation experiment the chlorination reaction in this study was chlorine and ph dependent and the pseudo first order reaction rate constant was controlled by the chlorine concentration and ph the reaction rate at ph 8 5 was 7 times faster than that at ph 6 5 twenty two byproducts were putatively identified by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc esi q tof ms and five main byproducts were purified and characterized by 1h and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy the pparγ effects of the byproducts were assayed revealing a2 to4 fold enhancement in their activities in comparison with the parent compound graphical abstract image 1 keywords bisphenol s lc esi q tof ms chlorination pparγ 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa is among the most widely produced and used chemicals worldwide and has been found to leach from polycarbonate and epoxy resin materials biles et al 1997 brotons et al 1995 hoekstra and simoneau 2013 krishnan et al 1993 and thermal paper walter 2010 because of its migration bpa contamination has been detected ubiquitously in various environmental and food matrices careghini et al 2015 humans can ingest it via dietary and non dietary pathways geens et al 2012 evidence from clinical epidemiologic and experimental studies has revealed the potential association of bpa with many human diseases choi et al 2012 miao et al 2011 rezg et al 2014 rochester 2013 considering the potential risk and public health concerns bpa use in children s products has been banned in many countries since 2011 in 2015 the european union reduced the temporary tolerable daily intake of bpa from 50 to 4 μg kg body weight day based on bpa related adverse effects on the kidney and mammary glands enzymes 2015 this tightened regulation has prompted a gradual shift toward the use of bisphenol analogs such as bisphenol s bps and bisphenol f bpf due to its excellent stability at high temperatures and its resistance to sunlight bps has become increasingly popular as a building block in polycarbonates epoxies thermal paper additives and certain personal consumer products labeled bpa free similar to bpa bps can leach from materials indeed bps has been found in personal care products liao and kannan 2014a 13 categories of foodstuffs from nine cities liao and kannan

moreover bps is more resistant to biodegradation than bpa in the aquatic environment danzl et al 2009 ike et al 2006 suggesting that bps has increased persistence since bps is one of the most commonly used alternatives to bpa there have been increased concerns over its safety in recent years similar to the concerns over bpa in vitro studies using different receptor models have revealed that bps is less estrogenic and antiandrogenic than bpa showing an average estrogenic potency of 0 32 0 28 compared with that of bpa rochester and bolden 2015 however bps had the largest effect on the production

2016 the reports documenting the ubiquitous occurrence of bps in various environmental matrices chen et al 2016b yang et al 2014 imply that it can generate various chlorinated byproducts by reacting with hypochlorite during the disinfecting procedures in water supply and treatment systems and during the bleaching of food contact materials four chlorinated derivatives of bps did not have increased estrogenic activity kuruto niwa et al 2005 compared with certain chlorinated bpas hu et al 2002 the estrogenic activities followed the order bps trichloro bps dichloro bps monochloro bps whereas tetrachloro bpsshowedno estrogenic activity previous studies suggested that polyhalogenated bpa could function as anobesogen by acting as an agonist and disrupting physiological functions regulated by human or animal peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma pparγ riu et al 2011 as a key transcription factor responsible for the development and metabolism of adipocytes pparγ is expressed in the adipose tissue obesogenic compounds can regulate pparγ activity directly or indirectly by increasing the level of pparγ protein or enhancing its recruitment to promoters of the key genes involved in adipocyte metabolism moreover a cross sectional study in cyprus indicated that the incidence of type ii diabetes mellitus t2dm was positively associated with the urinary levels of monochlorinated bpa mono cl bpa but not with the levels of the parent compound total bpa andra et al 2015 a previous study of the chlorination of bpa by hu showed a rapid electrophilic reaction with bpa disappearing within a few minutes generating polychlorinated phenoxyphenols hu et al 2002 the chlorinated products of bpa have been detected in drinking water fan et al 2013 bleached food contact papers zhou et al 2015 adipose tissue fernandez et al 2007 placental tissue jiménez díaz et al 2010 and the plasma of pregnant women and the corresponding embryos chen et al 2016b although the occurrence levels and detection frequencies of bps in the environment are gradually increasing due to the restricted use of bpa in personal consumer products there is a dearth of knowledge regarding chlorinated bps the chlorinated byproducts and transformation pathways in disinfection systems are poorly understood it is of particular importance to determine whether the pparγ activities of chlorinated bps derivatives are strengthened because of their structural similarity to the halogenated byproducts of bpa and bpf these byproducts have been shown to exhibit greater pparγ activities than their parent compounds

composition c12h8o4scl the fact that this compound had the same value for double bond equivalents rdb 8 5 as the parent compound bps indicated that both compounds presented the same degree of unsaturation the isotopic abundance ratio between m z 282 9836 and 284 9807 3 1 confirmed one chlorine substitution the ms ms spectrum showed the loss of hcl at m z 247 0061 δmda 0 4 and phenoxy c6h5o

compound bps and the isotopic patterns of dichlorine species the elemental compositions of these two compounds assigned were c12h7o4scl2 corresponding to dichlorine substituted bps the characteristic ion at m z 159 9483 δmda 0 of the former compound assigned an elemental composition of c6h2ocl2 indicated that two chlorine substitution reactions occurred at the ortho positions of the hydroxyl of the same benzene ring the other fragment ions at m z 280 9682 223 9103 175 9434 108 0215 and 92 0266 were ascribed to m h hcl m h c6h5o m h c6h5o so m h c6h3ocl2 so and m h c6h3ocl2 so2 respectively the latter fragment ion showing a base peak at m z 125 9873 δmda 0 1 was designated c6h3ocl via the loss of c6h4ocl and so2 indicating that the chlorine substitutions occurred on different benzene

elemental compositions of c12h6o4scl3 and c12h5o4scl4 respectively fig 2d e the two compounds had the same rdb values as bps indicating the chlorine substitution on the benzene ring of bps they exhibited similar fragmentation pathways via the loss of hydrogen chloride carbon monoxide by alpha cleavage sulfur dioxide by the cleavage of the two carbon sulfur bonds c s and phenol figs s1 s5 present the 1h nmr and 13c nmr spectra of the mono di tri and tetrachloro bps and the chemical shifts are detailed in table 2 the 1h nmr spectrum of monochloro bps exhibited the resonances for an abx

correlations from δ h7 70 h 2 to δ c7 70 158 0 c 4 and 127 3 c 6 indicated that chlorine was adjacent to the hydroxyl group as shown in the chemical structure in fig s1 in the 1h nmr spectrum of 3 5 dichloro bps three groups of aromatic proton signals were observed including δ h6 93 2h d j 8 7 hz h 3 h 5 7 78 2h d j 8 7 hz h 2 h 4 and 7 78 2h brs h 2 h 6 revealing that the two chlorine atoms were

and 7 78 2h d j 2 3 hz h 2 h 2 revealed that two chlorine atoms were substituted at the two benzene rings as discussed in the case of monochloro bps in the 1h nmr spectrum of 3 5 3 trichloro bps resonances of an abx aromatic spin system atδ h6 94 1h d j 8 7 hz h5 7 59 1h dd j 8 7 2 3 hz h6 and 7 78 1h d j 2 3 hz h 2 and a group of brs aromatic signals at 7 71 2h brs h 2 h 6 were observed indicating that two chlorine atoms were substituted adjacent to the hydroxyl carbon in one benzene ring of bps and that one chlorine atom was substituted adjacent to hydroxyl carbon in the other benzene ring 3 3 5 5 tetrachloro bps was obtained as amorphous powder and its molecular formula was determined as c12h5o4scl4 according to the hresims peak at m z 386 8632 m h in the 1h nmr spectrum only one group of aromatic proton signals atδ h7 84 4h brs was observed these signals in addition to the hmbc interactions between δ h7 84 h 2 and δ c155 7 c 4 revealed that all four chlorine atoms were substituted at the carbons adjacent to the hydroxyl carbons in the benzene ring fig 3 shows the time course profiles for bps degradation and the elution of byproducts at ph 6 5 7 0 7 5 8 0 and 8 5 with initial concentrations of bps and free available chlorine fac of 0 2 mg l and 1 mg l respectively at 25 c the degradation rates increased with an increase in the solution ph monochloro bps dichloro bps and trichloro bps were formed as a result of bps degradation during the first 10 30 mn and were slowly degraded over time at ph 6 5 8 5 tetrachloro bps gradually increased to a maximum concentration after several hours at ph 6 5 and 7 0 however low yields of tetrachloro bps were observed at ph 7 5 8 0 and 8 5 overall monochloro bps dichloro bps trichloro bps and tetrachloro bps completely disappeared after an 8 h reaction indicating the presence of other chlorinated byproducts the peak with a retention time of 5 80 mn fig s6 was tentatively assigned the elemental composition c18h11o5scl2by its accurate mass bp 408 m z 408 9706 δmda 0 2 and chlorine isotope pattern the presence of two chlorine atoms in this compound was confirmed in a full scan by the existence of the corresponding isotopic m h 2 ion with an abundance approximately two thirds that of the m h ion the rdb value rdb 12 5 compared with the parent compound bps rdb 8 5 indicated the addition of a benzene ring the prominent fragment ion at m z 175 9431 δmda 0 1 assigned to c6h2o2cl2 with an rdb value 5 0 indicated that the chlorine substitution occurred on the same phenolic ring the different fragmentation pathway from dichlorine substituted bps suggested that the two chlorines were positioned on the added phenolic ring the structure of this compound could be named 2 6 dichloro 4 4 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl phenoxy phenol the peaks with retention times of 6 08 mn and 6 29 mn had the same elemental composition of c18h10o5scl3 bp 442 and similar fragment ions figs s7 8 indicating different chlorine substituted positions on the two benzene ring of bps based on the predicted values of log kow octanol water partition coefficient using the epi suite software ecosa v1 11 and their relationship with the retention properties in reversed phase chromatography the peaks with retention times of t 6 15 mn log kow 4 79 and 6 29 mn log kow 6 29 were presumed to be 2 6 dichloro 4 2 chloro 4 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl phenoxy phenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 4 3 chloro 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl phenoxy phenol respectively the peaks with retention times of 5 38 mn and 6 50 mn also had the same elemental composition of c18h9o5scl4 bp 476 these peaks presented similar fragmentation pathways via the loss of hydrogen chloride and carbon monoxide by alpha cleavage and generated fragment ions at m z 315 9374 and 315 9359 with the tentative formula c12h6o4scl2 however the exact positions of the other two chlorine atoms where the substitutions occurred on this ring could not be elucidated based on their ms ms spectrum figs s9 10 the peak with retention time of 6 46 mn and an accurate mass of m z 510 8548 bp 510 δmda 1 3 was tentatively assigned as c18h8o5scl5 the fragment ion at m z 349 8976 δmda 0 2 indicated the cleavage of the sulfur carbon bond by the loss of c6h4ocl therefore this compound can be established as 2 6 dichloro 4 2 6 dichloro 4 3 chloro 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl phenoxy phenol fig s11 the peak with retention time of 5 57 mn bp 510 which showed the same elemental composition as the peak at 6 46 mn can be presumed to be2 6 dichloro 4 2 chloro 4 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl phenoxy phenol fig s12 the fragment ion at 285 9365 δmda 1 corresponding to the loss ofc6h3o3scl2 confirmed this assumption the peak with a retention time of 5 78 mn and an accurate mass of m z 544 8134 bp 544 δmda 1 1 was assigned as c18h7o5scl6 indicating that the ortho para positions to the hydroxyl group were substituted by chlorine atoms fig s13 although hu s team hu et al 2002 reported the generation of trichlorophenol during the chlorination process of bisphenol a this compound was not found in the chromatograms which was consistent with the study by yamamoto and yasuhara yamamoto and yasuhara 2002 based on the structures of the byproducts containing 18 carbons trichlorophenol must be generated and quickly reacted with chlorinated bps via electrophilic substitution in addition to the compounds identified above other chlorinated byproducts were tentatively deduced by lc q tof ms fig s14shows the extracted ion chromatograms of chlorinated bps after a 4 h reaction at ph 8 5 the peaks at 3 32 mn 3 57 mn 3 86 mn 3 88 mn 4 29 mn and 4 53 mn were tentatively assigned elemental compositions of c24h16o8s2cl c24h15o8s2cl2 c24h14o8s2cl3 c24h13o8s2cl4 c24h12o8s2cl5 and c24h11o8s2cl6 respectively figs s15 20 all these compounds contained the double carbon oxygen and sulfur atoms of bps suggesting the generation of biphenyl ether dimers via oxidative coupling reactions between phenoxy and chlorinated phenoxy radicals subsequently the above dimers continued to react with trichlorophenol to yield trimers via oxidative coupling reactions the peaks with retention times of 5 79 mn 5 95 mn and 6 03 mn were assigned elemental compositions of c30h17o9s2cl4 c30h16o9s2cl5 and c30h15o9s2cl6 respectively further confirming the above hypothesis figs s21 23 however the specific substituted positions of the chlorine atoms cannot be deduced by ms spectra the continued formation of higher polymers from the identified dimers and trimers or their degradation into smaller molecules is not clear based on the above results we can elucidate the chlorination reaction scheme of bps bps first reacted with fac to yield monochloro dichloro trichloro and tetrachloro bps in a stepwise manner moreover 2 4 6 trichlorophenol was also tentatively formed when the hypochlorite ion attacked the sulfur oxygen bond of bps which is based on previous studies on the chlorination reaction of bpa hu et al 2002 yamamoto and yasuhara 2002 over time the biphenyl ether dimers and trimers were generated by oxidative coupling reactions between different chlorinated bps derivatives and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol this proposed pathway is also not stoichiometric and other compounds may exist that were not detectable using our analytical procedure 3 2 reaction kinetics the chlorination kinetics of bpa the chemical predecessor of bps have been comprehensively explored in many studies gallard et al studied the initial pseudo first order kinetics under conditions with hocl 0 20 bpa 0 between ph 2 and 11 at room temperature gallard et al 2004 lane et al established a model for the initial chlorination between fac and bpa bpf and bisphenol a diglycidyl ether lane et al 2015 the kinetic constants of the initial chlorination between bps and fac were also investigated with control of the ph zheng et al 2016 the kinetic results can be well described by pseudo first order kinetics as demonstrated by the linear plots r2 0 93 the kinetic parameters of the pseudo first order reaction of bps at different ph values are described in table 3 the results indicated that the reaction rates increased by 7 fold with the increase in ph value from 6 5 to 8 5 implying the ph dependence of chlorination which is consistent with previous studies on the chlorination of bpa gallard et al 2004 lane et al 2015 phenols gallard and von gunten 2002 and resorcinols rebenne et al 1996 gallard et al demonstrated that the initial chlorination of bpa was ph dependent and that the main reactions occurred at ph values between 8 0 and 9 0 with the lowest reactivity at ph 5 0 the reaction order with respect to chlorine was examined at ph 7 0 by varying its concentration gallard et al 2004 the pseudo first order rate constant k obs is linearly correlated with the chlorine dose r2 0 93 implying that the chlorination reaction in this study is chlorine dependent and that the pseudo first order reaction rate constant is controlled by the chlorine concentration 3 3 pparγ activity assay we examined the activation of pparγ by chlorinated bps and byproduct mixtures of the chlorination reaction at different reaction times using the sensitive dual luciferase reporter assay as shown in fig s24 rosiglitazone showed the maximal activity of 14 7 1 4 on pparγ figures4and 5depict the pparγ activities of bps mono di tri and tetrachloro bps and byproduct mixtures at different reaction times the maximal activities of tri and tetrachloro bps on pparγ were 4 0 0 6 and 4 8 0 7 respectively compared with 1 3 0 2for bps fig 4 the mono and dichloro bps also showed maximal activities of approximately 2 4 and 2 8 fold respectively on pparγ in this study indicating that the pparγ effects were enhanced by an increase in number of substituted chlorine atoms as shown in fig 5 the chlorinated bps solutions at both 9 and 240 mn showed maximal activities on pparγ of approximately 2 3 fold and the maximal activity on pparγat540 mn was 1 7 fold although the compounds assayed in fig 5 were byproduct mixtures the process of sample preparation was the same as the reaction kinetic experiments at ph 7 and fig 3 shows the time course profiles for the elution of the main byproducts the pparγ activities of the byproducts were enhanced compared to that of the parent compound to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the pparγ effect of chlorinated bps byproducts the results are similar to our previous study on the chlorinated byproducts of bpf a structural analog of bps zheng et al 2016 previous in vitro and in vivo experiments suggested that pparγ is required for the differentiation of adipose tissue rosen et al 1999 a population study involving 643 sample subjects in jiangsu province china indicated that pparγ genes rs709158 rs1805192 and rs4684847 interacted with overweightness obesity to influence c reactive protein levels gu et al 2015 hogh et al implied that the overexpression of pparγ in the pancreatic beta cells exacerbated obesity induced glucose intolerance reduced beta cell mass and altered islet lipid metabolism in male mice hogh et al 2014 studies on bpa have shown that bpa and its metabolite bpa glucuronide bpa g can induce lipid accumulation and adipogenesis in murine 3t3l1 and primary human preadipocyte cell models atlas et al 2014 boucher et al 2014 2015 masuno et al 2002 an in vitro study investigating the potential effect of bps on lipid homeostasis found that bps at low concentrations induced an increase in the lipid content in 3t3l1 mouse preadipocytes and hepg2 human hepatoma cells along with a decrease in lipolysis helies toussaint et al 2014 bps exposure to primary human preadipocytes from female donors also induced adipogenesis through pparγ pathway mediation boucher et al 2016 an in vivo experiment indicated that bps showed obesogenicity in male mice offspring after perinatal exposure at low doses moral et al 2016 fig 6 shows the correlation between logkow estimated by epi suite software and pparγ activities the results suggest that the pparγ activities of chlorinated bps are highly associated with their logkow values similar studies on the pparγ activities of halogenated bpa have documented that the ranking of logkow of halogenated bpas is consistent with their agonistic activity toward the pparγ ligand binding domain lbd riu et al 2011 zhuang et al used an in silico molecular dynamics simulation to explore the distinct toxicity action and molecular recognition mechanism of different halogenated bpas toward pparγ zhuang et al 2014 the results revealed that increasing the degree of halogenationon the phenolic rings of bpa enhanced the surface electrostatic potentials and increased the shielding of the hormonally active phenolic oh thus it markedly decreased the electrostatic interactions favorable for agonistic activities toward pparγ different halogenation patterns also further altered the hydrogen bond interactions of bpa and induced conformational changes in the pparγ lbd specifically affecting the stabilization of helix h12 which is attributable to the different agonistic activities 4 conclusion our study demonstrated that bps could be transformed into the chlorinated derivatives monochloro dichloro trichloro tetrachloro bps and the biphenyl ether dimer and trimer byproducts via oxidative coupling reactions the reaction kinetics are controlled by ph and fac concentration and the reaction rate at ph 8 5 is 7 times that at ph 6 5 the chlorination byproducts of bisphenol s showed enhanced pparγ activities compared with bisphenol s indicating the

19753,bisphenol s bps an alternative product to bisphenol a bpa has been the focus of increasing public concern due to its potential endocrine disrupting effect and its adverse effects related to metabolic disorders such as obesity the detection of its residue in drinking water supply systems suggests that bps can be chlorinated however whether its endocrine disrupting effect can be disrupted by this chlorination remains unclear in the present study we identified the byproducts of the reaction of bps with chlorine and assessed the effect of the main byproducts on peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma pparγ bps was chlorinated in a simulation experiment the chlorination reaction in this study was chlorine and ph dependent and the pseudo first order reaction rate constant was controlled by the chlorine concentration and ph the reaction rate at ph 8 5 was 7 times faster than that at ph 6 5 twenty two byproducts were putatively identified by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc esi q tof ms and five main byproducts were purified and characterized by 1h and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy the pparγ effects of the

1995 hoekstra and simoneau 2013 krishnan et al 1993 and thermal paper walter 2010 because of its migration bpa contamination has been detected ubiquitously in various environmental and food matrices careghini et al 2015 humans can ingest it via dietary and non dietary pathways geens et al 2012 evidence from clinical epidemiologic and experimental studies has revealed the potential association of bpa with many human diseases choi et al 2012 miao et al 2011 rezg et al 2014 rochester 2013 considering the potential risk and public health concerns bpa use in children s products has been banned in many countries since 2011 in 2015 the european union reduced the temporary tolerable daily intake of bpa from 50 to 4 μg kg body weight day based on bpa related adverse effects on the kidney and mammary glands enzymes 2015 this tightened regulation has prompted a gradual shift toward the use of bisphenol analogs such as bisphenol s bps and bisphenol f bpf due to its excellent stability at high temperatures and its resistance to sunlight bps has become increasingly popular as a building block in polycarbonates epoxies thermal paper additives and certain personal consumer products labeled bpa free similar to bpa bps can leach from materials indeed bps has been found in personal care products liao and kannan 2014a 13 categories of foodstuffs from nine cities liao and kannan 2014b surface water yang et al 2014 and thermal receipt papers liao et al 2012 bps was also observed in human urine with an 81 detection frequency and a maximum level of 21 μg l chen et al 2016a moreover bps is more resistant to biodegradation than bpa in the aquatic environment danzl et al 2009 ike et al 2006 suggesting that bps has increased persistence since bps is one of the most commonly used alternatives to bpa there have been increased concerns over its safety in recent years similar to the concerns over bpa in vitro studies using different receptor models have revealed that bps is less estrogenic and antiandrogenic than bpa showing an average estrogenic potency of 0 32 0 28 compared with that of bpa rochester and bolden 2015 however bps had the largest effect on the production of 17α hydroxyprogesterone rosenmai et al 2014 in vivo studies liu et al 2013 naderi et al 2014 investigating the exposure of zebrafish to bps showed decreased gonad weight altered plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol and reproduction impairment including decreased sperm count egg production and hatchability and increased embryo malformation rates and female to male sex ratios another study kinch et al 2015 in zebrafish revealed that low dose 0 0068 μmol l exposure to bpa and bps respectively induced 180 and 240 increases respectively in precocious hypothalamic neurogenesisin embryonic zebrafish indicating their potential effect on hyperactivity and other behavioral disturbances in children human preadipocyte exposure to bps can induce lipid accumulation and increase the mrna and protein levels of several adipogenic markers boucher et al 2016 another study showed that bps led to obesity in male mice after perinatal and chronic exposure at low doses del moral et al 2016 the reports documenting the ubiquitous occurrence of bps in various environmental matrices chen et al 2016b yang et al 2014 imply that it can generate various chlorinated byproducts by reacting with hypochlorite during the disinfecting procedures in water supply and treatment systems and during the bleaching of food contact materials four chlorinated derivatives of bps did not have increased estrogenic activity kuruto niwa et al 2005 compared with certain chlorinated bpas hu et al 2002 the estrogenic activities followed the order bps trichloro bps dichloro bps monochloro bps whereas tetrachloro bpsshowedno estrogenic activity previous studies suggested that polyhalogenated bpa could function as anobesogen by acting as an agonist and disrupting physiological functions regulated by human or animal peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma pparγ riu et al 2011 as a key transcription factor responsible for the development and metabolism of adipocytes pparγ is expressed in the adipose tissue obesogenic compounds can regulate pparγ activity directly or indirectly by increasing the level of pparγ protein or enhancing its recruitment to promoters of the key genes involved in adipocyte metabolism moreover a cross sectional study in cyprus indicated that the incidence of type ii diabetes mellitus t2dm was positively associated with the urinary levels of monochlorinated bpa mono cl bpa but not with the levels of the parent compound total bpa andra et al 2015 a previous study of the chlorination of bpa by hu showed a rapid electrophilic reaction with bpa disappearing within a few minutes generating polychlorinated phenoxyphenols hu et al 2002 the chlorinated products of bpa have been detected in drinking water fan et al 2013 bleached food contact papers zhou et al 2015 adipose tissue fernandez et al 2007 placental tissue jiménez díaz et al 2010 and the plasma of pregnant women and the corresponding embryos chen et al 2016b although the occurrence levels and detection frequencies of bps in the environment are gradually increasing due to the restricted use of bpa in personal consumer products there is a dearth of knowledge regarding chlorinated bps the chlorinated byproducts and transformation pathways in disinfection systems are poorly understood it is of particular importance to determine whether the pparγ activities of chlorinated bps derivatives are strengthened because of their structural similarity to the halogenated byproducts of bpa and bpf these byproducts have been shown to exhibit greater pparγ activities than their parent compounds

compositions of the ions fig 1 shows the lc q tof chromatogram of byproducts after a 30 mn reaction the peak with a retention time of 4 05 mn m z 282 9836 δmda 0 4 was assigned the elemental composition c12h8o4scl the fact that this compound had the same value for double bond equivalents rdb 8 5 as the parent compound bps indicated that both compounds presented the same degree of unsaturation the isotopic abundance ratio between m z 282 9836 and 284 9807 3 1 confirmed one chlorine substitution the ms ms spectrum showed the loss of hcl at m z 247 0061 δmda 0 4 and phenoxy c6h5o

compound bps and the isotopic patterns of dichlorine species the elemental compositions of these two compounds assigned were c12h7o4scl2 corresponding to dichlorine substituted bps the characteristic ion at m z 159 9483 δmda 0 of the former compound assigned an elemental composition of c6h2ocl2 indicated that two chlorine substitution reactions occurred at the ortho positions of the hydroxyl of the same benzene ring the other fragment ions at m z 280 9682 223 9103 175 9434 108 0215 and 92 0266 were ascribed to m h hcl m h c6h5o m h c6h5o so m h c6h3ocl2 so and m h c6h3ocl2 so2 respectively the latter fragment ion showing a base peak at m z 125 9873 δmda 0 1 was designated c6h3ocl via the loss of c6h4ocl and so2 indicating that the chlorine substitutions occurred on different benzene

elemental compositions of c12h6o4scl3 and c12h5o4scl4 respectively fig 2d e the two compounds had the same rdb values as bps indicating the chlorine substitution on the benzene ring of bps they exhibited similar fragmentation pathways via the loss of hydrogen chloride carbon monoxide by alpha cleavage sulfur dioxide by the cleavage of the two carbon sulfur bonds c s and phenol figs s1 s5 present the 1h nmr and 13c nmr spectra of the mono di tri and tetrachloro bps and the chemical shifts are detailed in table 2 the 1h nmr spectrum of monochloro bps exhibited the resonances for an abx

correlations from δ h7 70 h 2 to δ c7 70 158 0 c 4 and 127 3 c 6 indicated that chlorine was adjacent to the hydroxyl group as shown in the chemical structure in fig s1 in the 1h nmr spectrum of 3 5 dichloro bps three groups of aromatic proton signals were observed including δ h6 93 2h d j 8 7 hz h 3 h 5 7 78 2h d j 8 7 hz h 2 h 4 and 7 78 2h brs h 2 h 6 revealing that the two chlorine atoms were

and 7 78 2h d j 2 3 hz h 2 h 2 revealed that two chlorine atoms were substituted at the two benzene rings as discussed in the case of monochloro bps in the 1h nmr spectrum of 3 5 3 trichloro bps resonances of an abx aromatic spin system atδ h6 94 1h d j 8 7 hz h5 7 59 1h dd j 8 7 2 3 hz h6 and 7 78 1h d j 2 3 hz h 2 and a group of brs aromatic signals at 7 71 2h brs h 2 h 6 were observed indicating that two chlorine atoms were substituted adjacent to the hydroxyl carbon in one benzene ring of bps and that one chlorine atom was substituted adjacent to hydroxyl carbon in the other benzene ring 3 3 5 5 tetrachloro bps was obtained as amorphous powder and its molecular formula was determined as c12h5o4scl4 according to the hresims peak at m z 386 8632 m h in the 1h nmr spectrum only one group of aromatic proton signals atδ h7 84 4h brs was observed these signals in addition to the hmbc interactions between δ h7 84 h 2 and δ c155 7 c 4 revealed that all four chlorine atoms were substituted at the carbons adjacent to the hydroxyl carbons in the benzene ring fig 3 shows the time course profiles for bps degradation and the elution of byproducts at ph 6 5 7 0 7 5 8 0 and 8 5 with initial concentrations of bps and free available chlorine fac of 0 2 mg l and 1 mg l respectively at 25 c the degradation rates increased with an increase in the solution ph monochloro bps dichloro bps and trichloro bps were formed as a result of bps degradation during the first 10 30 mn and were slowly degraded over time at ph 6 5 8 5 tetrachloro bps gradually increased to a maximum concentration after several hours at ph 6 5 and 7 0 however low yields of tetrachloro bps were observed at ph 7 5 8 0 and 8 5 overall monochloro bps dichloro bps trichloro bps and tetrachloro bps completely disappeared after an 8 h reaction indicating the presence of other chlorinated byproducts the peak with a retention time of 5 80 mn fig s6 was tentatively assigned the elemental composition c18h11o5scl2by its accurate mass bp 408 m z 408 9706 δmda 0 2 and chlorine isotope pattern the presence of two chlorine atoms in this compound was confirmed in a full scan by the existence of the corresponding isotopic m h 2 ion with an abundance approximately two thirds that of the m h ion the rdb value rdb 12 5 compared with the parent compound bps rdb 8 5 indicated the addition of a benzene ring the prominent fragment ion at m z 175 9431 δmda 0 1 assigned to c6h2o2cl2 with an rdb value 5 0 indicated that the chlorine substitution occurred on the same phenolic ring the different fragmentation pathway from dichlorine substituted bps suggested that the two chlorines were positioned on the added phenolic ring the structure of this compound could be named 2 6 dichloro 4 4 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl phenoxy phenol the peaks with retention times of 6 08 mn and 6 29 mn had the same elemental composition of c18h10o5scl3 bp 442 and similar fragment ions figs s7 8 indicating different chlorine substituted positions on the two benzene ring of bps based on the predicted values of log kow octanol water partition coefficient using the epi suite software ecosa v1 11 and their relationship with the retention properties in reversed phase chromatography the peaks with retention times of t 6 15 mn log kow 4 79 and 6 29 mn log kow 6 29 were presumed to be 2 6 dichloro 4 2 chloro 4 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl phenoxy phenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 4 3 chloro 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl phenoxy phenol respectively the peaks with retention times of 5 38 mn and 6 50 mn also had the same elemental composition of c18h9o5scl4 bp 476 these peaks presented similar fragmentation pathways via the loss of hydrogen chloride and carbon monoxide by alpha cleavage and generated fragment ions at m z 315 9374 and 315 9359 with the tentative formula c12h6o4scl2 however the exact positions of the other two chlorine atoms where the substitutions occurred on this ring could not be elucidated based on their ms ms spectrum figs s9 10 the peak with retention time of 6 46 mn and an accurate mass of m z 510 8548 bp 510 δmda 1 3 was tentatively assigned as c18h8o5scl5 the fragment ion at m z 349 8976 δmda 0 2 indicated the cleavage of the sulfur carbon bond by the loss of c6h4ocl therefore this compound can be established as 2 6 dichloro 4 2 6 dichloro 4 3 chloro 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl phenoxy phenol fig s11 the peak with retention time of 5 57 mn bp 510 which showed the same elemental composition as the peak at 6 46 mn can be presumed to be2 6 dichloro 4 2 chloro 4 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonyl phenoxy phenol fig s12 the fragment ion at 285 9365 δmda 1 corresponding to the loss ofc6h3o3scl2 confirmed this assumption the peak with a retention time of 5 78 mn and an accurate mass of m z 544 8134 bp 544 δmda 1 1 was assigned as c18h7o5scl6 indicating that the ortho para positions to the hydroxyl group were substituted by chlorine atoms fig s13 although hu s team hu et al 2002 reported the generation of trichlorophenol during the chlorination process of bisphenol a this compound was not found in the chromatograms which was consistent with the study by yamamoto and yasuhara yamamoto and yasuhara 2002 based on the structures of the byproducts containing 18 carbons trichlorophenol must be generated and quickly reacted with chlorinated bps via electrophilic substitution in addition to the compounds identified above other chlorinated byproducts were tentatively deduced by lc q tof ms fig s14shows the extracted ion chromatograms of chlorinated bps after a 4 h reaction at ph 8 5 the peaks at 3 32 mn 3 57 mn 3 86 mn 3 88 mn 4 29 mn and 4 53 mn were tentatively assigned elemental compositions of c24h16o8s2cl c24h15o8s2cl2 c24h14o8s2cl3 c24h13o8s2cl4 c24h12o8s2cl5 and c24h11o8s2cl6 respectively figs s15 20 all these compounds contained the double carbon oxygen and sulfur atoms of bps suggesting the generation of biphenyl ether dimers via oxidative coupling reactions between phenoxy and chlorinated phenoxy radicals subsequently the above dimers continued to react with trichlorophenol to yield trimers via oxidative coupling reactions the peaks with retention times of 5 79 mn 5 95 mn and 6 03 mn were assigned elemental compositions of c30h17o9s2cl4 c30h16o9s2cl5 and c30h15o9s2cl6 respectively further confirming the above hypothesis figs s21 23 however the specific substituted positions of the chlorine atoms cannot be deduced by ms spectra the continued formation of higher polymers from the identified dimers and trimers or their degradation into smaller molecules is not clear based on the above results we can elucidate the chlorination reaction scheme of bps bps first reacted with fac to yield monochloro dichloro trichloro and tetrachloro bps in a stepwise manner moreover 2 4 6 trichlorophenol was also tentatively formed when the hypochlorite ion attacked the sulfur oxygen bond of bps which is based on previous studies on the chlorination reaction of bpa hu et al 2002 yamamoto and yasuhara 2002 over time the biphenyl ether dimers and trimers were generated by oxidative coupling reactions between different chlorinated bps derivatives and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol this proposed pathway is also not stoichiometric and other compounds may exist that were not detectable using our analytical procedure 3 2 reaction kinetics the chlorination kinetics of bpa the chemical predecessor of bps have been comprehensively explored in many studies gallard et al studied the initial pseudo first order kinetics under conditions with hocl 0 20 bpa 0 between ph 2 and 11 at room temperature gallard et al 2004 lane et al established a model for the initial chlorination between fac and bpa bpf and bisphenol a diglycidyl ether lane et al 2015 the kinetic constants of the initial chlorination between bps and fac were also investigated with control of the ph zheng et al 2016 the kinetic results can be well described by pseudo first order kinetics as demonstrated by the linear plots r2 0 93 the kinetic parameters of the pseudo first order reaction of bps at different ph values are described in table 3 the results indicated that the reaction rates increased by 7 fold with the increase in ph value from 6 5 to 8 5 implying the ph dependence of chlorination which is consistent with previous studies on the chlorination of bpa gallard et al 2004 lane et al 2015 phenols gallard and von gunten 2002 and resorcinols rebenne et al 1996 gallard et al demonstrated that the initial chlorination of bpa was ph dependent and that the main reactions occurred at ph values between 8 0 and 9 0 with the lowest reactivity at ph 5 0 the reaction order with respect to chlorine was examined at ph 7 0 by varying its concentration gallard et al 2004 the pseudo first order rate constant k obs is linearly correlated with the chlorine dose r2 0 93 implying that the chlorination reaction in this study is chlorine dependent and that the pseudo first order reaction rate constant is controlled by the chlorine concentration 3 3 pparγ activity assay we examined the activation of pparγ by chlorinated bps and byproduct mixtures of the chlorination reaction at different reaction times using the sensitive dual luciferase reporter assay as shown in fig s24 rosiglitazone showed the maximal activity of 14 7 1 4 on pparγ figures4and 5depict the pparγ activities of bps mono di tri and tetrachloro bps and byproduct mixtures at different reaction times the maximal activities of tri and tetrachloro bps on pparγ were 4 0 0 6 and 4 8 0 7 respectively compared with 1 3 0 2for bps fig 4 the mono and dichloro bps also showed maximal activities of approximately 2 4 and 2 8 fold respectively on pparγ in this study indicating that the pparγ effects were enhanced by an increase in number of substituted chlorine atoms as shown in fig 5 the chlorinated bps solutions at both 9 and 240 mn showed maximal activities on pparγ of approximately 2 3 fold and the maximal activity on pparγat540 mn was 1 7 fold although the compounds assayed in fig 5 were byproduct mixtures the process of sample preparation was the same as the reaction kinetic experiments at ph 7 and fig 3 shows the time course profiles for the elution of the main byproducts the pparγ activities of the byproducts were enhanced compared to that of the parent compound to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the pparγ effect of chlorinated bps byproducts the results are similar to our previous study on the chlorinated byproducts of bpf a structural analog of bps zheng et al 2016 previous in vitro and in vivo experiments suggested that pparγ is required for the differentiation of adipose tissue rosen et al 1999 a population study involving 643 sample subjects in jiangsu province china indicated that pparγ genes rs709158 rs1805192 and rs4684847 interacted with overweightness obesity to influence c reactive protein levels gu et al 2015 hogh et al implied that the overexpression of pparγ in the pancreatic beta cells exacerbated obesity induced glucose intolerance reduced beta cell mass and altered islet lipid metabolism in male mice hogh et al 2014 studies on bpa have shown that bpa and its metabolite bpa glucuronide bpa g can induce lipid accumulation and adipogenesis in murine 3t3l1 and primary human preadipocyte cell models atlas et al 2014 boucher et al 2014 2015 masuno et al 2002 an in vitro study investigating the potential effect of bps on lipid homeostasis found that bps at low concentrations induced an increase in the lipid content in 3t3l1 mouse preadipocytes and hepg2 human hepatoma cells along with a decrease in lipolysis helies toussaint et al 2014 bps exposure to primary human preadipocytes from female donors also induced adipogenesis through pparγ pathway mediation boucher et al 2016 an in vivo experiment indicated that bps showed obesogenicity in male mice offspring after perinatal exposure at low doses moral et al 2016 fig 6 shows the correlation between logkow estimated by epi suite software and pparγ activities the results suggest that the pparγ activities of chlorinated bps are highly associated with their logkow values similar studies on the pparγ activities of halogenated bpa have documented that the ranking of logkow of halogenated bpas is consistent with their agonistic activity toward the pparγ ligand binding domain lbd riu et al 2011 zhuang et al used an in silico molecular dynamics simulation to explore the distinct toxicity action and molecular recognition mechanism of different halogenated bpas toward pparγ zhuang et al 2014 the results revealed that increasing the degree of halogenationon the phenolic rings of bpa enhanced the surface electrostatic potentials and increased the shielding of the hormonally active phenolic oh thus it markedly decreased the electrostatic interactions favorable for agonistic activities toward pparγ different halogenation patterns also further altered the hydrogen bond interactions of bpa and induced conformational changes in the pparγ lbd specifically affecting the stabilization of helix h12 which is attributable to the different agonistic activities 4 conclusion our study demonstrated that bps could be transformed into the chlorinated derivatives monochloro dichloro trichloro tetrachloro bps and the biphenyl ether dimer and trimer byproducts via oxidative coupling reactions the reaction kinetics are controlled by ph and fac concentration and the reaction rate at ph 8 5 is 7 times that at ph 6 5 the chlorination byproducts of bisphenol s showed enhanced pparγ activities compared with bisphenol s indicating the potential risk of metabolic changes induced by drinking water containing chlorination byproducts of bisphenol s acknowledgments this study was supported by the capital health research and development

considerably degraded and partially mineralized 58 by uv ps pretreatment at a ps dose not exceeding 0 6 mm and a uv irradiation time within 120 min which was attributed to the generation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals the fluorescent compounds in nom were almost completely degraded 98 by the uv ps pretreatment at a ps dose of 0 4 mm except for tyrosine like proteins 80 moreover uv ps pretreatment decreased the ratio of macromolecular compounds and increased the hydrophilic fractions resulting in reduced nom adhesion to the membrane hence irreversible fouling by nom was significantly retarded 75 by the uv ps pretreatment due to reduction in nom and more importantly by preferential degradation of fluorescent macromolecular and hydrophobic compounds fouling control performance was considerably improved at increased ps doses and extended uv irradiation time graphical abstract image 1 keywords water treatment ultrafiltration membrane fouling natural organic matter ultraviolet persulfate 1 introduction in recent decades ultrafiltration uf has been extensively used in drinking water treatment compared to conventional treatment uf provides treated water with better quality complete removal of pathogens and particulate impurities can be achieved with an uf membrane which significantly improves the biological security of drinking water jacangelo et al 1997 however although the uf process is recognized as an advanced technology for producing high quality drinking water membrane fouling which leads to reduced membrane productivity and increased energy consumption remains as an obstacle in the long term operation of uf particularly in full scale waterworks peiris et al 2013 yu et al 2016 natural organic matter nom in surface water mainly composed of humic acids ha polysaccharides proteins and lipids has been identified as the most problematic membrane foulant and causes severe membrane fouling particularly irreversible fouling howe and clark 2002 lee et al 2004 therefore a variety of pretreatments are adopted prior to membrane filtration to retard membrane fouling organic foulants can be removed or transformed to a certain extent with pretreatment and uf membrane fouling is alleviated to some degree widely investigated pretreatments include coagulation adsorption bio filtration and peroxidation coagulation is generally considered one of the most successful pretreatments for fouling control because it can effectively remove the high molecular weight mw fraction in nom which is primarily responsible for irreversible membrane fouling carroll et al 2000 dong et al 2007 howe and clark 2006 huang et al 2009 however coagulation is ineffective in the removal of low mw and hydrophilic fractions in nom which may also contribute to membrane pore blocking wei et al 2016 adsorption pretreatment with powdered activated carbon pac or ion exchange resins can eliminate low mw organics and improve feed water quality but the high demand for adsorbents may offset the limited benefits associated with fouling mitigation obtained by adsorption kimura and oki 2017 metcalfe et al 2016 moreover the presence of absorbents sometimes aggravates rather than mitigates membrane fouling for example shao et al 2016 investigated a hybrid pac uf process for surface water treatment and found that pac and ha formed a combined fouling layer on the membrane surface resulting in a significant synergistic fouling effect in general both coagulation and adsorption pretreatment only succeed in transferring nom fractions from feed water to the solid phase and further treatment disposal of the solid waste is still required although coagulation remains the most popular method for minimizing membrane fouling pre oxidation attracts greater interests in recent years due to its capacity in removing nom particularly in the occurrence of emerging organic contaminants among the investigated oxidation methods ozonation has been most intensively investigated however residual ozone in feed water may be detrimental to the membrane material resulting in accelerated membrane aging franck lacaze et al 2009 in recent years an advanced oxidation process aop using activated peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps has attracted much attention for the degradation of micro pollutants such as pharmaceutical organic compounds kwon et al 2015 ling et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 pesticide residue liu et al 2012 algal toxins and odor compounds antoniou et al 2010 xie et al 2015 sulfate radicals so4 produced via activating pms or ps with uv and reducing ions have very high oxidation capacity e0 2 65 3 1 v and can degrade both nom and micro pollutants liu et al 2017 lou et al 2016 hence it is reasonable to assume that oxidation pretreatment with activated pms or ps would contribute to nom fouling control during surface water treatment using low pressure membrane filtration to our knowledge there are only two reports involving the control of membrane fouling by model foulants and nom with pms pre oxidation activated by ferrous ions fe ii fe ii pms pretreatment 15 μm was demonstrated to effectively alleviate fouling caused by humic acids and alginate but fouling caused by bovine serum albumin was aggravated except when applied at an increased pms dose 50 μm was applied cheng et al 2017a for surface water nom was effectively removed via dual mechanisms i e pre oxidation with sulfate radicals and coagulation with in situ formed fe iii resulting in substantial reductions in organic compounds particularly for macromolecular fractions and thus increased membrane permeability and fouling reversibility cheng et al 2017b despite great performance in fouling control the fe ii pms pretreatment may increase sludge due to precipitation of ferric flocs particularly for practical applications to address this issue an ultraviolet activated persulfate uv ps process is alternatively put forward for uf membrane fouling control in this work uv irradiation which is widely applied in disinfection for both drinking water and wastewater effluent is a relatively cleaner activation method for the generation of sulfate radicals compared to fe ii in addition the uv ps process proves to be effective in degrading a variety of emerging organic compounds such as sulfamethoxazole yang et al 2017 methyl paraben dhaka et al 2017 haloacetonitriles hou et al 2017 in terms of fouling control performance and the mechanisms involved the uv ps pretreatment has not yet been systematically investigated the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a combined process of uv ps and uf for surface water treatment to gain insight into the effects of uv ps pretreatment on membrane fouling the amounts and characteristics of nom before and after pretreatment were systematically compared using fluorescence spectra mw distribution and hydrophobicity hydrophilicity moreover filtration tests were performed using a continuous flow immersed uf system which could better simulate practical applications the fouled membranes were further analyzed with scanning electron microscopy sem and attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to gain more insight into mechanisms for nom fouling control via uv ps pretreatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents

fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to distinguish among certain classes of organic matter in raw and pretreated water in this study the fluorescence spectra of nom were obtained using a

fluorescence data using the domfluor toolbox in matlab according to stedmon and bro 2008 the detailed instruction was provided in the supplementary information the variance explained core consistency diagnostic as well as half split analysis were applied to determine suitable component number for the parafac modeling as elucidated in our previous work yu et al 2015b the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component generated from parafac model was used to estimate the relative concentration and the dilution factors were used to calculate the fmax values for diluted samples an uf fractionation method was applied to determine the molecular weight mw distribution of nom the water samples were driven under a constant pressure of 0 1 mpa to pass through the uf membranes with different mwcos so that nom was separated into fractions of 100 30 100 5 30 1 5 and 1 kda the fractionation experiments were performed in a parallel with identical samples fed for each membrane to reduce concentration polarization and prevent cake layer formation mixing was provided by a stirrer running at 250 rpm for each fraction a 100 ml water sample was fed into the stirred cell and 50 ml permeate was produced with the initial 10 ml discarded finally concentrations of doc in the feed and permeate were measured fractionation was performed in triplicate with errors less than 3 nom was fractionated by nonionic macro porous resins into a hydrophobic fraction hpo a transphilic fraction tpi and a hydrophilic fraction hpi the hpo and tpi fractions were strongly adsorbed onto the dax 8 resin and xad 4 resin respectively whereas the hpi fraction passed through both resins carroll et al 2000 dong et al 2007 before use resins were sequentially washed with 0 1 n naoh 0 1 n hcl methanol and milli q water until no additional organic compounds were detected in the rinsing effluent her et al 2008 specifically the ph of water samples was adjusted to 2 and successively pumped into the dax 8 and xad 4 resin columns the flow rate was set at 15 wet resin volumes per hour second concentrations of organics in the feed water and effluents from both dax 8 and xad 4 resin columns were measured finally ratios of the hpo tpi and hpi fractions were calculated to determine the interfacial adhesion force between nom and the pvdf membrane an atomic force microscope afm bruker santa barbara ca was used with sin cantilevers bruker np o10 ca usa spring constant 0 06 n m 1 the functionalized cantilever was immersed in a concentrated nom solution for 24 h to prepare the nom coated probe wang et al 2013 nom in surface water was initially concentrated using an ro system and subsequently desalinated by electrodialysis until conductivity was less than 100 μs cm 1 li et al 2014 the afm interaction force measurements were performed in a fluid cell using a closed inlet outlet loop under contact mode according to the method of miao et al 2014 a buffer solution 1 mm nahco3 ph 7 8 was employed as the testing solution for each membrane sample at least 16 locations were randomly chosen for force measurements and more than 10 force curves were obtained at each location the integrity of the colloidal probe was examined by sem before and after each measurement to ensure accuracy for sem observation fouled membrane fibers were fractured in liquid nitrogen and naturally dried under ambient conditions notably the foulant layer attached on the membrane surface was not destroyed samples were coated with approximately 20 å au pd layer using a precision etching coating system model 682 gatan ca usa finally the top surface and cross section of the fouled membrane samples were observed under sem quanta 200feg netherlands in addition a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spotlight 400 perkin elmer usa was used to characterize the major functional groups of organic matter on the new and fouled membrane surfaces at wavenumbers between 4000 and 600 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of uv ps on the nom removal fig 2 shows the performance of uv ps pretreatment in the removal of nom during surface water treatment as shown in fig 2 when uv irradiation was applied without ps uv254 removal was less than 7 at the initial time and increased to 35 at 120 min whereas no visible doc reduction was observed over the entire experimental duration the results suggest that uv irradiation can degrade nom by destroying unsaturated bonds and aromatic structures represented by uv254 but only slightly induced mineralization this finding is consistent with reports that uv irradiation alone failed to notably reduce the amount of microcystis extracellular organic matter after a contact time of 120 min wang et al 2016 for pretreatment using ps only uv254 removal was less than 15 at a reaction time of 120 min as shown in fig s1 in supplementary information for uv ps pretreatment the removal of uv254 and doc were substantial and increased with increasing ps doses for example final removal rates for uv254 were 38 54 61 77 and 91 at ps doses of 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 mm respectively doc removal at 120 min increased from 4 to 58 as the ps dose increased from 0 05 mm to 0 6 mm the results indicate that uv ps can considerably degrade and partially mineralize nom in surface water particularly at higher ps doses it is well known that uv ps is high in oxidation capacity so that one of its application is for measurement of total organic carbon uv ps was increasingly applied for removal of micro pollutants in water reclamation for non potable purpose matzek and carter 2016 it was demonstrated that an efom mineralization rate of 32 was achieved by uv ps oxidation at a ps dose of 0 2 mm kwon et al 2015 in contrast the removal of doc and uv254 increased in different trends with increasing ps doses specifically uv254 removal was notably increased in the initial reaction time within 30 min whereas more substantial increases in doc removal were observed in the next time period 30 120 min fig 3 shows the results of the linear fitting between nom removal at 120 min and ps doses a strong linear relationship was observed for both doc and uv254 with increasing ps doses the only difference is that increasing rates represented by the slope of the fitting curve were higher for uv254 than for doc this may be attributed to the selective oxidation of different types of organics by uv ps the radicals generated in the uv ps system tend to first degrade unsaturated nom fractions represented by uv254 which are much more reactive followed by the stubborn fractions cheng et al 2017b overall uv ps can degrade and partially mineralize the nom in surface water and performance in nom removal increases with ps dose fluorescence eem spectra for raw water and pre oxidized water were obtained to investigate the removal of fluorescent components in nom by the uv ps pretreatment the fluorescent eem spectra for raw water is shown in fig s2 in the supplementary information the parafac analysis was applied to quantitatively interpret the spectra and a four component model was determined to be the most suitable model the eem contour of the four fluorescent components is presented in fig 4 and the excitation ex and emission em wavelength pairs of the four components are summarized in table s2 in the supplementary information component 1 c1 and component 3 c3 which appear at the at ex em wavelength pairs of 240 320 nm 390 440 nm and 270 360 nm 480 nm are associated with microbially derived and terrestrially derived humic like substances respectively yu et al 2015a component 2 c2 ex em 225 300 nm 340 nm is attributed to tryptophan like proteins and component 4 c4 ex em 220 275 nm 300 nm is related to tyrosine like proteins shutova et al 2014 the results are consistent with the fluorescent components identified in nom from the same river in a previous work except for the additional detection of tyrosine like proteins shao et al 2014 this result is likely attributed to aggravated microbial pollution of the river which causes increased soluble microbial products yu et al 2015a for raw water c1 was found to be dominant over other components in terms of fluorescent intensity as shown in fig 4 revealing that raw water was mainly subjected to autochthonous nom contamination lee et al 2006 fig 5 shows variations in removal rates for fluorescent components by the uv ps pretreatment with increasing ps doses interestingly c2 was the most readily degraded component regardless of ps dose followed by c1 c3 and then c4 the result indicates that uv ps preferentially degraded tryptophan like proteins and then humic like substances chen et al 2017 investigated the evolution of mw and fluorescence of efom in the uv ps oxidation process and found preferential degradation of terrestrial organics over microbial compounds which is different from the results in this work a probable interpretation is that protein like components which are less hydrophobic and self agglomerate to a lesser extent are preferentially degraded by radicals in the solution in a study on the photocatalytic degradation of fluorescent components in efom completely different degradation orders were found in the presence and absence of catalysts because contact with the radicals was a limiting step for components with greater adsorption affinity phong and hur 2016 when ps was applied at lower doses 0 05 and 0 1 mm the removal of fluorescent components was quite inefficient and slowly increased with reaction time except for c2 in contrast most fluorescent components were degraded in the initial 30 min and the removal performance gradually reached a plateau in the following 90 min when ps was applied at higher doses 0 4 and 0 6 mm moreover differences in removal rates were diminished at higher ps doses the final removal rates for c1 c2 and c3 were more than 95 at a ps dose of 0 6 mm and c4 was also removed by nearly 80 it is known that humic like substances which are strongly hydrophobic tend to adhere to membrane surfaces and cause irreversible fouling via pore narrowing and blocking meng et al 2015 in addition protein like substances which are typical biopolymers can form a gel layer over the membrane surface resulting in decreased membrane permeability kimura and oki 2017 in a previous study of surface water treatment using uf protein like substances particularly c2 were demonstrated to closely correlate with irreversible fouling tian et al 2015 due to the effective degradation of humic like and protein like substances it is reasonable to anticipate that uv ps pretreatment can considerably retard membrane fouling during surface water treatment using uf 3 2 effect of uv ps pretreatment on uf membrane fouling in this work multi cycle uf experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of uv ps pretreatment on membrane fouling during surface water treatment using uf it should be noted that the tmp increase was strongly associated with accumulation of irreversible membrane fouling because periodical backwashing was employed to eliminate reversible fouling fig 6 shows tmp developments during the filtration of raw and pre oxidized water for raw water tmp rapidly increased in the initial 600 min and gradually reached a plateau with the final tmp of 75 kpa this is attributed to accumulation of colloids and nom on the membrane which form a thick cake layer resulting in reduced membrane permeability when uv irradiation alone was applied to pretreat the raw water tmp increase slowed to some extent with the final tmp reduced to 60 kpa because uv irradiation can degrade some hydrophobic nom into low mw fractions that can penetrate the membrane membrane fouling is retarded by the uv irradiation despite the absence of ps dobrović et al 2007 when uv ps was applied to pretreat raw water tmp increase during filtration was substantially retarded the final tmp was reduced to approximately 40 kpa at low ps doses 0 05 and 0 1 mm and was further reduced to less than 20 kpa at the maximum ps dose 0 4 mm in the presence of uv ps tmp mainly increased at the initial filtration time and did not continue to increase over the duration this result indicates that uv ps pretreatment is extraordinarily effective in the control of uf fouling by nom particularly at higher ps doses likely due to the significant removal of nom kimura and oki 2017 cheng et al 2017b investigated the hybrid process of fe ii pms pretreatment and uf for surface water treatment and verified superb performance for dissolved nom removal achieved resulting in substantially reduced membrane fouling according to crittenden et al 2012 irreversible resistance at the end of filtration was calculated as 7 13 1012 and 1 78 1012 m 1 for the raw water and pretreated water 0 40 mm ps respectively notably irreversible fouling was reduced by 75 by uv ps pretreatment whereas the doc removal rate was less than 30 hence aside from reductions in nom variations in nom characteristics may also play a significant role in the control of nom fouling via uv ps pretreatment effects of uv irradiation time on nom fouling control using uv ps pretreatment were also investigated fig 6 b shows tmp increase curves during filtration of pretreated water at a fixed ps dose 0 2 mm and varying uv irradiation time 0 120 min as uv irradiation time extended to 10 30 and 60 min the tmp increase during filtration was notably reduced with a finial tmp of 62 52 and 24 kpa respectively however with further extension of the uv irradiation time to 120 min the tmp increase was no longer substantially reduced with a finial tmp of 23 kpa the result indicates that uv irradiation time also plays an important role in alleviating nom fouling by uv ps the effects of uv irradiation time on fouling buildup at other ps doses were also investigated with results shown in fig s3 in the supplementary information generally the extended uv irradiation time was apparently beneficial reducing tmp increases at lower ps doses 0 05 0 1 mm but improvements in fouling alleviation were not further obtained at higher ps doses at a ps dose of 0 2 mm a short uv irradiation time of 30 min corresponding to a uv fluency of 2750 mj cm 2 was sufficient for uv ps pretreatment to yield substantial alleviation of nom fouling with a steady tmp less than 30 kpa overall the performance of uv ps pretreatment in nom fouling control depends on both ps dose and uv irradiation time which are directly related to the running cost of uv ps pretreatment thus optimization of uv conditions should be performed using response surface methodology with reference to both fouling and cost indexes based on the results obtained it is easy to note that the increased ps doses and extended uv irradiation are favorable to control nom fouling for surface water treatment using uf however operational cost of uv ps oxidation will substantially increase with high ps and uv doses hence investigations on technical and more importantly economic feasibility are still warrant prior to practical application of persulfate oxidation for water treatment 3 3 effects of uv ps oxidation on nom characteristics fig 7 a shows nom fractionation results for dax 8 and xad 4 resins for raw water the hpo tpi and hpi fractions accounted for 39 36 and 25 respectively of the total organics in nom uv ps pretreatment substantially reduced the hpo fractions to 18 and 17 at a ps dose of 0 2 and 0 4 mm respectively tpi fractions were also reduced when pre oxidation was applied but the reductions were not as apparent as in hpo fractions however the hpi fraction was substantially increased when nom was subjected to uv ps pretreatment resulting in increased ratios of 58 and 64 at ps doses of 0 2 and 0 4 mm respectively the results indicate that uv ps pretreatment can degrade the nom into much more hydrophilic fractions particularly at higher ps doses this was also demonstrated in a study on uv induced photocatalytic degradation of humic acids the hydrophobic fraction also considerably decreased forming hydrophilic intermediates liu et al 2008 the hydrophilic matter that causes pore narrowing and blocking is the large mw fraction of which the size can be reduced by uv ps oxidation howe and clark 2002 hence nom fouling was substantially retarded in the presence of uv ps pretreatment in this study despite of increased hydrophilic fractions fig 7 b presents size fractionation of nom in raw water and pre oxidized water for raw water nom was mainly distributed in the low mw 1 kda and medium mw 5 30 kda which accounted for 81 and 17 of total organics respectively the high mw 100 kda only took a very small percentage less than 3 the medium mw and high mw organics which are identified as biopolymers with high fouling potential can contribute to the development of a fouling layer despite their low absolute amounts howe and clark 2002 when uv ps pretreatment was applied low mw fractions increased to varying degrees accompanied by reductions in the medium mw and high mw fractions the ratio for the low mw fraction exceeded 92 when uv ps was applied at a ps dose of 0 4 mm thus except for partial nom mineralization high mw and medium mw compounds were degraded by uv ps pretreatment into small hydrophilic molecules unlike the hydrophilic fractions in raw biopolymers the produced small hydrophilic molecules are significantly smaller than the membrane pores and easily penetrate the uf membrane resulting in less organic retention after uv ps pretreatment and thus reduced tmp increase hence although the hydrophilic fractions in nom yamamura et al 2014 microbial products smp kimura et al 2009 and algal eom zhang et al 2013 are closely correlated to membrane fouling pre oxidation processes using ozone wei et al 2016 permanganate lin et al 2013 and chlorine yu et al 2014 which increase the ratio of hydrophilic fractions are demonstrated to retard rather than aggravate membrane fouling in this work the interacting forces between the pvdf membrane and nom in raw and treated water were also determined to evaluate the tendency for nom adhesion to membrane surfaces fig 8 shows the specific adhesion force which considers the radius of the colloidal probe the specific adhesion force for a nom membrane was 1 39 mnm 1 for raw water and generally fell to 1 09 0 37 and 0 84 0 27 mn m 1 with uv ps pretreatment applied at ps doses of 0 2 and 0 4 mm respectively the results indicate that uv ps pretreatment can reduce nom adhesion to membrane surface likely due to preferential degradation of the hpo fraction fig 7 a as a result membrane fouling by nom was substantially retarded by uv ps pretreatment as demonstrated in fig 6 however miao et al 2014 have reported that the hpi fraction in efom exhibited much stronger adhesion forces to the membrane surface than the hpo fraction the difference may be attributed to the mw of hpi fractions in this work the increased hpi organics which were converted from the hpo fractions by uv ps oxidation were low in mw and easily penetrated the uf membrane without adhering to the membrane surface overall uv ps pretreatment can decrease the adhesion force of the nom membrane interaction and thus retard irreversible fouling 3 4 characterization of fouled uf membranes topological sem images of new and fouled uf membranes were taken and shown in fig s4 in the supplementary information the surface of the new uf membrane was quite smooth and clean without deposits in contrast a compact dense cake layer was observed on the membrane surface after filtering both raw and pretreated water it should be noted that the water samples were directly fed into the uf system without being pre filtered and thus it is reasonable to observe a thin cake layer despite uv ps pretreatment fig 9 shows the cross sectional sem image of fouled membranes a thick fouling layer can be discerned on the uf membrane after filtering raw water when the uv ps pretreatment was applied 0 4 mm only a very thin fouling layer occurred on the membrane surface due to reductions in high mw and hydrophobic fractions less nom was retained and deposited on the membrane during filtration resulting in a much thinner fouling layer with uv ps pretreatment hyung et al 2000 the result further verifies the effect of uv ps pretreatment in retarding nom fouling fig 10 shows ftir spectra of a new uf membrane and fouled membranes after filtering raw and pre oxidized water the strong absorbance at 1401 cm 1 and 1173 cm 1 which can be attributed to the deformation vibration and stretch vibration respectively verified the presence of c f groups in the pvdf membrane chang et al 2016 after filtration of raw water strong absorbance peaks can be observed around 3284 2930 1644 1543 and 1050 cm 1 the broad band near 3284 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of hydrogen bonds o h and the weak signal at 2930 cm was due to c h stretching vibrations her et al 2008 the stretches at 1643 cm and 1050 cm were associated with the carboxylate group cooh revealing deposition of carbohydrate like compounds lee et al 2004 moreover the characteristic groups of amino compounds were also observed at 1543 cm 1 n h implying that protein like substances were retained in the fouling layer lee et al 2004 because the fluorescent eem spectra has demonstrated the presence of humic like and protein like components in the water it is reasonable to find protein like substances in the fouling layer when feed water was pretreated by uv ps the ftir spectrum of the fouled membrane was similar to that without pretreatment the characteristic peaks for humic like protein like and carbohydrate like compounds were observed at the same wave numbers but the peak intensities were decreased to some extent with pretreatment 4 conclusions in this study the effects of uv ps oxidation on uf membrane fouling by nom in surface water were investigated the following conclusions can be drawn 1 nom in surface water was substantially degraded by uv ps pretreatment with uv254 and doc decreases of 97 and 58 respectively within 120 min at a ps dose of 0 6 mm uv adsorbing fractions in nom were preferentially degraded 2 a four component model described the fluorescent eem spectra of nom well and the dominance of c3 over other components was verified in terms of fluorescent intensity uv ps pretreatment was most effective in removing tryptophan like proteins followed by microbially derived humic like substances 3 uv ps pretreatment significantly retarded irreversible uf membrane fouling 75 caused by nom the performance of fouling control considerably improved at increased ps doses and extended uv irradiation times 4 mechanisms for nom fouling control using uv ps pretreatment include the preferential removal of hydrophobic fractions and degradation of medium mw and high mw compounds into hydrophilic small molecules which were significantly smaller than the membrane pores acknowledgements this work

and hydroxyl radicals the fluorescent compounds in nom were almost completely degraded 98 by the uv ps pretreatment at a ps dose of 0 4 mm except for tyrosine like proteins 80 moreover uv ps pretreatment decreased the ratio of macromolecular compounds and increased the hydrophilic fractions resulting in reduced nom adhesion to the membrane hence irreversible fouling by nom was significantly retarded 75 by the uv ps pretreatment due to reduction in nom and more importantly by preferential degradation of fluorescent macromolecular and hydrophobic compounds fouling control performance was considerably improved at increased ps doses and extended uv irradiation time graphical abstract image 1 keywords water treatment ultrafiltration membrane fouling natural organic matter ultraviolet persulfate 1 introduction in recent decades ultrafiltration uf has been extensively used in drinking water treatment compared to conventional treatment uf provides treated water with better quality complete removal of pathogens and particulate impurities can be achieved with an uf membrane which significantly improves the biological security of drinking water jacangelo et al 1997 however although the uf process is recognized as an advanced technology for producing high quality drinking water membrane fouling which leads to reduced membrane productivity and increased energy consumption remains as an obstacle in the long term operation of uf particularly in full scale waterworks peiris et al 2013 yu et al 2016 natural organic matter nom in surface water mainly composed of humic acids ha polysaccharides proteins and lipids has been identified as the most problematic membrane foulant and causes severe membrane fouling particularly irreversible fouling howe and clark 2002 lee et al 2004 therefore a variety of pretreatments are adopted prior to membrane filtration to retard membrane fouling organic foulants can be removed or transformed to a certain extent with pretreatment and uf membrane fouling is alleviated to some degree widely investigated pretreatments include coagulation adsorption bio filtration and peroxidation coagulation is generally considered one of the most successful pretreatments for fouling control because it can effectively remove the high molecular weight mw fraction in nom which is primarily responsible for irreversible membrane fouling carroll et al 2000 dong et al 2007 howe and clark 2006 huang et al 2009 however coagulation is ineffective in the removal of low mw and hydrophilic fractions in nom which may also contribute to membrane pore blocking wei et al 2016 adsorption pretreatment with powdered activated carbon pac or ion exchange resins can eliminate low mw organics and improve feed water quality but the high demand for adsorbents may offset the limited benefits associated with fouling mitigation obtained by adsorption kimura and oki 2017 metcalfe et al 2016 moreover the presence of absorbents sometimes aggravates rather than mitigates membrane fouling for example shao et al 2016 investigated a hybrid pac uf process for surface water treatment and found that pac and ha formed a combined fouling layer on the membrane surface resulting in a significant synergistic fouling effect in general both coagulation and adsorption pretreatment only succeed in transferring nom fractions from feed water to the solid phase and further treatment disposal of the solid waste is still required although coagulation remains the most popular method for minimizing membrane fouling pre oxidation attracts greater interests in recent years due to its capacity in removing nom particularly in the occurrence of emerging organic contaminants among the investigated oxidation methods ozonation has been most intensively investigated however residual ozone in feed water may be detrimental to the membrane material resulting in accelerated membrane aging franck lacaze et al 2009 in recent years an advanced oxidation process aop using activated peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps has attracted much attention for the degradation of micro pollutants such as pharmaceutical organic compounds kwon et al 2015 ling et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 pesticide residue liu et al 2012 algal toxins and odor compounds antoniou et al 2010 xie et al 2015 sulfate radicals so4 produced via activating pms or ps with uv and reducing ions have very high oxidation capacity e0 2 65 3 1 v and can degrade both nom and micro pollutants liu et al 2017 lou et al 2016 hence it is reasonable to assume that oxidation pretreatment with activated pms or ps would contribute to nom fouling control during surface water treatment using low pressure membrane filtration to our knowledge there are only two reports involving the control of membrane fouling by model foulants and nom with pms pre oxidation activated by ferrous ions fe ii fe ii pms pretreatment 15 μm was demonstrated to effectively alleviate fouling caused by humic acids and alginate but fouling caused by bovine serum albumin was aggravated except when applied at an increased pms dose 50 μm was applied cheng et al 2017a for surface water nom was effectively removed via dual mechanisms i e pre oxidation with sulfate radicals and coagulation with in situ formed fe iii resulting in substantial reductions in organic compounds particularly for macromolecular fractions and thus increased membrane permeability and fouling reversibility cheng et al 2017b despite great performance in fouling control the fe ii pms pretreatment may increase sludge due to precipitation of ferric flocs particularly for practical applications to address this issue an ultraviolet activated persulfate uv ps process is alternatively put forward for uf membrane fouling control in this work uv irradiation which is widely applied in disinfection for both drinking water and wastewater effluent is a relatively cleaner activation method for the generation of sulfate radicals compared to fe ii in addition the uv ps process proves to be effective in degrading a variety of emerging organic compounds such as sulfamethoxazole yang et al 2017 methyl paraben dhaka et al 2017 haloacetonitriles hou et al 2017 in terms of fouling control performance and the mechanisms involved the uv ps pretreatment has not yet been systematically investigated the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a combined process of uv ps and uf for surface water treatment to gain insight into the effects of uv ps pretreatment on membrane fouling the amounts and characteristics of nom before and after pretreatment were systematically compared using fluorescence spectra mw distribution and hydrophobicity hydrophilicity moreover filtration tests were performed using a continuous flow immersed uf system which could better simulate practical applications the fouled membranes were further analyzed with scanning electron microscopy sem and attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to gain more insight into mechanisms for nom fouling control via uv ps pretreatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents

fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to distinguish among certain classes of organic matter in raw and pretreated water in this study the fluorescence spectra of nom were obtained using a

fluorescence data using the domfluor toolbox in matlab according to stedmon and bro 2008 the detailed instruction was provided in the supplementary information the variance explained core consistency diagnostic as well as half split analysis were applied to determine suitable component number for the parafac modeling as elucidated in our previous work yu et al 2015b the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of each component generated from parafac model was used to estimate the relative concentration and the dilution factors were used to calculate the fmax values for diluted samples an uf fractionation method was applied to determine the molecular weight mw distribution of nom the water samples were driven under a constant pressure of 0 1 mpa to pass through the uf membranes with different mwcos so that nom was separated into fractions of 100 30 100 5 30 1 5 and 1 kda the fractionation experiments were performed in a parallel with identical samples fed for each membrane to reduce concentration polarization and prevent cake layer formation mixing was provided by a stirrer running at 250 rpm for each fraction a 100 ml water sample was fed into the stirred cell and 50 ml permeate was produced with the initial 10 ml discarded finally concentrations of doc in the feed and permeate were measured fractionation was performed in triplicate with errors less than 3 nom was fractionated by nonionic macro porous resins into a hydrophobic fraction hpo a transphilic fraction tpi and a hydrophilic fraction hpi the hpo and tpi fractions were strongly adsorbed onto the dax 8 resin and xad 4 resin respectively whereas the hpi fraction passed through both resins carroll et al 2000 dong et al 2007 before use resins were sequentially washed with 0 1 n naoh 0 1 n hcl methanol and milli q water until no additional organic compounds were detected in the rinsing effluent her et al 2008 specifically the ph of water samples was adjusted to 2 and successively pumped into the dax 8 and xad 4 resin columns the flow rate was set at 15 wet resin volumes per hour second concentrations of organics in the feed water and effluents from both dax 8 and xad 4 resin columns were measured finally ratios of the hpo tpi and hpi fractions were calculated to determine the interfacial adhesion force between nom and the pvdf membrane an atomic force microscope afm bruker santa barbara ca was used with sin cantilevers bruker np o10 ca usa spring constant 0 06 n m 1 the functionalized cantilever was immersed in a concentrated nom solution for 24 h to prepare the nom coated probe wang et al 2013 nom in surface water was initially concentrated using an ro system and subsequently desalinated by electrodialysis until conductivity was less than 100 μs cm 1 li et al 2014 the afm interaction force measurements were performed in a fluid cell using a closed inlet outlet loop under contact mode according to the method of miao et al 2014 a buffer solution 1 mm nahco3 ph 7 8 was employed as the testing solution for each membrane sample at least 16 locations were randomly chosen for force measurements and more than 10 force curves were obtained at each location the integrity of the colloidal probe was examined by sem before and after each measurement to ensure accuracy for sem observation fouled membrane fibers were fractured in liquid nitrogen and naturally dried under ambient conditions notably the foulant layer attached on the membrane surface was not destroyed samples were coated with approximately 20 å au pd layer using a precision etching coating system model 682 gatan ca usa finally the top surface and cross section of the fouled membrane samples were observed under sem quanta 200feg netherlands in addition a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spotlight 400 perkin elmer usa was used to characterize the major functional groups of organic matter on the new and fouled membrane surfaces at wavenumbers between 4000 and 600 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of uv ps on the nom removal fig 2 shows the performance of uv ps pretreatment in the removal of nom during surface water treatment as shown in fig 2 when uv irradiation was applied without ps uv254 removal was less than 7 at the initial time and increased to 35 at 120 min whereas no visible doc reduction was observed over the entire experimental duration the results suggest that uv irradiation can degrade nom by destroying unsaturated bonds and aromatic structures represented by uv254 but only slightly induced mineralization this finding is consistent with reports that uv irradiation alone failed to notably reduce the amount of microcystis extracellular organic matter after a contact time of 120 min wang et al 2016 for pretreatment using ps only uv254 removal was less than 15 at a reaction time of 120 min as shown in fig s1 in supplementary information for uv ps pretreatment the removal of uv254 and doc were substantial and increased with increasing ps doses for example final removal rates for uv254 were 38 54 61 77 and 91 at ps doses of 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 mm respectively doc removal at 120 min increased from 4 to 58 as the ps dose increased from 0 05 mm to 0 6 mm the results indicate that uv ps can considerably degrade and partially mineralize nom in surface water particularly at higher ps doses it is well known that uv ps is high in oxidation capacity so that one of its application is for measurement of total organic carbon uv ps was increasingly applied for removal of micro pollutants in water reclamation for non potable purpose matzek and carter 2016 it was demonstrated that an efom mineralization rate of 32 was achieved by uv ps oxidation at a ps dose of 0 2 mm kwon et al 2015 in contrast the removal of doc and uv254 increased in different trends with increasing ps doses specifically uv254 removal was notably increased in the initial reaction time within 30 min whereas more substantial increases in doc removal were observed in the next time period 30 120 min fig 3 shows the results of the linear fitting between nom removal at 120 min and ps doses a strong linear relationship was observed for both doc and uv254 with increasing ps doses the only difference is that increasing rates represented by the slope of the fitting curve were higher for uv254 than for doc this may be attributed to the selective oxidation of different types of organics by uv ps the radicals generated in the uv ps system tend to first degrade unsaturated nom fractions represented by uv254 which are much more reactive followed by the stubborn fractions cheng et al 2017b overall uv ps can degrade and partially mineralize the nom in surface water and performance in nom removal increases with ps dose fluorescence eem spectra for raw water and pre oxidized water were obtained to investigate the removal of fluorescent components in nom by the uv ps pretreatment the fluorescent eem spectra for raw water is shown in fig s2 in the supplementary information the parafac analysis was applied to quantitatively interpret the spectra and a four component model was determined to be the most suitable model the eem contour of the four fluorescent components is presented in fig 4 and the excitation ex and emission em wavelength pairs of the four components are summarized in table s2 in the supplementary information component 1 c1 and component 3 c3 which appear at the at ex em wavelength pairs of 240 320 nm 390 440 nm and 270 360 nm 480 nm are associated with microbially derived and terrestrially derived humic like substances respectively yu et al 2015a component 2 c2 ex em 225 300 nm 340 nm is attributed to tryptophan like proteins and component 4 c4 ex em 220 275 nm 300 nm is related to tyrosine like proteins shutova et al 2014 the results are consistent with the fluorescent components identified in nom from the same river in a previous work except for the additional detection of tyrosine like proteins shao et al 2014 this result is likely attributed to aggravated microbial pollution of the river which causes increased soluble microbial products yu et al 2015a for raw water c1 was found to be dominant over other components in terms of fluorescent intensity as shown in fig 4 revealing that raw water was mainly subjected to autochthonous nom contamination lee et al 2006 fig 5 shows variations in removal rates for fluorescent components by the uv ps pretreatment with increasing ps doses interestingly c2 was the most readily degraded component regardless of ps dose followed by c1 c3 and then c4 the result indicates that uv ps preferentially degraded tryptophan like proteins and then humic like substances chen et al 2017 investigated the evolution of mw and fluorescence of efom in the uv ps oxidation process and found preferential degradation of terrestrial organics over microbial compounds which is different from the results in this work a probable interpretation is that protein like components which are less hydrophobic and self agglomerate to a lesser extent are preferentially degraded by radicals in the solution in a study on the photocatalytic degradation of fluorescent components in efom completely different degradation orders were found in the presence and absence of catalysts because contact with the radicals was a limiting step for components with greater adsorption affinity phong and hur 2016 when ps was applied at lower doses 0 05 and 0 1 mm the removal of fluorescent components was quite inefficient and slowly increased with reaction time except for c2 in contrast most fluorescent components were degraded in the initial 30 min and the removal performance gradually reached a plateau in the following 90 min when ps was applied at higher doses 0 4 and 0 6 mm moreover differences in removal rates were diminished at higher ps doses the final removal rates for c1 c2 and c3 were more than 95 at a ps dose of 0 6 mm and c4 was also removed by nearly 80 it is known that humic like substances which are strongly hydrophobic tend to adhere to membrane surfaces and cause irreversible fouling via pore narrowing and blocking meng et al 2015 in addition protein like substances which are typical biopolymers can form a gel layer over the membrane surface resulting in decreased membrane permeability kimura and oki 2017 in a previous study of surface water treatment using uf protein like substances particularly c2 were demonstrated to closely correlate with irreversible fouling tian et al 2015 due to the effective degradation of humic like and protein like substances it is reasonable to anticipate that uv ps pretreatment can considerably retard membrane fouling during surface water treatment using uf 3 2 effect of uv ps pretreatment on uf membrane fouling in this work multi cycle uf experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of uv ps pretreatment on membrane fouling during surface water treatment using uf it should be noted that the tmp increase was strongly associated with accumulation of irreversible membrane fouling because periodical backwashing was employed to eliminate reversible fouling fig 6 shows tmp developments during the filtration of raw and pre oxidized water for raw water tmp rapidly increased in the initial 600 min and gradually reached a plateau with the final tmp of 75 kpa this is attributed to accumulation of colloids and nom on the membrane which form a thick cake layer resulting in reduced membrane permeability when uv irradiation alone was applied to pretreat the raw water tmp increase slowed to some extent with the final tmp reduced to 60 kpa because uv irradiation can degrade some hydrophobic nom into low mw fractions that can penetrate the membrane membrane fouling is retarded by the uv irradiation despite the absence of ps dobrović et al 2007 when uv ps was applied to pretreat raw water tmp increase during filtration was substantially retarded the final tmp was reduced to approximately 40 kpa at low ps doses 0 05 and 0 1 mm and was further reduced to less than 20 kpa at the maximum ps dose 0 4 mm in the presence of uv ps tmp mainly increased at the initial filtration time and did not continue to increase over the duration this result indicates that uv ps pretreatment is extraordinarily effective in the control of uf fouling by nom particularly at higher ps doses likely due to the significant removal of nom kimura and oki 2017 cheng et al 2017b investigated the hybrid process of fe ii pms pretreatment and uf for surface water treatment and verified superb performance for dissolved nom removal achieved resulting in substantially reduced membrane fouling according to crittenden et al 2012 irreversible resistance at the end of filtration was calculated as 7 13 1012 and 1 78 1012 m 1 for the raw water and pretreated water 0 40 mm ps respectively notably irreversible fouling was reduced by 75 by uv ps pretreatment whereas the doc removal rate was less than 30 hence aside from reductions in nom variations in nom characteristics may also play a significant role in the control of nom fouling via uv ps pretreatment effects of uv irradiation time on nom fouling control using uv ps pretreatment were also investigated fig 6 b shows tmp increase curves during filtration of pretreated water at a fixed ps dose 0 2 mm and varying uv irradiation time 0 120 min as uv irradiation time extended to 10 30 and 60 min the tmp increase during filtration was notably reduced with a finial tmp of 62 52 and 24 kpa respectively however with further extension of the uv irradiation time to 120 min the tmp increase was no longer substantially reduced with a finial tmp of 23 kpa the result indicates that uv irradiation time also plays an important role in alleviating nom fouling by uv ps the effects of uv irradiation time on fouling buildup at other ps doses were also investigated with results shown in fig s3 in the supplementary information generally the extended uv irradiation time was apparently beneficial reducing tmp increases at lower ps doses 0 05 0 1 mm but improvements in fouling alleviation were not further obtained at higher ps doses at a ps dose of 0 2 mm a short uv irradiation time of 30 min corresponding to a uv fluency of 2750 mj cm 2 was sufficient for uv ps pretreatment to yield substantial alleviation of nom fouling with a steady tmp less than 30 kpa overall the performance of uv ps pretreatment in nom fouling control depends on both ps dose and uv irradiation time which are directly related to the running cost of uv ps pretreatment thus optimization of uv conditions should be performed using response surface methodology with reference to both fouling and cost indexes based on the results obtained it is easy to note that the increased ps doses and extended uv irradiation are favorable to control nom fouling for surface water treatment using uf however operational cost of uv ps oxidation will substantially increase with high ps and uv doses hence investigations on technical and more importantly economic feasibility are still warrant prior to practical application of persulfate oxidation for water treatment 3 3 effects of uv ps oxidation on nom characteristics fig 7 a shows nom fractionation results for dax 8 and xad 4 resins for raw water the hpo tpi and hpi fractions accounted for 39 36 and 25 respectively of the total organics in nom uv ps pretreatment substantially reduced the hpo fractions to 18 and 17 at a ps dose of 0 2 and 0 4 mm respectively tpi fractions were also reduced when pre oxidation was applied but the reductions were not as apparent as in hpo fractions however the hpi fraction was substantially increased when nom was subjected to uv ps pretreatment resulting in increased ratios of 58 and 64 at ps doses of 0 2 and 0 4 mm respectively the results indicate that uv ps pretreatment can degrade the nom into much more hydrophilic fractions particularly at higher ps doses this was also demonstrated in a study on uv induced photocatalytic degradation of humic acids the hydrophobic fraction also considerably decreased forming hydrophilic intermediates liu et al 2008 the hydrophilic matter that causes pore narrowing and blocking is the large mw fraction of which the size can be reduced by uv ps oxidation howe and clark 2002 hence nom fouling was substantially retarded in the presence of uv ps pretreatment in this study despite of increased hydrophilic fractions fig 7 b presents size fractionation of nom in raw water and pre oxidized water for raw water nom was mainly distributed in the low mw 1 kda and medium mw 5 30 kda which accounted for 81 and 17 of total organics respectively the high mw 100 kda only took a very small percentage less than 3 the medium mw and high mw organics which are identified as biopolymers with high fouling potential can contribute to the development of a fouling layer despite their low absolute amounts howe and clark 2002 when uv ps pretreatment was applied low mw fractions increased to varying degrees accompanied by reductions in the medium mw and high mw fractions the ratio for the low mw fraction exceeded 92 when uv ps was applied at a ps dose of 0 4 mm thus except for partial nom mineralization high mw and medium mw compounds were degraded by uv ps pretreatment into small hydrophilic molecules unlike the hydrophilic fractions in raw biopolymers the produced small hydrophilic molecules are significantly smaller than the membrane pores and easily penetrate the uf membrane resulting in less organic retention after uv ps pretreatment and thus reduced tmp increase hence although the hydrophilic fractions in nom yamamura et al 2014 microbial products smp kimura et al 2009 and algal eom zhang et al 2013 are closely correlated to membrane fouling pre oxidation processes using ozone wei et al 2016 permanganate lin et al 2013 and chlorine yu et al 2014 which increase the ratio of hydrophilic fractions are demonstrated to retard rather than aggravate membrane fouling in this work the interacting forces between the pvdf membrane and nom in raw and treated water were also determined to evaluate the tendency for nom adhesion to membrane surfaces fig 8 shows the specific adhesion force which considers the radius of the colloidal probe the specific adhesion force for a nom membrane was 1 39 mnm 1 for raw water and generally fell to 1 09 0 37 and 0 84 0 27 mn m 1 with uv ps pretreatment applied at ps doses of 0 2 and 0 4 mm respectively the results indicate that uv ps pretreatment can reduce nom adhesion to membrane surface likely due to preferential degradation of the hpo fraction fig 7 a as a result membrane fouling by nom was substantially retarded by uv ps pretreatment as demonstrated in fig 6 however miao et al 2014 have reported that the hpi fraction in efom exhibited much stronger adhesion forces to the membrane surface than the hpo fraction the difference may be attributed to the mw of hpi fractions in this work the increased hpi organics which were converted from the hpo fractions by uv ps oxidation were low in mw and easily penetrated the uf membrane without adhering to the membrane surface overall uv ps pretreatment can decrease the adhesion force of the nom membrane interaction and thus retard irreversible fouling 3 4 characterization of fouled uf membranes topological sem images of new and fouled uf membranes were taken and shown in fig s4 in the supplementary information the surface of the new uf membrane was quite smooth and clean without deposits in contrast a compact dense cake layer was observed on the membrane surface after filtering both raw and pretreated water it should be noted that the water samples were directly fed into the uf system without being pre filtered and thus it is reasonable to observe a thin cake layer despite uv ps pretreatment fig 9 shows the cross sectional sem image of fouled membranes a thick fouling layer can be discerned on the uf membrane after filtering raw water when the uv ps pretreatment was applied 0 4 mm only a very thin fouling layer occurred on the membrane surface due to reductions in high mw and hydrophobic fractions less nom was retained and deposited on the membrane during filtration resulting in a much thinner fouling layer with uv ps pretreatment hyung et al 2000 the result further verifies the effect of uv ps pretreatment in retarding nom fouling fig 10 shows ftir spectra of a new uf membrane and fouled membranes after filtering raw and pre oxidized water the strong absorbance at 1401 cm 1 and 1173 cm 1 which can be attributed to the deformation vibration and stretch vibration respectively verified the presence of c f groups in the pvdf membrane chang et al 2016 after filtration of raw water strong absorbance peaks can be observed around 3284 2930 1644 1543 and 1050 cm 1 the broad band near 3284 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of hydrogen bonds o h and the weak signal at 2930 cm was due to c h stretching vibrations her et al 2008 the stretches at 1643 cm and 1050 cm were associated with the carboxylate group cooh revealing deposition of carbohydrate like compounds lee et al 2004 moreover the characteristic groups of amino compounds were also observed at 1543 cm 1 n h implying that protein like substances were retained in the fouling layer lee et al 2004 because the fluorescent eem spectra has demonstrated the presence of humic like and protein like components in the water it is reasonable to find protein like substances in the fouling layer when feed water was pretreated by uv ps the ftir spectrum of the fouled membrane was similar to that without pretreatment the characteristic peaks for humic like protein like and carbohydrate like compounds were observed at the same wave numbers but the peak intensities were decreased to some extent with pretreatment 4 conclusions in this study the effects of uv ps oxidation on uf membrane fouling by nom in surface water were investigated the following conclusions can be drawn 1 nom in surface water was substantially degraded by uv ps pretreatment with uv254 and doc decreases of 97 and 58 respectively within 120 min at a ps dose of 0 6 mm uv adsorbing fractions in nom were preferentially degraded 2 a four component model described the fluorescent eem spectra of nom well and the dominance of c3 over other components was verified in terms of fluorescent intensity uv ps pretreatment was most effective in removing tryptophan like proteins followed by microbially derived humic like substances 3 uv ps pretreatment significantly retarded irreversible uf membrane fouling 75 caused by nom the performance of fouling control considerably improved at increased ps doses and extended uv irradiation times 4 mechanisms for nom fouling control using uv ps pretreatment include the preferential removal of hydrophobic fractions and degradation of medium mw and high mw compounds into hydrophilic small molecules which were significantly smaller than the membrane pores acknowledgements this work
