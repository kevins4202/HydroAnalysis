12470,applied voltage was introduced into the anaerobic system for improving the efficiency of sewage treatment and bioenergy production for better energy efficient applications it was necessary to have a good understanding of the effect of applied voltage which is different from the conductive materials in this study the effects of applied voltage at different positions were investigated considering the concentration gradients results showed that the maximum cod removal efficiency was 96 7 and the methane production rate was 0 434 0 018 m3 ch4 m3 day in the reactor with two pairs of electrodes the effect of the applied voltage on the organic matter conversion and methane production were dominant in the lower electrode the increased energy output could content the required electric energy and additional energy could be generated by chp the contribution of electrochemical direct action was lesser and the increase of applied voltage led to the enrichment of functional microbes in this system especially the hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated by methanocorpusculum graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial electrolysis methane recovery applied voltage microbial community analysis methanogens data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewage was considered as a pollutant in the traditional concept of sewage treatment but currently that insight has been altered and it has been optimistically perceived as a significant source for energy recovery this perception can help achieve sustainable development goals for resource recovery energy self sufficiency and carbon neutrality in sewage treatment process 1 sewage energy treatment could recycle more carbon sources and convert them into methane through anaerobic digestion to achieve energy recovery in the traditional anaerobic methanogenesis process most of the methane was produced by acetotrophic methanogens however acetotrophic methanogens grew slowly and were difficult to enrich resulting in slow methanogenesis introduction of electrodes into the anaerobic system was performed to constitute a coupled system of microbial electrolytic cell and anaerobic system mes ad which has also been known as electrical stimulation or electrocatalytic anaerobic system 2 3 it could upsurge the proportion of methanogenesis by hydrogenotrophic methanogens on the cathode and increase the conversion of volatile fatty acids into hydrogen gas numerous significant research studies have presented that the voltage addition has efficiently augmented the production of methane 4 8 it was generally believed that the increased methane production resulted from the direct electrochemical contribution namely the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode 9 10 nevertheless in the previous studies performed by our research team it has been reported that only a minor part of the electrons generated by oxidized organic matter streamed into the external circuit displaying a low coulomb efficiency 11 12 thus the contribution of direct electrochemical impacts on methanogenesis electrochemical contribution efficiency was negligible in addition the electrodes also served as carriers for microbial enrichment in the system microbial community on the electrode surface will have a competitive relationship due to limited space available on the electrodes 13 for example lower cathode potential improved the higher enrichment of dechlorinators desulfitobacterium dehalobacter fermentative bacteria norank f propionibacteriaceae dysgonomonas and methanogen methanosarcina on the cathode biofilm 14 applied voltage also had pronounced effects on planktonic microbial communities in addition to the microbes on the electrode biofilm where suspensions were enriched by electrochemically active bacteria and methanogens such as geobacter and methanobacterium 15 these actualities indicated another important role of applied voltage in microbial electrolysis assisted reactor was its enrichment of important functional microbes involved in methanogenic processes conversely the electrode material was conductive and some researches have ascertained that conductive material including carbon based materials e g carbon felt carbon cloth carbon nano tube active carbon granule biochar and graphite and metal based material e g nanoscale zero valent iron magnetite hematite stainless steel mesh copper mesh and nickel mesh were equally effective in enhancing methane generation 16 19 both the implementation of conductive carriers and the application of voltage to them could significantly improve the methanogenic efficiency in reactors as applied voltage has optimistic impacts on improving methane generation by inevitably enhancing the energy consumption electricity consumption but in the case of microbial electrolysis assisted systems where applied voltage is used contention arises whether the electricity consumed by this extra applied voltage could be compensated by the additional methane production to achieve energy self sufficiency in depth understanding and appropriate research have to be carried out to investigate the additional effects of applied voltage on the conductive reactor and find an efficient and energy saving regulation technique this present research study has focused on designing and operating electrode reactor and conductive carrier reactor with the same configuration and material at the same time promoting effects of applied voltage have been evaluated in terms of organic matter removal efficiency and methane recovery as the indexes simultaneously microbial sampling has been performed from the suspended solution electrode biofilms and carrier biofilms the microbial diversity microbial community structure composition and the differences of functional microbial community distribution at different locations were analyzed combined with the shared otu analysis the regulation effect of applied voltage on microbial community structure in the system was obtained 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor construction and operation four reactors with the identical structure fig 1 and different operation methods table s1 were employed the reactors were made of plexiglass and with an empty volume of about 600 ml as described in our previous research studies 11 12 the reactor comprised of inlet region reaction region outlet and gas collection region the reaction region was made up of the two detachable modules and each module housed a pair of electrodes or conductive carriers these electrodes or conductive carriers were made of the same materials placed at the same position and were distinguished by the applied voltage 0 8 v application each module consisted of carbon fiber brushes of 5 cm diameter and length which were 3 cm lower than the stacked nickel meshes 5 cm in diameter 12 the conductive carriers consisted of the same conductive material used for loading microbes and without applied voltage implementation whereas electrodes had carbon fiber brush as the anode and nickel meshes as the cathode the order from bottom to top was carbon fiber brush nickel meshes carbon fiber brush nickel meshes fig 1 r1 had two pairs of conductive carriers r2 had one pair of electrodes at the lower module and a pair of conductive carriers at the upper module r3 had the upper electrodes and lower conductive carriers r4 had two pairs of electrodes fig 1 reactors adopted an up flow type of operation with the inlet at the lower part of the reactor and the outlet at the upper portion the substrate was pumped into the reactor from the inlet pipe by a multi channel peristaltic pump bt100 1l longer pump for researching the various effects of applied voltage at the different positions each reactor was equipped with two sampling sites as presented in fig 1 the start up stage was divided into two phases with different feeding water pattern in phase i solution was fed as sequential batch with a cycle of 48 h the inoculated source was mixed with the solution into the reactor only during the first cycle after four cycles it was changed to continuous inflow mode during phase ii and the potential and current were monitored solution was pumped into the reactor at a certain flow rate which was calculated according to the hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h the solution was composed of sodium acetate 2000 mg l phosphate buffer solution pbs 50 mmol l and other nutrient solution 12 activated sludge about 3 g vss l 1 wenchang mwtp harbin china of 5 ml along with effluent of 10 ml from previous long term operation bioelectrochemical reactor 12 were added as inoculation source at the operational stage sodium acetate was replaced with the wheat beer of 25

pumped into the reactor the laboratory was maintained at room temperature 25 2 c throughout the experiment the required applied voltage of 0 8 v was provided by the dc power supply fdps 180 shanghai fudan tianxin science teaching instrument co ltd china 2 2 sample collection for chemical detection the effluent sample was filtered in a filter with pore size of 0 45 Î¼m tianjin jinteng experiment equipment co ltd china and was used for the determination of cod carbohydrates and ethanol the corresponding concentration of inflow and effluent were determined by fast digestion phenol sulfuric acid and gas chromatography methods respectively these concentration indices were used to calculate the removal efficiency expressed as re for the lower part the concentration of inflow was c in and the concentration of sample from site1 was c eff meanwhile the c eff of the lower part was c in of the upper part and the concentration of sample from site2 expressed the c eff of both the upper part and the whole reactor the produced biogas was collected in gas bags for gas chromatography agilent 7890 usa analysis every 24 h the biogas was used for the calculation of methane production rate mpr m3 ch4 m3 day and methane yield my m3 ch4 kg cod for electrochemical analysis the potential difference between the reference electrode and the anode was recorded to evaluate the start up and operation of the reactor a resistor of 10 Ï was connected in the external circuit and the potential of the resistance was recorded and converted into current according to ohm s law current was used to calculate the electric quantity q c coulombic efficiency ce and electrochemical contribution efficiency Î· e for determining whether the energy recovered by the reactor was higher than the energy consumption energy recovered and applied electricity were calculated as e ch 4 j 20 and e i j 2 3 sample collection for microbial analysis the solution was discharged from different positions in the reactor in order to avoid damages to the electrode biofilm while sample collection for microbial analysis after centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was discarded and remaining solids was analyzed as suspended solution after disposing the solution in the reactor it was disassembled and the electrodes were gently removed and pieces were cut with scissors and placed in a 50 ml centrifuge tube pbs was added to the level above the electrode material and the tubes were sufficiently shaken until no biofilm was visible on the electrode after which the empty material was removed the tubes

throughput sequencing and the selected primers were 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 data was analyzed on the platform of majorbio http www i sanger com including Î± diversity index relative abundance etc 3 results 3 1 effects of applied voltage on organic matter removal and methane recovery during the operational phase the change of cod removal efficiency in conductive carrier reactor r1 and electrode reactors r2 r3 and r4 were shown in fig 2a on the 14th day of the operation the cod removal efficiency of the reactor r4 with two pair of electrodes first reached stability initially followed by r2 and r3 without applied voltage the re of cod in r1 increased with time until the 24th day and reached less than 90 these results showed that the applied voltage was helpful for the reactor to reach a stable state rapidly no matter one pair or two pairs of electrodes reactor r4 had the highest re of 96 7 whereas the re of reactor r2 with lower electrodes 94 0 0 3 was higher than that of r3 91 1 0 4 indicating that the lower electrodes played a significant role in the cod removal process the cod removal at different positions in accordance to concentration gradient of the up flow reactor was displayed in table 1 the represented a voltage of 0 8 v applied to the module and represented the conductive carrier without applied voltage for the lower module the re of electrodes 81 7 and 82 9 was higher than that of conductive carriers 72 9 and 76 7 in the upper part the order of re and the contribution in proportion were r4 r2 r3 r1 this demonstrated that the electrode had higher re than the conductive carrier at the same position due to the applied voltage meanwhile since the reduced concentration along with the direction of water flow the cod removal efficiency of the upper part accounted for a less proportion in all reactors therefore the improvement by applied voltage in r3 was less than that in r2 the re of r3 was less than that of in r2 methane generation in each reactor during operational phase was portrayed in fig 2b the electrode reactors r2 r3 and r4 detected methane earlier than the conductive carrier reactor r1 indicating the fact that applied voltage might have accelerated the reactor to achieve a stable operating state with methanogenesis the slow proliferation rate of anaerobic microbes and insufficient biomass resulted in a long start up time of anaerobic reactor and methanogens could not directly utilize organic matter with more than two carbons for the reactor r1 without applied voltage acid producing bacteria were required to convert organic matter to hydrogen and acetic acid primarily resulting in a dawdling methanogenesis the reactor r4 with two pairs of electrodes achieved the highest mpr of 0 434 0 018 m3 ch4 m3 day which was 1 76 times than that of the conductive carrier reactor r1 0 247 0 015 m3 ch4 m3 day indicating that the applied voltage could accelerate the methane production with the lower electrodes r2 had a higher mpr than r3 with the upper electrodes the lower electrodes contacted the substrate preferentially and converted it into components that could be used by methanogens thereby increasing the methane production by calculation methane yield my of reactor r4 0 215 0 008 m3 ch4 kg cod was the highest which was 1 69 times than that of r1 0 127 0 006 m3 ch4 kg cod my in r2 and r3 were1 50 and 1 35 times than that of r1 respectively the maximum my obtained in the study was lower than the theoretical my 0 35 m3 ch4 kg cod which was similar with the general my 0 2 0 3 m3 ch4 kg cod of some recent anaerobic process studies reported in some literatures 21 22 in addition the operation mode in this current study was continuous flow with a high mpr which could produce high methane per unit volume and per unit time this will be significant in energy recovery processes and will effectively save capital construction costs 3 2 electrochemical and energy recovery analysis the current production in electrodes was monitored fig s1 and calculated as the electric quantity q presented in table 2 the current of r4 1 and r4 2 was the current of the lower and upper electrodes of reactor r4 respectively the current in descending order was r4 1 r2 r3 r4 2 due to the higher concentration of organic matter at the bottom level the number of electrons generated by oxidized organic matter from the lower electrodes was greater the average current of r4 1 10 60 ma was higher than that of the upper electrodes 6 23 ma in r4 and r4 1 produced higher current than r2 these outcomes explained that more electrons produced by r4 1 were transferred to the cathode for the upper electrodes the upper part of r3 had the higher influent cod than r4 2 table 1 more organic matter was used for producing more electrons thus resulting in higher current production of r3 than r4 2 in microbial electrochemical systems electrochemically active bacteria at the anode used organic matter to produce electrons and transferred electrons through external circuits electrons participated in methanogenesis at the cathode through many pathways the theoretical number of electrons produced by cod oxidation q cod and the theoretical number of electrons needed for methane production q ch 4 have been calculated and listed in table s2 q and q ch 4 were both higher than the q cod which resulted in low coulombic efficiency ce and electrochemical contribution efficiency Î· e table 2 the ce of r2 and the lower electrodes in r4 were 5 6 and 6 2 indicating that the percentage of electrons transferred through the external circuit was low most of the organic matter degradation was contributed by anaerobic bacteria and the direct electrochemical effect was not obvious in comparison the ce of r3 and the upper electrodes in r4 were higher as 22 6 and 26 0 respectively this specified that the direct electrochemical contribution of the upper electrodes was more comprehensible in organic matter degradation r4 had the highest Î· e 16 2 due to its two pairs of electrodes r2 had a slightly higher Î· e than r3 which indicated that the direct electrochemical contribution of the lower electrodes was more obvious in the process of methanogenesis for the reactors operating continuously and stably the energy output e ch 4 and the power consumption e i caused by the applied voltage were calculated as shown in table 2 reactor r1 was a conductive carrier reactor without applied voltage and e i therefore taking the e ch 4 of r1 as a reference the increased output energy under the effect of applied voltage was calculated and expressed as Î´ e ch 4 reactor r4 had the two pairs of electrodes and its external circuit provided maximum electric energy with the highest e ch 4 by calculation the Î´ e ch 4 in r2 r3 and r4 were 2417 0 j 1596 7 j and 3352 2 j respectively which were higher than the corresponding e i 654 3 j 533 9 j and 1162 5 j in conventional thermal power plants electricity was generated by burning methane and slightly more than half of the heat was lost as excess its thermal efficiency was about 35 40 while combined heat and power chp could be as high as 80 through comparison it was determined that the increased energy output by the effect of applied voltage could fulfill the required electric energy and comprehend the self sufficiency in this energy consumption process r2 had the greatest advantage when efficiency was calculated at 35 if chp was adopted all three reactors generated additional energy and r4 could generate most recovery energy these results proved the feasibility of the bioelectrochemical methanogenic reactor in this study 3 3 microbial community analysis on electrode and carrier biofilms the biofilms on the surface of electrodes and carriers were analyzed the name of corresponding samples was simplified table s3 the Î± diversity correlation index table s4 indicated that the samples in r1 had the higher diversity especially the nickel mesh carrier biofilm r1 mc1 and r1 mc2 r1 had a rich variety of microbes samples in r4 had the lower diversity especially the r4 a1 in r2 and r3 the number of otus in carrier samples r2 ma2 r2 mc2 and r3 ma1 r3 mc1 were greater than that in electrode samples r2 a1 r2 c1 and r3 a2 r3 c2 the results indicated that the microbial diversity of electrode biofilm was lower than that of carrier biofilm though they were made of the same material this suggested that applied voltage can reduce microbial diversity and induce the enrichment of dominant bacteria further the microbial community composition was analyzed to better understand the impact of applied voltage on the anodes and carbon brush carriers the distribution of some functional bacteria genera included fermentative and acid producing bacteria electrochemically active bacteria and methanogens was also indicated in fig 3 it was worth noting that unlike other microbial electrochemical systems large number of methanogens were enriched in the anodic biofilm and their relative abundance was significantly higher than that of the carbon brush carrier the main enriched methanogens were methanocorpusculum and the relative abundance of r4 a1 r4 a2 and r2 a1 were 62 2 53 6 and 61 2 respectively methanogens on the anode interacted directly with other functional microbes to promote methanogenesis in r2 and r4 but indirectly reducing the ce the main bacterial genera enriched on carbon brush carrier were enterococcus 16 9 30 4 norank f rikenellaceae 8 2 10 9 and macellibacteroides 2 1 8 9 macellibacteroides and enterococcus 23 metabolized carbohydrates to produce lactic acid and acetic acid on the anode biofilm r2 a1 r3 a2 r4 a1 and r4 a2 the norank f rikenellaceae 5 8 15 4 and enterococcus 4 2 17 7 showed higher abundance the enrichment degree of electrochemically active bacteria was negligent on the carbon brush carrier for the anode samples r3 a2 enriched the higher abundance of desulfovibrio 10 1 and geobacter 1 3 than r4 a1 r4 a2 and r2 a1 which resulted in the ce of r3 a2 31 4 higher than that of r4 a1 ce 6 1 r4 a2 ce 27 6 and r2 a1 ce 5 4 it could be validated that the applied voltage played the role of directional enrichment of anodic microbes and this effect was influenced by the electrode positions for example it promoted the enrichment of the methanocorpusculum on the anodes in r2 and r4 made r2 and r4 have higher methanogenic efficiency however for the upper electrode reactor r3 desulfovibrio and geobacter were promoted to enrich on the anode the enrichment of functional bacteria genera on the cathodes and nickel mesh carriers was publicized in fig 3 the relative abundance of electrochemically active bacteria was low in all samples it showed the abundance of fermentative and acid producing bacteria was low on the r4 c2 and r2 c1 but high on the r4 c1 and r3 c2 among them acetobacterium which mainly metabolize ethanol and lactic acid was highly enriched on r4 c1 and r3 c2 19 6 and 21 95 the main acetotrophic methanogens enriched in nickel mesh carrier was methanosarcina with higher abundance than the cathode the abundance of methanosarcina on r1 mc1 and r1 mc2 was 13 9 and 6 1 respectively while more methanocorpusculum 21 3 and 26 7 and methanobacterium 30 1 and 38 9 were augmented in r4 c2 and r2 c1 which enhanced the mpr and my of r2 and r4 than r1 it was obvious that the effect of the applied voltage on the cathode was directional enrichment of methanogens especially hydrogenotrophic methanogens which promoted the faster conversion of more organic matter into methane 3 4 regulating role of applied voltage on microbial community structure in fig 4a the upper carriers r1 ma2 and r1 mc2 had a more number of exclusive species but in a lesser abundance the shared bacterial genera in the core functional area mainly included enterococcus macellibacteroides norank f rikenellaceae and proteiniphilum followed by hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanocorpusculum and methanosarcina in addition it also included a minor amount of unclassified f comamonadaceae which was often detected in the mfc system as an anodic dominant bacterium with electrogene capacities 24 thereinto enterococcus had the largest abundance the species of bacteria in the core functional area were high which indicated that the microbial community structure of the carrier biofilm in the unpowered reactor was analogous to that of the suspension solution compared with the unpowered r1 the number of nodes in the core functional area of the shared otu network between the electrode surface and the suspended solution in r4 fig 4b were significantly reduced and the species abundance was increased as in r2 fig s2 and r3 fig s3 the main shared otu belonged to methanocorpusculum which possessed the ability of fermentation and acid production compared with r1 there were more exclusive nodes on the electrode surface and the species and abundance of enriched functional bacteria enriched at the same location were higher than those on the carrier surface indicating that the applied voltage played a vital role in directional enrichment of microbes for the anode r4 a1 had the exclusive otu belonging to sphaerochaeta and proteiniphilum r4 a2 enriched norank f rikenellaceae r4 c2 had the exclusive otu of methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and desulfovibrio furthermore it had some shared otu with other electrode and suspended solution r4 c2 had common methanosarcina and methanobacterium with r4 c1 and r4 a2 and lentimicrobium with r4 c1 and with suspended solution this proved that large number of methanogens were enriched on r4 c2 and there were certain similarities and connections between the electrodes in the same solution driven by applied voltage four kinds of methanogens had developed on r4 c2 including the acetotrophic methanogens methanosarcina and hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and methanocorpusculum the enrichment of methanogens with high diversity and high abundance might be the key reason for the promotion of methane production in reactor r4 compared with r1 the significant difference was that r1 enriched more enterococcus macellibacteroides unclassified f comamonadaceae and methanosarcina while additional methanocorpusculum acetobacterium and norank o clostridia ucg 014 were enriched in r4 fig 4c 4 discussion according to the microbial community composition the methane production process in the conductive carrier reactor and electrode reactor has been depicted in fig 5a and b the influent organic matter compounds like carbohydrates ethanol and amino acids produced acetic acid by the action of fermentative and acid producing bacteria which were enriched on the surface of electrodes or carriers and in the suspension solution acetic acid could be directly used for methanogenesis or through the action of electrochemically active bacteria to produce carbon dioxide and protons where the protons were further converted into hydrogen and utilized by methanogens methane was produced in several ways i the acetotrophic methanogens in suspension solution or on the surface of electrode and carrier used acetic acid to produce methane ii acetotropic methanogens and electrochemically active bacteria with the capacity of extracellular electron transport could reduce co2 to methane by direct interspecific electron transport theoretically 25 iii the hydrogenotrophic methanogens in suspension solution or on the surface of electrode and carrier may use h2 to produce methane iv the hydrogenotrophic methanogens enriched on the cathode produced methane by cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction or by receiving electrons directly from the cathode methane was produced through the first three pathways in the conductive carrier reactor however there were four ways of methanogenesis in electrode reactor compared with the traditional anaerobic methanogenesis system the conductive carrier and applied voltage had a certain selection effect on microbes especially the applied voltage the core functional flora containing fermentative and acid producing bacteria electrochemically active bacteria and methanogens were formed to increase the direct interspecific electron transport mode and the proportion of methanogens compared with the conductive carrier part of the electrons generated by the oxidation of organic matter on the electrode could be transferred to the cathode through the external circuit for the use by methanogens on the one hand the applied voltage had a promoting effect on the electrochemical methanogenesis in the case of equivalent material surface area and source the mpr and my of the electrode reactor were significantly higher than those of the conductive carrier reactor on the other hand the applied voltage promoted faster and more stable enrichment of the core functional flora which emphasized the electrode reactor to achieve speedier and stable treatment effects however the direct contribution of electrochemical effects on methanogenesis Î· e was low only 10 1 19 4 the more important role of applied voltage was to regulate the microbial community structure especially the diversity and content of methanogens in the core functional flora cathode enriched more hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated by methanocorpusculum and methanobacterium under the applied voltage while the conductive carriers consisted of the same materials enriched more acetotrophic methanogens different with other microbial electrochemical systems large number of methanogens were also enriched in the anodic biofilm especially the lower anode enriched more methanocorpusculum the relative abundance of methanogens in the electrode reactor was significantly higher than that in the conductive carrier reactor and the chief methanogen was hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanocorpusculum it indicated that applied voltage was the driving force behind the amelioration of methanogens dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens the enrichment of large number of hydrogenotrophic methanogens resulted in rapid exploitation of the hydrogen produced in the system to produce methane which also explained the reason why hydrogen was almost undetectable in the gas bag in addition hydrogenotrophic methanogens produced methane quicker and steadier than acetotrophic methanogens the regulation effect of applied voltage on microbes was greater than that of direct electrochemical contribution the effect of applied voltage was mainly in the start up process of the reactor and to make the reactor swiftly attain the stable treatment state the applied voltage enriched a large amount of hydrogenotrophic methanogens on the surface of both anode and cathode the number of electrons transferred by the external circuit was trivial and they could be produced and directly used on the anode and cathode at the same time the effect of applied voltage on anode and cathode had diminutive difference therefore when the dominant bacteria were enriched and the treatment efficiency was stable and efficient the reactor could be switched to the open circuit operation which achieved the purpose of energy saving on the other hand when the reactor is scaled up the electrode is also upgraded synchronously the contribution of direct electrochemical action will escalate resulting in effective microbial colonization on the electrode and a stronger electric field this electric field will be a driving force for enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and this will boost up the capability electrochemically active bacteria to produce electricity therefore the consequences of electric field should be considered in practical application 5 conclusions applied voltage was highly capable of promoting the conversion of organic matter into methane the maximum cod removal efficiency was 96 7 and methane production rate was 0 434 0 018 m3 ch4 m3 day by implementing two pairs of electrodes r2 one pair of lower electrodes and r4 two pairs of electrodes were suitable for conventional thermal power plants and chp respectively interestingly large number of methanogens were enriched on the anode compared with that the contribution of electrochemical direct action was insignificant most outstandingly applied voltage promoted faster and more stable enrichment of functional microbes thus enriching the hydrogenotrophic methanogens

pumped into the reactor the laboratory was maintained at room temperature 25 2 c throughout the experiment the required applied voltage of 0 8 v was provided by the dc power supply fdps 180 shanghai fudan tianxin science teaching instrument co ltd china 2 2 sample collection for chemical detection the effluent sample was filtered in a filter with pore size of 0 45 Î¼m tianjin jinteng experiment equipment co ltd china and was used for the determination of cod carbohydrates and ethanol the corresponding concentration of inflow and effluent were determined by fast digestion phenol sulfuric acid and gas chromatography methods respectively these concentration indices were used to calculate the removal efficiency expressed as re for the lower part the concentration of inflow was c in and the concentration of sample from site1 was c eff meanwhile the c eff of the lower part was c in of the upper part and the concentration of sample from site2 expressed the c eff of both the upper part and the whole reactor the produced biogas was collected in gas bags for gas chromatography agilent 7890 usa analysis every 24 h the biogas was used for the calculation of methane production rate mpr m3 ch4 m3 day and methane yield my m3 ch4 kg cod for electrochemical analysis the potential difference between the reference electrode and the anode was recorded to evaluate the start up and operation of

energy recovered and applied electricity were calculated as e ch 4 j 20 and e i j 2 3 sample collection for microbial analysis the solution was discharged from different positions in the reactor in order to avoid damages to the electrode biofilm while sample collection for microbial analysis after centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was discarded and remaining solids was analyzed as suspended solution after disposing the solution in the reactor it was disassembled and the electrodes were gently removed and pieces were cut with scissors and placed in a 50 ml centrifuge

diversity index relative abundance etc 3 results 3 1 effects of applied voltage on organic matter removal and methane recovery during the operational phase the change of cod removal efficiency in conductive carrier reactor r1 and electrode reactors r2 r3 and r4 were shown in fig 2a on the 14th day of the operation the cod removal efficiency of the reactor r4 with two pair of electrodes first reached stability initially followed by r2 and r3 without applied voltage the re of cod in r1 increased with time until the 24th day and reached less than 90 these results showed that the applied voltage was helpful for the reactor to reach a stable state rapidly no matter one pair or two pairs of electrodes reactor r4 had the highest re of 96 7 whereas the re of reactor r2 with lower electrodes 94 0 0 3 was higher than that of r3 91 1 0 4 indicating that the lower electrodes played a significant role in the cod removal process the cod removal at different positions in accordance to concentration gradient of the up flow reactor was displayed in table 1 the represented a voltage of 0 8 v applied to the module and represented the conductive carrier without applied voltage for the lower module the re of electrodes 81 7 and 82 9 was higher than that of conductive carriers 72 9 and 76 7 in the upper part the order of re and the contribution in proportion were r4 r2 r3 r1 this demonstrated that the electrode had higher re than the conductive carrier at the same position due to the applied voltage meanwhile since the reduced concentration along with the direction of water flow the cod removal efficiency of the upper part accounted for a less proportion in all reactors therefore the improvement by applied voltage in r3 was less than that in r2 the re of r3 was less than that of in r2 methane generation in each reactor during operational phase was portrayed in fig 2b the electrode reactors r2 r3 and r4 detected methane earlier than the conductive carrier reactor r1 indicating the fact that applied voltage might have accelerated the reactor to achieve a stable operating state with methanogenesis the slow proliferation rate of anaerobic microbes and insufficient biomass resulted in a long start up time of anaerobic reactor and methanogens could not directly utilize organic matter with more than two carbons for the reactor r1 without applied voltage acid producing bacteria were required to convert organic matter to hydrogen and acetic acid primarily resulting in a dawdling methanogenesis the reactor r4 with two pairs of electrodes achieved the highest mpr of 0 434 0 018 m3 ch4 m3 day which was 1 76 times than that of the conductive carrier reactor r1 0 247 0 015 m3 ch4 m3 day indicating that the applied voltage could accelerate the methane production with the lower electrodes r2 had a higher mpr than r3 with the upper electrodes the lower electrodes contacted the substrate preferentially and converted it into components that could be used by methanogens thereby increasing the methane production by calculation methane yield my of reactor r4 0 215 0 008 m3 ch4 kg cod was the highest which was 1 69 times than that of r1 0 127 0 006 m3 ch4 kg cod my in r2 and r3 were1 50 and 1 35 times than that of r1 respectively the maximum my obtained in the study was lower than the theoretical my 0 35 m3 ch4 kg cod which was similar with the general my 0 2 0 3 m3 ch4 kg cod of some recent anaerobic process studies reported in some literatures 21 22 in addition the operation mode in this current study was continuous flow with a high mpr which could produce high methane per unit volume and per unit time this will be significant in energy recovery processes and will effectively save capital construction costs 3 2 electrochemical and energy recovery analysis the current production in electrodes was monitored fig s1 and calculated as the electric quantity q presented in table 2 the current of r4 1 and r4 2 was the current of the lower and upper electrodes of reactor r4 respectively the current in descending order was r4 1 r2 r3 r4 2 due to the higher concentration of organic matter at the bottom level the number of electrons generated by oxidized organic matter from the lower electrodes was greater the average current of r4 1 10 60 ma was higher than that of the upper electrodes 6 23 ma in r4 and r4 1 produced higher current than r2 these outcomes explained that more electrons produced by r4 1 were transferred to the cathode for the upper electrodes the upper part of r3 had the higher influent cod than r4 2 table 1 more organic matter was used for producing more electrons thus resulting in higher current production of r3 than r4 2 in microbial electrochemical systems electrochemically active bacteria at the anode used organic matter to produce electrons and transferred electrons through external circuits electrons participated in methanogenesis at the cathode through many pathways the theoretical number of electrons produced by cod oxidation q cod and the theoretical number of electrons needed for methane production q ch 4 have been calculated and listed in table s2 q and q ch 4 were both higher than the q cod which resulted in low coulombic efficiency ce and electrochemical contribution efficiency Î· e table 2 the ce of r2 and the lower electrodes in r4 were 5 6 and 6 2 indicating that the percentage of electrons transferred through the external circuit was low most of the organic matter degradation was contributed by anaerobic bacteria and the direct electrochemical effect was not obvious in comparison the ce of r3 and the upper electrodes in r4 were higher as 22 6 and 26 0 respectively this specified that the direct electrochemical contribution of the upper electrodes was more comprehensible in organic matter degradation r4 had the highest Î· e 16 2 due to its two pairs of electrodes r2 had a slightly higher Î· e than r3 which indicated that the direct electrochemical contribution of the lower electrodes was more obvious in the process of methanogenesis for the reactors operating continuously and stably the energy output e ch 4 and the power consumption e i caused by the applied voltage were calculated as shown in table 2 reactor r1 was a conductive carrier reactor without applied voltage and e i therefore taking the e ch 4 of r1 as a reference the increased output energy under the effect of applied voltage was calculated and expressed as Î´ e ch 4 reactor r4 had the two pairs of electrodes and its external circuit provided maximum electric energy with the highest e ch 4 by calculation the Î´ e ch 4 in r2 r3 and r4 were 2417 0 j 1596 7 j and 3352 2 j respectively which were higher than the corresponding e i 654 3 j 533 9 j and 1162 5 j in conventional thermal power plants electricity was generated by burning methane and slightly more than half of the heat was lost as excess its thermal efficiency was about 35 40 while combined heat and power chp could be as high as 80 through comparison it was determined that the increased energy output by the effect of applied voltage could fulfill the required electric energy and comprehend the self sufficiency in this energy consumption process r2 had the greatest advantage when efficiency was calculated at 35 if chp was adopted all three reactors generated additional energy and r4 could generate most recovery energy these results proved the feasibility of the bioelectrochemical methanogenic reactor in this study 3 3 microbial community analysis on electrode and carrier biofilms the biofilms on the surface of electrodes and carriers were analyzed the name of corresponding samples was simplified table s3 the Î± diversity correlation index table s4 indicated that the samples in r1 had the higher diversity especially the nickel mesh carrier biofilm r1 mc1 and r1 mc2 r1 had a rich variety of microbes samples in r4 had the lower diversity especially the r4 a1 in r2 and r3 the number of otus in carrier samples r2 ma2 r2 mc2 and r3 ma1 r3 mc1 were greater than that in electrode samples r2 a1 r2 c1 and r3 a2 r3 c2 the results indicated that the microbial diversity of electrode biofilm was lower than that of carrier biofilm though they were made of the same material this suggested that applied voltage can reduce microbial diversity and induce the enrichment of dominant bacteria further the microbial community composition was analyzed to better understand the impact of applied voltage on the anodes and carbon brush carriers the distribution of some functional bacteria genera included fermentative and acid producing bacteria electrochemically active bacteria and methanogens was also indicated in fig 3 it was worth noting that unlike other microbial electrochemical systems large number of methanogens were enriched in the anodic biofilm and their relative abundance was significantly higher than that of the carbon brush carrier the main enriched methanogens were methanocorpusculum and the relative abundance of r4 a1 r4 a2 and r2 a1 were 62 2 53 6 and 61 2 respectively methanogens on the anode interacted directly with other functional microbes to promote methanogenesis in r2 and r4 but indirectly reducing the ce the main bacterial genera enriched on carbon brush carrier were enterococcus 16 9 30 4 norank f rikenellaceae 8 2 10 9 and macellibacteroides 2 1 8 9 macellibacteroides and enterococcus 23 metabolized carbohydrates to produce lactic acid and acetic acid on the anode biofilm r2 a1 r3 a2 r4 a1 and r4 a2 the norank f rikenellaceae 5 8 15 4 and enterococcus 4 2 17 7 showed higher abundance the enrichment degree of electrochemically active bacteria was negligent on the carbon brush carrier for the anode samples r3 a2 enriched the higher abundance of desulfovibrio 10 1 and geobacter 1 3 than r4 a1 r4 a2 and r2 a1 which resulted in the ce of r3 a2 31 4 higher than that of r4 a1 ce 6 1 r4 a2 ce 27 6 and r2 a1 ce 5 4 it could be validated that the applied voltage played the role of directional enrichment of anodic microbes and this effect was influenced by the electrode positions for example it promoted the enrichment of the methanocorpusculum on the anodes in r2 and r4 made r2 and r4 have higher methanogenic efficiency however for the upper electrode reactor r3 desulfovibrio and geobacter were promoted to enrich on the anode the enrichment of functional bacteria genera on the cathodes and nickel mesh carriers was publicized in fig 3 the relative abundance of electrochemically active bacteria was low in all samples it showed the abundance of fermentative and acid producing bacteria was low on the r4 c2 and r2 c1 but high on the r4 c1 and r3 c2 among them acetobacterium which mainly metabolize ethanol and lactic acid was highly enriched on r4 c1 and r3 c2 19 6 and 21 95 the main acetotrophic methanogens enriched in nickel mesh carrier was methanosarcina with higher abundance than the cathode the abundance of methanosarcina on r1 mc1 and r1 mc2 was 13 9 and 6 1 respectively while more methanocorpusculum 21 3 and 26 7 and methanobacterium 30 1 and 38 9 were augmented in r4 c2 and r2 c1 which enhanced the mpr and my of r2 and r4 than r1 it was obvious that the effect of the applied voltage on the cathode was directional enrichment of methanogens especially hydrogenotrophic methanogens which promoted the faster conversion of more organic matter into methane 3 4 regulating role of applied voltage on microbial community structure in fig 4a the upper carriers r1 ma2 and r1 mc2 had a more number of exclusive species but in a lesser abundance the shared bacterial genera in the core functional area mainly included enterococcus macellibacteroides norank f rikenellaceae and proteiniphilum followed by hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanocorpusculum and methanosarcina in addition it also included a minor amount of unclassified f comamonadaceae which was often detected in the mfc system as an anodic dominant bacterium with electrogene capacities 24 thereinto enterococcus had the largest abundance the species of bacteria in the core functional area were high which indicated that the microbial community structure of the carrier biofilm in the unpowered reactor was analogous to that of the suspension solution compared with the unpowered r1 the number of nodes in the core functional area of the shared otu network between the electrode surface and the suspended solution in r4 fig 4b were significantly reduced and the species abundance was increased as in r2 fig s2 and r3 fig s3 the main shared otu belonged to methanocorpusculum which possessed the ability of fermentation and acid production compared with r1 there were more exclusive nodes on the electrode surface and the species and abundance of enriched functional bacteria enriched at the same location were higher than those on the carrier surface indicating that the applied voltage played a vital role in directional enrichment of microbes for the anode r4 a1 had the exclusive otu belonging to sphaerochaeta and proteiniphilum r4 a2 enriched norank f rikenellaceae r4 c2 had the exclusive otu of methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and desulfovibrio furthermore it had some shared otu with other electrode and suspended solution r4 c2 had common methanosarcina and methanobacterium with r4 c1 and r4 a2 and lentimicrobium with r4 c1 and with suspended solution this proved that large number of methanogens were enriched on r4 c2 and there were certain similarities and connections between the electrodes in the same solution driven by applied voltage four kinds of methanogens had developed on r4 c2 including the acetotrophic methanogens methanosarcina and hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacterium methanobrevibacter and methanocorpusculum the enrichment of methanogens with high diversity and high abundance might be the key reason for the promotion of methane production in reactor r4 compared with r1 the significant difference was that r1 enriched more enterococcus macellibacteroides unclassified f comamonadaceae and methanosarcina while additional methanocorpusculum acetobacterium and norank o clostridia ucg 014 were enriched in r4 fig 4c 4 discussion according to the microbial community composition the methane production process in the conductive carrier reactor and electrode reactor has been depicted in fig 5a and b the influent organic matter compounds like carbohydrates ethanol and amino acids produced acetic acid by the action of fermentative and acid producing bacteria which were enriched on the surface of electrodes or carriers and in the suspension solution acetic acid could be directly used for methanogenesis or through the action of electrochemically active bacteria to produce carbon dioxide and protons where the protons were further converted into hydrogen and utilized by methanogens methane was produced in several ways i the acetotrophic methanogens in suspension solution or on the surface of electrode and carrier used acetic acid to produce methane ii acetotropic methanogens and electrochemically active bacteria with the capacity of extracellular electron transport could reduce co2 to methane by direct interspecific electron transport theoretically 25 iii the hydrogenotrophic methanogens in suspension solution or on the surface of electrode and carrier may use h2 to produce methane iv the hydrogenotrophic methanogens enriched on the cathode produced methane by cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction or by receiving electrons directly from the cathode methane was produced through the first three pathways in the conductive carrier reactor however there were four ways of methanogenesis in electrode reactor compared with the traditional anaerobic methanogenesis system the conductive carrier and applied voltage had a certain selection effect on microbes especially the applied voltage the core functional flora containing fermentative and acid producing bacteria electrochemically active bacteria and methanogens were formed to increase the direct interspecific electron transport mode and the proportion of methanogens compared with the conductive carrier part of the electrons generated by the oxidation of organic matter on the electrode could be transferred to the cathode through the external circuit for the use by methanogens on the one hand the applied voltage had a promoting effect on the electrochemical methanogenesis in the case of equivalent material surface area and source the mpr and my of the electrode reactor were significantly higher than those of the conductive carrier reactor on the other hand the applied voltage promoted faster and more stable enrichment of the core functional flora which emphasized the electrode reactor to achieve speedier and stable treatment effects however the direct contribution of electrochemical effects on methanogenesis Î· e was low only 10 1 19 4 the more important role of applied voltage was to regulate the microbial community structure especially the diversity and content of methanogens in the core functional flora cathode enriched more hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated by methanocorpusculum and methanobacterium under the applied voltage while the conductive carriers consisted of the same materials enriched more acetotrophic methanogens different with other microbial electrochemical systems large number of methanogens were also enriched in the anodic biofilm especially the lower anode enriched more methanocorpusculum the relative abundance of methanogens in the electrode reactor was significantly higher than that in the conductive carrier reactor and the chief methanogen was hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanocorpusculum it indicated that applied voltage was the driving force behind the amelioration of methanogens dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens the enrichment of large number of hydrogenotrophic methanogens resulted in rapid exploitation of the hydrogen produced in the system to produce methane which also explained the reason why hydrogen was almost undetectable in the gas bag in addition hydrogenotrophic methanogens produced methane quicker and steadier than acetotrophic methanogens the regulation effect of applied voltage on microbes was greater than that of direct electrochemical contribution the effect of applied voltage was mainly in the start up process of the reactor and to make the reactor swiftly attain the stable treatment state the applied voltage enriched a large amount of hydrogenotrophic methanogens on the surface of both anode and cathode the number of electrons transferred by the external circuit was trivial and they could be produced and directly used on the anode and cathode at the same time the effect of applied voltage on anode and cathode had diminutive difference therefore when the dominant bacteria were enriched and the treatment efficiency was stable and efficient the reactor could be switched to the open circuit operation which achieved the purpose of energy saving on the other hand when the reactor is scaled up the electrode is also upgraded synchronously the contribution of direct electrochemical action will escalate resulting in effective microbial colonization on the electrode and a stronger electric field this electric field will be a driving force for enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and this will boost up the capability electrochemically active bacteria to produce electricity therefore the consequences of electric field should be considered in practical application 5 conclusions applied voltage was highly capable of promoting the conversion of organic matter into methane the maximum cod removal efficiency was 96 7 and methane production rate was 0 434 0 018 m3 ch4 m3 day by implementing two pairs of electrodes r2 one pair of lower electrodes and r4 two pairs of electrodes were suitable for conventional thermal power plants and chp respectively interestingly large number of methanogens were enriched on the anode compared with that the contribution of electrochemical direct action was insignificant most outstandingly applied voltage promoted faster and more stable enrichment of functional microbes thus enriching the hydrogenotrophic methanogens

12471,despite the established evidence that the influent carbon nitrogen c n ratio affects nitrogen removal properties and nitrous oxide n2o emissions in the biological aerated filter baf n2o production is difficult to predict when influent c n ratios fluctuate widely for actual wastewater treatment systems in this study a simplified mathematical model was developed and applied to the baf system the operational parameters that influenced the effluent quality and n2o emissions were optimized by sensitivity analysis using an experimental dataset with c n ratio of 5 model parameters were developed for predicting n2o emissions subsequently the model was extended to predict n2o concentrations over a larger range i e c n 2 and 8 and comparisons were performed to verify its applicability results from this study indicated that y no 2 hb was the most sensitive stoichiometric coefficient for predicting n2o emissions sensitivity 15 5 and that the developed model could accurately predict nitrogen removal and n2o emissions over a c n ratio range of 2 to 8 in baf the proposed mathematical model could benefit the estimation of ghg emissions from full scale wastewater treatment plants and thereby contribute to improving the friendly operation of baf treatment facilities graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biological aerated filter nitrogen removal nitrous oxide mathematical model carbon nitrogen ratio data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction biological aerated filter baf has been extensively investigated in medium and small sized wastewater treatment industry in recent years 1 baf relies on microorganisms attached to the microfilter media to remove pollutants through bio metabolism physical filtration as well as food chain transference and accumulation 2 compared with activated sludge systems the unique structure provides baf with advantages such as compactness a small carbon footprint and a higher water quality effluent 3 with increasingly strict requirements of carbon mitigation and energy recovery in wastewater treatment processes production of nitrous oxide n2o as a potent greenhouse gas ghg has received a great deal of attention during baf treatment 4 with the rapid growth of computer science and related fields mathematical model has been widely used to explore nitrogen removal n2o emissions in wastewater treatments to illustrate ni et al 5 applied aquasim to simulate the coupling of the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob denitrification pathway and the hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation pathway to n2o production under different dissolved oxygen do and nitrite no2 n concentrations in membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr and calibrated the model based on two independent sets of experimental data further studies then identified boundary conditions of the model to describe n2o emissions processes of different pathways and established operational conditions for predicting the n2o emissions 6 mathematical model also helps in planning the applicability of n2o emissions by determining a clear relationship between biofilm property settings and predicted n2o production 7 despite these studies have indicated the prospect of predicting n2o emission by mathematical model in mabr reactor there are limited studies to examine the applicability of such model in the baf reactor in addition the water quality of influent in full scale wastewater plants wwtps is usually fluctuant and varies in carbon nitrogen c n ratio early studies considered that c n ratio of influent water affected n2o emissions from heterotrophic denitrification in biofilm reactors 8 10 low levels of the c n ratio resulted in increasing n2o emissions because of the lack of electron donors for denitrifiers and no2 n accumulation 11 12 the yield of nitrogen load to n2o decreased gradually with increasing c n ratio 8 it should be noted that an excessively high c n ratio can increase the competitive advantage of heterotrophic bacteria hb attached to microcarriers in biofilm systems thereby reducing the effects of nitrification and nitrogen removal 13 14 thus differences in effluent c n ratio have remarkable impacts on n2o emissions for biofilm system model traditional approaches should be considered alongside more biological processes and biofilm properties in order to accurately describe nitrogen removal and n2o emissions however few studies that examined the accuracy of modeling prediction under c n ratio conditions are available and it remains unknown whether the mathematical model about n2o emission could tolerate the fluctuation in c n ratio therefore this study operated the baf reactors and developed a nitrogen removal model for predicting n2o emissions the model was calibrated using a nonlinear fit on experimental data from operating conditions with an influent c n ratio of 5 and the process kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were estimated or fixed to further explore and expand the applicability of this model for n2o prediction the developed model was then validated by experimental results from different c n levels 2 and 8 respectively the aim of this study was to verify the feasibility of the proposed mathematical model to predict the n2o emission treating different c n ratio wastewater in baf 2 materials and methods 2 1 baf mathematical model for nitrogen removal and n2o emissions the optimized and refined model for nitrogen removal and n2o emissions from different c n levels was developed based on weighing the combined requirements of effluent quality and n2o production proposed in peng et al 6 and wanner et al 15 of these the interaction between aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and hb was directly referenced to the verified reaction sequence 16 moreover the biofilm structure was hypothesized to be a continuum in which the mass transfer rate including the substrate and do in this system was equal to the reaction rate in the biofilm it was assumed that the biofilm surface was smooth and that the biofilm density and the diffusion coefficient were constant across the surface the model included 14 components 9 soluble and 5 particulate components and 29 bioprocesses the membrane diffusion coefficients process kinetic rates and parameters were listed in supplementary information tables s1 s3 the process kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were adjusted from the reported values 17 18 other 10 parameters without accurate reference values table s2 were left as default values and then an initial burn in run was performed using the test data to obtain parameter estimates 2 2 baf configurations for parameter estimation and prediction the baf reactor was used as a plug flow reactor to emulate nitrogen removal processes within the biofilm into a holistic understanding of the nitrogen transformation mechanisms as shown in fig s1 the working volume of baf was about 44 l the do concentration was maintained at 4 mg l during the aeration period and the hydraulic retention time hrt was kept at approximately 6 h the synthetic wastewater that was pumped into the reactor was detailed in table s4 ceramsites with 30 50 mm particle diameters were selected as the support material for biofilm to measure the integrated effluent quality of the baf the effluent samples were collected from the middle of the reactor and the released n2o was captured at the top using an airbag detailed baf configuration procedures were described in our previous study 19 the changes in cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and n2o concentrations were intermittently measured during the long term operation of the baf reactor with an influent c n ratio of 5 fig s2 note however that while the concentration response curves are accumulated by slowly cycling processes this does not capture small changes such as the impact of no3 n on n2o production since the primary objective of this study is to predict n2o emissions more accurately the dataset from typical periods a whole cycle after 12 days running was used to calibrate model and estimate parameters to account for the accumulation of n2o in nitrification and denitrification thereby increasing the intended flexibility of this model moreover in view of the increasing interest in n2o prediction for full scale wwtps it is imperative to fill the upper and lower limits of modeling predictions integrating the fluctuations of the actual wastewater c n ratios we also validated the predictive ability of the new model using the validation set i e c n 2 and 8 to cover a broad range of conditions in full scale wwtps 12 20 to ensure comparability across samples these reactors run conditions were the same as above experiments except that the feed water c n ratios were different during this process the reactor effluent water quality and n2o concentration were measured every three days for duration of 18 days 2 3 baf model evaluation setting up and running the baf model was implemented in aquasim 2 0 108 parameters were set by following the guidelines of zare et al 21 and zacharia et al 22 table s2 based on the above assumptions the simulation output was implemented using default parameters and operating data with c n ratio of 5 fig s3 and there was a nonlinear error to simulate and predict water quality in particular the experimental measured n2o concentration at the endpoint was 0 45 g n m3 and the predicted value was 0 075 g n m3 indicating a strong skew in the predicted data additional investigations would have been necessary to exclude possible sources of error or deviation thereby confirming estimates for the kinetic rate constants therefore we first conducted sensitivity analyses on 5 key target parameters including cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and n2o and their results are discussed subsequently the parameter estimates were then obtained using the secant method embedded in aquasim 2 0 and the parameters with relatively large absolute values of uncertainty were selected for adjustment for the remaining parameters they were expected to result in negligible errors because of their minor influence on nitrogen removal finally the standard errors of individual parameter estimates were calculated from the root mean square error rmse to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed model 2 4 baf model application expansion to widen the application of the prognostic model we considered two different influent c n ratio setups of the model including pollutant removal curves for low and high c n ratios the model employed the same parameter values from the c n ratio condition of 5 to ensure that the model simulations depended only on an initial c n ratio level as the unique variable thereby not generating inter model differences in addition analysis of variance anova was performed to test for intragroup differences in target parameters the determined f test was applied for parameter combinations and degrees of freedom to further evaluate the statistical significance of the difference between experimental dataset and model predictions 2 5 other analytical methods wastewater characterization i e cod nh4 n no3 n and no2 n was analyzed in triplicate following the established standard methods 23 n2o concentrations in bioreactors were detected and quantified by gas chromatography 6890 agilent usa with a porpak q column and an electron capture detector ecd the temperatures of the injector column and detector were 100 50 and 300 c respectively high purity nitrogen gas 99 99 purity was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 40 ml min 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted using r http www r project org the fit of the global model was tested by f test and a value of p 0 05 was considered statistically significant in addition student s t test was used for measuring the differences between the experimental datasets all statistical tests were performed in a 2 sided manner 3 results 3 1 evaluation of model general performance a sensitivity analysis was performed on the operating data with a c n ratio of 5 to determine the influence of the assumed parameter values of the baf model on the target parameters in the nitrogen removal process due to the plethora of parameters only the sensitivity of the top 6 parameters that had the most influence on the target parameters was shown in fig 1 for cod concentration the sensitivity of other parameters increased slightly during the reaction period except for k sto maximum storage rate constant of x sto and Î¼ hb maximum growth rate of hb in particular k sto was the most sensitive parameter for cod with its absolute value increased to 75 66 over one period in addition the parameters that exert an influence on nh4 n were given in the order of sensitivity as follows Î¼ hb 12 660 i nbm nitrogen content of biomass 12 280 Î¼ aob amo maximum ammonia monooxygenase reaction rate of aob 4 828 i nss nitrogen content of s s 2 402 k sto 2 161 and b o 2 hb decay rate coefficient aerobic of hb 1 318 this results suggested that nh4 n was influenced more by hb growth Î¼ aob amo was the rate limiting step the most sensitive parameter for no3 n alteration while

level of 8 i e predicting the nitrogen removal ability under higher organic loadings the model predictions and the experimental results as shown in fig 4 the simulated results matched well with the experimental measurements which captured the trends of cod nh4 n no3 n and no2 n levels it was worth noting that the model predicted n2o concentrations did not match the experimental data after the 12th day of the validation experiment despite deviations from the intended trajectory none of all target parameters were found to be significantly different by anova as shown in table s6 p 0 05 supporting the systematic validity of the developed model for c n level fluctuation modeling 4 discussion 4 1 the proposed model could accurately predict n2o emissions in baf despite the fact that conventional models could evaluate nitrogen removal in most cases the prediction of n2o emissions in baf systems by the general model has been overlooked for a long time it was calculated that the wastewater treatment sector has contributed to approximately 8 of global anthropogenic n2o emissions 26 therefore the relationship between nitrogen removal and n2o production needs to be clarified by focusing on the model prediction process to improve the accuracy of baf model the one dimensional dynamic biofilm model developed by wanner and morgenroth 15 was implemented to simulate the growth and normal metabolism of microbes as a commonly used mathematical tool however the method assumes that the spatial gradient of biofilm substrates and microbial populations is perpendicular to the underlying substratum direction 27 this could potentially result in either an underestimation or overestimation of actual n2o emissions for this purpose we used the activated sludge system as a source of microbial kinetic parameters to calibrate the experimental datasets under biofilm conditions the results are specific to the nitrogen removal predictive ability for the developed model the kinetic parameters associated with n2o emissions determined by sensitivity analysis were shown in fig 1e the parameters that had a relatively great effect on n2o were mostly kinetic parameters for hb metabolism indicating that most denitrification processes were quite sensitive to n2o emissions 28 the sensitivity of parameters stimulating n2o production through heterotrophic denitrification increased as the reaction progressed it was worth noting that y no 2 hb was most sensitive to n2o emissions increasing its value by 15 5 when the assumed n2o emissions were increased by 100 this could be due to the fact that heterotrophic denitrification was the major pathway for n2o emission from the biofilm 6 changes in no3 n and no2 n could be evidence of causality as no significant accumulation of no2 n concentration occurred during the same period this was consistent with previously reported results that the contribution of n2o emissions from nitrification to total n2o was small at neutral ph and low no2 n levels 29 in addition this indicated that accounting for n2o emissions could provide better estimates and predict the production and consumption pathways of no3 n and no2 n in completely autotrophic nitrogen removal system 30 it was highly beneficial for accurately modeling the nitrogen removal pathway in wastewater treatment 4 2 the model has the scalability to apply to different c n ratio previous studies demonstrated that influent water quality especially the c n ratio had a strong impact on the nitrogen transformation process 9 to expand the scope of the correlation between c n ratio and effluent quality the predictions of this model were confirmed for different c n ratio conditions the results obtained with different c n ratios and nitrogen removal efficiencies were shown in figs 3 and 4 the simulation results indicated that cod reduction was insensitive to the c n ratio range in this model this was consistent with previous experimental observations in various studies using different carbon sources 31 33 however the lower cod removal efficiency was possibly related to the conversion of aob activity owing to the disadvantage in the competition for oxygen with hb i e lower oxygen affinity 34 jenni et al 35 also confirmed that the biological activity of aob increased with the increase of c n ratio in the feed solution therefore insufficient carbon sources inhibited the hb activity under low c n ratio conditions resulting in measured cod concentrations similar to the predicted factors the addition of organic matter can improve the nitrogen removal properties at normal c n levels 36 however most of the no3 n in the influent was consumed by microbial denitrification at a c n ratio of 2 indicating that aob dominated the biological process 37 meanwhile as denitrification consumption was considered in the model the experimental no2 n concentrations were lower than the predicted values 38 resulting in an prognostic apparent discrepancy p 0 05 as the ratio increased to 8 there was no evidence of no3 n or no2 n accumulation indicating that the reduced no3 n was undoubtedly consumed by denitrifiers the results were consistent with previous studies that a deficiency in carbon sources would limit denitrification processes resulting in a relatively high no3 n concentration in the effluent 39 in addition regardless of whether the condition was a c n ratio of 2 or 8 n2o production was always positively correlated with no2 n concentration 40 there was evidence that this was due to less intense competition for electron acceptors in the n2o reduction process than other processes leading to the n2o accumulation 41 however the deviation of n2o prediction was observed in the reactor with c n of 8 at the later running phases these differences could be explained by the short term instability of hb and aob in the wastewater treatment system early in the trials nitrogen removal in baf could be carried out properly by ammonification nitrification and denitrification 42 in late trials the constant aeration pressure and high c n ratio resulted in a greater competitive advantage for hb over aob 13 the inferior aob activity seriously hindered n2o reduction and led to n2o accumulation observed in the experimental study 43 despite the aforementioned deviations there was no statistically difference in the overall n2o concentration variations collectively the model captured all these trends demonstrating that the developed baf model can evaluate the relationship among target parameters at the c n ratio range of 2 to 8 4 3 the developed model could contribute to the estimation of ghg emissions from wwtps the c n ratio of influent fluctuates with environmental conditions e g weather and temperature in actual wwtps and thereby carbon source additions and aeration controls commonly utilize simple rules of thumb with increasingly more stringent discharge standards carbon emissions from wastewater treatment systems have also attracted researchers attention predictably there is an urgent need to develop more accurate and appropriate controls and thus improve ghg emissions 44 however n2o concentrations could not be monitored continuously for years at a time due to its high cost and discommodious sample processing on the contrary long term monitoring of cod and total nitrogen concentrations is necessary for wwtps to evaluate effluent quality therefore considering the trade off between the influent c n ratio range of actual wwtps and the operability of an appropriate model 12 20 the effects of three initial c n ratio sets on effluent quality and n2o emissions were investigated successively in this study statistical indicated that the proposed model could appropriately describe the nitrogen removal and n2o emissions in input c n range of 2 to 8 without affecting prediction accuracy in addition to reduce n2o emission while maintaining nitrogen removal performance the simulations strongly recommend regulating the mixture c n ratio by adding extra carbon source to induce denitrification at relatively low c n levels by weighing all indicators the control strategy with a c n ratio of 5 was found to be a compromise to avoid n2o emissions due to the inhibition of no2 n or nitric oxide reduction and also to ensure the total nitrogen removal via nitrite 16 18 for wastewater with high c n ratio the high organic matter would enhance competition between hb and aob thereby weakening the aob bioactivity from an operational perspective therefore it is necessary to increase the mixture recirculation appropriately which could ensure the do level and then improve nitrifiers based on the above mentioned the functional relationships between variables c n ratio and indicators n2o emissions in actual wastewater treatment systems are established using the proposed model and the nitrogen removal and n2o emission in wwtps could be reasonably predicted through monitoring daily thus providing feedback to control carbon source addition and recirculation flow rate these approaches can minimize ghg emissions while meeting the stable operation of wwtps on the other hand we acknowledge that there are possible limitations and weaknesses to the presented findings such as high c n levels causing the proposed model to underestimate n2o production in a long term continuous operation fig 4e in fact different from laboratory scale reactors many parameter calibrations could increase the general uncertainty of the model in the actual wwtps 45 therefore although a systematic c n regulation strategy for controlling n2o emissions was obtained in the operational settings of this work it still needs experimental validation in real wwtps these questions will be explored in depth in our following work but it is undeniable that the results of our derived could be used together with other established assessment tools to provide an order of magnitude rather than precise values contributing to the estimation of effluent quality and ghg emissions 6 7 5 conclusions in this work an appropriate simplified model was developed around nitrogen removal and n2o emissions processes in baf to enhance the applicability of the tool in addressing specific application scenarios sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation indicated that k sto Î¼ hb Î¼ aob amo y nob and y n 2 o hb were key sensitive to effluent quality i e cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and n2o respectively in particular y n 2 o hb was the most critical one to n2o emissions with a sensitivity of 15 5 the developed model successfully reproduced effluent quality and n2o emissions for c n ratios 2 and 8 results suggested that high scalability of the model can ensure its evaluation performance over general c n range of wwtps based on the proposed model wwtps can choose control strategies such as adding carbon sources or regulating recirculation flows according to systematic c n fluctuations in

12471,despite the established evidence that the influent carbon nitrogen c n ratio affects nitrogen removal properties and nitrous oxide n2o emissions in the biological aerated filter baf n2o production is difficult to predict when influent c n ratios fluctuate widely for actual wastewater treatment systems in this study a simplified mathematical model was developed and applied to the baf system the operational parameters that influenced the effluent quality and n2o emissions were optimized by sensitivity analysis using an experimental dataset with c n ratio of 5 model parameters were developed for predicting n2o emissions subsequently the model was extended to predict n2o concentrations over a larger range i e c n 2 and 8 and comparisons were performed to verify its applicability results from this study indicated that y no 2 hb was the most sensitive stoichiometric coefficient for predicting n2o emissions sensitivity 15 5 and that the developed model could accurately predict nitrogen removal and n2o emissions over a c n ratio range of 2 to 8 in baf the proposed mathematical model could benefit the estimation of ghg emissions from full scale wastewater treatment plants and thereby contribute to improving the friendly operation of baf treatment facilities graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biological aerated filter nitrogen removal nitrous oxide mathematical model carbon nitrogen ratio data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction biological aerated filter baf has been extensively investigated in medium and small sized wastewater treatment industry in recent years 1 baf relies on microorganisms attached to the microfilter media to remove pollutants through bio metabolism physical filtration as well as food chain transference and accumulation 2 compared with activated sludge systems the unique structure provides baf with advantages such as compactness a small carbon footprint and a higher water quality effluent 3 with increasingly strict requirements of carbon mitigation and energy recovery in wastewater treatment processes production of nitrous oxide n2o as a potent greenhouse gas ghg has received a great deal of attention during baf treatment 4 with the rapid growth of computer science and related fields mathematical model has been widely used to explore nitrogen removal n2o emissions in wastewater treatments to illustrate ni et al 5 applied aquasim to simulate the coupling of the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob denitrification pathway and the hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation pathway to n2o production under different dissolved oxygen do and nitrite no2 n concentrations in membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr and calibrated the model based on two independent sets of experimental data further studies then identified boundary conditions of the model to describe n2o emissions processes of different pathways and established operational conditions for predicting the n2o emissions 6 mathematical model also helps in planning the applicability of n2o emissions by determining a clear relationship between biofilm property settings and predicted n2o production 7 despite these studies have indicated the prospect of predicting n2o emission by mathematical model in mabr reactor there are limited studies to examine the applicability of such model in the baf reactor in addition the water quality of influent in full scale wastewater plants wwtps is usually fluctuant and varies in carbon nitrogen c n ratio early studies considered that c n ratio of influent water affected n2o emissions from heterotrophic denitrification in biofilm reactors 8 10 low levels of the c n ratio resulted in increasing n2o emissions because of the lack of electron donors for denitrifiers and no2 n accumulation 11 12 the yield of nitrogen load to n2o decreased gradually with increasing c n ratio 8 it should be noted that an excessively high c n ratio can increase the competitive advantage of heterotrophic bacteria hb attached to microcarriers in biofilm systems thereby reducing the effects of nitrification and nitrogen removal 13 14 thus differences in effluent c n ratio have remarkable impacts on n2o emissions for biofilm system model traditional approaches should be considered alongside more biological processes and biofilm properties in order to accurately describe nitrogen removal and n2o emissions however few studies that examined the accuracy of modeling prediction under c n ratio conditions are available and it remains unknown whether the mathematical model about n2o emission could tolerate the fluctuation in c n ratio therefore this study operated the baf reactors and developed a nitrogen removal model for predicting n2o emissions the model was calibrated using a nonlinear fit on experimental data from operating conditions with an influent c n ratio of 5 and the process kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were estimated or fixed to further explore and expand the applicability of this model for n2o prediction the developed model was then validated by experimental results from different c n levels 2 and 8 respectively the aim of this study was to verify the feasibility of the proposed mathematical model to predict the n2o emission treating different c n ratio wastewater in baf 2 materials and methods 2 1 baf mathematical model for nitrogen removal and n2o emissions the optimized and refined model for nitrogen removal and n2o emissions from different c n levels was developed based on weighing the combined requirements of effluent quality and n2o production proposed in peng et al 6 and wanner et al 15 of these the interaction between aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and hb was directly referenced to the verified reaction sequence 16 moreover the biofilm structure was hypothesized to be a continuum in which the mass transfer rate including the substrate and do in this system was equal to the reaction rate in the biofilm it was assumed that the biofilm surface was smooth and that the biofilm density and the diffusion coefficient were constant across the surface the model included 14 components 9 soluble and 5 particulate components and 29 bioprocesses the membrane diffusion coefficients process kinetic rates and parameters were listed in supplementary information tables s1 s3 the process kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were adjusted from the reported values 17 18 other 10 parameters without accurate reference values table s2 were left as default values and then an initial burn in run was performed using the test data to obtain parameter estimates 2 2 baf configurations for parameter estimation and prediction the baf reactor was used as a plug flow reactor to emulate nitrogen removal processes within the biofilm into a holistic understanding of the nitrogen transformation mechanisms as shown in fig s1 the working volume of baf was about 44 l the do concentration was maintained at 4 mg l during the aeration period and the hydraulic retention time hrt was kept at approximately 6 h the synthetic wastewater that was pumped into the reactor was detailed in table s4 ceramsites with 30 50 mm particle diameters were selected as the support material for biofilm to measure the integrated effluent quality of the baf the effluent samples were collected from the middle of the reactor and the released n2o was captured at the top using an airbag detailed baf configuration procedures were described in our previous study 19 the changes in cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and n2o concentrations were intermittently measured during the long term operation of the baf reactor with an influent c n ratio of 5 fig s2 note however that while the concentration response curves are accumulated by slowly cycling processes this does not capture small changes such as the impact of no3 n on n2o production since the primary objective of this study is to predict n2o emissions more accurately the dataset from typical periods a whole cycle after 12 days running was used to calibrate model and estimate parameters to account for the accumulation of n2o in nitrification and denitrification thereby increasing the intended flexibility of this model moreover in view of the increasing interest in n2o prediction for full scale wwtps it is imperative to fill the upper and lower limits of modeling predictions integrating the fluctuations of the actual wastewater c n ratios we also validated the predictive ability of the new model using the validation set i e c n 2 and 8 to cover a broad range of conditions in full scale wwtps 12 20 to ensure comparability across samples these reactors run conditions were the same as above experiments except that the feed water c n ratios were different during this process the reactor effluent water quality and n2o concentration were measured every three days for duration of 18 days 2 3 baf model evaluation setting up and running the baf model was implemented in aquasim 2 0 108 parameters were set by following the guidelines of zare et al 21 and zacharia et al 22 table s2 based on the above assumptions the simulation output was implemented using default parameters and operating data with c n ratio of 5 fig s3 and there was a nonlinear error to simulate and predict water quality in particular the experimental measured n2o concentration at the endpoint was 0 45 g n m3 and the predicted value was 0 075 g n m3 indicating a strong skew in the predicted data additional investigations would have been necessary to exclude possible sources of error or deviation thereby confirming estimates for the kinetic rate constants therefore we first conducted sensitivity analyses on 5 key target parameters including cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and n2o and their results are discussed subsequently the parameter estimates were then obtained using the secant method embedded in aquasim 2 0 and the parameters with relatively large absolute values of uncertainty were selected for adjustment for the remaining parameters they were expected to result in negligible errors because of their minor influence on nitrogen removal finally the standard errors of individual parameter estimates were calculated from the root mean square error rmse to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed model 2 4 baf model application expansion to widen the application of the prognostic model we considered two different influent c n ratio setups of the model including pollutant removal curves for low and high c n ratios the model employed the same parameter values from the c n ratio condition of 5 to ensure that the model simulations depended only on an initial c n ratio level as the unique variable thereby not generating inter model differences in addition analysis of variance anova was performed to test for intragroup differences in target parameters the determined f test was applied for parameter combinations and degrees of freedom to further evaluate the statistical significance of the difference between experimental dataset and model predictions 2 5 other analytical methods wastewater characterization i e cod nh4 n no3 n and no2 n was analyzed in triplicate following the established standard methods 23 n2o concentrations in bioreactors were detected and quantified by gas chromatography 6890 agilent usa with a porpak q column and an electron capture detector ecd the temperatures of the injector column and detector were 100 50 and 300 c respectively high purity nitrogen gas 99 99 purity was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 40 ml min 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted using r http www r project org the fit of the global model was tested by f test and a value of p 0 05 was considered statistically significant in addition student s t test was used for measuring the differences between the experimental datasets all statistical tests were performed in a 2 sided manner 3 results 3 1 evaluation of model general performance a sensitivity analysis was performed on the operating data with a c n ratio of 5 to determine the influence of the assumed parameter values of the baf model on the target parameters in the nitrogen removal process due to the plethora of parameters only the sensitivity of the top 6 parameters that had the most influence on the target parameters was shown in fig 1 for cod concentration the sensitivity of other parameters increased slightly during the reaction period except for k sto maximum storage rate constant of x sto and Î¼ hb maximum growth rate of hb in particular k sto was the most sensitive parameter for cod with its absolute value increased to 75 66 over one period in addition the parameters that exert an influence on nh4 n were given in the order of sensitivity as follows Î¼ hb 12 660 i nbm nitrogen content of biomass 12 280 Î¼ aob amo maximum ammonia monooxygenase reaction rate of aob 4 828 i nss nitrogen content of s s 2 402 k sto 2 161 and b o 2 hb decay rate coefficient aerobic of hb 1 318 this results suggested that nh4 n was influenced more by hb growth Î¼ aob amo was the rate limiting step the most sensitive parameter for no3 n alteration while other parameters barely changed indicating that the ammonia oxidizing process played a critical role in nitrogen removal the sensitivity of y nob yield coefficient for nob Î¼ nob maximum growth rate of nob and k no 2 aob s no 2 affinity constant for aob increased to 0 170 0 169 and 0 165 respectively at the end of typical period in other words the aerobic growth of nob had a great influence on the changes of no2 n it should be mentioned that the sensitivity of all parameters associated with n2o emissions showed positive or negative increasing trends with prolonged reaction time indicating that n2o emissions were generally sensitive to the kinetics parameters of hb the presence of some sensitive parameters had effects on multiple targets in the sensitivity analysis indicating that they were highly identifiable we focused on selecting the value that corresponded to each target parameter with the maximum absolute sensitivity parameter for adjustment the key parameters were estimated

decreased from 23 533 to 17 649 which was a 25 00 decrease 3 2 model predictions for nitrogen removal and n2o emissions the experimental data with an initial c n of 5 were again fitted to the predictions to assess the overall performance of the developed model fig 2 showed the close correlation between the predicted and measured values of cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and n2o concentrations at an

consistent with previous studies that a deficiency in carbon sources would limit denitrification processes resulting in a relatively high no3 n concentration in the effluent 39 in addition regardless of whether the condition was a c n ratio of 2 or 8 n2o production was always positively correlated with no2 n concentration 40 there was evidence that this was due to less intense competition for electron acceptors in the n2o reduction process than other processes leading to the n2o accumulation 41 however the deviation of n2o prediction was observed in the reactor with c n of 8 at the later running phases these differences could be explained by the short term instability of hb and aob in the wastewater treatment system early in the trials nitrogen removal in baf could be carried out properly by ammonification nitrification and denitrification 42 in late trials the constant aeration pressure and high c n ratio resulted in a greater competitive advantage for hb over aob 13 the inferior aob activity seriously hindered n2o reduction and led to n2o accumulation observed in the experimental study 43 despite the aforementioned deviations there was no statistically difference in the overall n2o concentration variations collectively the model captured all these trends demonstrating that the developed baf model can evaluate the relationship among target parameters at the c n ratio range of 2 to 8 4 3 the developed model could contribute to the estimation of ghg emissions from wwtps the c n ratio of influent fluctuates with environmental conditions e g weather and temperature in actual wwtps and thereby carbon source additions and aeration controls commonly utilize simple rules of thumb with increasingly more stringent discharge standards carbon emissions from wastewater treatment systems have also attracted researchers attention predictably there is an urgent need to develop more accurate and appropriate controls and thus improve ghg emissions 44 however n2o concentrations could not be monitored continuously for years at a time due to its high cost and discommodious sample processing on the contrary long term monitoring of cod and total nitrogen concentrations is necessary for wwtps to evaluate effluent quality therefore considering the trade off between the influent c n ratio range of actual wwtps and the operability of an appropriate model 12 20 the effects of three initial c n ratio sets on effluent quality and n2o emissions were investigated successively in this study statistical indicated that the proposed model could appropriately describe the nitrogen removal and n2o emissions in input c n range of 2 to 8 without affecting prediction accuracy in addition to reduce n2o emission while maintaining nitrogen removal performance the simulations strongly recommend regulating the mixture c n ratio by adding extra carbon source to induce denitrification at relatively low c n levels by weighing all indicators the control strategy with a c n ratio of 5 was found to be a compromise to avoid n2o emissions due to the inhibition of no2 n or nitric oxide reduction and also to ensure the total nitrogen removal via nitrite 16 18 for wastewater with high c n ratio the high organic matter would enhance competition between hb and aob thereby weakening the aob bioactivity from an operational perspective therefore it is necessary to increase the mixture recirculation appropriately which could ensure the do level and then improve nitrifiers based on the above mentioned the functional relationships between variables c n ratio and indicators n2o emissions in actual wastewater treatment systems are established using the proposed model and the nitrogen removal and n2o emission in wwtps could be reasonably predicted through monitoring daily thus providing feedback to control carbon source addition and recirculation flow rate these approaches can minimize ghg emissions while meeting the stable operation of wwtps on the other hand we acknowledge that there are possible limitations and weaknesses to the presented findings such as high c n levels causing the proposed model to underestimate n2o production in a long term continuous operation fig 4e in fact different from laboratory scale reactors many parameter calibrations could increase the general uncertainty of the model in the actual wwtps 45 therefore although a systematic c n regulation strategy for controlling n2o emissions was obtained in the operational settings of this work it still needs experimental validation in real wwtps these questions will be explored in depth in our following work but it is undeniable that the results of our derived could be used together with other established assessment tools to provide an order of magnitude rather than precise values contributing to the estimation of effluent quality and ghg emissions 6 7 5 conclusions in this work an appropriate simplified model was developed around nitrogen removal and n2o emissions processes in baf to enhance the applicability of the tool in addressing specific application scenarios sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation indicated that k sto Î¼ hb Î¼ aob amo y nob and y n 2 o hb were key sensitive to effluent quality i e cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n and n2o respectively in particular y n 2 o hb was the most critical one to n2o emissions with a sensitivity of 15 5 the developed model successfully reproduced effluent quality and n2o emissions for c n ratios 2 and 8 results suggested that high scalability of the model can ensure its evaluation performance over general c n range of wwtps based on the proposed model wwtps can choose control strategies such as adding carbon sources or regulating recirculation flows according to systematic c n fluctuations in this way the minimization of n2o emissions can be achieved without altering the plant layout and unit processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12472,although mil 101 fe has a homogeneous distribution of active metal sites the relatively low stability of its coordination bonds limits its potential for application especially in harsh environments here a novel lanthanum doped mil 101 fe nh2 mesoporous sio2 yolk shell lmfn ys material synthesized by green water etching has effectively improved the adsorption capacity and stability of mil 101 fe nh2 compared to traditional acid base etching methods water etching offered a more co friendly and cost effective approach to producing yolk shell structures due to the mesoporous protective shell of mesoporous sio2 and more exposed active sites the yolk shell materials showed a faster adsorption rate 30 min and a larger uptake capacity 240 0 mg p g than those of mil 101 the material also exhibited broad range of ph stability from 2 to 10 and displayed good cyclic regeneration ability with a removal efficiency of 75 9 after three cycles additionally it demonstrated excellent selectivity towards various coexisting anions such as cl no3 so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 at diverse ionic strengths ranging from 0 001 to 1 m the superior performance of l1mfn ys yolk shell materials of la fe 1 1 was attributed to a combination of factors including ligand exchange between la fe oh and phosphates lewis acid base interaction and electrostatic attraction additionally high phosphate removal performance was observed in the real petrochemical wastewater initial concentrations of 5 48 mg p g with a residual effluent concentration of 0 05 mg p l which was below the a level standard of phosphate effluent in china 0 5 mg l this work provides a green method for preparing yolk shell materials with improved ability to treat phosphate wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water etching metal organic framework yolk shell phosphate adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p a scarce and non renewable resource is imperative to biological growth as well as human life 1 2 however excessive p discharged into water is considered to be the reason of eutrophication outbreaks leading to wild growth of algal and disrupting the ecological balance thereby posing an immense menace to human health 3 up to now numerous processing technologies have been investigated for p recovery including biological treatment adsorption chemical precipitation and so on 4 5 in detail the precipitation biological aeration method was able to reduce phosphate concentrations in wastewater to 0 80 1 79 mg l 6 while the combination of electrocoagulation and biology was able to reduce phosphate concentrations in wastewater to 0 2 2 6 mg l 7 nevertheless the phosphate effluent concentrations of these technologies are above 0 2 mg l and do not meet the discharge standards 0 05 mg l in europe and 0 01 mg l in north america based on this idea it is still significant to prepare new efficient and inexpensive materials for the development of new treatment processes a large number of adsorbent materials have been investigated for phosphorus removal in the past decades among them originally developed by fÃ©rey team mil 101 fe material was used as an ideal adsorbent material to remove phosphate from water due to its strong affinity of unsaturated metal sites as well as the large specific surface area and high porosity 8 for example the group of li et al prepared magnetic mil 101 fe which reached equilibrium at 30 min with a maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of only 24 7 mg g 9 liu and his colleagues synthesized nh2 mil 101 fe for the recovery of p from aqueous with a maximum uptake capacity of 87 7 mg g within 120 min 3 the above examples indicate that bare mil 101 fe can be used alone for phosphate removal but its low adsorption capacity and long equilibrium time limit its widespread application in addition the poor structural stability is another important reason that limits the wide application of mil 101 fe specifically because metal ligand coordination bonds are weaker than covalent sio bonds mil 101 fe is less stable to temperature humidity and acid base than inorganic materials e g mesoporous silica and tends to collapse or even decompose under harsh conditions 10 to this end improving the adsorption capacity of mil 101 fe on phosphate and the structural stability of the single mil 101 fe in different environments are important issues to be addressed currently doping a simple and effective method is used to modify single metal organic framework mof materials to enhance their adsorption capacity for phosphate 11 lanthanum la an inexpensive and plentiful resource is deemed to be efficient in removing p from wastewater 12 also the low solubility of lanthanum phosphate pksp 26 15 enables complex formation even in trace level enhancing its removal efficiency at low concentrations 13 huang et al fabricated la doped mesoporous silica with a phosphorus adsorption capacity of 47 89 mg p g while undoped mesoporous silica hardly adsorbed phosphate 14 additionally the adsorption capacity of la doped zsm 5 prepared by pham et al for phosphate reached 106 20 mg g much higher than that of zsm 5 59 80 mg g 15 therefore the use of la doping to enhance the phosphate adsorption capacity is effective and feasible in order to improve the stability of mil 101 fe as well as to expose more accessible active sites and thus improve the adsorption capacity except for the synthesis of stable mof materials one of the most effective methods is to capsulate the mofs into the stable inorganic material shells 16 for instance tsai used sio2 encapsulated zif 67 core shell materials for the cycloaddition reaction of co2 and propylene oxide which improved the stability of zif 67 with a maximum conversion of 97 17 then taylor pashow et al employed sio2 coated fe mof to form a core shell structure to improve its stability for drug delivery 18 li et al reported zif 8 msio2 core shell material to enhance the stability of zif 8 19 despite the improved stability the core shell materials still have many defects firstly the active sites on the surface of the core can be blocked by the outer shell secondly for the core shell materials adsorption occurs in the pore channels which can affect the diffusion of substances and reduce the adsorption efficiency 20 compared with core shell nanomaterials the yolk shell structured materials can expose more active sites and the core shell voids can ensure adequate contact between active sites and phosphate furthermore the current reported mof sio2 yolk shell nanostructures were prepared by selective etching of core shell structures where the cyanide cationic surfactant or alkaline etchant used to etch the core or silica shell were toxic and environmentally unfriendly 21 24 therefore the development of a green method for fabricating yolk shell structure to improve the stability of mof and expose more active sites thereby improving the adsorption capacity has great potential for applications in different directions here we synthesize mesoporous sio2 encapsulated la doped mil 101 fe nh2 yolk shell nanocomposites via an environmentally friendly water etching method thus improving the stability and phosphate adsorption capacity of mil 101 fe moreover the special structure has numerous advantages for phosphate adsorption specifically the mesoporous shell provides an efficient pathway for adsorbent and phosphate transport the yolk shell structure protects the mil 101 fe core with active sites and improves its stability throughout the process in this paper firstly we prepared la mil 101 fe nh2 nanomaterials with three different la fe ratios named l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn to obtain the optimal ration and further synthesized core shell and yolk shell structures then we further explored the effect of external conditions on the removal phosphate by core shell and yolk shell adsorbents including oscillation time original concentration solution ph environment temperature coexisting anions ion strength and the application of practical phosphorus containing petrochemical wastewater etc finally the adsorption mechanisms were deeply discussed and analyzed by ftir spectrum xrd pattern and xps pattern 2 experimental 2 1 materials and reagents ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 wt lanthanum chloride hexahydrate lacl3 6h2o 99 9 wt and 2 amino terephthalic acid nh2 bdc 99 wt were supplied by shanghai aladdin chemical reagent tetraethyl silicate teos 98 wt ammonia solution nh3 h2o 28 wt and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab 99 wt were provided by shanghai macklin chemical reagent 2 2 preparation of mil 101 fe nh2 mfn and la mil 101 fe nh2 lmfn mfn was prepared based on previous research with slight modification 3 in short the solution a 0 225 g of nh2 bdc dispersed into 15 ml of dmf was mixed with the solution b 0 675 g of fecl3 6h2o dispersed into 15 ml of dmf then 1 2 ml of acetic acid was added and the solution was sonicated for 30 min and heated at 200 c for 20 h afterward the obtained brown sediment was washed three times with dmf and absolute ethanol finally the materials were dried at 80 c for 10 h in vacuum to mfm under the same procedure lmfn was prepared by dissolving both lacl3 6h2o and fecl3 6h2o in solution b here the three different molar ratios of la to fe were designed including 0 5 1 1 1 and 1 5 1 named l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn respectively the material with the best doping ration was then used to synthesized core shell and yolk shell structure 2 3 preparation of la mil 101 fe nh2 sio2 cs lmfn cs lmfn 0 1 g and ctab 1 25 were uniformly dispersed in 100 ml of deionized water and 20 ml of absolute ethanol after stirring for 60 min the solution was heated to 50 c 0 5 ml of nh3 h2o was added and the solution was continuously stirred for 6 h during this time it was worth noting that teos 1 ml and absolute ethanol 10 ml were formed into a mixed solution and 2 ml of the mixed solution was added every 1 h after centrifugation the obtained product was washed three times with absolute ethanol later the semi finished material was extracted and refluxed three times with absolute ethanol and nh4no3 solution at 80 c 25 the solid liquid was separated by suction filtration and dried at 80 c overnight 2 4 preparation of la mil 101 fe nh2 sio2 ys lmfn ys lmfn ys was synthesized by a green water etching method 26 specifically lmfn ys was obtained by placing lmfn cs at 2 mg ml in deionized water by simple water etching usually the autoclave containing 10 ml of the suspension was reacted at 100 c for 24 h the resulting product was centrifuged and washed several times with dmf and absolute ethanol to obtain final material lmfn ys 2 5 batch uptake experiments to obtain the optimal la doping ration the adsorption properties of p were investigated by a series of mfn l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn the differences in p removal at dosages of lmfn cs and lmfn ys were explored in the range of 10 100 mg the calculation formula for adsorption capacity eq s1 was displayed in the supplementary materials the collected samples were filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m membrane for the analysis of phosphate concentration which was determined spectrophotometrically at the detecting wavelength of 700 nm on a uv vis spectrophotometer based on the molybdenum blue method 27 for the kinetics studies of lmfn cs and lmfn ys 50 mg of the prepared materials were uniformly dispersed in 80 ml of 150 mg p l p solution and sampled at various time intervals 0 300 min in isotherm experiment 50 mg of lmfn cs and lmfn ys were charged into 80 ml conical flask with initial p concentrations ranging from 10 to 250 mg p l to explore the influence of external temperature on p removal thermodynamic experiments were carried out by adding 0 05 g of adsorbents to 80 ml of 150 mg p l phosphorus solution at different temperatures 30 40 and 50 c the effect of ph 2 11 on p adsorption was investigated by adjusting the initial ph by 0 1 m hcl and naoh nacl na2co3 nahco3 nano3 and na2so4 were used to evaluate the effect of coexisting anions and four concentrations 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 1 m were set respectively to explore the effect of ionic strength to enhance the practical application ability of the prepared adsorbents we also explored the regeneration ability of the materials in detail the used adsorbents lmfn ys p were soaked in 1 nacl solution and reacted at room temperature for 24 h then the obtained adsorbent materials were re used for p adsorption experiments under the same experimental conditions to further verify the practical application capability of l1mfn ys the petrochemical wastewater was used as an actual water sample for experiments the detailed parameters of the petrochemical wastewater are listed in table 4 of the si briefly 20 ml of petrochemical wastewater was thoroughly mixed with different adsorbent dosages 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 and 1 g l for sufficient time the water after the reaction was passed through a 0 22 Î¼m filter membrane before detection 2 6 analytical techniques all analytical techniques applied in this work are appeared in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the xrd patterns of synthesized materials in the range of 5 60 are displayed in fig 1 mfn l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn located at 2Î¸ 8 97 9 7 16 19 6 21 3 and 33 retained the chemical structure of mil 101 fe nh2 fig 1a which was consistent with previous literatures 28 29 the diffraction peak intensities at 2Î¸ 8 97 and 9 7 gradually weakened or even disappeared with the increase of la doping amount fig 1a which was ascribed to the destruction of the original mof structure by the introduction of excess la interestingly the diffraction peaks of l1mfn matched poorly with standard cards of la2o3 pdf 40 1279 and lao pdf 33 0716 fig s1 which proved that la did not exist as an oxide therefore according to the xrd a deduction could be obtained that the doping of la changes the structure of mil 101 and forms la mof after mesoporous sio2 encapsulation although the peak intensity of l1mfn ys become weaker the main characteristic peaks of mfn are basically remained indicating that the prepared materials are stable this phenomenon may be that the encapsulated mesoporous sio2 shell could prevent the x ray penetration to some extent and mask the original mof characteristic peaks in addition to the excess la doping furthermore a new sio2 characteristic peak appeared at 2Î¸ 22 1 fig 1b which was in keeping with huang s group 10 fig 2 exhibited the morphology of the synthetic materials the severe agglomeration of mfn in fig 2a was caused by the expansion of reagent dosing during synthesis 30 it was evident that mfn with a particle size of about 2 Î¼m possessed a well defined octahedral structure l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn fig 2b d presented non smooth spheres with many pores which were conducive to full contact with adsorption sites inside the adsorbent 31 with the increase of la loading although the lmfn crystal size became larger the morphology changed little this reason may be that the growth of mfn was inhibited by excessive la doping resulting in a larger crystal size after sio2 coating in addition to the larger particle the surface of l1mfn cs fig 2e and l1mfn ys fig 2f became more rounder and smoother furthermore eds elemental mapping of l1mfn fig 2g and l1mfn ys fig 2h owned la fe o n and la fe o n si respectively indicating that the materials were successfully synthesized the single tem morphology of the as prepared materials is exhibited in fig 3 the l1mfn edge in fig 3a b exhibited a spherical structure with wrinkled edges indicating a porous material it was evident that l1mfn was triumphantly encapsulated uniformly by a sio2 shell with a thickness of about 110 nm fig 3c d showing a core shell structure notably after water etching an apparent yolk shell structure with more apparent mesopores in sio2 shell was observed and the void between l1mfn and sio2 was about 49 28 nm fig 3e furthermore the hrtem image of l1mfn ys could observe that the lattice fringe space 0 31 nm of the outermost layer was in line with the 111 crystal plane of si and showed delamination phenomenon fig 3g which further confirmed the successful preparation of the yolk shell structure 32 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of mfn l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn in the pressure range of 0 1 were all type ii isotherms fig s2a to d which indicated that the prepared materials owned a mesoporous structure and were favorable for the adsorption furthermore after sio2 encapsulating l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys exhibited type iv and type ii adsorption isotherms respectively with obvious hysteresis loops manifesting the existence of mesopores 26 31 the detailed pore characteristics are exhibited in fig s2 and table s1 due to the introduction of amino groups the specific surface area 104 21 m2 g of mfn was lower than the results reported in other literatures 31 interestingly the doping amount of la was positively correlated with the pore size and inversely correlated with the pore volume and the specific surface area of materials since the binding of la to nh2 bdc ligands destroys the original mof structure the bet surface area of mfn is larger than that of lmfn 33 as illustrated in table s1 l1mfn cs owned a pore size of 3 616 nm while l1mfn ys possessed a pore size of 8 922 nm which were all caused by the introduction of mesoporous sio2 26 this large pore size could expose more active sites which was more conducive to the diffusion of adsorbate to explain the bonding of the samples the analysis results of ftir are shown in fig 4 the stretching and bending vibrations of nh in the amino group corresponded to 3416 and 1624 cm 1 respectively proving that the samples contained lots of amino groups fig 4a the bands at 1358 and 1259 cm 1 were corresponded to cn stretching vibrations 34 moreover the peaks at 1617 1428 1391 and 1574 6 cm 1 were linked with aromatic carbon cc and carboxyl carbon co co 35 the emerging peaks at 846 cm 1 were attributed to the lao bonds formed between la3 and the nh2 bdc ligand furthermore the bands around 1110 and 1050 cm 1 corresponded to feoh and laoh respectively 36 the peaks at 1080 804 463 and 960 cm 1 represented siosi osio and sioh respectively demonstrating the successful preparation of the sio2 shell 25 the peak of ctab the mesoporous template used to synthesize mesoporous silica could not be detected near 3000 cm 1 fig 4b indicating the successful removal of ctab and the formation of mesoporous sio2 26 3 2 water etching process previously liu et al synthesized multi shelled hollow mil 101 cr by stepwise crystal growth and etched with water and acetic acid since the mof crystal synthesized at 180 c for 4 h was not uniform this etching started from the inside of the mil 101 crystal and liu et al had demonstrated that it was the hydrogen in the water that played a pivotal role in the etching process 37 in this work the homogeneous mil 101 materials synthesized by reacting at 200 c for 24 h was etched by water beginning from the outside of the crystal 26 moreover according to molecular mechanisms the process of water etching was that the unsaturated coordinating nucleophilic metal atoms were more easily combined with nucleophilic o atoms in water and the remaining h atoms were bound to o atoms on the ligands making the mof outer layer easier to etch than the inner layer 26 additionally tg analysis experiments fig s3 manifested that the presence of mesoporous sio2 shell was more conductive to the destruction of mil 101 crystals at low temperature the above discussion and analysis prove that it is feasible to etch mil 101 crystals with water at low temperature 100 c 3 3 adsorbents optimization fig s4a shows the effect of different lanthanum doped mil 101 fe nh2 on p adsorption at diverse contact times the adsorption capacity for p of mfn without any la doping was only 85 08 mg p g whereas the others l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn were enormously improved to 124 62 145 16 and 144 64 mg p g respectively furthermore when the lafe ration reached 1 5 the uptake capacity was no longer improved because the excessive doping of la changed the crystal structure of mfn which in turn affected the adsorption effect furthermore the largest k value of l1mfn fig s4b could also be inferred that different doping amounts of la changed the crystal structure of mil 101 fe 38 therefore l1mfn proved to be the materials with the best doping ratio which was further used in subsequent experiments fig s4c exhibits the effect of different adsorbent dosages on p removal when the sorbent dosage was 50 mg the adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys reached the maximum value of 196 7 and 208 4 mg p g respectively hence 50 mg was identified as the adsorbent dose for follow up studies 3 4 phosphorus adsorption by l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys 3 4 1 oscillation time and adsorption kinetics the effect of oscillation time on the recovery of p on l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys was investigated and exhibited in fig 5a as presented within the first 20 min the adsorption rates of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys on phosphate spiked up to 186 7 and 201 3 mg p g respectively however the adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys increased slowly as the repulsive forces among the adsorbents increased and reached adsorption equilibrium within 60 and 30 min respectively which was much faster than that of mfn 120 min the reason may be that the core shell voids of the yolk shell structure could ensure sufficient contact between the adsorbents and phosphates enabling a faster adsorption rate to gain an in depth understanding of the p adsorption process several kinetic models the pseudo first order eq s3 pseudo second order eq s4 and intraparticle diffusion eq s5 models were employed to analyze the kinetic data the corresponding model parameter fitting results are presented in table 1 from fig 5b c and table 1 the pseudo second order model could better describe the kinetic data indicating that the p adsorption processes of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys were chemical interaction processes 39 to better explain the p uptake process the fitting curve of intraparticle diffusion model was exhibited in fig 5d the three broken lines represented the three adsorption processes i the initial fast p adsorption stage ii the p diffusion stage to the interior of the adsorbent and iii the final saturation stage 25 and as the time became longer the intraparticle diffusion gradually weakened which was in keep with the order of kd1 kd2 kd3 40 furthermore the fitted straight lines all deviated from the origin indicating that the intraparticle diffusion process was related to phosphate adsorption by the adsorbents the adsorption modelling results for phosphate showed multi linearity proving that multiple adsorption mechanisms participated in the uptake of phosphate onto l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys 3 4 2 initial p concentration and adsorption isotherms the p adsorption properties of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys at various initial p concentrations were explored as illustrated in fig 6a with an increase in the initial concentration the adsorption capacity of phosphate by l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys improved gradually until the plateau was reached which was because the high concentrations of phosphate could increase the driving force of adsorption but also could cause competition between phosphates for adsorption sites in addition the removal effect of l1mfn ys was better than that of l1mfn cs generally adsorption isotherms were momentous means for explaining the adsorption behavior of adsorbents therefore the langmuir eq s6 freundlich eq s7 temkin eq s8 and sips eq s9 isotherm models are applied for fitting the data and displayed in fig 6b c and table 2 given the large correlation coefficient graphs of the isotherm data were well explained by the langmuir model manifesting that a monolayer of p adsorption occurred at the uniformly distributed active sites on l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys the maximum adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys were up to 234 0 and 242 0 mg p g respectively higher than those of other adsorbent materials table 3 indicating that the la doping and the yolk shell structure formed by mesoporous silica encapsulation played an important role in the phosphate adsorption process compared with other mil 101 materials table 3 l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys not only had faster adsorption rates and higher adsorption capacities but also owned excellent ph stability this was because the encapsulation of the mesoporous sio2 shell improved the stability of the inner core mil 101 while the yolk shell structure can expose more active sites the parameter 1 n in the freundlich model was located in the range of 1 1 n 0 indicating that the prepared materials had good affinity with phosphate molecules further the rl values fig 5d in the samples followed the order 1 rl 0 which certified a favorable uptake process for l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys to p according to the bt value in table 2 it could be concluded that physical adsorption did not participate in the adsorption of phosphate anions on l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys bt 20 j mol 45 the Î³ values of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys were 0 6136 and 0 7687 respectively proving that the adsorption behavior of the phosphate anion on l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys was monolayer uniform 46 3 4 3 external temperatures and adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption properties of p on adsorbent materials can be revealed by thermodynamic studies gibbs free energy Î´g0 enthalpy change Î´h0 and entropy change Î´s0 can be calculated from the formula eqs s10 s11 and s12 in the si the corresponding vant hoff thermodynamic fitting graphs are presented in fig s5 and table s2 the p adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys increased from 196 7 and 208 4 mg p g to 203 8 and 213 7 mg p g fig s5a respectively indicating the endothermic adsorption nature which could be attributed to the accelerated diffusion rate of phosphate anions with the increasing temperature 45 moreover the positive values of Î´h0 also reflected the endothermic nature of phosphate uptake and the positive Î´s0 values proved increased randomness at the solid liquid interface the negative values of Î´g0 shown in table s2 revealed the favorable and spontaneous characteristics for the phosphate uptake by l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys with the minimal demands for activation energies 47 3 4 4 initial ph fig 7 exhibited the removal of p by the above two materials at different ph and their corresponding zeta potential values the main species of phosphate present at different phs were presented in fig s6 from fig 7a and b overall the phosphate uptake capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys for p remained almost unchanged over a wide ph range of 2 10 but when the ph raised to 11 the adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys decreased from 198 6 and 203 8 mg p g to 192 5 and 194 8 mg p g respectively the zero potential charges phzpc of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys were about 2 95 and 3 60 fig 7c respectively which meant that the surface of the materials was positively charged when the ph phzpc in this range ph phzpc the main form of phosphorus was h2po4 fig s6 so electrostatic attraction was the main removal method in addition the electrostatic attraction between the protonated amino group nh3 and h2po4 could also enhance the removal of p when the phzpc ph 10 the surface of the materials was negatively charged which repelled phosphate anions but the adsorption capacities remained a high level indicating that ligand exchanged and lewis acid base interaction played a dominating role the unsaturated metal active sites in the prepared materials acted as lewis acid and h2po4 hpo4 2 became lewis base therefore the unsaturated metal active site adsorbs phosphate anions through lewis acid base interaction 33 when ph 10 a mass of oh would compete with po3 and hpo4 2 leading to a reduced uptake capacity also interestingly the solution ph gradually increased after adsorption indicating that the application of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys in adsorption of phosphate could increase the alkalinity of the solution fig 7a b and table s3 the reason may be that when ph phzpc the protonation of nh2 and fe la oh on the surface of the materials would carry a large amount of h which increased the solution ph when ph phzpc the protonated fe la oh2 would exchange with phosphate to form fe la op bonds through ligand exchange and release a large number of h thereby reducing the ph of the p solution 27 48 3 4 5 ionic strength and coexisting anions since the actual water contains numerous anions that can compete with phosphate anions for adsorption therefore several common coexisting anions cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 and hco3 of different concentrations were used to assess the selectivity of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys it was clear from fig 8 that except for co3 2 other anions had no impact on the p removal furthermore as the enhancement of co3 2 ionic strength 0 001 m to 1 m the adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys for phosphate decreased from 197 2 and 203 9 mg p g to 141 8 and 146 mg p g respectively since co3 2 the hydrolysis of co3 2 produced oh which in turn affected the adsorption process of p 31 furthermore considering that the phosphate adsorption capacity did not change much at the four different ionic strengths which indicated that l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys had high adsorption selectivity so overall l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys were hardly affected by interfering ions of different intensities and had strong environmental adaptability 3 4 6 adsorbent regeneration and application of actual petrochemical wastewater it is important to access effective desorption after the uptake of phosphate for achieving the economic value of l1mfn ys as shown in fig 9a the adsorption capacity of l1mfn ys for phosphate was able to reach 195 3 mg p g in the first cycle and the adsorption capacity decreased gradually with the increase of the number of cycles it could be found that after three adsorption desorption cycles l1mfn ys was still able to reach a phosphate adsorption capacity of 182 2 mg p g which was much higher than that of other fresh adsorbents table 3 furthermore l1mfn ys maintained above 92 desorption efficiency which proved that l1mfn ys maintained high efficiency and stability in multiple recycling and had the potential for practical application the original petrochemical wastewater had not undergone any processing and the initial p concentration was 5 48 mg p l from fig 9b when the adsorbent amount increased the p concentration decreased rapidly furthermore the residual p concentration reached the a level standard for p containing wastewater discharge in china with the dosage of 0 8 g l indicating that l1mfn ys owned great prospects for disposing the actual p containing sewage 3 5 adsorption mechanisms to gain an in depth comprehension of the adsorption mechanism of p adsorption by l1mfn ys ftir xrd and xps are applied to elucidate the adsorption process of p it could be seen from fig s7a that after p adsorption some new diffraction peaks appeared in l1mfn ys p corresponding to lapo4 pdf 04 0635 fepo4 pdf 30 0659 and fe2 po3 3 pdf 07 0184 respectively furthermore compared to the ftir spectrum of l1mfn ys fig s7b the new peaks centered at 530 and 613 cm 1 belonged to opo and opo bands 49 50 the enhanced absorption peak at 1050 cm 1 was put down to the stretching vibration of the po bond at 1038 cm 1 49 furthermore the xrd pattern fig s7a and ftir spectrum fig s7b show that l1mfn ys basically retains the characteristic peaks of mfn before and after adsorption indicating that the stability of l1mfn is improved by msio2 wrapping fig s8 displays the sem image of the adsorbent after adsorption the structure of l1mfn ys was not damaged after the adsorption of p and remained the original spherical structure indicating that l1mfn ys has good structural stability fig s8a nevertheless the surface of l1mfn ys p becomes rough compared with l1mfn ys fig 2f which may be caused by the adsorbed p to accumulated on its surface additionally the eds mappings of l1mfn ys p manifested that p was uniformly distributed on l1mfn ys proving that p was successfully adsorbed for the purpose of further elaborating the interaction between p and l1mfn ys nanomaterials xps spectra experiments before and after adsorption were carried out from fig 10a before adsorption l1mfn ys mainly contained la fe n si o c elements indicating the triumphantly doping of amino groups and la obviously the p peak could be clearly observed after adsorption which proved that p was successfully removed by adsorption moreover compared with the spectrum of kh2po4 134 0 ev p 2p shifted to the lower binding energies fig 10b implying the formation of new chemical bonds between p and l1mfn ys as shown in figs 10 e f and s8 c d after adsorption of p la 3d and fe 2p shifted rightward to higher binding energies which may because the electron transfer in the valence bands of fe and la to form new inner sphere complexes laop and feop 51 52 given the spectrum of o 1s before adsorption fig 10c there were four subpeaks oco 533 06 ev h2o 532 62 ev fe la oh 531 40 ev and fe la ofe la 530 51 ev respectively however after uptake of p the peak intensity of fe la oh was weakened and the appearance of poh at 532 8 ev resulted in an enhanced adsorption peak this results testified that ligand exchange occurred between fe la oh as the active sites and phosphate which in turn leaded to a decrease in its peak intensity 53 meanwhile due to the production of plentiful fe la op the peak at 531 2 ev was enhanced which further demonstrated that fe la oh was beneficial to the removal of p since there was little difference in the peaks of c 1s fig s8a and b manifesting that there was only physical adsorption between c 1s and p furthermore the binding energies at 399 34 and 402 39 ev represented n and nh2 respectively fig s8e nevertheless after p sorption a new spectrum of protonated nh3 appeared at 402 19 ev which testified that nh2 was efficiently pronated and participated in the p removal process 54 this was in line with the discussion in the ph section based on the above analysis the interaction mechanisms between l1mfn ys and phosphate were mainly ligand exchange electrostatic attraction and lewis acid base interaction the possible schematic diagram was shown in fig 11 and the details were as follows i the removal of phosphate was achieved through ligand exchange between fe la oh and h2po4 hpo4 2 to form inner sphere complexes fe la op ii unsaturated active metal sites lewis acids removed phosphates lewis bases through lewis acid base interactions iii the removal of phosphates by electrostatic attraction between nh3 and h2po4 hpo4 2 under acidic conditions 4 conclusions in summary we reported a novel la doped mil 101 fe nh2 msio2 yolk shell nanostructured materials prepared by a water etching method for the phosphorus removal from wastewater the exposed more active mof core and the protective rigid silica shell allowed the yolk shell material to have greater adsorption capacity and better stability during phosphate adsorption uptake experiments implied that l1mfn ys exhibited outstanding p removal ability the adsorption equilibrium could be reached within 30 min and the maximum adsorption capacity was up to 240 0 mg p g meanwhile l1mfn ys showed excellent ph stability 2 10 and outstanding adsorption selectivity for phosphate of disparate ionic strengths furthermore after three cycles of regeneration experiments l1mfn ys still maintained a phosphate adsorption capacity of 182 2 mg p g and a desorption efficiency of above 92 indicating that it had the potential for practical application the characterization results implied that the adsorption mechanisms presented the p uptake on l1mfn ys was related to lewis acid base interaction electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange finally since the prepared adsorbent is a powder material this can lead to incomplete recovery in the treatment of the actual wastewater resulting in secondary contamination of the water body immobilization of the material or preparation of magnetic material could be performed in the future work to solve this problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12472,although mil 101 fe has a homogeneous distribution of active metal sites the relatively low stability of its coordination bonds limits its potential for application especially in harsh environments here a novel lanthanum doped mil 101 fe nh2 mesoporous sio2 yolk shell lmfn ys material synthesized by green water etching has effectively improved the adsorption capacity and stability of mil 101 fe nh2 compared to traditional acid base etching methods water etching offered a more co friendly and cost effective approach to producing yolk shell structures due to the mesoporous protective shell of mesoporous sio2 and more exposed active sites the yolk shell materials showed a faster adsorption rate 30 min and a larger uptake capacity 240 0 mg p g than those of mil 101 the material also exhibited broad range of ph stability from 2 to 10 and displayed good cyclic regeneration ability with a removal efficiency of 75 9 after three cycles additionally it demonstrated excellent selectivity towards various coexisting anions such as cl no3 so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 at diverse ionic strengths ranging from 0 001 to 1 m the superior performance of l1mfn ys yolk shell materials of la fe 1 1 was attributed to a combination of factors including ligand exchange between la fe oh and phosphates lewis acid base interaction and electrostatic attraction additionally high phosphate removal performance was observed in the real petrochemical wastewater initial concentrations of 5 48 mg p g with a residual effluent concentration of 0 05 mg p l which was below the a level standard of phosphate effluent in china 0 5 mg l this work provides a green method for preparing yolk shell materials with improved ability to treat phosphate wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water etching metal organic framework yolk shell phosphate adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus p a scarce and non renewable resource is imperative to biological growth as well as human life 1 2 however excessive p discharged into water is considered to be the reason of eutrophication outbreaks leading to wild growth of algal and disrupting the ecological balance thereby posing an immense menace to human health 3 up to now numerous processing technologies have been investigated for p recovery including biological treatment adsorption chemical precipitation and so on 4 5 in detail the precipitation biological aeration method was able to reduce phosphate concentrations in wastewater to 0 80 1 79 mg l 6 while the combination of electrocoagulation and biology was able to reduce phosphate concentrations in wastewater to 0 2 2 6 mg l 7 nevertheless the phosphate effluent concentrations of these technologies are above 0 2 mg l and do not meet the discharge standards 0 05 mg l in europe and 0 01 mg l in north america based on this idea it is still significant to prepare new efficient and inexpensive materials for the development of new treatment processes a large number of adsorbent materials have been investigated for phosphorus removal in the past decades among them originally developed by fÃ©rey team mil 101 fe material was used as an ideal adsorbent material to remove phosphate from water due to its strong affinity of unsaturated metal sites as well as the large specific surface area and high porosity 8 for example the group of li et al prepared magnetic mil 101 fe which reached equilibrium at 30 min with a maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of only 24 7 mg g 9 liu and his colleagues synthesized nh2 mil 101 fe for the recovery of p from aqueous with a maximum uptake capacity of 87 7 mg g within 120 min 3 the above examples indicate that bare mil 101 fe can be used alone for phosphate removal but its low adsorption capacity and long equilibrium time limit its widespread application in addition the poor structural stability is another important reason that limits the wide application of mil 101 fe specifically because metal ligand coordination bonds are weaker than covalent sio bonds mil 101 fe is less stable to temperature humidity and acid base than inorganic materials e g mesoporous silica and tends to collapse or even decompose under harsh conditions 10 to this end improving the adsorption capacity of mil 101 fe on phosphate and the structural stability of the single mil 101 fe in different environments are important issues to be addressed currently doping a simple and effective method is used to modify single metal organic framework mof materials to enhance their adsorption capacity for phosphate 11 lanthanum la an inexpensive and plentiful resource is deemed to be efficient in removing p from wastewater 12 also the low solubility of lanthanum phosphate pksp 26 15 enables complex formation even in trace level enhancing its removal efficiency at low concentrations 13 huang et al fabricated la doped mesoporous silica with a phosphorus adsorption capacity of 47 89 mg p g while undoped mesoporous silica hardly adsorbed phosphate 14 additionally the adsorption capacity of la doped zsm 5 prepared by pham et al for phosphate reached 106 20 mg g much higher than that of zsm 5 59 80 mg g 15 therefore the use of la doping to enhance the phosphate adsorption capacity is effective and feasible in order to improve the stability of mil 101 fe as well as to expose more accessible active sites and thus improve the adsorption capacity except for the synthesis of stable mof materials one of the most effective methods is to capsulate the mofs into the stable inorganic material shells 16 for instance tsai used sio2 encapsulated zif 67 core shell materials for the cycloaddition reaction of co2 and propylene oxide which improved the stability of zif 67 with a maximum conversion of 97 17 then taylor pashow et al employed sio2 coated fe mof to form a core shell structure to improve its stability for drug delivery 18 li et al reported zif 8 msio2 core shell material to enhance the stability of zif 8 19 despite the improved stability the core shell materials still have many defects firstly the active sites on the surface of the core can be blocked by the outer shell secondly for the core shell materials adsorption occurs in the pore channels which can affect the diffusion of substances and reduce the adsorption efficiency 20 compared with core shell nanomaterials the yolk shell structured materials can expose more active sites and the core shell voids can ensure adequate contact between active sites and phosphate furthermore the current reported mof sio2 yolk shell nanostructures were prepared by selective etching of core shell structures where the cyanide cationic surfactant or alkaline etchant used to etch the core or silica shell were toxic and environmentally unfriendly 21 24 therefore the development of a green method for fabricating yolk shell structure to improve the stability of mof and expose more active sites thereby improving the adsorption capacity has great potential for applications in different directions here we synthesize mesoporous sio2 encapsulated la doped mil 101 fe nh2 yolk shell nanocomposites via an environmentally friendly water etching method thus improving the stability and phosphate adsorption capacity of mil 101 fe moreover the special structure has numerous advantages for phosphate adsorption specifically the mesoporous shell provides an efficient pathway for adsorbent and phosphate transport the yolk shell structure protects the mil 101 fe core with active sites and improves its stability throughout the process in this paper firstly we prepared la mil 101 fe nh2 nanomaterials with three different la fe ratios named l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn to obtain the optimal ration and further synthesized core shell and yolk shell structures then we further explored the effect of external conditions on the removal phosphate by core shell and yolk shell adsorbents including oscillation time original concentration solution ph environment temperature coexisting anions ion strength and the application of practical phosphorus containing petrochemical wastewater etc finally the adsorption mechanisms were deeply discussed and analyzed by ftir spectrum xrd pattern and xps pattern 2 experimental 2 1 materials and reagents ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 wt lanthanum chloride hexahydrate lacl3 6h2o 99 9 wt and 2 amino terephthalic acid nh2 bdc 99 wt were supplied by shanghai aladdin chemical reagent tetraethyl silicate teos 98 wt ammonia solution nh3 h2o 28 wt and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab 99 wt were provided by shanghai macklin chemical reagent 2 2 preparation of mil 101 fe nh2 mfn and la mil 101 fe nh2 lmfn mfn was prepared based on previous research with slight modification 3 in short the solution a 0 225 g of nh2 bdc dispersed into 15 ml of dmf was mixed with the solution b 0 675 g of fecl3 6h2o dispersed into 15 ml of dmf then 1 2 ml of acetic acid was added and the solution was sonicated for 30 min and heated at 200 c for 20 h afterward the obtained brown sediment was washed three times with dmf and absolute ethanol finally the materials were dried at 80 c for 10 h in vacuum to mfm under the same procedure lmfn was prepared by dissolving both lacl3 6h2o and fecl3 6h2o in solution b here the three different molar ratios of la to fe were designed including 0 5 1 1 1 and 1 5 1 named l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn respectively the material with the best doping ration was then used to synthesized core shell and yolk shell structure 2 3 preparation of la mil 101 fe nh2 sio2 cs lmfn cs lmfn 0 1 g and ctab 1 25 were uniformly dispersed in 100 ml of deionized water and 20 ml of absolute ethanol after stirring for 60 min the solution was heated to 50 c 0 5 ml of nh3 h2o was added and the solution was continuously stirred for 6 h during this time it was worth noting that teos 1 ml and absolute ethanol 10 ml were formed into a mixed solution and 2 ml of the mixed solution was added every 1 h after centrifugation the obtained product was washed three times with absolute ethanol later the semi finished material was extracted and refluxed three times with absolute ethanol and nh4no3 solution at 80 c 25 the solid liquid was separated by suction filtration and dried at 80 c overnight 2 4 preparation of la mil 101 fe nh2 sio2 ys lmfn ys lmfn ys was synthesized by a green water etching method 26 specifically lmfn ys was obtained by placing lmfn cs at 2 mg ml in deionized water by simple water etching usually the autoclave containing 10 ml of the suspension was reacted at 100 c for 24 h the resulting product was centrifuged and washed several times with dmf and absolute ethanol to obtain final material lmfn ys 2 5 batch uptake experiments to obtain the optimal la doping ration the adsorption properties of p were investigated by a series of mfn l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn the differences in p removal at dosages of lmfn cs and lmfn ys were explored in the range of 10 100 mg the calculation formula for adsorption capacity eq s1 was displayed in the supplementary materials the collected samples were filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m membrane for the analysis of phosphate concentration which was determined spectrophotometrically at the detecting wavelength of 700 nm on a uv vis spectrophotometer based on the molybdenum blue method 27 for the kinetics studies of lmfn cs and lmfn ys 50 mg of the prepared materials were uniformly dispersed in 80 ml of 150 mg p l p solution and sampled at various time intervals 0 300 min in isotherm experiment 50 mg of lmfn cs and lmfn ys were charged into 80 ml conical flask with initial p concentrations ranging from 10 to 250 mg p l to explore the influence of external temperature on p removal thermodynamic experiments were carried out by adding 0 05 g of adsorbents to 80 ml of 150 mg p l phosphorus solution at different temperatures 30 40 and 50 c the effect of ph 2 11 on p adsorption was investigated by adjusting the initial ph by 0 1 m hcl and naoh nacl na2co3 nahco3 nano3 and na2so4 were used to evaluate the effect of coexisting anions and four concentrations 0 001 0 01 0 1 and 1 m were set respectively to explore the effect of ionic strength to enhance the practical application ability of the prepared adsorbents we also explored the regeneration ability of the materials in detail the used adsorbents lmfn ys p were soaked in 1 nacl solution and reacted at room temperature for 24 h then the obtained adsorbent materials were re used for p adsorption experiments under the same experimental conditions to further verify the practical application capability of l1mfn ys the petrochemical wastewater was used as an actual water sample for experiments the detailed parameters of the petrochemical wastewater are listed in table 4 of the si briefly 20 ml of petrochemical wastewater was thoroughly mixed with different adsorbent dosages 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 and 1 g l for sufficient time the water after the reaction was passed through a 0 22 Î¼m filter membrane before detection 2 6 analytical techniques all analytical techniques applied in this work are appeared in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the xrd patterns of synthesized materials in the range of 5 60 are displayed in fig 1 mfn l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn located at 2Î¸ 8 97 9 7 16 19 6 21 3 and 33 retained the chemical structure of mil 101 fe nh2 fig 1a which was consistent with previous literatures 28 29 the diffraction peak intensities at 2Î¸ 8 97 and 9 7 gradually weakened or even disappeared with the increase of la doping amount fig 1a which was ascribed to the destruction of the original mof structure by the introduction of excess la interestingly the diffraction peaks of l1mfn matched poorly with standard cards of la2o3 pdf 40 1279 and lao pdf 33 0716 fig s1 which proved that la did not exist as an oxide therefore according to the xrd a deduction could be obtained that the doping of la changes the structure of mil 101 and forms la mof after mesoporous sio2 encapsulation although the peak intensity of l1mfn ys become weaker the main characteristic peaks of mfn are basically remained indicating that the prepared materials are stable this phenomenon may be that the encapsulated mesoporous sio2 shell could prevent the x ray penetration to some extent and mask the original mof characteristic peaks in addition to the excess la doping furthermore a new sio2 characteristic peak appeared at 2Î¸ 22 1 fig 1b which was in keeping with huang s group 10 fig 2 exhibited the morphology of the synthetic materials the severe agglomeration of mfn in fig 2a was caused by the expansion of reagent dosing during synthesis 30 it was evident that mfn with a particle size of about 2 Î¼m possessed a well defined octahedral structure l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn fig 2b d presented non smooth spheres with many pores which were conducive to full contact with adsorption sites inside the adsorbent 31 with the increase of la loading although the lmfn crystal size became larger the morphology changed little this reason may be that the growth of mfn was inhibited by excessive la doping resulting in a larger crystal size after sio2 coating in addition to the larger particle the surface of l1mfn cs fig 2e and l1mfn ys fig 2f became more rounder and smoother furthermore eds elemental mapping of l1mfn fig 2g and l1mfn ys fig 2h owned la fe o n and la fe o n si respectively indicating that the materials were successfully synthesized the single tem morphology of the as prepared materials is exhibited in fig 3 the l1mfn edge in fig 3a b exhibited a spherical structure with wrinkled edges indicating a porous material it was evident that l1mfn was triumphantly encapsulated uniformly by a sio2 shell with a thickness of about 110 nm fig 3c d showing a core shell structure notably after water etching an apparent yolk shell structure with more apparent mesopores in sio2 shell was observed and the void between l1mfn and sio2 was about 49 28 nm fig 3e furthermore the hrtem image of l1mfn ys could observe that the lattice fringe space 0 31 nm of the outermost layer was in line with the 111 crystal plane of si and showed delamination phenomenon fig 3g which further confirmed the successful preparation of the yolk shell structure 32 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of mfn l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn in the pressure range of 0 1 were all type ii isotherms fig s2a to d which indicated that the prepared materials owned a mesoporous structure and were favorable for the adsorption furthermore after sio2 encapsulating l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys exhibited type iv and type ii adsorption isotherms respectively with obvious hysteresis loops manifesting the existence of mesopores 26 31 the detailed pore characteristics are exhibited in fig s2 and table s1 due to the introduction of amino groups the specific surface area 104 21 m2 g of mfn was lower than the results reported in other literatures 31 interestingly the doping amount of la was positively correlated with the pore size and inversely correlated with the pore volume and the specific surface area of materials since the binding of la to nh2 bdc ligands destroys the original mof structure the bet surface area of mfn is larger than that of lmfn 33 as illustrated in table s1 l1mfn cs owned a pore size of 3 616 nm while l1mfn ys possessed a pore size of 8 922 nm which were all caused by the introduction of mesoporous sio2 26 this large pore size could expose more active sites which was more conducive to the diffusion of adsorbate to explain the bonding of the samples the analysis results of ftir are shown in fig 4 the stretching and bending vibrations of nh in the amino group corresponded to 3416 and 1624 cm 1 respectively proving that the samples contained lots of amino groups fig 4a the bands at 1358 and 1259 cm 1 were corresponded to cn stretching vibrations 34 moreover the peaks at 1617 1428 1391 and 1574 6 cm 1 were linked with aromatic carbon cc and carboxyl carbon co co 35 the emerging peaks at 846 cm 1 were attributed to the lao bonds formed between la3 and the nh2 bdc ligand furthermore the bands around 1110 and 1050 cm 1 corresponded to feoh and laoh respectively 36 the peaks at 1080 804 463 and 960 cm 1 represented siosi osio and sioh respectively demonstrating the successful preparation of the sio2 shell 25 the peak of ctab the mesoporous template used to synthesize mesoporous silica could not be detected near 3000 cm 1 fig 4b indicating the successful removal of ctab and the formation of mesoporous sio2 26 3 2 water etching process previously liu et al synthesized multi shelled hollow mil 101 cr by stepwise crystal growth and etched with water and acetic acid since the mof crystal synthesized at 180 c for 4 h was not uniform this etching started from the inside of the mil 101 crystal and liu et al had demonstrated that it was the hydrogen in the water that played a pivotal role in the etching process 37 in this work the homogeneous mil 101 materials synthesized by reacting at 200 c for 24 h was etched by water beginning from the outside of the crystal 26 moreover according to molecular mechanisms the process of water etching was that the unsaturated coordinating nucleophilic metal atoms were more easily combined with nucleophilic o atoms in water and the remaining h atoms were bound to o atoms on the ligands making the mof outer layer easier to etch than the inner layer 26 additionally tg analysis experiments fig s3 manifested that the presence of mesoporous sio2 shell was more conductive to the destruction of mil 101 crystals at low temperature the above discussion and analysis prove that it is feasible to etch mil 101 crystals with water at low temperature 100 c 3 3 adsorbents optimization fig s4a shows the effect of different lanthanum doped mil 101 fe nh2 on p adsorption at diverse contact times the adsorption capacity for p of mfn without any la doping was only 85 08 mg p g whereas the others l0 5mfn l1mfn and l1 5mfn were enormously improved to 124 62 145 16 and 144 64 mg p g respectively furthermore when the lafe ration reached 1 5 the uptake capacity was no longer improved because the excessive doping of la changed the crystal structure of mfn which in turn affected the adsorption effect furthermore the largest k value of l1mfn fig s4b could also be inferred that different doping amounts of la changed the crystal structure of mil 101 fe 38 therefore l1mfn proved to be the materials with the best doping ratio which was further used in subsequent experiments fig s4c exhibits the effect of different adsorbent dosages on p removal when the sorbent dosage was 50 mg the adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys reached the maximum value of 196 7 and 208 4 mg p g respectively hence 50 mg was identified as the adsorbent dose for follow up studies 3 4 phosphorus adsorption by l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys 3 4 1 oscillation time and adsorption kinetics the effect of oscillation time on the recovery of p on l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys was investigated and exhibited in fig 5a as presented within the first 20 min the adsorption rates of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys on phosphate spiked up to 186 7 and 201 3 mg p g respectively however the adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys increased slowly as the repulsive forces among the adsorbents increased and reached adsorption equilibrium within 60 and 30 min respectively which was much faster than that of mfn 120 min the reason may be that the core shell voids of the yolk shell structure could ensure sufficient contact between the adsorbents and phosphates enabling a faster adsorption rate to gain an in depth understanding of the p adsorption process several kinetic models the pseudo first order eq s3 pseudo second order eq s4 and intraparticle diffusion eq s5 models were employed to analyze the kinetic data the corresponding model parameter fitting results are presented in table 1 from fig 5b c and table 1 the pseudo second order model could better describe the kinetic data indicating that the p adsorption processes of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys were chemical interaction processes 39 to better explain the p uptake process the fitting curve of intraparticle diffusion model was exhibited in fig 5d the three broken lines represented the three adsorption processes i the initial fast p adsorption stage ii the p diffusion stage to the interior of the adsorbent and iii the final saturation stage 25 and as the time became longer the intraparticle diffusion gradually weakened which was in keep with the order of kd1 kd2 kd3 40 furthermore the fitted straight lines all deviated from the origin indicating that the intraparticle diffusion process was related to phosphate adsorption by the adsorbents the adsorption modelling results for phosphate showed multi linearity proving that multiple adsorption mechanisms participated in the uptake of phosphate onto l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys 3 4 2 initial p concentration and adsorption isotherms the p adsorption properties of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys at various initial p concentrations were explored as illustrated in fig 6a with an increase in the initial concentration the adsorption capacity of phosphate by l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys improved gradually until the plateau was reached which was because the high concentrations of phosphate could increase the driving force of adsorption but also could cause competition between phosphates for adsorption sites in addition the removal effect of l1mfn ys was better than that of l1mfn cs generally adsorption isotherms were momentous means for explaining the adsorption behavior of adsorbents therefore the langmuir eq s6 freundlich eq s7 temkin eq s8 and sips eq s9 isotherm models are applied for fitting the data and displayed in fig 6b c and table 2 given the large correlation coefficient graphs of the isotherm data were well explained by the langmuir model manifesting that a monolayer of p adsorption occurred at the uniformly distributed active sites on l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys the maximum adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys were up to 234 0 and 242 0 mg p g respectively higher than those of other adsorbent materials table 3 indicating that the la doping and the yolk shell structure formed by mesoporous silica encapsulation played an important role in the phosphate adsorption process compared with other mil 101 materials table 3 l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys not only had faster adsorption rates and higher adsorption capacities but also owned excellent ph stability this was because the encapsulation of the mesoporous sio2 shell improved the stability of the inner core mil 101 while the yolk shell structure can expose more active sites the parameter 1 n in the freundlich model was located in the range of 1 1 n 0 indicating that the prepared materials had good affinity with phosphate molecules further the rl values fig 5d in the samples followed the order 1 rl 0 which certified a favorable uptake process for l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys to p according to the bt value in table 2 it could be concluded that physical adsorption did not participate in the adsorption of phosphate anions on l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys bt 20 j mol 45 the Î³ values of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys were 0 6136 and 0 7687 respectively proving that the adsorption behavior of the phosphate anion on l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys was monolayer uniform 46 3 4 3 external temperatures and adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption properties of p on adsorbent materials can be revealed by thermodynamic studies gibbs free energy Î´g0 enthalpy change Î´h0 and entropy change Î´s0 can be calculated from the formula eqs s10 s11 and s12 in the si the corresponding vant hoff thermodynamic fitting graphs are presented in fig s5 and table s2 the p adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys increased from 196 7 and 208 4 mg p g to 203 8 and 213 7 mg p g fig s5a respectively indicating the endothermic adsorption nature which could be attributed to the accelerated diffusion rate of phosphate anions with the increasing temperature 45 moreover the positive values of Î´h0 also reflected the endothermic nature of phosphate uptake and the positive Î´s0 values proved increased randomness at the solid liquid interface the negative values of Î´g0 shown in table s2 revealed the favorable and spontaneous characteristics for the phosphate uptake by l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys with the minimal demands for activation energies 47 3 4 4 initial ph fig 7 exhibited the removal of p by the above two materials at different ph and their corresponding zeta potential values the main species of phosphate present at different phs were presented in fig s6 from fig 7a and b overall the phosphate uptake capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys for p remained almost unchanged over a wide ph range of 2 10 but when the ph raised to 11 the adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys decreased from 198 6 and 203 8 mg p g to 192 5 and 194 8 mg p g respectively the zero potential charges phzpc of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys were about 2 95 and 3 60 fig 7c respectively which meant that the surface of the materials was positively charged when the ph phzpc in this range ph phzpc the main form of phosphorus was h2po4 fig s6 so electrostatic attraction was the main removal method in addition the electrostatic attraction between the protonated amino group nh3 and h2po4 could also enhance the removal of p when the phzpc ph 10 the surface of the materials was negatively charged which repelled phosphate anions but the adsorption capacities remained a high level indicating that ligand exchanged and lewis acid base interaction played a dominating role the unsaturated metal active sites in the prepared materials acted as lewis acid and h2po4 hpo4 2 became lewis base therefore the unsaturated metal active site adsorbs phosphate anions through lewis acid base interaction 33 when ph 10 a mass of oh would compete with po3 and hpo4 2 leading to a reduced uptake capacity also interestingly the solution ph gradually increased after adsorption indicating that the application of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys in adsorption of phosphate could increase the alkalinity of the solution fig 7a b and table s3 the reason may be that when ph phzpc the protonation of nh2 and fe la oh on the surface of the materials would carry a large amount of h which increased the solution ph when ph phzpc the protonated fe la oh2 would exchange with phosphate to form fe la op bonds through ligand exchange and release a large number of h thereby reducing the ph of the p solution 27 48 3 4 5 ionic strength and coexisting anions since the actual water contains numerous anions that can compete with phosphate anions for adsorption therefore several common coexisting anions cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 and hco3 of different concentrations were used to assess the selectivity of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys it was clear from fig 8 that except for co3 2 other anions had no impact on the p removal furthermore as the enhancement of co3 2 ionic strength 0 001 m to 1 m the adsorption capacities of l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys for phosphate decreased from 197 2 and 203 9 mg p g to 141 8 and 146 mg p g respectively since co3 2 the hydrolysis of co3 2 produced oh which in turn affected the adsorption process of p 31 furthermore considering that the phosphate adsorption capacity did not change much at the four different ionic strengths which indicated that l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys had high adsorption selectivity so overall l1mfn cs and l1mfn ys were hardly affected by interfering ions of different intensities and had strong environmental adaptability 3 4 6 adsorbent regeneration and application of actual petrochemical wastewater it is important to access effective desorption after the uptake of phosphate for achieving the economic value of l1mfn ys as shown in fig 9a the adsorption capacity of l1mfn ys for phosphate was able to reach 195 3 mg p g in the first cycle and the adsorption capacity decreased gradually with the increase of the number of cycles it could be found that after three adsorption desorption cycles l1mfn ys was still able to reach a phosphate adsorption capacity of 182 2 mg p g which was much higher than that of other fresh adsorbents table 3 furthermore l1mfn ys maintained above 92 desorption efficiency which proved that l1mfn ys maintained high efficiency and stability in multiple recycling and had the potential for practical application the original petrochemical wastewater had not undergone any processing and the initial p concentration was 5 48 mg p l from fig 9b when the adsorbent amount increased the p concentration decreased rapidly furthermore the residual p concentration reached the a level standard for p containing wastewater discharge in china with the dosage of 0 8 g l indicating that l1mfn ys owned great prospects for disposing the actual p containing sewage 3 5 adsorption mechanisms to gain an in depth comprehension of the adsorption mechanism of p adsorption by l1mfn ys ftir xrd and xps are applied to elucidate the adsorption process of p it could be seen from fig s7a that after p adsorption some new diffraction peaks appeared in l1mfn ys p corresponding to lapo4 pdf 04 0635 fepo4 pdf 30 0659 and fe2 po3 3 pdf 07 0184 respectively furthermore compared to the ftir spectrum of l1mfn ys fig s7b the new peaks centered at 530 and 613 cm 1 belonged to opo and opo bands 49 50 the enhanced absorption peak at 1050 cm 1 was put down to the stretching vibration of the po bond at 1038 cm 1 49 furthermore the xrd pattern fig s7a and ftir spectrum fig s7b show that l1mfn ys basically retains the characteristic peaks of mfn before and after adsorption indicating that the stability of l1mfn is improved by msio2 wrapping fig s8 displays the sem image of the adsorbent after adsorption the structure of l1mfn ys was not damaged after the adsorption of p and remained the original spherical structure indicating that l1mfn ys has good structural stability fig s8a nevertheless the surface of l1mfn ys p becomes rough compared with l1mfn ys fig 2f which may be caused by the adsorbed p to accumulated on its surface additionally the eds mappings of l1mfn ys p manifested that p was uniformly distributed on l1mfn ys proving that p was successfully adsorbed for the purpose of further elaborating the interaction between p and l1mfn ys nanomaterials xps spectra experiments before and after adsorption were carried out from fig 10a before adsorption l1mfn ys mainly contained la fe n si o c elements indicating the triumphantly doping of amino groups and la obviously the p peak could be clearly observed after adsorption which proved that p was successfully removed by adsorption moreover compared with the spectrum of kh2po4 134 0 ev p 2p shifted to the lower binding energies fig 10b implying the formation of new chemical bonds between p and l1mfn ys as shown in figs 10 e f and s8 c d after adsorption of p la 3d and fe 2p shifted rightward to higher binding energies which may because the electron transfer in the valence bands of fe and la to form new inner sphere complexes laop and feop 51 52 given the spectrum of o 1s before adsorption fig 10c there were four subpeaks oco 533 06 ev h2o 532 62 ev fe la oh 531 40 ev and fe la ofe la 530 51 ev respectively however after uptake of p the peak intensity of fe la oh was weakened and the appearance of poh at 532 8 ev resulted in an enhanced adsorption peak this results testified that ligand exchange occurred between fe la oh as the active sites and phosphate which in turn leaded to a decrease in its peak intensity 53 meanwhile due to the production of plentiful fe la op the peak at 531 2 ev was enhanced which further demonstrated that fe la oh was beneficial to the removal of p since there was little difference in the peaks of c 1s fig s8a and b manifesting that there was only physical adsorption between c 1s and p furthermore the binding energies at 399 34 and 402 39 ev represented n and nh2 respectively fig s8e nevertheless after p sorption a new spectrum of protonated nh3 appeared at 402 19 ev which testified that nh2 was efficiently pronated and participated in the p removal process 54 this was in line with the discussion in the ph section based on the above analysis the interaction mechanisms between l1mfn ys and phosphate were mainly ligand exchange electrostatic attraction and lewis acid base interaction the possible schematic diagram was shown in fig 11 and the details were as follows i the removal of phosphate was achieved through ligand exchange between fe la oh and h2po4 hpo4 2 to form inner sphere complexes fe la op ii unsaturated active metal sites lewis acids removed phosphates lewis bases through lewis acid base interactions iii the removal of phosphates by electrostatic attraction between nh3 and h2po4 hpo4 2 under acidic conditions 4 conclusions in summary we reported a novel la doped mil 101 fe nh2 msio2 yolk shell nanostructured materials prepared by a water etching method for the phosphorus removal from wastewater the exposed more active mof core and the protective rigid silica shell allowed the yolk shell material to have greater adsorption capacity and better stability during phosphate adsorption uptake experiments implied that l1mfn ys exhibited outstanding p removal ability the adsorption equilibrium could be reached within 30 min and the maximum adsorption capacity was up to 240 0 mg p g meanwhile l1mfn ys showed excellent ph stability 2 10 and outstanding adsorption selectivity for phosphate of disparate ionic strengths furthermore after three cycles of regeneration experiments l1mfn ys still maintained a phosphate adsorption capacity of 182 2 mg p g and a desorption efficiency of above 92 indicating that it had the potential for practical application the characterization results implied that the adsorption mechanisms presented the p uptake on l1mfn ys was related to lewis acid base interaction electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange finally since the prepared adsorbent is a powder material this can lead to incomplete recovery in the treatment of the actual wastewater resulting in secondary contamination of the water body immobilization of the material or preparation of magnetic material could be performed in the future work to solve this problem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

acid ha solutions were utilised to test the antifouling behaviour of membranes in addition raw wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp was used to further assess the performance of the membranes the results indicated that with only 3 wt f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid in the pla membrane matrix the fouling tendency was attenuated superior rejection rates for bsa and ha of 96 and 98 respectively and the pure water flux was increased to almost 80 l m2hbar compared to the neat pla membrane 27 l m2hbar without compromising the high organic removal efficiency according to the results

keywords membrane wastewater treatment carbon nanotubes graphene oxide biodegradable polymer nanohybrid data availability all data generated or analysed during this study are included in this submitted article 1 introduction polymeric ultrafiltration uf membranes based on natural and or petroleum are widely used for the purification of domestic and industrial wastewater due to their chemical resistance sustainability and mechanical and thermal stabilities 12 polymeric membranes have garnered a lot of interest in both industrial activities and academic research studies renewable biodegradable polymeric materials are crucial for membrane technology since petroleum based polymers cannot be recycled and have detrimental consequences on the ecosystem and human health 15 biodegradable polymeric membranes unlike synthetic polymers can be composted after their life cycle is complete through the composting process thus mitigating the negative environmental consequences 12 polylactic acid pla is a decomposable polymer that can be utilised in membrane production instead of conventional fossil based materials membrane fouling has always been regarded as a critical challenge because it has a major impact on the efficiency of the treatment systems as well as the quality of the produced water common colloidal particles in wastewater including polysaccharides bovine serum albumin bsa humic acid ha and alginate are causing membrane organic fouling throughout the filtration process 32 various studies have investigated the augmentation of fouling resistance of polymeric membranes by integrating nanoparticles into their matrix the most used nanoparticles to develop membranes performance include graphene oxide go and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts due to their desirable mechanical chemical and physical characteristics and their distinctive nanostructure go nanosheets disperse rapidly in water and other solvents due to the occurrence of hydrophilic groups including carbonyl carboxyl epoxy and hydroxyl which grant go nanosheets to remain stable in various solutions the remarkable amphiphilic nature of go nanosheets enhances the interaction between the solvent and the non solvent through the immersion precipitation membrane fabrication method 6 13 the performance of the membrane can be improved by functionalizing go nanoparticles f go with other functional materials which can increase their dispersibility and allow them to reach their maximum potential 1 3 mwcnts have been widely used in many applications due to their excellent features such as high porosity flexibility and antibacterial property however they have limited dispersibility in organic solvents because of van der waals forces i e having a strong bundling phenomenon as a result several research studies were reported on the functionalization of the surface of mwcnts to improve their dispersibility 23 25 33 various studies have been executed to advance the membranes performance for wastewater treatment by incorporating go and mwcnts yang et al 33 developed a membrane with better fouling resistance properties by blending go silver nanoparticles into a cellulose acetate ca membrane the wettability and the antibacterial characteristics of the membrane were improved resulting in 86 inactivation of escherichia coli after 2 h of contact with the membrane hu and mi 16 synthesized a membrane through the vacuum filtration of go suspension using aluminium oxide as a substrate decorated with polydopamine and then thermally treated to enhance the connection with the support and boost the membrane s stability the fabricated membranes had a water flux of 48 4 l m2h and 99 7 rejection of nacl at 90 c various research on membranes for wastewater treatment that incorporate go and mwcnts to improve filtration properties were conducted however there are still a number of issues to address in terms of fouling and permeability when using a biodegradable polymeric membrane this study aims to enhance the properties of pla polymeric membranes using f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid more specifically the synthesis and incorporation of self assembled f go and mwcnts cooh f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid into the biodegradable pla membrane matrix were investigated it is expected to enhance the overall permeability by creating channels between the nanohybrids and pla to impart antifouling and high rejection to the synthetic bsa and ha solutions to the best of our knowledge the effect of incorporating f go mwcnts cooh into pla polymeric membrane matrix in treating wastewater has not been studied before the f go mwcnts cooh based pla membranes were further evaluated using raw municipal wastewater to ensure their durability membrane characterization using sem ft ir xrd contact angle porosity and pore size was also carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts purity 98 length 3 6

with a resistivity of 15 mÏ cm at 25 c was used in the coagulation bath the quick start bradford protein 1 dye reagent was used in the fouling study hach dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer was utilised to measure chemical oxygen demand cod concentration in raw wastewater feed and filtrate after treatment hach hq40d was used to measure the ph of treated and untreated wastewater raw wastewater samples were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp in abu dhabi uae before the filtration experiments no prior treatment was performed on the influent raw wastewater was stored in the fridge at 4 c and well mixed prior to the filtration tests the raw wastewater used in this study had a ph of 7 2 and a cod concentration of 318 mg l 2 2 synthesis and characterizations of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid 2 2 1 synthesis of f go nanosheets go was prepared using the simplified hummer method 6 13 to a volume ratio of 9 1 sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid 3 g of natural graphite flakes were mixed with the previous solution with stirring for 3 min 21 then 18 g of potassium permanganate kmno4 was carefully added to avoid a rapid exothermic reaction to ensure the complete oxidization of graphite the solution was under stirring for 3 d at room temperature the oxidation process was stopped by adding hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and then a bright yellow solution was obtained as an indication of the high oxidation of graphite di water and 1 m aqueous solution of hcl was added to wash the intercalated graphite oxide 3 4 times until a ph of 5 6 was achieved the collected viscous solution was further purified by dialysis using cellulose tubes the go filled dialysis tubes were immersed in a beaker containing di and stirred for 2 to 3 d the dialysis tubes are semi permeable membrane used to remove very small molecular weight solutes from solution and re adjusting the solution in a new buffer di water the di water in the beaker was changed with fresh water every 12 h then the purified go solution was collected and stored in an air tight bottle the preparation of the amino f go was carried out according to the literature 20 in which 0 01 mmol of edc and 0 02 mmol of nhs were added at room temperature and left to stir for 4 h around 0 01 mmol of ed was added to the go solution dropwise the solution was alkaline however the reaction favors the acidic condition therefore hcl was added to ensure that the solution was acidic ph 3 and kept stirring overnight then the solution was washed and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 30 min with di water until it reached a neutral ph condition the prepared f go has a concentration of 3 7 mg ml edc nhs acts as an intermediate crosslinker to accelerate the amidation reaction by creating bulky ester groups for the ed to easily react with the carboxyl groups r cooh on the go nanosheets 36 as shown in fig 1a the go colour changed from dark brown to light brown fig 1b 2 2 2 synthesis of mwcnts cooh negatively charged mwcnts cooh were fabricated as shown in fig 2 11 briefly 2 g of pristine mwcnts were treated with h2so4 and hno3 with a volume ratio the solution was maintained for 30 min at 25 c under stirring then the solution was slowly heated to a temperature of 70 c in an oil bath for 3 5 h to stop the reaction the solution was allowed to cool and washed several times with di water until the ph of the collected mwcnts cooh solution was almost neutral the final concentration of the solution was about 8 5 mg ml 2 2 3 preparation of negatively charged f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid the electrostatic co precipitation approach was used to obtain the self assembled negative charged f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid the nanohybrid was prepared by mixing a 20 80 volume ratio of positively charged f go 5 73 g mol and negatively charged mwcnts cooh 8 5 g mol as shown in fig 3 both f go and mwcnts cooh were diluted to a concentration of 1 5 mg ml by adding di water and then sonicated for 30 min to get well dispersed solutions under vigorous stirring the f go solution was added dropwise to the mwcnts cooh solution to make self assembled nanohybrids the electrostatic attraction between positively charged f go and mwcnts cooh leads to self assembly and the solution starts to coagulate the solution was left untouched for 2 d to precipitate the nanohybrids then centrifuged 8000 rpm 30 min followed by freeze drying for 3 d to obtain dried self assembled nanohybrids the ratio of f go and mwcnts cooh was altered to obtain differently charged nanohybrids 2 3 characterization of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid to confirm the successful formation of the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid several characterizations were performed such as tga netzsch sta 449 f3 jupiter xrd panalytical empyrean 40 kv and 35 ma sem quanta 250 esem and eds were performed furthermore the zetasizer 7 13 malvern panalytical instruments ltd was used to investigate the surface charge of nanomaterials in di water with a ph of 7 and a concentration of 0 2 mg ml ft ir spectroscopy was carried out to examine the functional groups of the produced nanohybrid bruker vertex 80v spectrometer furthermore the synthesized self assembled f go mwcnts cooh was compared to those of other nanoparticles such as pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh go and f go using the same characterization analyses 2 4 fabrication of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid based pla mixed matrix membranes all of the f go mwcnts cooh based pla nanohybrid membranes in this study were synthesized using the immersion precipitation method the nanohybrid with different contents was sonicated in dmac solvent for 2 h and then pla and pvp were dissolved subsequently then the prepared dope solutions were used to fabricate the membranes 18 the fabricated membranes were marked as m0 m1 m2 and m3 the concentrations of the fabricated membranes are presented in table 1 fig 4a illustrates the procedures used to fabricate the membranes and fig 4b shows real photos of the fabricated mixed matrix membranes they were cut into circular discs and secured with o rings to match the dimensions of the uf batch type cell the active membrane surface area was approximately 12 56 cm2 2 5 characterization of mixed matrix membranes sem and eds were utilised to study the morphological characteristics and surface chemical structure of the membranes by capturing surface and cross sectional images of membranes before the analysis a coating procedure was performed using platinum to form a 10 nm layer on the top of the membrane surface to enhance image quality the surface functional groups of the produced mixed matrix membranes were assessed using ft ir analysis xrd was used to evaluate the crystallinity of the produced membranes the prepared membranes hydrophilicity was obtained by determining the wca using a sessile drop technique utilising a contact angle analyzer krÃ¼ss germany 5 Î¼l droplet of di water was dropped onto the membrane surface using a micro syringe 19 to capture the image of the water droplet to reduce experimental error the average values of five contact angle measurements were obtained the porosity of the membranes was measured using the dry wet technique 18 2 6 performance of mixed matrix membranes the designed mixed matrix membranes were assessed for the rejection of synthetic bsa and ha and compared to the neat pla membrane the preparation of bsa and ha solutions as well as the performance of the mixed matrix membranes followed the same procedures as in our prior work 18 the flux recovery ratio frr was performed to measure the fouling resistance of the prepared membranes the total fouling affinity r t of the membranes following the filtration of foulants and reversible r r and irreversible r ir protein fouling were obtained to further investigate the fouling properties of the manufactured membranes equilibrium adsorption quantity q was computed to further investigate the antifouling characteristics of mixed matrix membranes the fabricated mixed matrix membrane s performance and fouling behaviour were subsequently evaluated via five consecutive filtration cycles utilising untreated raw municipal wastewater in order to ensure the membrane s durability the membrane was cleaned with di water physically and hach dr 3900 uv vis spectrophotometer was used to determine the cod concentration in the feed and filtrate samples raw municipal wastewater with 318 mg l cod concentrations 8 3 ms cm conductivity and a ph of 7 2 was collected from a local wwtp in abu dhabi uae and stored at 4 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid the surface charge of the prepared nanohybrid was determined using a zeta potential analyzer as shown in fig 5 according to the obtained zeta potential values mixing positively charged f go 6 8 2 6 mv with negatively charged mwcnts cooh 39 7 1 4 mv in a ratio of 20 80 showed the highest negative charge zeta potential 36 5 2 1 mv therefore this ratio was selected to be integrated within the membrane mixed matrix to enhance the membrane properties typical microstructure sem images of mwcnts mwcnts cooh go f go and f go mwcnts cooh are displayed in fig 6 the control mwcnts have the form of agglomerated bundles which are fragmented into separate tubes due to aggressive acid treatment during the oxidation process to form mwcnts cooh 26 fig 6a the go nanosheets are shaped with wave like surface morphology furthermore the f go nanosheets have a huge surface area and show some agglomeration due to vander waals forces or Ï Ï stacking as presented in fig 6b and c this confirms that the negatively charged mwcnts coohs have connected to the surface of amino f go nanosheets in hollow rod like shaped bundles this good arrangement could be attributed to the self assembly interactions between two oppositely charged nanomaterials 8 fig 6d shows the elemental mapping of the nanohybrid the presence of a nitrogen n atom verified the creation of multiple amide bonds and the existence of free amino groups on the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid to confirm that mwcnts cooh had been successfully prepared ft ir analysis was carried out as indicated in fig 7a the pristine mwcnts had a peak at 3420 cm 1 in the measured range due to the hydroxyl groups at the edges while new prominent peaks appeared at 1715 1390 and 1100 cm 1 after acid treatment which related to the typical peaks of carboxyl groups carbonyl groups and co stretching vibration modes respectively 34 the ft ir spectra of graphite in fig 7b showed no significant peaks while four distinct peaks were observed in the ft ir spectra of the go at 996 1330 1724 and 3400 cm 1 which correspond to vibrations of o from carbonyl groups coh of carboxyl groups cc and oh in water respectively the ftir spectra of f go revealed a new peak at 3120 cm 1 which confirmed the presence of nh due to the amidation reaction fig 7b 31 the ftir of the nanohybrid showed a strong wide peak in the region 2000 3500 cm 1 which is a characteristic of the stretching vibrations of secondary amide nh combined with oh groups as shown in fig 7c peaks identified in the f go and mwcnts cooh nanomaterials were detected in the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid confirming the formation of a self assembled nanohybrid as shown in fig 8c to validate the successful synthesis of f go and mwcnts cooh xrd was employed to determine the structure of the cellular units d spacing fig 8a illustrates the xrd pattern of graphite and go the graphite shows two distinct and sharp peaks 2Î¸ 26 5 and 54 5 specific to the 002 and 004 planes with d spacing of 3 2 and 1 5 respectively the data depict the normal graphite crystal structure the go exhibits a large diffraction peak at 2Î¸ 9 8 001 with a plane spacing of 8 7 and a 100 diffraction peak at 2Î¸ 44 5 with a d spacing of 2 0 indicating an effective go synthesis 29 the xrd patterns of mwcnts and mwcnts cooh are presented in fig 8b the 002 reflection of the hexagonal graphite structure with a d spacing of 3 6 may be indexed as the strong diffraction peak at 2Î¸ 26 the 100 graphitic planes are responsible for the peak at 43 which has a d spacing of 2 3 7 the diffraction peaks of mwcnts and mwcnts cooh are identical yet pristine mwcnts have the maximum intensity compared to mwcnt cooh as a result it can be inferred that when mwcnts were transformed into mwcnts cooh the semi crystalline structure of pristine mwcnts were somewhat changed to an amorphous structure 22 the xrd pattern of the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid is shown in fig 8c the diffraction peak at 9 5 was obtained from the go however it had a broader d spacing of 9 2 compared to the go d spacing of 8 7 furthermore two additional peaks were detected at 2Î¸ 26 and 43 which were obtained from the graphite like structure of mwcnts xrd patterns showed that the f go mwcnts cooh self assembled nanohybrid enhanced structural heterogeneity and interlayer distance more than either f go or mwcnts cooh alone 8 the tga results of mwcnts mwcnts cooh go f go and f go mwcnts cooh nanomaterials are shown in fig 9 thermal degradation of go with weight loss 20 occurred between 150 and 250 c in which it is related to the removal of oxygen related functional groups from the go surface f go has a similar thermal degradation trend between 100 and 300 c due to the decomposition of oxygen and other functional groups the pristine mwcnts showed more thermal stability therefore they decomposed after 550 c while the mwcnts cooh decomposed between 50 and 300 c with weight loss 55 the synthesized nanohybrid displayed thermal stability as it decomposed with weight loss 40 at 400 c 3 2 characterizations of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid based pla mixed matrix membranes 3 2 1 effect of nanohybrid on membrane morphology fig 10 displays the surface and cross sectional sem images of the pristine pla and mixed matrix membranes with various nanohybrid loadings incorporating f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid improved the porous structure of the membranes by increasing the pore size compared to pristine pla the pores became wider as the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid concentration increased in the membrane matrix from 1 5 to 6 wt as shown in fig 10a this could be attributed to the hydrophilic natÃ¼re of the nanohybrid which can lead to a high adsorption tendency allowing more water penetration during the non solvent induced phase separation process 30 the high asymmetrical structure of the fabricated mixed matrix membranes including the top dense layer and finger like sponge cavities sublayer was verified by sem cross sectional images as illustrated in fig 10b the creation of finger like and spongy macrovoid feature was expected because of the differential in solubility rate among the organic additives and pla the f go mwcnts cooh mixed matrix membranes have a wider and longer finger like sponge porous structure than the pristine pla membrane which has comparatively tiny finger like pores this has a favourable impact on the pure water flow during the filtration process 34 3 2 2 pore size porosity and wettability properties of mixed matrix membranes the mean pore size increased from 1 9 0 1 nm in m0 to 4 1 0 1 nm in m3 in contrast the porosity of the fabricated membranes reduced from 65 2 1 2 in m0 to 56 1 1 2 in m3 which could be related to the enhancement in the viscosity of the dope solution as the nanohybrid content increased causing a slower immersion precipitation fig 11 28 water contact angle analysis was used to investigate membrane hydrophilicity fig 12 shows the values obtained for the contact angles of the membranes the results revealed that the hydrophilicity of the membranes increased as the loadings of f go mwcnts cooh increased as the contact angle values decreased from 73 4 1 3 for the pristine membrane to 51 9 1 1 for the m3 membrane this reduction in the contact angle values is due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups carboxyl hydroxyl and amine in the self assembled f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid 3 2 3 surface chemistry of mixed matrix membranes the surface chemistry of the created membranes was studied using ft ir fig 13a and b show the ft ir spectra of the membranes with various contents of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid the typical absorption peaks were discovered at 1700 cm 1 for the stretching vibration of co and 678 cm 1 for the bending vibration of the ch ch3 plane because pla contains ester groups co 10 the peak at 1090 cm 1 was also obtained aside from the 724 cm 1 band which indicates the cc stretching vibration additional pla peaks were detected at 2947 and 2997 cm 1 corresponding to the asymmetric stretching vibration 35 the carbonyl absorption of pvp is shown by the 1690 cm 1 peak fig 13a 14 finally the nanohybrid peaks at 1429 and 1710 cm 1 correspond to conh and cn asymmetric stretching respectively as illustrated in fig 13b 8 confirmation of the successful production of pla mixed matrix membranes was obtained despite the membranes identical broad spectrum properties and slight variations in peak intensity the strength of these two peaks grows and becomes sharper as the nanohybrid content of the composite membranes increases 26 33 xrd was performed to examine the structure of the pristine pla and nanohybrid membranes as presented in fig 13c all membranes showed an intensity peak at 2Î¸ 16 24 and 27 a similar pattern for pla as described in the literature indicating that pla has a semi crystalline structure and no significant changes occurred after the nanohybrid was mixed with the pla membranes matrix 10 24 3 2 4 performance of mixed matrix membranes using synthetic wastewater the results revealed that the incorporation of the hydrophilic nanohybrid f go mwcnts cooh with various concentrations from 1 5 to 6 wt within the membrane matrix improved the water permeability of the fabricated membranes from 27 3 1 6 to 95 3 1 4 l m2h for m0 and m3 respectively as shown in fig 14 these findings are consistent with the results of mean pore size porosity sem and contact angle trends the addition of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid up to 3 wt into the nanohybrid membrane matrix slightly improved the removal of bsa and ha rejection and reached the threshold value however when the nanohybrids were incorporated at 6 wt the removal efficiency decreased because of the formation of larger pores as shown in fig 15 the m2 membrane achieved the highest percentages of bsa and ha removal 96 and 98 due to its morphological feature and moderate pore size values relative to other membranes m2 membranes significant bsa and ha rejection might be explained by the charge steric effect and size exclusion mechanisms which were generated by the inclusion of a highly negative nanohybrid into the membrane matrix the negative surface charge of the fabricated membranes augmented as the content of f go mwcnts cooh increased this improves the repulsion forces among the negative bsa ha and the membrane surface 14 3 2 5 antifouling characteristics of mixed matrix membranes utilising synthetic wastewater the fouling potential of the prepared mixed matrix membranes was studied using bsa and ha solutions as organic foulants as shown in table 2 several factors affect the antifouling properties of the membrane including surface hydrophilicity charge porosity and membrane pore size the addition of the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid increased the surface hydrophilicity of the mixed matrix membrane which resulted in improved fouling resistance of the membranes as a hydration layer formed on the membrane surface that prevented the adhesion accumulation of organic foulants 27 the physical deposition of ha eventually resulted in the formation of a fouling layer on the top of the membrane surface which was quickly removed by washing 4 however bsa is more likely to adsorb on the membrane surface and or inside the membrane pores because of hydrophobic interactions resulting in more significant membrane fouling the incorporation of f go mwcnts cooh within the pla membrane reduced the r t r r and in values compared to the pristine pla membrane based on the findings of fouling testing it was noticed that mixed matrix membranes showed less fouling tendency as the incorporation of nanohybrid mitigates the deposition adsorption of foulants and the formation of a cake layer on the surface of the membrane or within its pores thus the foulant can be easily washed out using di water resulting in superior antifouling performance for mixed matrix membranes the frr values of the prepared membranes were calculated to reflect the ease of recovering the water permeation by washing the membrane after fouling in fig 16 the frr of the pla membranes increased from 88 to 94 when nanohybrid concentration increased from 0 to 6 wt using bsa solution as a foulant this could be attributed to the enhancement of membrane hydrophilicity that mitigated the membrane fouling a similar trend has been obtained using the ha solution however the frr values of the mixed matrix membranes in the case of ha were better than those of the bsa solution this could be ascribed to their different fouling mechanisms as shown in fig 17 the removal mechanisms of ha and bsa could include the size exclusion and the gibbs donnan effect 17 the static adsorption approach was used to evaluate the antifouling capacity of the pristine and mixed matrix membranes as shown in table 3 increasing the nanohybrid concentration reduced the equilibrium adsorption quantity of foulants which is highly related to their hydrophilicity based on the predicted q values it was found that improving the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane reduces foulant adsorption 3 2 6 post filtration characterization using synthetic wastewater further post filtration characterizations were performed using the optimum m2 membrane the surface sem images of m2 membranes post bsa and ha filtration and after di water washing are shown in fig 18 the images obtained from the fabricated m2 membranes revealed that ha accumulated on the surface of the membrane during filtration the fouling layer formed because of physical deposition was quickly removed by washing fig 18a due to hydrophobic interactions the bsa is more likely to get adsorption on the membrane s surface or become stuck inside its pores resulting in more severe membrane fouling fig 18b in addition the membrane exhibited adsorption interactions among the bsa protein or ha and the membrane surface in the ft ir spectra after filtration a further band shift of the amide group at 1633 cm 1 nh stretch was obtained as shown in fig 19a 2 the membranes were rinsed with di water and ft ir analysis was performed fig 19a it was found that the bsa peak disappeared the results confirmed that the washing procedure with water was efficient in eliminating bsa foulant for the ft ir spectra after ha filtration the binding interactions between ha and the membrane surface were verified by observing the peak of humic acid at 1100 cm 1 co stretch or oh deformation of cooh 9 the disappearance of this peak after washing proves the water washing effectiveness with no need for chemical usage the xrd spectra of the m2 membrane before and after washing the membrane after filtrating bsa and ha solutions are shown in fig 20 based on the obtained spectra the intensity of the peak changes due to the presence of bsa and ha as shown in fig 20 b and c the peaks in fig 20 a and d have intensities similar to those in fig 13c this confirmed the high anti fouling behaviour of the m2 membrane tga analysis was performed to investigate the thermal stability characteristics of pristine pla and f go mwcnts cooh based pla mixed matrix membranes to confirm the influence of nanohybrid on the polymer chain stiffness tga was utilised to evaluate the thermal stabilities as a function of weight at a heating rate of 10 c min the m2 membrane exhibited thermal decomposition in three phases including pla dehydration thermal fracture of the molecular chain and thermal degradation of adjacent functional groups as presented in fig 21 the m2 membrane exhibited high thermal stability and degraded at 400 c compared to m0 thus the addition of the nanohybrid increased the membranes thermal stability 3 2 7 analyzing the performance of the m2 membrane using raw wastewater municipal wastewater was taken from a local wwtp and utilised for five filtering cycles to test the m2 membrane s performance and fouling behaviour at the end of each cycle the tested membrane was cleaned with di water physically and the cod removal was measured as shown in fig 22 the cod removal percentages of the cycles were similar indicating that the membrane had stable cod removal and functionality the real images of the m2 membrane before raw wastewater filtration fig 23a after raw wastewater filtration fig 23b and after washing with di water fig 23c demonstrate that the membrane surface was sufficiently physically cleaned with di water to further assess the anti fouling properties and reusability of the m2 membrane the frr was studied as shown in table 4 the m2 membrane had a high frr almost 92 with just water washing in the first filtering cycle this may be attributed to the development of a loose and unstable fouled layer on the membrane that can easily be removed the results are consistent with the results of static bsa adsorption result indicating that the presence of nanohybrids within the membrane matrix improved antifouling properties the m2 membrane s hydrophilic character was confirmed by ca analysis due to the incorporation of the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid furthermore after the five filtration cycles the frr values of m2 decreased slightly from 92 to 71 confirming the practical stability and high resistance to fouling table 5 shows a comparison of the findings from this study with the literature the comparison with literature was used in order to clarify that the optimum membrane m2 demonstrated superior pure water flux and ha and bsa removal concerning other modified polymeric membranes 4 conclusion biodegradable pla membranes are an attractive substitute for non renewable petrochemical based polymeric membranes various pla membranes were successfully integrated with different loadings of the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid to further enhance the characteristics of the pla membrane through the immersion precipitation method increasing the concentration of the nanohybrid improved the water flux and antifouling properties by increasing the highly negatively charged surface pore size and surface wettability of the membranes the frr values of the prepared membranes after bsa and ha filtration increased from 89 to 95 and from 94 to 98 respectively when the nanohybrid concentration was increased from 0 to 6 wt in addition m2 showed superior rejection rates for bsa and ha of 96 and 98 respectively furthermore the m2 membrane exhibited excellent fouling resistance when treating raw wastewater with frr of about 92 requiring only hydraulic washing the results of this work show that f go mwcnts cooh based pla mixed matrix membranes have great potential

respectively and the pure water flux was increased to almost 80 l m2hbar compared to the neat pla membrane 27 l m2hbar without compromising the high organic removal efficiency according to the results

keywords membrane wastewater treatment carbon nanotubes graphene oxide biodegradable polymer nanohybrid data availability all data generated or analysed during this study are included in this submitted article 1 introduction polymeric ultrafiltration uf membranes based on natural and or petroleum are widely used for the purification of domestic and industrial wastewater due to their chemical resistance sustainability and mechanical and thermal stabilities 12 polymeric membranes have garnered a lot of interest in both industrial activities and academic research studies renewable biodegradable polymeric materials are crucial for membrane technology since petroleum based polymers cannot be recycled and have detrimental consequences on the ecosystem and human health 15 biodegradable polymeric membranes unlike synthetic polymers can be composted after their life cycle is complete through the composting process thus mitigating the negative environmental consequences 12 polylactic acid pla is a decomposable polymer that can be utilised in membrane production instead of conventional fossil based materials membrane fouling has always been regarded as a critical challenge because it has a major impact on the efficiency of the treatment systems as well as the quality of the produced water common colloidal particles in wastewater including polysaccharides bovine serum albumin bsa humic acid ha and alginate are causing membrane organic fouling throughout the filtration process 32 various studies have investigated the augmentation of fouling resistance of polymeric membranes by integrating nanoparticles into their matrix the most used nanoparticles to develop membranes performance include graphene oxide go and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts due to their desirable mechanical chemical and physical characteristics and their distinctive nanostructure go nanosheets disperse rapidly in water and other solvents due to the occurrence of hydrophilic groups including carbonyl carboxyl epoxy and hydroxyl which grant go nanosheets to remain stable in various solutions the remarkable amphiphilic nature of go nanosheets enhances the interaction between the solvent and the non solvent through the immersion precipitation membrane fabrication method 6 13 the performance of the membrane can be improved by functionalizing go nanoparticles f go with other functional materials which can increase their dispersibility and allow them to reach their maximum potential 1 3 mwcnts have been widely used in many applications due to their excellent features such as high porosity flexibility and antibacterial property however they have limited dispersibility in organic solvents because of van der waals forces i e having a strong bundling phenomenon as a result several research studies were reported on the functionalization of the surface of mwcnts to improve their dispersibility 23 25 33 various studies have been executed to advance the membranes performance for wastewater treatment by incorporating go and mwcnts yang et al 33 developed a membrane with better fouling resistance properties by blending go silver nanoparticles into a cellulose acetate ca membrane the wettability and the antibacterial characteristics of the membrane were improved resulting in 86 inactivation of escherichia coli after 2 h of contact with the membrane hu and mi 16 synthesized a membrane through the vacuum filtration of go suspension using aluminium oxide as a substrate decorated with polydopamine and then thermally treated to enhance the connection with the support and boost the membrane s stability the fabricated membranes had a water flux of 48 4 l m2h and 99 7 rejection of nacl at 90 c various research on membranes for wastewater treatment that incorporate go and mwcnts to improve filtration properties were conducted however there are still a number of issues to address in terms of fouling and permeability when using a biodegradable polymeric membrane this study aims to enhance the properties of pla polymeric membranes using f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid more specifically the synthesis and incorporation of self assembled f go and mwcnts cooh f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid into the biodegradable pla membrane matrix were investigated it is expected to enhance the overall permeability by creating channels between the nanohybrids and pla to impart antifouling and high rejection to the synthetic bsa and ha solutions to the best of our knowledge the effect of incorporating f go mwcnts cooh into pla polymeric membrane matrix in treating wastewater has not been studied before the f go mwcnts cooh based pla membranes were further evaluated using raw municipal wastewater to ensure their durability membrane characterization using sem ft ir xrd contact angle porosity and pore size was also carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts purity 98 length 3 6

with a resistivity of 15 mÏ cm at 25 c was used in the coagulation bath the quick start bradford protein 1 dye reagent was used in the fouling study hach dr3900 uv vis spectrophotometer was utilised to measure chemical oxygen demand cod concentration in raw wastewater feed and filtrate after treatment hach hq40d was used to measure the ph of treated and untreated wastewater raw wastewater samples were collected from a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp in abu dhabi uae before the filtration experiments no prior treatment was performed on the influent raw wastewater was stored in the fridge at 4 c and well mixed prior to the filtration tests the raw wastewater used in this study had a ph of 7 2 and a cod concentration of 318 mg l 2 2 synthesis and characterizations of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid 2 2 1 synthesis of f go nanosheets go was prepared using the simplified hummer method 6 13 to a volume ratio of 9 1 sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid 3 g of natural graphite flakes were mixed with the previous solution with stirring for 3 min 21 then 18 g of potassium permanganate kmno4 was carefully added to avoid a rapid exothermic reaction to ensure the complete oxidization of graphite the solution was under stirring for 3 d at room temperature the oxidation process was stopped by adding hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and then a bright yellow solution was obtained as an indication of the high oxidation of graphite di water and 1 m aqueous solution of hcl was added to wash the intercalated graphite oxide 3 4 times until a ph of 5 6 was achieved the collected viscous solution was further purified by dialysis using cellulose tubes the go filled dialysis tubes were immersed in a beaker containing di and stirred for 2 to 3 d the dialysis tubes are semi permeable membrane used to remove very small molecular weight solutes from solution and re adjusting the solution in a new buffer di water the di water in the beaker was changed with fresh water every 12 h then the purified go solution was collected and stored in an air tight bottle the preparation of the amino f go was carried out according to the literature 20 in which 0 01 mmol of edc and 0 02 mmol of nhs were added at room temperature and left to stir for 4 h around 0 01 mmol of ed was added to the go solution dropwise the solution was alkaline however the reaction favors the acidic condition therefore hcl was added to ensure that the solution was acidic ph 3 and kept stirring overnight then the solution was washed and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 30 min with di water until it reached a neutral ph condition the prepared f go has a concentration of 3 7 mg ml edc nhs acts as an intermediate crosslinker to accelerate the amidation reaction by creating bulky ester groups for the ed to easily react with the carboxyl groups r cooh on the go nanosheets 36 as shown in fig 1a the go colour changed from dark brown to light brown fig 1b 2 2 2 synthesis of mwcnts cooh negatively charged mwcnts cooh were fabricated as shown in fig 2 11 briefly 2 g of pristine mwcnts were treated with h2so4 and hno3 with a volume ratio the solution was maintained for 30 min at 25 c under stirring then the solution was slowly heated to a temperature of 70 c in an oil bath for 3 5 h to stop the reaction the solution was allowed to cool and washed several times with di water until the ph of the collected mwcnts cooh solution was almost neutral the final concentration of the solution was about 8 5 mg ml 2 2 3 preparation of negatively charged f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid the electrostatic co precipitation approach was used to obtain the self assembled negative charged f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid the nanohybrid was prepared by mixing a 20 80 volume ratio of positively charged f go 5 73 g mol and negatively charged mwcnts cooh 8 5 g mol as shown in fig 3 both f go and mwcnts cooh were diluted to a concentration of 1 5 mg ml by adding di water and then sonicated for 30 min to get well dispersed solutions under vigorous stirring the f go solution was added dropwise to the mwcnts cooh solution to make self assembled nanohybrids the electrostatic attraction between positively charged f go and mwcnts cooh leads to self assembly and the solution starts to coagulate the solution was left untouched for 2 d to precipitate the nanohybrids then centrifuged 8000 rpm 30 min followed by freeze drying for 3 d to obtain dried self assembled nanohybrids the ratio of f go and mwcnts cooh was altered to obtain differently charged nanohybrids 2 3 characterization of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid to confirm the successful formation of the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid several characterizations were performed such as tga netzsch sta 449 f3 jupiter xrd panalytical empyrean 40 kv and 35 ma sem quanta 250 esem and eds were performed furthermore the zetasizer 7 13 malvern panalytical instruments ltd was used to investigate the surface charge of nanomaterials in di water with a ph of 7 and a concentration of 0 2 mg ml ft ir spectroscopy was carried out to examine the functional groups of the produced nanohybrid bruker vertex 80v spectrometer furthermore the synthesized self assembled f go mwcnts cooh was compared to those of other nanoparticles such as pristine mwcnts mwcnts cooh go and f go using the same characterization analyses 2 4 fabrication of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid based pla mixed matrix membranes all of the f go mwcnts cooh based pla nanohybrid membranes in this study were synthesized using the immersion precipitation method the nanohybrid with different contents was sonicated in dmac solvent for 2 h and then pla and pvp were dissolved subsequently then the prepared dope solutions were used to fabricate the membranes 18 the fabricated membranes were marked as m0 m1 m2 and m3 the concentrations of the fabricated membranes are presented in table 1 fig 4a illustrates the procedures used to fabricate the membranes and fig 4b shows real photos of the fabricated mixed matrix membranes they were cut into circular discs and secured with o rings to match the dimensions of the uf batch type cell the active membrane surface area was approximately 12 56 cm2 2 5 characterization of mixed matrix membranes sem and eds were utilised to study the morphological characteristics and surface chemical structure of the membranes by capturing surface and cross sectional images of membranes before the analysis a coating procedure was performed using platinum to form a 10 nm layer on the top of the membrane surface to enhance image quality the surface functional groups of the produced mixed matrix membranes were assessed using ft ir analysis xrd was used to evaluate the crystallinity of the produced membranes the prepared membranes hydrophilicity was obtained by determining the wca using a sessile drop technique utilising a contact angle analyzer krÃ¼ss germany 5 Î¼l droplet of di water was dropped onto the membrane surface using a micro syringe 19 to capture the image of the water droplet to reduce experimental error the average values of five contact angle measurements were obtained the porosity of the membranes was measured using the dry wet technique 18 2 6 performance of mixed matrix membranes the designed mixed matrix membranes were assessed for the rejection of synthetic bsa and ha and compared to the neat pla membrane the preparation of bsa and ha solutions as well as the performance of the mixed matrix membranes followed the same procedures as in our prior work 18 the flux recovery ratio frr was performed to measure the fouling resistance of the prepared membranes the total fouling affinity r t of the membranes following the filtration of foulants and reversible r r and irreversible r ir protein fouling were obtained to further investigate the fouling properties of the manufactured membranes equilibrium adsorption quantity q was computed to further investigate the antifouling characteristics of mixed matrix membranes the fabricated mixed matrix membrane s performance and fouling behaviour were subsequently evaluated via five consecutive filtration cycles utilising untreated raw municipal wastewater in order to ensure the membrane s durability the membrane was cleaned with di water physically and hach dr 3900 uv vis spectrophotometer was used to determine the cod concentration in the feed and filtrate samples raw municipal wastewater with 318 mg l cod concentrations 8 3 ms cm conductivity and a ph of 7 2 was collected from a local wwtp in abu dhabi uae and stored at 4 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid the surface charge of the prepared nanohybrid was determined using a zeta potential analyzer as shown in fig 5 according to the obtained zeta potential values mixing positively charged f go 6 8 2 6 mv with negatively charged mwcnts cooh 39 7 1 4 mv in a ratio of 20 80 showed the highest negative charge zeta potential 36 5 2 1 mv therefore this ratio was selected to be integrated within the membrane mixed matrix to enhance the membrane properties typical microstructure sem images of mwcnts mwcnts cooh go f go and f go mwcnts cooh are displayed in fig 6 the control mwcnts have the form of agglomerated bundles which are fragmented into separate tubes due to aggressive acid treatment during the oxidation process to form mwcnts cooh 26 fig 6a the go nanosheets are shaped with wave like surface morphology furthermore the f go nanosheets have a huge surface area and show some agglomeration due to vander waals forces or Ï Ï stacking as presented in fig 6b and c this confirms that the negatively charged mwcnts coohs have connected to the surface of amino f go nanosheets in hollow rod like shaped bundles this good arrangement could be attributed to the self assembly interactions between two oppositely charged nanomaterials 8 fig 6d shows the elemental mapping of the nanohybrid the presence of a nitrogen n atom verified the creation of multiple amide bonds and the existence of free amino groups on the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid to confirm that mwcnts cooh had been successfully prepared ft ir analysis was carried out as indicated in fig 7a the pristine mwcnts had a peak at 3420 cm 1 in the measured range due to the hydroxyl groups at the edges while new prominent peaks appeared at 1715 1390 and 1100 cm 1 after acid treatment which related to the typical peaks of carboxyl groups carbonyl groups and co stretching vibration modes respectively 34 the ft ir spectra of graphite in fig 7b showed no significant peaks while four distinct peaks were observed in the ft ir spectra of the go at 996 1330 1724 and 3400 cm 1 which correspond to vibrations of o from carbonyl groups coh of carboxyl groups cc and oh in water respectively the ftir spectra of f go revealed a new peak at 3120 cm 1 which confirmed the presence of nh due to the amidation reaction fig 7b 31 the ftir of the nanohybrid showed a strong wide peak in the region 2000 3500 cm 1 which is a characteristic of the stretching vibrations of secondary amide nh combined with oh groups as shown in fig 7c peaks identified in the f go and mwcnts cooh nanomaterials were detected in the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid confirming the formation of a self assembled nanohybrid as shown in fig 8c to validate the successful synthesis of f go and mwcnts cooh xrd was employed to determine the structure of the cellular units d spacing fig 8a illustrates the xrd pattern of graphite and go the graphite shows two distinct and sharp peaks 2Î¸ 26 5 and 54 5 specific to the 002 and 004 planes with d spacing of 3 2 and 1 5 respectively the data depict the normal graphite crystal structure the go exhibits a large diffraction peak at 2Î¸ 9 8 001 with a plane spacing of 8 7 and a 100 diffraction peak at 2Î¸ 44 5 with a d spacing of 2 0 indicating an effective go synthesis 29 the xrd patterns of mwcnts and mwcnts cooh are presented in fig 8b the 002 reflection of the hexagonal graphite structure with a d spacing of 3 6 may be indexed as the strong diffraction peak at 2Î¸ 26 the 100 graphitic planes are responsible for the peak at 43 which has a d spacing of 2 3 7 the diffraction peaks of mwcnts and mwcnts cooh are identical yet pristine mwcnts have the maximum intensity compared to mwcnt cooh as a result it can be inferred that when mwcnts were transformed into mwcnts cooh the semi crystalline structure of pristine mwcnts were somewhat changed to an amorphous structure 22 the xrd pattern of the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid is shown in fig 8c the diffraction peak at 9 5 was obtained from the go however it had a broader d spacing of 9 2 compared to the go d spacing of 8 7 furthermore two additional peaks were detected at 2Î¸ 26 and 43 which were obtained from the graphite like structure of mwcnts xrd patterns showed that the f go mwcnts cooh self assembled nanohybrid enhanced structural heterogeneity and interlayer distance more than either f go or mwcnts cooh alone 8 the tga results of mwcnts mwcnts cooh go f go and f go mwcnts cooh nanomaterials are shown in fig 9 thermal degradation of go with weight loss 20 occurred between 150 and 250 c in which it is related to the removal of oxygen related functional groups from the go surface f go has a similar thermal degradation trend between 100 and 300 c due to the decomposition of oxygen and other functional groups the pristine mwcnts showed more thermal stability therefore they decomposed after 550 c while the mwcnts cooh decomposed between 50 and 300 c with weight loss 55 the synthesized nanohybrid displayed thermal stability as it decomposed with weight loss 40 at 400 c 3 2 characterizations of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid based pla mixed matrix membranes 3 2 1 effect of nanohybrid on membrane morphology fig 10 displays the surface and cross sectional sem images of the pristine pla and mixed matrix membranes with various nanohybrid loadings incorporating f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid improved the porous structure of the membranes by increasing the pore size compared to pristine pla the pores became wider as the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid concentration increased in the membrane matrix from 1 5 to 6 wt as shown in fig 10a this could be attributed to the hydrophilic natÃ¼re of the nanohybrid which can lead to a high adsorption tendency allowing more water penetration during the non solvent induced phase separation process 30 the high asymmetrical structure of the fabricated mixed matrix membranes including the top dense layer and finger like sponge cavities sublayer was verified by sem cross sectional images as illustrated in fig 10b the creation of finger like and spongy macrovoid feature was expected because of the differential in solubility rate among the organic additives and pla the f go mwcnts cooh mixed matrix membranes have a wider and longer finger like sponge porous structure than the pristine pla membrane which has comparatively tiny finger like pores this has a favourable impact on the pure water flow during the filtration process 34 3 2 2 pore size porosity and wettability properties of mixed matrix membranes the mean pore size increased from 1 9 0 1 nm in m0 to 4 1 0 1 nm in m3 in contrast the porosity of the fabricated membranes reduced from 65 2 1 2 in m0 to 56 1 1 2 in m3 which could be related to the enhancement in the viscosity of the dope solution as the nanohybrid content increased causing a slower immersion precipitation fig 11 28 water contact angle analysis was used to investigate membrane hydrophilicity fig 12 shows the values obtained for the contact angles of the membranes the results revealed that the hydrophilicity of the membranes increased as the loadings of f go mwcnts cooh increased as the contact angle values decreased from 73 4 1 3 for the pristine membrane to 51 9 1 1 for the m3 membrane this reduction in the contact angle values is due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups carboxyl hydroxyl and amine in the self assembled f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid 3 2 3 surface chemistry of mixed matrix membranes the surface chemistry of the created membranes was studied using ft ir fig 13a and b show the ft ir spectra of the membranes with various contents of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid the typical absorption peaks were discovered at 1700 cm 1 for the stretching vibration of co and 678 cm 1 for the bending vibration of the ch ch3 plane because pla contains ester groups co 10 the peak at 1090 cm 1 was also obtained aside from the 724 cm 1 band which indicates the cc stretching vibration additional pla peaks were detected at 2947 and 2997 cm 1 corresponding to the asymmetric stretching vibration 35 the carbonyl absorption of pvp is shown by the 1690 cm 1 peak fig 13a 14 finally the nanohybrid peaks at 1429 and 1710 cm 1 correspond to conh and cn asymmetric stretching respectively as illustrated in fig 13b 8 confirmation of the successful production of pla mixed matrix membranes was obtained despite the membranes identical broad spectrum properties and slight variations in peak intensity the strength of these two peaks grows and becomes sharper as the nanohybrid content of the composite membranes increases 26 33 xrd was performed to examine the structure of the pristine pla and nanohybrid membranes as presented in fig 13c all membranes showed an intensity peak at 2Î¸ 16 24 and 27 a similar pattern for pla as described in the literature indicating that pla has a semi crystalline structure and no significant changes occurred after the nanohybrid was mixed with the pla membranes matrix 10 24 3 2 4 performance of mixed matrix membranes using synthetic wastewater the results revealed that the incorporation of the hydrophilic nanohybrid f go mwcnts cooh with various concentrations from 1 5 to 6 wt within the membrane matrix improved the water permeability of the fabricated membranes from 27 3 1 6 to 95 3 1 4 l m2h for m0 and m3 respectively as shown in fig 14 these findings are consistent with the results of mean pore size porosity sem and contact angle trends the addition of f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid up to 3 wt into the nanohybrid membrane matrix slightly improved the removal of bsa and ha rejection and reached the threshold value however when the nanohybrids were incorporated at 6 wt the removal efficiency decreased because of the formation of larger pores as shown in fig 15 the m2 membrane achieved the highest percentages of bsa and ha removal 96 and 98 due to its morphological feature and moderate pore size values relative to other membranes m2 membranes significant bsa and ha rejection might be explained by the charge steric effect and size exclusion mechanisms which were generated by the inclusion of a highly negative nanohybrid into the membrane matrix the negative surface charge of the fabricated membranes augmented as the content of f go mwcnts cooh increased this improves the repulsion forces among the negative bsa ha and the membrane surface 14 3 2 5 antifouling characteristics of mixed matrix membranes utilising synthetic wastewater the fouling potential of the prepared mixed matrix membranes was studied using bsa and ha solutions as organic foulants as shown in table 2 several factors affect the antifouling properties of the membrane including surface hydrophilicity charge porosity and membrane pore size the addition of the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid increased the surface hydrophilicity of the mixed matrix membrane which resulted in improved fouling resistance of the membranes as a hydration layer formed on the membrane surface that prevented the adhesion accumulation of organic foulants 27 the physical deposition of ha eventually resulted in the formation of a fouling layer on the top of the membrane surface which was quickly removed by washing 4 however bsa is more likely to adsorb on the membrane surface and or inside the membrane pores because of hydrophobic interactions resulting in more significant membrane fouling the incorporation of f go mwcnts cooh within the pla membrane reduced the r t r r and in values compared to the pristine pla membrane based on the findings of fouling testing it was noticed that mixed matrix membranes showed less fouling tendency as the incorporation of nanohybrid mitigates the deposition adsorption of foulants and the formation of a cake layer on the surface of the membrane or within its pores thus the foulant can be easily washed out using di water resulting in superior antifouling performance for mixed matrix membranes the frr values of the prepared membranes were calculated to reflect the ease of recovering the water permeation by washing the membrane after fouling in fig 16 the frr of the pla membranes increased from 88 to 94 when nanohybrid concentration increased from 0 to 6 wt using bsa solution as a foulant this could be attributed to the enhancement of membrane hydrophilicity that mitigated the membrane fouling a similar trend has been obtained using the ha solution however the frr values of the mixed matrix membranes in the case of ha were better than those of the bsa solution this could be ascribed to their different fouling mechanisms as shown in fig 17 the removal mechanisms of ha and bsa could include the size exclusion and the gibbs donnan effect 17 the static adsorption approach was used to evaluate the antifouling capacity of the pristine and mixed matrix membranes as shown in table 3 increasing the nanohybrid concentration reduced the equilibrium adsorption quantity of foulants which is highly related to their hydrophilicity based on the predicted q values it was found that improving the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane reduces foulant adsorption 3 2 6 post filtration characterization using synthetic wastewater further post filtration characterizations were performed using the optimum m2 membrane the surface sem images of m2 membranes post bsa and ha filtration and after di water washing are shown in fig 18 the images obtained from the fabricated m2 membranes revealed that ha accumulated on the surface of the membrane during filtration the fouling layer formed because of physical deposition was quickly removed by washing fig 18a due to hydrophobic interactions the bsa is more likely to get adsorption on the membrane s surface or become stuck inside its pores resulting in more severe membrane fouling fig 18b in addition the membrane exhibited adsorption interactions among the bsa protein or ha and the membrane surface in the ft ir spectra after filtration a further band shift of the amide group at 1633 cm 1 nh stretch was obtained as shown in fig 19a 2 the membranes were rinsed with di water and ft ir analysis was performed fig 19a it was found that the bsa peak disappeared the results confirmed that the washing procedure with water was efficient in eliminating bsa foulant for the ft ir spectra after ha filtration the binding interactions between ha and the membrane surface were verified by observing the peak of humic acid at 1100 cm 1 co stretch or oh deformation of cooh 9 the disappearance of this peak after washing proves the water washing effectiveness with no need for chemical usage the xrd spectra of the m2 membrane before and after washing the membrane after filtrating bsa and ha solutions are shown in fig 20 based on the obtained spectra the intensity of the peak changes due to the presence of bsa and ha as shown in fig 20 b and c the peaks in fig 20 a and d have intensities similar to those in fig 13c this confirmed the high anti fouling behaviour of the m2 membrane tga analysis was performed to investigate the thermal stability characteristics of pristine pla and f go mwcnts cooh based pla mixed matrix membranes to confirm the influence of nanohybrid on the polymer chain stiffness tga was utilised to evaluate the thermal stabilities as a function of weight at a heating rate of 10 c min the m2 membrane exhibited thermal decomposition in three phases including pla dehydration thermal fracture of the molecular chain and thermal degradation of adjacent functional groups as presented in fig 21 the m2 membrane exhibited high thermal stability and degraded at 400 c compared to m0 thus the addition of the nanohybrid increased the membranes thermal stability 3 2 7 analyzing the performance of the m2 membrane using raw wastewater municipal wastewater was taken from a local wwtp and utilised for five filtering cycles to test the m2 membrane s performance and fouling behaviour at the end of each cycle the tested membrane was cleaned with di water physically and the cod removal was measured as shown in fig 22 the cod removal percentages of the cycles were similar indicating that the membrane had stable cod removal and functionality the real images of the m2 membrane before raw wastewater filtration fig 23a after raw wastewater filtration fig 23b and after washing with di water fig 23c demonstrate that the membrane surface was sufficiently physically cleaned with di water to further assess the anti fouling properties and reusability of the m2 membrane the frr was studied as shown in table 4 the m2 membrane had a high frr almost 92 with just water washing in the first filtering cycle this may be attributed to the development of a loose and unstable fouled layer on the membrane that can easily be removed the results are consistent with the results of static bsa adsorption result indicating that the presence of nanohybrids within the membrane matrix improved antifouling properties the m2 membrane s hydrophilic character was confirmed by ca analysis due to the incorporation of the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid furthermore after the five filtration cycles the frr values of m2 decreased slightly from 92 to 71 confirming the practical stability and high resistance to fouling table 5 shows a comparison of the findings from this study with the literature the comparison with literature was used in order to clarify that the optimum membrane m2 demonstrated superior pure water flux and ha and bsa removal concerning other modified polymeric membranes 4 conclusion biodegradable pla membranes are an attractive substitute for non renewable petrochemical based polymeric membranes various pla membranes were successfully integrated with different loadings of the f go mwcnts cooh nanohybrid to further enhance the characteristics of the pla membrane through the immersion precipitation method increasing the concentration of the nanohybrid improved the water flux and antifouling properties by increasing the highly negatively charged surface pore size and surface wettability of the membranes the frr values of the prepared membranes after bsa and ha filtration increased from 89 to 95 and from 94 to 98 respectively when the nanohybrid concentration was increased from 0 to 6 wt in addition m2 showed superior rejection rates for bsa and ha of 96 and 98 respectively furthermore the m2 membrane exhibited excellent fouling resistance when treating raw wastewater with frr of about 92 requiring only hydraulic washing the results of this work show that f go mwcnts cooh based pla mixed matrix membranes have great potential

development nowadays therefore accessing to clean water remains a global challenge to human civilization at present 1 2 among the numerous strategies that previously been proposed to alleviate the shortage of freshwater solar enabled evaporation is one of the most eco friendly approach to utilize inexhaustible solar energy for obtaining freshwater via separating solute and solvent from abundant brine water in globe 3 4 however traditional solar driven evaporation process has the drawback of low efficiency in solar to vapour conversion interfacial steam generation model which enable to localize the generated thermal into thin liquid air interface has been thus emerging as a promising research hotspot that attracted tremendous interest and dedicated with significant efforts in desalination in past few years 5 18 owing to the feature that solar driven evaporation largely relies upon the utilization of solar irradiation superior performance in photo thermal conversion is the prerequisite for high efficiency photo thermal interfacial evaporation which depends upon exploring sunlight absorbing materials with characterizations of broad and strong sunlight adsorption so far various kinds of photothermal materials including metallic 19 21 semiconductive 22 23 carbon based materials 24 26 and polymers 27 28 have been developed in this field nevertheless although these materials possess ideal solar absorbance in full spectrum of solar incident 2 5 25 Î¼m thermal emittance over the long wavelength infrared region 2 5 25 Î¼m is also so high that heat loss via thermal radiation is significant as well severely impeding the effective utilization of solar incident to overcome the drawback of these traditional photothermal materials a set of special materials with spectrally selective performance which simultaneously characterize high solar absorptance over spectrum of solar incident and low thermal emittance in infrared region have been developing for years for the reason that infrared reflective bottom layer is necessarily a solid substrate for infrared reflection in solar selective absorbing material this special type of solar absorber is different from conventional porous solar absorbers unable to provide pores and path for water supply and vapour escape one strategy proposed before for applying such ordinary photothermal material is to design separating structure for dividing the photo thermal layer with steam generation layer by carefully separating an integrated device with one area for solar absorption and the other area for steam generation solar collection absorbers can completely avoid to be salt covering when desalinating brine water without resulting into deterioration of optical absorption properties in long term operation a number of studies for instance wang s group 29 creatively designed a 3d cup structure with its photothermal interface dividing from evaporation surface realizing stable performance in long term desalination moreover a contactless structure proposed by chen et al 30 has employed the commercial spectrally selective solar absorbers by taking advantage of such concept of separation as well efficiently generating hot steam via thermal concentration another extensively studied model that also belongs to this separation concept is janus structure which limits the evaporation at the hydrophobic hydrophilic interface in spite of common superiority in salt resistance the aforementioned separation concept faces paradox between salt prevention ability and heat conduction loss still has huge room for evaporation performance improvement convective airflow in nature open condition being demonstrated by several recent works including experiments and simulations could enhance the proceeding of evaporation efficiently by prompting the transferring of generated vapour to ambient timely whereas solar desalination is normally a process that generally work under close condition for clean water collection limiting the way of utilizing nature convective airflow in practical solar desalination herein we discovered a self intensified convective airflow effect in an inverted evaporation model which horizontally deploys a high entropy spectrally selective absorber coating ssac by adhering it upon upside of cloth that owing strong absorbability upon the solar incident vertically irradiating on the absorber can heat the wetted cloth beneath and evaporate the water inside since the ssac has no pore for steam to escape upward directly the generated vapour can only retain for some times until it can rapidly flow upward from the edge of the ssac spontaneously giving rise to a self intensified convective airflow effect enhancing the evaporation rate of such model of inverted evaporation thereupon by jointly introducing the hanging structure for desalination heat generated by the ssac can be localized further with almost no dissipation to bulk water brine water can be continually transported from bulk water to evaporative interface via fabric cloth consecutively producing water steam from the bottom surface of the heated cloth importantly the concentrated brine water can be simultaneously collected through dripping from the bottom of the surface without the interface been solid salt blocked 2 experimental details 2 1 the fabrication of ssac and the characterization methods the high entropy alloy nitride hean based ssac was deposited on stainless steel as substrate using reactive rf magnetron sputtering according to the work previously reported 31 scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6701f japan is conducted to characterize the surface and cross sectional topography of ssac eds mapping and element content of the layer of ssac was obtained by sem that equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx jsm 5600lv the reflectance spectrum across 250 to 2500 nm was measured on a uv vis nir spectrometer perkin elmer lambda 950 and the reflectance spectra 2 5 25 Î¼m of the ssac coating was carried out on a spectrometer bruker tensor 27 ft ir an optical contact angle meter dsa100 kruss germany was introduced to track the water contact angles of water absorbing materials laser thermal conductivity meter lfa457 was employed to conduct the thermal conductivity measurement 2 2 water evaporation and desalination test in laboratory scale the small scale experiments were carried out in a laboratory with identical ambient humidity of 47 52 and temperature of 18 22 c the steam generation device was assembled as following steps ssac based photothermal layer was bonded onto the center of a strip of water absorbing materials 4 cm 20 cm by heat conducting double sided adhesive with its surface vertically exposing to illumination and the whole structure of the evaporator was constructed by fixing the hanging strip with rubber band onto a plastic cylinder shaped water bottle which size are 8 and 12 cm in diameter and height respectively for transporting bulk water to above evaporative interface the bottom of photothermal ssac via capillary force the wholly assembled evaporator was subsequently placed into a beaker with the two edges of hanging strip immersing into water or brine except the absorbing ssac surface for receiving irradiation only other top opened area were completely covered to avoid solar incident from illuminating and heating places other than light receiving area we designated solar incident with standard solar spectrum am 1 5 g is obtained by equipping an optical filter as an accessory at the outlet of solar simulator which is a 300 w xenon lamp hsxf300 a solar power meter was used to calibrate the certain intensity of illumination that irradiating upon ssac and a platform balance 0 001 g in accuracy was placed underneath the beaker to record the total weight changes of water over time photo to vapour evaporation efficiency Î· is calculated via following equation as generally recognized in most reports Î· m h t i s where m represents the net water evaporation rate ht is the total energy demand for water to increase temperature sensible heat and to transit from liquid to vapour phase phase change enthalpy is is the power of incident solar beam that irradiated upon the ssac based photothermal layer which is 1 kw m 2 in this experiment it is important to note that unlike the normally reported upward evaporation model the projected area in this downward evaporative model is divided from evaporative area given that the projected area is directly in proportion to the energy inputting through the simulated solar incident it is rational to use the value of the project area to calculate the specific evaporation rate desalination test is conducted to evaluate the sustainability of the ssac based evaporator in continuous desalinating brine water of high salinity 10 salinity in practice and the concentrated brine droplet was synchronously collected inside the plastic water bottle to further detect the salinity of concentrated brine by salinity meter infrared radiation ir camera flir tg165 was used to take thermal ir photographs over the process of evaporation and temperature variation during evaporation was also recorded according to the readings visually revealing on thermocouple tasi tab115 3 result and discussion for the purpose of effectively transferring the generated heat from photothermal layer to water soaked commercial artificial suede that bonded below stainless steel with superior performance in thermal conductivity is employed as a substrate to deposit with high entropy alloy nitride hean based ssac on the upper side and the reflectance spectra inserted with structural schematic inset are jointly given in fig 1 a based on the calculation the absorbance of the as deposited hean based ssac over full wavelength solar spectrum is approximately equal to 95 and the emittance over infrared band is approximately equal to 0 12 this value of infrared radiation is also relatively verified by an emissivity meter via another method of testing fig s1 such ideal performance in intensifying solar absorption and suppressing infrared radiation losing is beneficial for thermal localization fig 1 b c showing the surface and cross section sem morphologies of hean based ssac it can be observed that the as deposited coating shows dense grain shape of different size which is uniformly distributed all over the coating surface and there is a distinct interface sandwiched between two layers which can be attributed to the different morphology of low metal volume fraction lmvf and sio2 layers eds analysis is introduced to obtain the elemental distribution and content on the surface of as deposited coating by observation of the eds mapping fig 1 d al cr zr ti ta n elements are jointly and spatially inhomogeneous distributed in coating and the overlapped distribution of them demonstrates that they are spatially segregated hydrophilicity is another critical factor for realizing effective steam generation as the material responsible for transporting water to evaporative interface should possess superior wettability based on that hydrophilic property of commercial artificial suede cas was investigated by measure the water contact angle on it as reveal in fig 2 a d water droplet quickly spreads as soon as it was contacting upon on the surface and completely disappears in just 11 s indicating that cas totally absorbs the water drop this result demonstrates the excellent hydrophilicity of cas which favors the replenishing of water to the evaporating interface to bond ssac with cas a type of double sided adhesive features heat conduction ability as mentioned in experimental details is applied for such purpose to quantitatively measure the thermal conductivity of double sided adhesive a standard sample for testing with laser thermal conductivity meter is utilized as a metal block substrate to load on after loaded though the value of thermal conductivity decreasing dramatically from 175 to 19 2 w m 1 k 1 it still retains a much higher level than other non metallic material with high thermal conductivity such as thermal conductive silicone 1 0 3 0 w m 1 k 1 besides a cross section inset in fig 2 e reveals the micrometer scale of the double sided adhesive which is about 200 Î¼m in thickness too thin to have adverse effect on heat transferring in practical application since the special hanging model is distinct from traditional evaporative model in thermal management 32 therefore heat transfer rather than heat insulation ability of hydrated cas is tracked in this work however different from the glass sandwiched testing method generally reported before there is a precondition that should be verified prior to the measurement of heat conducting property for water soaked cas by the method introduced in this work for the first time with bottom surface exposing to air water evaporation occurs as the hydrated cas is heated by upper photothermal layer and this will lead to variation of thermal conductivity the occurrence of water loss via steam generation can be completely avoided by sealing the lower surface with a transparent film as demonstrated in fig 2 f no weight loss was indicated over time upon irradiated by 1 sun and the temperature difference between upper surface and lower surface of the unsealed hydrated cas become more widen than sealed counterpart fig 2 g ir images taken also visually exhibit the final equilibrium temperature on both upper and lower surface with the difference of fig 2 h unsealed group 7 5 c higher than the difference 2 6 c of sealed group fig 2 i the procedure of assembling the evaporator was carried out according to experimental details described above ssac based photothermal layer with its size 4 cm in length and width fig 3 a was firstly bonded onto a strip of cas as water absorbing materials 4 cm 20 cm by heat conducting double sided adhesive fig 3 b and the whole structure of the evaporator is integrated as presented in fig 3 c with the surface of ssac based photothermal layer being faced upward in order to further visually illustrate the water transport ability of cas a set of time elapsing photographs was taken as soon as the evaporator was placed into a beaker of water as can be seen in fig 3 d water was pumped quickly via capillarity against gravity in 0 5 min once the edge of cas was immersed into water and it kept climbing upward until reaching the top surface of the evaporator fully wetting the evaporative interface beneath ssac ultimately a curve is plotted to depict this variation of suction height over time fig 3 e which exhibits that sufficient water supply can be maintained throughout the process of evaporation following above discussion on verifying the precondition of the method for measuring heat conducting property which for the first time introduced in this work the upper photothermal layer was held at temperature of 40 70 and 100 c by adjusting power intensity of simulated solar incident and the final equilibrium temperature on lower surface of cas sealed with a transparent film under dried and hydrated condition is plotted in fig 4 a it has been reported that water can act as a thermal conductor of its own that is the reason why the ir images fig 4 b c of dry cas displays noticeable temperature difference between upper photothermal layer and lower surface while subtle difference in hydrated cas interestingly with the upper temperature of photothermal layer declining to 70 and 40 c such difference in hydrated cas decreases to a level so subtle that can be neglected fig s2 thus conferring effective heat transfer from photothermal layer to bottom evaporative interface as nearly all of the evaporating interface illuminated by solar incident of 1 sun is within the range during 30 50 c temperature region based on the enhancement of the heat localization effect comparing with floating model 32 efficient heat transferring of water soaked cas that enable uniformly heating up of hanging fabric where the ssac based photothermal layer is located upon is able to realize efficient solar driven interfacial evaporation in consequence to further compare the output in the cases of ssac deepening with different depth of 0 3 and 6 cm fig 4 d evaporation rate is determined by recording cumulative mass loss fig 4 e of bulk water being evaporated fig 4 f displayed evaporation rate evolutions as a function of time since solar incident of 1 sun irradiated input the maximum value of the experimental group with 6 cm in depth can be achieved within only a few minutes and remains a constant evaporation rate of about 3 62 kg m 2 h 1 followed by 2 98 and 2 55 kg m 2 h 1 with 3 and 0 cm orderly evaporation rate increasing with depth that ssac localized can be probably ascribed to follow contributions 1 the extending of water path also extends dark evaporation along the path which thereupon reducing the delivering of water to evaporative interface 2 the hanging depth is contributes to further improvement of thermal localization capability for hanging model these two concluded contributions can be also reflected via the captured ir images of evaporative interface and water path fig s3 in addition as revealed in fig 4 g it is amazing to note that the calculated photo vapour efficiency of three tested groups 0 3 and 6 cm are as high as 175 205 and 250 on average breaking the theoretical upper limit of 100 a mechanism driving this incredible phenomenon will be introduced to explain in detail afterward as well known in the previously reported literatures the most limiting bottleneck for photo thermal interfacial evaporation is lies in salt precipitation it will inevitably happen on the surface of floating model when being applied for long term desalination of high salinity brine to solve the problem of salt accumulation in our assembled evaporator a desalination device is installed according to construction presented in fig s4 because the brine absorption capability for cas is not as good as pure water so we employed fabric instead in the desalination by controlling height difference between ssac to liquid within outside bottle fig 5 a concentrated brine droplet can be gathered inside over the progress of desalination without appearance of salt crystals adhering on evaporative interface fig 5 b represents the relationship between the height difference and the drop speed denoted by interval time between per drop as shown the drop speed can be regulated by adjusting height difference ranging from 0 5 to 6 3 cm when evaporating simulated seawater with 3 5 in salinity evaporation rate is rising with decreasing of drop speed likely resulting from increasing heat loss induced by faster drop speed fig 5 c on contrary with the speed further decreasing the evaporation rate remains almost constant 1 507 1 568 kg m 2 h 1 furthermore we have also investigated the relationship of concentrated brine and drop speed under identical condition as can be observed in fig 5 c and its inset salinity remains almost unchanged within the range of high drop speed interval time is from 7 6 to 39 s of per drop while it rapidly goes up with quick decreasing of drop speed until eventually can crystallizes out and drips along with saturated brine drops that can be collected although own the promising application in producing solid salt crystals rigorous operating condition should be maintained otherwise it will cause serious harmful to evaporating system completely clogging the evaporative interface and hindering steam generation nevertheless by the mean of re increasing drop speed evaporation ability can be fully recovered fig s5 achieving zero liquid discharge desalination has been long regarded as ultimate goal of developing photo thermal evaporation however treating brine of high salinity especially 10 is inevitable in the process to further comparatively demonstrate the performance of our dripping evaporator herein high concentration simulated brine water 10 was selected as desalinating target it should be noted that cas as water channel is replaced by cotton fabric before long term desalination test for the reason that it is more suitable than cas in absorbing high concentration brine fig s6 without any suspension of continuous desalination our dripping evaporator with drop speed of 78 s can maintain stable evaporation performance for at least 14 h fig 5 c on the contrary when dripless by stretching water channel almost flat evaporation rate will gradually decay from 1 06 kg m 2 h 1at initial to 0 87 kg m 2 h 1 at 14 h instead of rapidly declining separating the photo thermal layer with steam generation interface though unavoidably forming salt crust layer as same as upward evaporative model does not severely affect steam generation during long term operation the accumulation salt crust that always contains porous structure tends to form on outer surface rather than interior enable to providing sufficient path for vapour to escape and this explanation is in accord with the discussion that previous study on 3d cup structure concluded 29 despite of being deposited by salt crust when dripless the salt accumulation can be cleaned out through facilely rinsing process fig s7 attempting to disclose the high efficiency evaporation mechanism that underlying the inverted evaporation model a presumed precondition is primarily proposed based on the fact that the steam generated from bottom of interface unable to flow upward naturally as ever when impeded by the solid surface of metallic substrate assuming that the flow speed v1 of initial generated steam in such inverted evaporation model fig 6 right is 0 m s 1 while it remains almost unchanged v1 v2 0 m s 1 as steam flowing upward in traditional upward evaporation model fig 6 left hydromechanics method is used to further analysis both two different model and the fluid dynamic parameters can be calculated via bernoulli s equation as below z 1 p 1 Ïg v 1 2 2 z 2 p 2 Ïg v 2 2 2 here z1 and z2 are almost equal to each other in both models so it can be neglected and the equation above can be modified as p 1 Ïg v 1 2 2 p 2 Ïg v 2 2 2 in which p and v are respectively the pressure and flow speed of 1 1 and 2 2 in this case p2 is approximately equal to p1 because v1 v2 0 m s 1 in traditional model however the flow speed v2 of 2 2 in inverted evaporation model is much higher than 1 1 due to the assumption that the flow speed v1 of initial generated steam in such inverted evaporation model fig 6 right is 0 m s 1 and it will lead to the pressure of 2 2 much lower than 1 1 in inverted evaporation model resorting to this hydromechanics based analysis method it can be concluded that it probably the pressure difference that gives rise to promotion of steam generation thus realizing the high efficiency steam generation in inverted evaporation model different sizes of ssac possess different area of solid metallic substrate which accordingly prolongs the generated steam flowing path underneath with various degrees therefore we performed another experiment to further comparatively study evaporation efficiency of ssac with different size 4 5 and 6 cm notably when steam progressively produced from the beneath of ssac 4 5 and 6 cm different thickness of steam layer is synchronously formed as can be observed in fig 7 a c thickness of steam layer in the case of 6 cm is the most followed by 5 and 4 cm orderly water mass change fig 7 e and the calculated evaporation rate evolution over time fig 7 f commonly shows that for experimental group with 4 cm in size evaporation rate is the highest which is almost 1 2 and 1 7 time higher than the cases of 5 and 6 cm reason underlying this phenomenon can be the mechanism that larger area of solid metallic substrate results into prolonging of flowing path for steam steam that generated from inner space needs to have a speed v 0 m s 1 to move longer steps until reaching the edge where it could have been immediately flowed upward as the same as in the case that small area of solid metallic substrate is employed whereas even though the speed of steam underneath is not 0 m s 1 when larger solid metallic substrate is employed it will still rapidly flow upward as soon as it arrives the edge of ssac fig 7 d ensuring effective evaporation of inverted evaporation model at last by comparison steam generation performance of this work is superior to a majority of other works that previously reported employing carbon based materials metal based materials and organic polymers as photothermal materials as shown in fig 8 and table s1 4 conclusions spectrally selective absorber coating ssac overcomes the drawback of traditional photothermal materials one strategy proposed before for applying such ordinary photothermal is to design separating structure for dividing the photo thermal layer with steam generation layer however this separation concept faces paradox between salt prevention ability and heat conduction loss still has huge room for evaporation performance improvement herein we discovered self intensified convective airflow effect by designing an inverted evaporation model which horizontally deploys a high entropy spectrally selective absorber coating ssac by adhering it upon upside of cloth that owing strong absorbability the absorbance and emittance of the fabricated

materials possess ideal solar absorbance in full spectrum of solar incident 2 5 25 Î¼m thermal emittance over the long wavelength infrared region 2 5 25 Î¼m is also so high that heat loss via thermal radiation is significant as well severely impeding the effective utilization of solar incident to overcome the drawback of these traditional photothermal materials a set of special materials with spectrally selective performance which simultaneously characterize high solar absorptance over spectrum of solar incident and low thermal emittance in infrared region have been developing for years for the reason that infrared reflective bottom layer is necessarily a solid substrate for infrared reflection in solar selective absorbing material this special type of solar absorber is different from conventional porous solar absorbers unable to provide pores and path for water supply and vapour escape one strategy proposed before for applying such ordinary photothermal material is to design separating structure for dividing the photo thermal layer with steam generation layer by carefully separating an integrated device with one area for solar absorption and the other area for steam generation solar collection absorbers can completely avoid to be salt covering when desalinating brine water without resulting into deterioration of optical absorption properties in long term operation a number of studies for instance wang s group 29 creatively designed a 3d cup structure with its photothermal interface dividing from evaporation surface realizing stable performance in long term desalination moreover a contactless structure proposed by chen et al 30 has employed the commercial spectrally selective solar absorbers by taking advantage of such concept of separation as well efficiently generating hot steam via thermal concentration another extensively studied model that also belongs to this separation concept is janus structure which limits the evaporation at the hydrophobic hydrophilic interface in spite of common superiority in salt resistance the aforementioned separation concept faces paradox between salt prevention ability and heat conduction loss still has huge room for evaporation performance improvement convective airflow in nature open condition being demonstrated by several recent works including experiments and simulations could enhance the proceeding of evaporation efficiently by prompting the transferring of generated vapour to ambient timely whereas solar desalination is normally a process that generally work under close condition for clean water collection limiting the way of utilizing nature convective airflow in practical solar desalination herein we discovered a self intensified convective airflow effect in an inverted evaporation model which horizontally deploys a high entropy spectrally selective absorber coating ssac by adhering it upon upside of cloth that owing strong absorbability upon the solar incident vertically irradiating on the absorber can heat the wetted cloth beneath and evaporate the water inside since the ssac has no pore for steam to escape upward directly the generated vapour can only retain for some times until it can rapidly flow upward from the edge of the ssac spontaneously giving rise to a self intensified convective airflow effect enhancing the evaporation rate of such model of inverted evaporation thereupon by jointly introducing the hanging structure for desalination heat generated by the ssac can be localized further with almost no dissipation to bulk water brine water can be continually transported from bulk water to evaporative interface via fabric cloth consecutively producing water steam from the bottom surface of the heated cloth importantly the concentrated brine water can be simultaneously collected through dripping from the bottom of the surface without the interface been solid salt blocked 2 experimental details 2 1 the fabrication of ssac and the characterization methods the high entropy alloy nitride hean based ssac was deposited on stainless steel as substrate using reactive rf magnetron sputtering according to the work previously reported 31 scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6701f japan is conducted to characterize the surface and cross sectional topography of ssac eds mapping and element content of the layer of ssac was obtained by sem that equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx jsm 5600lv the reflectance spectrum across 250 to 2500 nm was measured on a uv vis nir spectrometer perkin elmer lambda 950 and the reflectance spectra 2 5 25 Î¼m of the ssac coating was carried out on a spectrometer bruker tensor 27 ft ir an optical contact angle meter dsa100 kruss germany was introduced to track the water contact angles of water absorbing materials laser thermal conductivity meter lfa457 was employed to conduct the thermal conductivity measurement 2 2 water evaporation and desalination test in laboratory scale the small scale experiments were carried out in a laboratory with identical ambient humidity of 47 52 and temperature of 18 22 c the steam generation device was assembled as following steps ssac based photothermal layer was bonded onto the center of a strip of water absorbing materials 4 cm 20 cm by heat conducting double sided adhesive with its surface vertically exposing to illumination and the whole structure of the evaporator was constructed by fixing the hanging strip with rubber band onto a plastic cylinder shaped water bottle which size are 8 and 12 cm in diameter and height respectively for transporting bulk water to above evaporative interface the bottom of photothermal ssac via capillary force the wholly assembled evaporator was subsequently placed into a beaker with the two edges of hanging strip immersing into water or brine except the absorbing ssac surface for receiving irradiation only other top opened area were completely covered to avoid solar incident from illuminating and heating places other than light receiving area we designated solar incident with standard solar spectrum am 1 5 g is obtained by equipping an optical filter as an accessory at the outlet of solar simulator which is a 300 w xenon lamp hsxf300 a solar power meter was used to calibrate the certain intensity of illumination that irradiating upon ssac and a platform balance 0 001 g in accuracy was placed underneath the beaker to record the total weight changes of water over time photo to vapour evaporation efficiency Î· is calculated via following equation as generally recognized in most reports Î· m h t i s where m represents the net water evaporation rate ht is the total energy demand for water to increase temperature sensible heat and to transit from liquid to vapour phase phase change enthalpy is is the power of incident solar beam that irradiated upon the ssac based photothermal layer which is 1 kw m 2 in this experiment it is important to note that unlike the normally reported upward evaporation model the projected area in this downward evaporative model is divided from evaporative area given that the projected area is directly in proportion to the energy inputting through the simulated solar incident it is rational to use the value of the project area to calculate the specific evaporation rate desalination test is conducted to evaluate the sustainability of the ssac based evaporator in continuous desalinating brine water of high salinity 10 salinity in practice and the concentrated brine droplet was synchronously collected inside the plastic water bottle to further detect the salinity of concentrated brine by salinity meter infrared radiation ir camera flir tg165 was used to take thermal ir photographs over the process of evaporation and temperature variation during evaporation was also recorded according to the readings visually revealing on thermocouple tasi tab115 3 result and discussion for the purpose of effectively transferring the generated heat from photothermal layer to water soaked commercial artificial suede that bonded below stainless steel with superior performance in thermal conductivity is employed as a substrate to deposit with high entropy alloy nitride hean based ssac on the upper side and the reflectance spectra inserted with structural schematic inset are jointly given in fig 1 a based on the calculation the absorbance of the as deposited hean based ssac over full wavelength solar spectrum is approximately equal to 95 and the emittance over infrared band is approximately equal to 0 12 this value of infrared radiation is also relatively verified by an emissivity meter via another method of testing fig s1 such ideal performance in intensifying solar absorption and suppressing infrared radiation losing is beneficial for thermal localization fig 1 b c showing the surface and cross section sem morphologies of hean based ssac it can be observed that the as deposited coating shows dense grain shape of different size which is uniformly distributed all over the coating surface and there is a distinct interface sandwiched between two layers which can be attributed to the different morphology of low metal volume fraction lmvf and sio2 layers eds analysis is introduced to obtain the elemental distribution and content on the surface of as deposited coating by observation of the eds mapping fig 1 d al cr zr ti ta n elements are jointly and spatially inhomogeneous distributed in coating and the overlapped distribution of them demonstrates that they are spatially segregated hydrophilicity is another critical factor for realizing effective steam generation as the material responsible for transporting water to evaporative interface should possess superior wettability based on that hydrophilic property of commercial artificial suede cas was investigated by measure the water contact angle on it as reveal in fig 2 a d water droplet quickly spreads as soon as it was contacting upon on the surface and completely disappears in just 11 s indicating that cas totally absorbs the water drop this result demonstrates the excellent hydrophilicity of cas which favors the replenishing of water to the evaporating interface to bond ssac with cas a type of double sided adhesive features heat conduction ability as mentioned in experimental details is applied for such purpose to quantitatively measure the thermal conductivity of double sided adhesive a standard sample for testing with laser thermal conductivity meter is utilized as a metal block substrate to load on after loaded though the value of thermal conductivity decreasing dramatically from 175 to 19 2 w m 1 k 1 it still retains a much higher level than other non metallic material with high thermal conductivity such as thermal conductive silicone 1 0 3 0 w m 1 k 1 besides a cross section inset in fig 2 e reveals the micrometer scale of the double sided adhesive which is about 200 Î¼m in thickness too thin to have adverse effect on heat transferring in practical application since the special hanging model is distinct from traditional evaporative model in thermal management 32 therefore heat transfer rather than heat insulation ability of hydrated cas is tracked in this work however different from the glass sandwiched testing method generally reported before there is a precondition that should be verified prior to the measurement of heat conducting property for water soaked cas by the method introduced in this work for the first time with bottom surface exposing to air water evaporation occurs as the hydrated cas is heated by upper photothermal layer and this will lead to variation of thermal conductivity the occurrence of water loss via steam generation can be completely avoided by sealing the lower surface with a transparent film as demonstrated in fig 2 f no weight loss was indicated over time upon irradiated by 1 sun and the temperature difference between upper surface and lower surface of the unsealed hydrated cas become more widen than sealed counterpart fig 2 g ir images taken also visually exhibit the final equilibrium temperature on both upper and lower surface with the difference of fig 2 h unsealed group 7 5 c higher than the difference 2 6 c of sealed group fig 2 i the procedure of assembling the evaporator was carried out according to experimental details described above ssac based photothermal layer with its size 4 cm in length and width fig 3 a was firstly bonded onto a strip of cas as water absorbing materials 4 cm 20 cm by heat conducting double sided adhesive fig 3 b and the whole structure of the evaporator is integrated as presented in fig 3 c with the surface of ssac based photothermal layer being faced upward in order to further visually illustrate the water transport ability of cas a set of time elapsing photographs was taken as soon as the evaporator was placed into a beaker of water as can be seen in fig 3 d water was pumped quickly via capillarity against gravity in 0 5 min once the edge of cas was immersed into water and it kept climbing upward until reaching the top surface of the evaporator fully wetting the evaporative interface beneath ssac ultimately a curve is plotted to depict this variation of suction height over time fig 3 e which exhibits that sufficient water supply can be maintained throughout the process of evaporation following above discussion on verifying the precondition of the method for measuring heat conducting property which for the first time introduced in this work the upper photothermal layer was held at temperature of 40 70 and 100 c by adjusting power intensity of simulated solar incident and the final equilibrium temperature on lower surface of cas sealed with a transparent film under dried and hydrated condition is plotted in fig 4 a it has been reported that water can act as a thermal conductor of its own that is the reason why the ir images fig 4 b c of dry cas displays noticeable temperature difference between upper photothermal layer and lower surface while subtle difference in hydrated cas interestingly with the upper temperature of photothermal layer declining to 70 and 40 c such difference in hydrated cas decreases to a level so subtle that can be neglected fig s2 thus conferring effective heat transfer from photothermal layer to bottom evaporative interface as nearly all of the evaporating interface illuminated by solar incident of 1 sun is within the range during 30 50 c temperature region based on the enhancement of the heat localization effect comparing with floating model 32 efficient heat transferring of water soaked cas that enable uniformly heating up of hanging fabric where the ssac based photothermal layer is located upon is able to realize efficient solar driven interfacial evaporation in consequence to further compare the output in the cases of ssac deepening with different depth of 0 3 and 6 cm fig 4 d evaporation rate is determined by recording cumulative mass loss fig 4 e of bulk water being evaporated fig 4 f displayed evaporation rate evolutions as a function of time since solar incident of 1 sun irradiated input the maximum value of the experimental group with 6 cm in depth can be achieved within only a few minutes and remains a constant evaporation rate of about 3 62 kg m 2 h 1 followed by 2 98 and 2 55 kg m 2 h 1 with 3 and 0 cm orderly evaporation rate increasing with depth that ssac localized can be probably ascribed to follow contributions 1 the extending of water path also extends dark evaporation along the path which thereupon reducing the delivering of water to evaporative interface 2 the hanging depth is contributes to further improvement of thermal localization capability for hanging model these two concluded contributions can be also reflected via the captured ir images of evaporative interface and water path fig s3 in addition as revealed in fig 4 g it is amazing to note that the calculated photo vapour efficiency of three tested groups 0 3 and 6 cm are as high as 175 205 and 250 on average breaking the theoretical upper limit of 100 a mechanism driving this incredible phenomenon will be introduced to explain in detail afterward as well known in the previously reported literatures the most limiting bottleneck for photo thermal interfacial evaporation is lies in salt precipitation it will inevitably happen on the surface of floating model when being applied for long term desalination of high salinity brine to solve the problem of salt accumulation in our assembled evaporator a desalination device is installed according to construction presented in fig s4 because the brine absorption capability for cas is not as good as pure water so we employed fabric instead in the desalination by controlling height difference between ssac to liquid within outside bottle fig 5 a concentrated brine droplet can be gathered inside over the progress of desalination without appearance of salt crystals adhering on evaporative interface fig 5 b represents the relationship between the height difference and the drop speed denoted by interval time between per drop as shown the drop speed can be regulated by adjusting height difference ranging from 0 5 to 6 3 cm when evaporating simulated seawater with 3 5 in salinity evaporation rate is rising with decreasing of drop speed likely resulting from increasing heat loss induced by faster drop speed fig 5 c on contrary with the speed further decreasing the evaporation rate remains almost constant 1 507 1 568 kg m 2 h 1 furthermore we have also investigated the relationship of concentrated brine and drop speed under identical condition as can be observed in fig 5 c and its inset salinity remains almost unchanged within the range of high drop speed interval time is from 7 6 to 39 s of per drop while it rapidly goes up with quick decreasing of drop speed until eventually can crystallizes out and drips along with saturated brine drops that can be collected although own the promising application in producing solid salt crystals rigorous operating condition should be maintained otherwise it will cause serious harmful to evaporating system completely clogging the evaporative interface and hindering steam generation nevertheless by the mean of re increasing drop speed evaporation ability can be fully recovered fig s5 achieving zero liquid discharge desalination has been long regarded as ultimate goal of developing photo thermal evaporation however treating brine of high salinity especially 10 is inevitable in the process to further comparatively demonstrate the performance of our dripping evaporator herein high concentration simulated brine water 10 was selected as desalinating target it should be noted that cas as water channel is replaced by cotton fabric before long term desalination test for the reason that it is more suitable than cas in absorbing high concentration brine fig s6 without any suspension of continuous desalination our dripping evaporator with drop speed of 78 s can maintain stable evaporation performance for at least 14 h fig 5 c on the contrary when dripless by stretching water channel almost flat evaporation rate will gradually decay from 1 06 kg m 2 h 1at initial to 0 87 kg m 2 h 1 at 14 h instead of rapidly declining separating the photo thermal layer with steam generation interface though unavoidably forming salt crust layer as same as upward evaporative model does not severely affect steam generation during long term operation the accumulation salt crust that always contains porous structure tends to form on outer surface rather than interior enable to providing sufficient path for vapour to escape and this explanation is in accord with the discussion that previous study on 3d cup structure concluded 29 despite of being deposited by salt crust when dripless the salt accumulation can be cleaned out through facilely rinsing process fig s7 attempting to disclose the high efficiency evaporation mechanism that underlying the inverted evaporation model a presumed precondition is primarily proposed based on the fact that the steam generated from bottom of interface unable to flow upward naturally as ever when impeded by the solid surface of metallic substrate assuming that the flow speed v1 of initial generated steam in such inverted evaporation model fig 6 right is 0 m s 1 while it remains almost unchanged v1 v2 0 m s 1 as steam flowing upward in traditional upward evaporation model fig 6 left hydromechanics method is used to further analysis both two different model and the fluid dynamic parameters can be calculated via bernoulli s equation as below z 1 p 1 Ïg v 1 2 2 z 2 p 2 Ïg v 2 2 2 here z1 and z2 are almost equal to each other in both models so it can be neglected and the equation above can be modified as p 1 Ïg v 1 2 2 p 2 Ïg v 2 2 2 in which p and v are respectively the pressure and flow speed of 1 1 and 2 2 in this case p2 is approximately equal to p1 because v1 v2 0 m s 1 in traditional model however the flow speed v2 of 2 2 in inverted evaporation model is much higher than 1 1 due to the assumption that the flow speed v1 of initial generated steam in such inverted evaporation model fig 6 right is 0 m s 1 and it will lead to the pressure of 2 2 much lower than 1 1 in inverted evaporation model resorting to this hydromechanics based analysis method it can be concluded that it probably the pressure difference that gives rise to promotion of steam generation thus realizing the high efficiency steam generation in inverted evaporation model different sizes of ssac possess different area of solid metallic substrate which accordingly prolongs the generated steam flowing path underneath with various degrees therefore we performed another experiment to further comparatively study evaporation efficiency of ssac with different size 4 5 and 6 cm notably when steam progressively produced from the beneath of ssac 4 5 and 6 cm different thickness of steam layer is synchronously formed as can be observed in fig 7 a c thickness of steam layer in the case of 6 cm is the most followed by 5 and 4 cm orderly water mass change fig 7 e and the calculated evaporation rate evolution over time fig 7 f commonly shows that for experimental group with 4 cm in size evaporation rate is the highest which is almost 1 2 and 1 7 time higher than the cases of 5 and 6 cm reason underlying this phenomenon can be the mechanism that larger area of solid metallic substrate results into prolonging of flowing path for steam steam that generated from inner space needs to have a speed v 0 m s 1 to move longer steps until reaching the edge where it could have been immediately flowed upward as the same as in the case that small area of solid metallic substrate is employed whereas even though the speed of steam underneath is not 0 m s 1 when larger solid metallic substrate is employed it will still rapidly flow upward as soon as it arrives the edge of ssac fig 7 d ensuring effective evaporation of inverted evaporation model at last by comparison steam generation performance of this work is superior to a majority of other works that previously reported employing carbon based materials metal based materials and organic polymers as photothermal materials as shown in fig 8 and table s1 4 conclusions spectrally selective absorber coating ssac overcomes the drawback of traditional photothermal materials one strategy proposed before for applying such ordinary photothermal is to design separating structure for dividing the photo thermal layer with steam generation layer however this separation concept faces paradox between salt prevention ability and heat conduction loss still has huge room for evaporation performance improvement herein we discovered self intensified convective airflow effect by designing an inverted evaporation model which horizontally deploys a high entropy spectrally selective absorber coating ssac by adhering it upon upside of cloth that owing strong absorbability the absorbance and emittance of the fabricated ssac almost reach 95 and 0 12 respectively in the function of self intensified convective airflow effect this ssac assembled inverted evaporation model can achieve efficient steam output 4 98 kg m 2 h 1 resorting to hydromechanics based analysis method it can be concluded that it probably the pressure difference that gives rise to promotion of steam generation thus realizing the high efficiency steam generation in inverted evaporation model by jointly introducing the hanging structure for desalination heat generated by the ssac can be localized further with almost no dissipation to bulk water in addition the concentrated brine water can be simultaneously collected through dripping from the bottom of the surface without the interface been solid salt blocked demonstrating the great
