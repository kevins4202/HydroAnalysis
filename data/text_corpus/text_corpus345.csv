1725,rating curves are robust tools for continuously evaluating streamflows by gauging water levels this paper introduces a procedure to derive rating curves by combining a stage discharge relationship proposed by maghrebi et al and the inverse distance weighting idw method in order to determine the appropriate value of the α parameter in idw a trial and error procedure using different values of α from 0 to 5 is implemented to this end 2000 subsamples in different sizes selected randomly from the observed data of four cross sections are generated and the corresponding rating curves are delivered the mean absolute percentage error mape and the root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the results the results from four cross sections demonstrated that α 0 corresponds to the least favorable results while α 1 is the most appropriate value the maximum mape and rmse observed in the trent river section were 22 5 and 13 1 m3 s using maghrebi s relation respectively these values decreased to 13 5 and 8 6 m3 s when applying the proposed method using 7 points additional cross sections from the tiber river are used to validate the method and to compare it with the classical model the results demonstrated that mape and rmse values are reduced with increasing sample size and the proposed model outperforms the classical one for small sample sizes rmse values declined from 62 27 4 46 76 7 m3 s to 32 8 14 4 23 5 33 9 m3 s using seven observed points in ponte nuovo santa lucia ponte felcino and ponte rosciano cross sections respectively the proposed model illustrated a notable decline in the uncertainty bands which diminished significantly with increasing sample sizes the proposed method is advantageous in constructing rating curves in new sites

been essential for numerous purposes including water resources management flood control and other hydrological applications traditionally river discharge measurements are directly accomplished utilizing the velocity area method which includes measures of streamwise depth averaged velocity once the discharge is obtained it is related to the associated stage to develop a calibrated rating curve therefore rating curves present a continuous and automatic estimate of streamflow by monitoring the water level observing streamflow using conventional methods can be difficult impractical costly time consuming and potentially dangerous in massive floods herschy 2008 legleiter et al 2017 however rating curves remain an absolute mainstay in river monitoring above all monitoring the stage which can be readily measured with considerable precision is a simple and practical solution criss 2022 the rating curves are usually represented by power functions constructed by manual methods or regression fitting herschy 2008 hamilton et al 2016 rainville et al 2016 other approximations of stream gauged data such as chebyshev polynomials fenton 2018 mcmahon and peel 2019 and piecewise continuous splines fenton 2018 holtschlag 2022 are used to represent a stage discharge relationship however simple power functions are common and can be applied to a wide range of rivers and streams such modeling is used effectively well in about 75 of canadian hydrometric stations hamilton et al 2016 rainville et al 2016 the changing hydraulic and morphological characteristics of rivers require that flow measurements be carried out in regular intervals usually every six weeks and in selected events fulton et al 2020 ideally gauging would be distributed over the full range of stages with uniform distribution as a general rule the minimum size of streamflow data should be twice as large as the number of rating parameters that must be obtained rainville et al 2016 therefore the building of rating curves is a challenging task mainly in ungauged sites with limited funding the simple rating curve cannot be employed at hydrometric stations with variable backwater or unsteady flow conditions rantz 1982 levesque and oberg 2012 the index velocity method is recommended for such situations which converts the measured local velocities to the mean channel velocity by the index velocity rating hong et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 cheng et al 2019 found that the performance of the index velocity was much better than the stage discharge rating in conditions of unsteady flows however the results from the kapuas river indonesia showed that the stage discharge rating performed better than the index velocity method kästner et al 2018 as the classic rating curve this method requires a large amount of data to be calibrated adequately traditionally manning s formula is used to estimate the discharge in rivers with simple cross section geometry other hydraulic methods such as the divided channel method dcm the coherence method cohm the weighted divided channel method wdcm and the modified divided channel method mdcm were proposed to improve manning s formula in compound channels lotter 1933 ackers 1993 lambert and myers 1998 khatua et al 2012 however each method has its restrictions and is insufficient to predict discharge accurately maghrebi et al 2017 in addition determining the manning roughness coefficient which plays a crucial role in manning s formula is a difficult task in the field ardıçlıoğlu and kuriqi 2019 more advanced methods based on machine learning and data driven techniques have been developed for stage discharge assessment most of these techniques exhibit a high performance in comparison to conventional methods techniques such as artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm fuzzy logic decision tree processes and wavelet analysis wa coupled with ann and svm were used to develop a stage discharge relationship e g deka and chandramouli 2003 bhattacharya and solomatine 2005 aggarwal et al 2012 ghorbani et al 2020 tripura et al 2021 kumar et al 2020 shukla et al 2021 these models construct input output relationships regardless of the physical principles and require a relatively large data set shukla et al 2021 as a result these methods might not be appropriate for the conditions of limited data other researchers such as e g maghrebi et al 2017 manfreda 2018 manfreda et al 2020 criss 2022 further utilized information extracted from surveyed data manfreda 2018 presented the flow area model in which the mean channel velocity and the flow area are stage related power functions according to this method the discharge like the continuity equation is the product of mean velocity and flow area this technique might be highly advantageous in data scarce environments manfreda et al 2020 however this method requires the trend of the mean channel velocity in data scarce environments to be determined in advance for instance the mean channel velocity was nearly a linear function in italian and american rivers studied by manfreda 2018 and criss 2022 but it was a logarithmic function in the tiber river datasets manfreda et al 2020 maghrebi et al 2017 presented a rating curve relationship utilizing one measured stage discharge point in addition to the hydraulic parameter uspm introduced by maghrebi 2006 and geometrical parameters including cross sectional area wetted perimeter and the width of the free surface the method demonstrated high efficiency in estimating rating curves in different laboratory sections and natural rivers the proposed method is applicable for steady flows and does not require any calibration since the method utilizes single pair of sampled stage discharge it is believed to be very effective and practical in data scarce environments nevertheless the accuracy of the rating curve is highly dependent on observed data precision using inaccurate reference data in maghrebi s relationship is reflected by errors in the resulting rating curve in addition despite the improvements in the technology of streamflow monitoring errors and uncertainty still occur continuously in gauging data manfreda et al 2020 therefore this paper mainly aims to overcome the weaknesses in maghrebi s relationship and to enhance its accuracy discharge measurements need to be continuous and the used methods should be simple sufficient and cost effective therefore the purpose of this study is to present an approach for estimating rating curves using minimum gauging data mainly in ungauged sites with limited funding a procedure to generate rating curves based on the relationship proposed by maghrebi et al 2017 combined with the inverse distance weighting idw method is introduced to this end a set of measured points is used to build rating curves based on maghrebi s relationship and the idw method is used to find the weighting average of these rating curves the idw method has many applications in hydrology and water sciences e g lu and wong 2008 waseem et al 2016 tan et al 2021 khouni et al 2021 jeong et al 2020 the method computes the value of unsampled points using the weighted average value of observed points so that the weights are inversely related to the distances between the observed and predicted points the weights are modified by a constant power α to match the studied phenomenon however this paper investigates a new application of the idw method to estimate rating curves this method has been adapted in which the elevation is used instead of the distance and the estimated values from maghrebi s relationship instead of the observed ones actual data collected from various rivers are used to determine the best value of α the current study has been conducted with the following specific objectives i to explore the applicability of the proposed technique ii to obtain the appropriate power of the weights α iii to obtain the minimum required measured data iv to address the performance of the proposed technique and compare it with the classic rating curves 2 methods and data 2 1 stage discharge relationship the current paper is built upon the previous works of maghrebi 2006 and maghrebi et al 2017 maghrebi 2006 introduced a mathematical model to estimate the isovel contours in any channel cross section in this method as shown in fig 1 the cross section is covered with triangular meshes and the boundary is divided into small elements ds the total velocity deviation at the center of the mesh element is calculated as follows 1 u y z boundary c 1 sin θ f r d s where c1 is a constant θ is the angle between the positional vector r and the boundary elemental vector ds and f r is the dominant velocity function maghrebi and ball 2006 have proposed the seventh root power law as a velocity function suitable for natural rivers therefore the local velocity u y z at each element can be computed as 2 u y z boundary c r 1 7 sin θ d s where c is a constant that equals unity for uniform boundary roughness therefore the mean velocity u spm can be calculated in the following manners maghrebi 2006 3 u spm a u y z d a a where da is the area of the mesh element and a is the cross sectional area maghrebi et al 2017 have used the uspm with other hydraulic and geometrical parameters to build a rating curve relationship they assumed that the flow rate could be connected to the relevant variables in the following equation maghrebi et al 2017 4 q a a 1 p a 2 p t a 3 u spm a 4 n a 5 where p t p t is the sum of the wetted perimeter p and the width of the water surface t and n is the manning roughness maghrebi et al 2017 presented their relationship as a ratio between discharges at two distinct water levels of the cross section experimental and field data were used to find the optimal magnitudes of the exponents a1 a2 a3 and a4 the exponent a5 was defined as a5 1 because of the inverse relation between flow rate and roughness in the manning formula therefore the final form of the stage discharge relationship was found maghrebi et al 2017 5 q e q r a e a r 0 972 p e p r 1 268 p t e p t r 0 832 u spm e u spms r n e n r 1 where the subscripts e and r refer to the estimated and referenced parameters respectively computing the discharge in different stages based on eq 5 requires a single measured flow rate linked to a reference stage besides cross section geometry the validation process using field data has ensured the high performance of eq 5 in estimating rating curves in natural rivers it should be mentioned that the relationship does not require any calibration however each reference stage will produce a unique rating curve maghrebi et al 2017 reported that the rating curves obtained based on reference points at high water levels are generally associated with more precise results one of the weaknesses of the relationship above is that when the regarded water level is far from the reference level the calculated discharge accuracy might decline maghrebi and ali 2019 also the accuracy of the outcomes is highly dependent on observed data precision as any kind of errors in reference measurement will be reflected in errors in the resulting rating curve ahmadi and maghrebi 2019 2 2 combination approach the reference point in the stage discharge relationship plays the most significant role in determining the rating curve any errors in the point information will produce errors in the entire rating curve and parts of the rating curve at levels far from the reference point may suffer from a lack of accuracy therefore this paper proposes using more than one measurement point to increase the rating curve s reliability various reference points at different levels are used to generate a set of rating curves the weighted average is employed for interpolating the final rating curve in the following manner 6 q e h i 1 n λ i h q e i h where n is the total number of reference points qe i h is the discharge at the stage h estimated from eq 5 based on the ith reference point and λi h is the weight of the rating curve i at the stage h the rating curve resulting from each reference point is believed to be dominant in the levels neighboring that point therefore the inverse distance weighting method idw is employed to derive the weights the idw method s weights are inversely related to the power of distances between the estimated and sampled stages the weights are defined in the following manner lu and wong 2008 7 λ i h h oi α i n h oi α with 8 i 1 n λ i h 1 where hoi h hr i is the level difference between h and the ith reference stage and α is the power of distance that plays a role in calculating the weighting factor the conceptual illustration of the implemented method is shown in fig 2 the figure illustrates how to compute the discharge at a stage he based on three gauging levels and the geometry information large α generates larger weights in the neighboring area and progressively down weights farther away using small α leads to the arithmetic average in the near region lu and wong 2008 according to eq 7 when α 0 then λi 1 n and hence 9 q e h i 1 n λ i h q e i h 1 n i 1 n q e i h in this case the estimated discharge is the average computed based on different reference levels in order to determine the appropriate value of α in the proposed method a trial and error procedure using different values of α from 0 to 5 is implemented observed data from four cross sections described in the next section are used to test the results it is found that α 0 corresponds to the least favorable results while α 1 is the most appropriate value more analysis of α effect is introduced in the result section the proposed method has some limitations in several situations such as in the case of alluvial rivers which are self formed and made up of mobile sediment or soil the cross sections of these rivers are shaped by the magnitude and frequency of the floods they experience the stability of the geometrical parameters used in the proposed method is a pivotal condition for proper estimation each change in the geometrical parameters associated with the reference section produces a new distinct rating curve therefore attempting to delineate fixed stage discharge relationships in anything other than bedrock channels is not feasible another limitation is that man made structures like dams and canal intakes can cause stage discharge relationships to modify in addition the stage at a given discharge of large rivers can shift by up to 2 m due to temperature effects maghrebi s relation was delivered by supposing a constant water slope for all levels therefore the method might not be applicable in hysteresis conditions where water surface slope and flow are not the same for a selected level in two floods 2 3 the classical model the power function is a simple model widely used to represent the stage discharge relationship in hydrometric stations it can be expressed as rantz 1982 10 q a h d m where h is the stage and a d and m are calibration parameters the parameters are calculated using the available data and the least squares method in this paper the classical model is referred to as model 1 and the proposed model as model 2 2 4 field data this paper exploits the data published by manfreda et al 2020 and knight et al 2009 to explore the performance of the proposed model the collected data from knight et al 2009 is used to determine the appropriate value of α and the other data is used to compare the proposed approach with the classical model the data set of knight et al 2009 consists of four river cross sections that are irregular in shape and cover a range of channel types they include simple cross section la suela river compound cross section severn and main rivers and asymmetric cross section trent river according to the available data the maximum depth of these sections varies from 1 78 m in the main river to 7 77 m in the severn river the maximum discharge varies from 58 m3 s in the main river to 331 m3 s in the severn river the gauged sections of ponte nuovo ponte felcino and santa lucia located on the tiber river in italy and ponte rosciano situated on the chiascio river which is a major tributary of the tiber river are used to validate the proposed approach the selected hydrometric stations were provided with a remote ultrasonic water level gauge at the same time the current meter was utilized to assemble the velocity measurements and thus evaluate the flow rate by the mid section method moramarco et al 2004 the flow rate and cross section geometry data were collected between 1982 and 2008 and the various geometry survey indicates that all cross sections were relatively stable in that period since the roughness variation along the wetted perimeter at the four cross sections is not available the roughness is presumed as homogenous as a result the influence of roughness in the relativity rating curve relationship eq 5 can be omitted the flow and site characteristics for all cross sections are shown in table 1 3 results 3 1 application of the proposed method in order to show the performance of the proposed relationship in different conditions it is applied to the cross sections collected from literature to begin the method is tested using only one reference measurement according to eq 5 to build a rating curve the computations must be conducted at numerous levels that cover the range of the desired rating curve therefore a reference point is chosen as one observed discharge with the corresponding stage qr hr from the available data then all geometrical parameters including a p and pt and the hydraulic parameter uspm are computed for the reference level and all other stages in the range of the rating curve once the parameters are calculated applying eq 5 for all levels leads to the estimated rating curve fig 3 shows the variation of each parameter in a dimensionless form from the lowest to highest stages for four studied cross sections fig 4 shows all potential rating curves for the selected cross sections the number of estimated rating curves represented by orange lines conforms to the available observed data in each section the solid black lines in fig 4 represent the mean value of all estimated rating curves it can be seen that the calculated rating curves do well in most cases the worst rating curves relate to the lowest reference levels while the best results correspond to the medium and high stages a general trend of overestimating the stage and underestimating the discharge by rating curves corresponding to lower references is observed the estimated rating curves were highly dependent on the selected reference point therefore incorporating more than one measured point is suggested to ensure more accuracy and take advantage of available observed data the combination of three rating curves based on selected reference points is illustrated in fig 5 which also provides the distribution of their weights the weighting factor λ in eq 6 specifies the percentage contribution of each of the rating curves in deriving the final rating curve the α parameter in eq 7 is used to modify the weighting factor to match the studied phenomenon for a considered rating curve as seen from fig 5 the weights that are computed based on α 1 equal one at the reference level zero at reference levels corresponding to other rating curves and relate inversely with the difference in depth between the reference and other stages in order to illustrate the impact of the parameter on the final rating curve the previous three rating curves are combined using different weights as shown in fig 6 the figure shows that the larger α the larger weights in the neighboring area and progressively down weights farther away for α 0 the combining approach yields the arithmetic average of the three rating curves as seen in fig 6 a therefore increasing the value of α leads to more dominance of each rating curve in its vicinity 3 2 impacts of the α parameter and the number of observed points the number of observed points and values of the weighting factor λ play a significant role in the proposed method therefore the new approach is applied to selected cross sections to obtain the best magnitude of the α parameter which controls the weighting factor λ and to study the impact of increasing the number of data used on results to this end 2000 subsamples selected randomly from observed data are generated to show the model s performance in various conditions the size of subsets ranges from 2 to 7 measurements the points in each subsample are employed as reference ones to compute the rating curves based on eq 5 and then to interpolate the final rating curve using eq 6 the calculations are repeated for different values of the α parameter the cross sections of la suela main severn and trent rivers are used to obtain the best α while the other sections are used in the final validation statistical criteria are used to evaluate the results including the mean absolute percentage error mape and the root mean square error rmse they are defined as follows 11 m a p e 100 n i 1 n q o i q e i q o i 12 rmse m 3 s 1 n i 1 n q o i q e i 2 where n is the number of observed data fig 7 shows the mean value of statistical measures for the results computed based on different sample sizes as seen in fig 7 the mape and rmse values are reduced with increasing sample size besides sample sizes of less than 5 points have more effect in improving the results than larger samples fig 7 shows the mean value of statistical measures for the results computed based on different sample sizes as well as different values of the α parameter red symbols represent mape values while blue symbols represent rmse values as can be seen in fig 7 mape and rmse values decreased with increasing sample size the maximum mape and rmse observed in the trent section are 22 5 and 13 1 m3 s respectively these values decreased to 13 5 and 8 6 m3 s when applying the proposed method using 7 points with α 1 in addition mape and rmse decreased to less than 11 and 7 m3 s in the remaining sections respectively for all sections α 0 is associated with the least favorable results the figure shows that the results are close to each other for larger values of α with a relative advantage of α 1 especially for sample sizes larger than 4 therefore α 1 is supposed to be the default value of this parameter and all analyses performed after here are based on α 1 for more demonstration of the benefits of the proposed method and to validate it the combination approach is applied to ponte nuovo santa lucia ponte felcino and ponte rosciano cross sections fig 8 shows the mean value of statistical measures for the results which computed based on different sample sizes as seen in fig 8 the mape and rmse values are reduced with increasing sample size furthermore sample sizes of less than 5 points have more effect in improving the results than larger samples rmse values declined from 62 27 4 46 76 7 m3 s to 32 8 14 4 23 5 33 9 m3 s using seven observed points in ponte nuovo santa lucia ponte felcino and ponte rosciano cross sections respectively in fact minimizing the width of uncertainty intervals is fundamental in building a model narrower uncertainty intervals mean a higher probability density of estimated rating curves for this reason the uncertainty bands for the proposed model are investigated in this study fig 9 shows the mean rating curve and 95 confidence interval for 2000 subsamples of two and three reference points no substantial differences between the two mean curves could be observed however the bands of uncertainty for three points cases are diminished this uncertainty analysis included only the random errors caused by gauging both stage and discharge according to mcmillan and westerberg 2015 errors in rating curve estimation could result from random instrumental errors and epistemic errors such as channel cross section changes since the cross sections studied in this paper were relatively stable over the study period only random errors are considered 3 3 comparison between the proposed model and the classical one the 2000 subsets of each sample size are employed to construct the rating curves using the proposed and classical models the sample size ranges from 4 to 15 measurements and the statistical measures mape and rmse are then used to compare the two models it should be mentioned that observed data on construction rating curves were not used in calculating the mape and rmse values fig 10 compares the statistical measures obtained from the two models for the ponte nuovo cross section the color of each point identifies the associated sample size the 1 1 line divides each plot in this figure into two portions specifying what model is performing better it can be observed that the mape and rmse values tend to decrease with increasing sample size for both models the proposed model tends to outperform the classical one especially for small sample sizes in many cases the hydrometric data from the field is only available for low and medium stages deriving the stage discharge curve for high levels has particular importance in flood control therefore to establish the performance of the proposed model in such conditions we limit the range of data to a determined threshold of non exceedance probability of water levels the probability of water level h not exceeding the threshold h is p h h the non exceedance probability is assumed to be in a range of 0 5 1 after arranging the recorded data in ascending order based on their levels h the non exceedance probability of each stage is computed hence the threshold h is the stage related to each required probability table 2 provides the values of h associated with the non exceedance probability from 0 5 to 1 when p h h 1 it means that the threshold h hmax and all available data are used in the analysis procedure whereas p h h 0 5 means that 50 of the available data associated with lower stages are employed the calculations of the non exceedance probability are based on the available collected data in each site and might not reflect reality according to manfreda et al 2020 the threshold of p h h 0 8 removes the floods from the dataset of the chiascio and tiber rivers thus high stage events in this paper denote floods that exceed the stage of p h h 0 8 while low and medium stage events are related to stages lower than that threshold in order to show the effect of sample size and the threshold variation the mean difference between statistical measures of models 1 and 2 are represented in fig 11 as a function of sample size employed in the construction rating curves the mean differences between statistical measures for each sample size are computed as follows 13 rmse 2 1 rms e 2 rms e 1 14 mape 2 1 map e 2 map e 1 where 1 and 2 refer to model 1 and model 2 respectively the mean values of statistical measures for each model are computed from the results of the 2000 subsets fig 11a shows the mean difference between the results of models 2 and 1 in terms of rmse as a function of sample size for various thresholds in the studied cross sections the negative values denote that the proposed model outperforms the classical one whereas the positive values refer to the relative advantages of the classical model fig 11a illustrates that model 2 outperforms model 1 for small sample sizes while the differences become smaller for larger samples in general the advantage of model 2 is more evident for lower thresholds however this is not a rule and in some cases the differences have a random distribution resulting from the data used for example in the ponte nuovo section the preference of model 2 is arranged according to the threshold except for p h h 0 7 or h 4 05 m where the data used within the range h 3 66 4 05 m are more randomly distributed as seen in fig 9a similarly the differences in mape shown in fig 11b denote that model 2 performs better than model 1 for all explored sample sizes in three cross sections results of both mape and rmse reveal that model 2 outperforms model 1 in both low and high water levels in the case of small sample sizes the derived rating curves based on all available data are used to measure the uncertainty the mean value of rating curves derived based on 5 points samples and its 95 confidence interval are shown in fig 12 the mean rating curve of model 1 appears to differ from the rating of model 2 at high stages in the santa lucia and ponte rosciano sections however they are close to each other in the ponte nuovo and ponte felcino sections the results indicated that using model 2 yields a notable decline in the uncertainty bands this feature evolved noticeably at high stages fig 13 provides a similar analysis of uncertainty for the cases of 10 points as can be seen the uncertainty bands are significantly diminished for both models fig 14 shows the mean rating curve and its 95 confidence interval for 2000 subsets of three reference points the outcomes of this study imply that the reference points at the lowest stages lead to more significant errors therefore the measurements at very shallow water levels are not employed in deriving rating curves in fig 14 also the three reference points are limited and distributed in the range of low and medium water levels the results of fig 14 denote that the exclusion of the lowest gauging leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the proposed model the model reasonably evaluates discharges at high water levels based on low and medium reference measurements it can be seen that most of the observed data not used in the construction of the rating curves are located inside uncertainty bands it is interesting to explore other methods like idw such as the kriging method the kriging is a geostatistical technique that uses the weighted combination of the observed values around the unknown point of interest it aims to minimize the variance of errors isaaks and srivastava 1989 burrough et al 2015 in this method the variance of the distance difference between observed points is represented by a semi variogram a mathematical function is used to fit the empirical variogram a tool used to investigate the spatial autocorrelation structure of the data the variogram of the ponte nuovo data is shown in fig 15 the horizontal axis represents the difference in stage and the vertical axis represents the semi variance of corresponding discharges the resulting empirical variogram can be fitted very well using a gaussian distribution investigating all other sections indicates that the gaussian distribution is a sound choice to fit the variogram for discharge stage data this might help reduce the required data for establishing the variogram by a priori assuming a gaussian distribution however due to the apparent trend of increasing discharge with stage the ordinary kriging failed to generate accurate weights when the estimate is extrapolated rather than interpolated the universal kriging which requires obtaining a deterministic function representing the data trend is used in such situations isaaks and srivastava 1989 in this case more data is needed to fit the deterministic function and the empirical variogram of residuals which might not be suitable for the topic of limited data in contrast the idw is an effective tool in restricted data environments it is a simple method easy to employ and most importantly it has a rational background it is because the rating curves were more accurate in the neighboring stages to the reference point in addition it has a significant role in improving the results the procedure proposed in this paper is advantageous in constructing rating curves in new sites specifically in the case of limited funding and building more reliable rating curves in gauged sites however the impact of heterogeneous roughness water surface slope or energy slope and the variation in cross section are not included in this study because this information might not be available in limited data conditions considering the variation of roughness leads to improvement in maghrebi s relationship ahmadi and maghrebi 2019 vatanchi and maghrebi 2019 and hence enhances the proposed approach in hysteresis conditions where the water surface slope and rating flow are not the same for a selected level in two floods the data used in generating the rating curve should be taken during only the rising or falling stage ahmadi and maghrebi 2019 however further analysis of the performance of the proposed method is required the optimal implementation of the proposed model requires picking the appropriate reference points as in this study previous studies have shown that maghrebi s relation may lead to higher errors at the lowest stages ahmadi and maghrebi 2019 vatanchi and maghrebi 2019 low stages are generally affected by local section control but fortunately these stages can be distinguished by representing the data in a log log scale plot to highlight the change in the rating curve slope fenton and keller 2001 manfreda et al 2020 we can conclude from the above analysis that the proposed model is an effective alternative especially in data scarce environments the results of a large number of explored samples show a considerable decrease in errors and uncertainty bands 4 conclusion rating curves are robust tools for continuously evaluating streamflows by gauging water levels discharge measurements need to be continuous and the used methods should be simple sufficient and cost effective therefore the purpose of this study is to present an approach for estimating rating curves using minimum gauging data mainly in ungauged sites with limited funding a procedure to generate rating curves based on a stage discharge relationship combined with the inverse distance weighting idw method was introduced in this study in order to determine the appropriate value of the α parameter in idw a trial and error procedure using different values of α from 0 to 5 is implemented to this end 2000 subsamples in different sizes selected randomly from the observed data of four cross sections were generated and the corresponding rating curves were delivered the mean absolute percentage error mape and the root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the results additional cross sections from the tiber river were used to validate the method and to compare it with the classical model in many cases the hydrometric data from the field are only available for low and medium stages therefore to establish the performance of the proposed model in such conditions we limited the utilized data to low and medium water levels the findings are summarized as follows using one reference point yielded satisfactory rating curves in most cases the lowest reference levels introduced the worst rating curves while the best results were associated with the medium and high stages the estimated rating curves were highly dependent on the selected reference point increasing the value of the α parameter in idw leads to more dominance of each rating curve in its vicinity it is found that α 0 corresponds to the least favorable results while α 1 is the most appropriate value the mape and rmse criteria values decrease monotonically with increasing the number of used reference points sample sizes of less than 5 points have more effect in improving the results than larger samples the proposed model outperforms the classical one especially for small sample sizes the results indicated that using the proposed model yields a notable decline in the uncertainty bands this feature evolved noticeably at high stages the uncertainty bands are significantly diminished for both models with increasing sample sizes the proposed model showed high potential efficiency in developing rating curves in data scarce environments a few reference points will effectively build a reliable rating curve even if they are distributed at low and medium stages the results denoted that the exclusion of the lowest gauging leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the proposed model the proposed method is advantageous in constructing rating curves in data scarce environments however in alluvial rivers where the cross section is unstable and

1725,rating curves are robust tools for continuously evaluating streamflows by gauging water levels this paper introduces a procedure to derive rating curves by combining a stage discharge relationship proposed by maghrebi et al and the inverse distance weighting idw method in order to determine the appropriate value of the α parameter in idw a trial and error procedure using different values of α from 0 to 5 is implemented to this end 2000 subsamples in different sizes selected randomly from the observed data of four cross sections are generated and the corresponding rating curves are delivered the mean absolute percentage error mape and the root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the results the results from four cross sections demonstrated that α 0 corresponds to the least favorable results while α 1 is the most appropriate value the maximum mape and rmse observed in the trent river section were 22 5 and 13 1 m3 s using maghrebi s relation respectively these values decreased to 13 5 and 8 6 m3 s when applying the proposed method using 7 points additional cross sections from the tiber river are used to validate the method and to compare it with the classical model the results demonstrated that mape and rmse values are reduced with increasing sample size and the proposed model outperforms the classical one for small sample sizes rmse values declined from 62 27 4 46 76 7 m3 s to 32 8 14 4 23 5 33 9 m3 s using seven observed points in ponte nuovo santa lucia ponte felcino and ponte rosciano cross sections respectively the proposed model illustrated a notable decline in the uncertainty bands which diminished significantly with increasing sample sizes the proposed method is advantageous in constructing rating curves in new sites

been essential for numerous purposes including water resources management flood control and other hydrological applications traditionally river discharge measurements are directly accomplished utilizing the velocity area method which includes measures of streamwise depth averaged velocity once the discharge is obtained it is related to the associated stage to develop a calibrated rating curve therefore rating curves present a continuous and automatic estimate of streamflow by monitoring the water level observing streamflow using conventional methods can be difficult impractical costly time consuming and potentially dangerous in massive floods herschy 2008 legleiter et al 2017 however rating curves remain an absolute mainstay in river monitoring above all monitoring the stage which can be readily measured with considerable precision is a simple and practical solution criss 2022 the rating curves are usually represented by power functions constructed by manual methods or regression fitting herschy 2008 hamilton et al 2016 rainville et al 2016 other approximations of stream gauged data such as chebyshev polynomials fenton 2018 mcmahon and peel 2019 and piecewise continuous splines fenton 2018 holtschlag 2022 are used to represent a stage discharge relationship however simple power functions are common and can be applied to a wide range of rivers and streams such modeling is used effectively well in about 75 of canadian hydrometric stations hamilton et al 2016 rainville et al 2016 the changing hydraulic and morphological characteristics of rivers require that flow measurements be carried out in regular intervals usually every six weeks and in selected events fulton et al 2020 ideally gauging would be distributed over the full range of stages with uniform distribution as a general rule the minimum size of streamflow data should be twice as large as the number of rating parameters that must be obtained rainville et al 2016 therefore the building of rating curves is a challenging task mainly in ungauged sites with limited funding the simple rating curve cannot be employed at hydrometric stations with variable backwater or unsteady flow conditions rantz 1982 levesque and oberg 2012 the index velocity method is recommended for such situations which converts the measured local velocities to the mean channel velocity by the index velocity rating hong et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 cheng et al 2019 found that the performance of the index velocity was much better than the stage discharge rating in conditions of unsteady flows however the results from the kapuas river indonesia showed that the stage discharge rating performed better than the index velocity method kästner et al 2018 as the classic rating curve this method requires a large amount of data to be calibrated adequately traditionally manning s formula is used to estimate the discharge in rivers with simple cross section geometry other hydraulic methods such as the divided channel method dcm the coherence method cohm the weighted divided channel method wdcm and the modified divided channel method mdcm were proposed to improve manning s formula in compound channels lotter 1933 ackers 1993 lambert and myers 1998 khatua et al 2012 however each method has its restrictions and is insufficient to predict discharge accurately maghrebi et al 2017 in addition determining the manning roughness coefficient which plays a crucial role in manning s formula is a difficult task in the field ardıçlıoğlu and kuriqi 2019 more advanced methods based on machine learning and data driven techniques have been developed for stage discharge assessment most of these techniques exhibit a high performance in comparison to conventional methods techniques such as artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm fuzzy logic decision tree processes and wavelet analysis wa coupled with ann and svm were used to develop a stage discharge relationship e g deka and chandramouli 2003 bhattacharya and solomatine 2005 aggarwal et al 2012 ghorbani et al 2020 tripura et al 2021 kumar et al 2020 shukla et al 2021 these models construct input output relationships regardless of the physical principles and require a relatively large data set shukla et al 2021 as a result these methods might not be appropriate for the conditions of limited data other researchers such as e g maghrebi et al 2017 manfreda 2018 manfreda et al 2020 criss 2022 further utilized information extracted from surveyed data manfreda 2018 presented the flow area model in which the mean channel velocity and the flow area are stage related power functions according to this method the discharge like the continuity equation is the product of mean velocity and flow area this technique might be highly advantageous in data scarce environments manfreda et al 2020 however this method requires the trend of the mean channel velocity in data scarce environments to be determined in advance for instance the mean channel velocity was nearly a linear function in italian and american rivers studied by manfreda 2018 and criss 2022 but it was a logarithmic function in the tiber river datasets manfreda et al 2020 maghrebi et al 2017 presented a rating curve relationship utilizing one measured stage discharge point in addition to the hydraulic parameter uspm introduced by maghrebi 2006 and geometrical parameters including cross sectional area wetted perimeter and the width of the free surface the method demonstrated high efficiency in estimating rating curves in different laboratory sections and natural rivers the proposed method is applicable for steady flows and does not require any calibration since the method utilizes single pair of sampled stage discharge it is believed to be very effective and practical in data scarce environments nevertheless the accuracy of the rating curve is highly dependent on observed data precision using inaccurate reference data in maghrebi s relationship is reflected by errors in the resulting rating curve in addition despite the improvements in the technology of streamflow monitoring errors and uncertainty still occur continuously in gauging data manfreda et al 2020 therefore this paper mainly aims to overcome the weaknesses in maghrebi s relationship and to enhance its accuracy discharge measurements need to be continuous and the used methods should be simple sufficient and cost effective therefore the purpose of this study is to present an approach for estimating rating curves using minimum gauging data mainly in ungauged sites with limited funding a procedure to generate rating curves based on the relationship proposed by maghrebi et al 2017 combined with the inverse distance weighting idw method is introduced to this end a set of measured points is used to build rating curves based on maghrebi s relationship and the idw method is used to find the weighting average of these rating curves the idw method has many applications in hydrology and water sciences e g lu and wong 2008 waseem et al 2016 tan et al 2021 khouni et al 2021 jeong et al 2020 the method computes the value of unsampled points using the weighted average value of observed points so that the weights are inversely related to the distances between the observed and predicted points the weights are modified by a constant power α to match the studied phenomenon however this paper investigates a new application of the idw method to estimate rating curves this method has been adapted in which the elevation is used instead of the distance and the estimated values from maghrebi s relationship instead of the observed ones actual data collected from various rivers are used to determine the best value of α the current study has been conducted with the following specific objectives i to explore the applicability of the proposed technique ii to obtain the appropriate power of the weights α iii to obtain the minimum required measured data iv to address the performance of the proposed technique and compare it with the classic rating curves 2 methods and data 2 1 stage discharge relationship the current paper is built upon the previous works of maghrebi 2006 and maghrebi et al 2017 maghrebi 2006 introduced a mathematical model to estimate the isovel contours in any channel cross section in this method as shown in fig 1 the cross section is covered with triangular meshes and the boundary is divided into small elements ds the total velocity deviation at the center of the mesh element is calculated as follows 1 u y z boundary c 1 sin θ f r d s where c1 is a constant θ is the angle between the positional vector r and the boundary elemental vector ds and f r is the dominant velocity function maghrebi and ball 2006 have proposed the seventh root power law as a velocity function suitable for natural rivers therefore the local velocity u y z at each element can be computed as 2 u y z boundary c r 1 7 sin θ d s where c is a constant that equals unity for uniform boundary roughness therefore the mean velocity u spm can be calculated in the following manners maghrebi 2006 3 u spm a u y z d a a where da is the area of the mesh element and a is the cross sectional area maghrebi et al 2017 have used the uspm with other hydraulic and geometrical parameters to build a rating curve relationship they assumed that the flow rate could be connected to the relevant variables in the following equation maghrebi et al 2017 4 q a a 1 p a 2 p t a 3 u spm a 4 n a 5 where p t p t is the sum of the wetted perimeter p and the width of the water surface t and n is the manning roughness maghrebi et al 2017 presented their relationship as a ratio between discharges at two distinct water levels of the cross section experimental and field data were used to find the optimal magnitudes of the exponents a1 a2 a3 and a4 the exponent a5 was defined as a5 1 because of the inverse relation between flow rate and roughness in the manning formula therefore the final form of the stage discharge relationship was found maghrebi et al 2017 5 q e q r a e a r 0 972 p e p r 1 268 p t e p t r 0 832 u spm e u spms r n e n r 1 where the subscripts e and r refer to the estimated and referenced parameters respectively computing the discharge in different stages based on eq 5 requires a single measured flow rate linked to a reference stage besides cross section geometry the validation process using field data has ensured the high performance of eq 5 in estimating rating curves in natural rivers it should be mentioned that the relationship does not require any calibration however each reference stage will produce a unique rating curve maghrebi et al 2017 reported that the rating curves obtained based on reference points at high water levels are generally associated with more precise results one of the weaknesses of the relationship above is that when the regarded water level is far from the reference level the calculated discharge accuracy might decline maghrebi and ali 2019 also the accuracy of the outcomes is highly dependent on observed data precision as any kind of errors in reference measurement will be reflected in errors in the resulting rating curve ahmadi and maghrebi 2019 2 2 combination approach the reference point in the stage discharge relationship plays the most significant role in determining the rating curve any errors in the point information will produce errors in the entire rating curve and parts of the rating curve at levels far from the reference point may suffer from a lack of accuracy therefore this paper proposes using more than one measurement point to increase the rating curve s reliability various reference points at different levels are used to generate a set of rating curves the weighted average is employed for interpolating the final rating curve in the following manner 6 q e h i 1 n λ i h q e i h where n is the total number of reference points qe i h is the discharge at the stage h estimated from eq 5 based on the ith reference point and λi h is the weight of the rating curve i at the stage h the rating curve resulting from each reference point is believed to be dominant in the levels neighboring that point therefore the inverse distance weighting method idw is employed to derive the weights the idw method s weights are inversely related to the power of distances between the estimated and sampled stages the weights are defined in the following manner lu and wong 2008 7 λ i h h oi α i n h oi α with 8 i 1 n λ i h 1 where hoi h hr i is the level difference between h and the ith reference stage and α is the power of distance that plays a role in calculating the weighting factor the conceptual illustration of the implemented method is shown in fig 2 the figure illustrates how to compute the discharge at a stage he based on three gauging levels and the geometry information large α generates larger weights in the neighboring area and progressively down weights farther away using small α leads to the arithmetic average in the near region lu and wong 2008 according to eq 7 when α 0 then λi 1 n and hence 9 q e h i 1 n λ i h q e i h 1 n i 1 n q e i h in this case the estimated discharge is the average computed based on different reference levels in order to determine the appropriate value of α in the proposed method a trial and error procedure using different values of α from 0 to 5 is implemented observed data from four cross sections described in the next section are used to test the results it is found that α 0 corresponds to the least favorable results while α 1 is the most appropriate value more analysis of α effect is introduced in the result section the proposed method has some limitations in several situations such as in the case of alluvial rivers which are self formed and made up of mobile sediment or soil the cross sections of these rivers are shaped by the magnitude and frequency of the floods they experience the stability of the geometrical parameters used in the proposed method is a pivotal condition for proper estimation each change in the geometrical parameters associated with the reference section produces a new distinct rating curve therefore attempting to delineate fixed stage discharge relationships in anything other than bedrock channels is not feasible another limitation is that man made structures like dams and canal intakes can cause stage discharge relationships to modify in addition the stage at a given discharge of large rivers can shift by up to 2 m due to temperature effects maghrebi s relation was delivered by supposing a constant water slope for all levels therefore the method might not be applicable in hysteresis conditions where water surface slope and flow are not the same for a selected level in two floods 2 3 the classical model the power function is a simple model widely used to represent the stage discharge relationship in hydrometric stations it can be expressed as rantz 1982 10 q a h d m where h is the stage and a d and m are calibration parameters the parameters are calculated using the available data and the least squares method in this paper the classical model is referred to as model 1 and the proposed model as model 2 2 4 field data this paper exploits the data published by manfreda et al 2020 and knight et al 2009 to explore the performance of the proposed model the collected data from knight et al 2009 is used to determine the appropriate value of α and the other data is used to compare the proposed approach with the classical model the data set of knight et al 2009 consists of four river cross sections that are irregular in shape and cover a range of channel types they include simple cross section la suela river compound cross section severn and main rivers and asymmetric cross section trent river according to the available data the maximum depth of these sections varies from 1 78 m in the main river to 7 77 m in the severn river the maximum discharge varies from 58 m3 s in the main river to 331 m3 s in the severn river the gauged sections of ponte nuovo ponte felcino and santa lucia located on the tiber river in italy and ponte rosciano situated on the chiascio river which is a major tributary of the tiber river are used to validate the proposed approach the selected hydrometric stations were provided with a remote ultrasonic water level gauge at the same time the current meter was utilized to assemble the velocity measurements and thus evaluate the flow rate by the mid section method moramarco et al 2004 the flow rate and cross section geometry data were collected between 1982 and 2008 and the various geometry survey indicates that all cross sections were relatively stable in that period since the roughness variation along the wetted perimeter at the four cross sections is not available the roughness is presumed as homogenous as a result the influence of roughness in the relativity rating curve relationship eq 5 can be omitted the flow and site characteristics for all cross sections are shown in table 1 3 results 3 1 application of the proposed method in order to show the performance of the proposed relationship in different conditions it is applied to the cross sections collected from literature to begin the method is tested using only one reference measurement according to eq 5 to build a rating curve the computations must be conducted at numerous levels that cover the range of the desired rating curve therefore a reference point is chosen as one observed discharge with the corresponding stage qr hr from the available data then all geometrical parameters including a p and pt and the hydraulic parameter uspm are computed for the reference level and all other stages in the range of the rating curve once the parameters are calculated applying eq 5 for all levels leads to the estimated rating curve fig 3 shows the variation of each parameter in a dimensionless form from the lowest to highest stages for four studied cross sections fig 4 shows all potential rating curves for the selected cross sections the number of estimated rating curves represented by orange lines conforms to the available observed data in each section the solid black lines in fig 4 represent the mean value of all estimated rating curves it can be seen that the calculated rating curves do well in most cases the worst rating curves relate to the lowest reference levels while the best results correspond to the medium and high stages a general trend of overestimating the stage and underestimating the discharge by rating curves corresponding to lower references is observed the estimated rating curves were highly dependent on the selected reference point therefore incorporating more than one measured point is suggested to ensure more accuracy and take advantage of available observed data the combination of three rating curves based on selected reference points is illustrated in fig 5 which also provides the distribution of their weights the weighting factor λ in eq 6 specifies the percentage contribution of each of the rating curves in deriving the final rating curve the α parameter in eq 7 is used to modify the weighting factor to match the studied phenomenon for a considered rating curve as seen from fig 5 the weights that are computed based on α 1 equal one at the reference level zero at reference levels corresponding to other rating curves and relate inversely with the difference in depth between the reference and other stages in order to illustrate the impact of the parameter on the final rating curve the previous three rating curves are combined using different weights as shown in fig 6 the figure shows that the larger α the larger weights in the neighboring area and progressively down weights farther away for α 0 the combining approach yields the arithmetic average of the three rating curves as seen in fig 6 a therefore increasing the value of α leads to more dominance of each rating curve in its vicinity 3 2 impacts of the α parameter and the number of observed points the number of observed points and values of the weighting factor λ play a significant role in the proposed method therefore the new approach is applied to selected cross sections to obtain the best magnitude of the α parameter which controls the weighting factor λ and to study the impact of increasing the number of data used on results to this end 2000 subsamples selected randomly from observed data are generated to show the model s performance in various conditions the size of subsets ranges from 2 to 7 measurements the points in each subsample are employed as reference ones to compute the rating curves based on eq 5 and then to interpolate the final rating curve using eq 6 the calculations are repeated for different values of the α parameter the cross sections of la suela main severn and trent rivers are used to obtain the best α while the other sections are used in the final validation statistical criteria are used to evaluate the results including the mean absolute percentage error mape and the root mean square error rmse they are defined as follows 11 m a p e 100 n i 1 n q o i q e i q o i 12 rmse m 3 s 1 n i 1 n q o i q e i 2 where n is the number of observed data fig 7 shows the mean value of statistical measures for the results computed based on different sample sizes as seen in fig 7 the mape and rmse values are reduced with increasing sample size besides sample sizes of less than 5 points have more effect in improving the results than larger samples fig 7 shows the mean value of statistical measures for the results computed based on different sample sizes as well as different values of the α parameter red symbols represent mape values while blue symbols represent rmse values as can be seen in fig 7 mape and rmse values decreased with increasing sample size the maximum mape and rmse observed in the trent section are 22 5 and 13 1 m3 s respectively these values decreased to 13 5 and 8 6 m3 s when applying the proposed method using 7 points with α 1 in addition mape and rmse decreased to less than 11 and 7 m3 s in the remaining sections respectively for all sections α 0 is associated with the least favorable results the figure shows that the results are close to each other for larger values of α with a relative advantage of α 1 especially for sample sizes larger than 4 therefore α 1 is supposed to be the default value of this parameter and all analyses performed after here are based on α 1 for more demonstration of the benefits of the proposed method and to validate it the combination approach is applied to ponte nuovo santa lucia ponte felcino and ponte rosciano cross sections fig 8 shows the mean value of statistical measures for the results which computed based on different sample sizes as seen in fig 8 the mape and rmse values are reduced with increasing sample size furthermore sample sizes of less than 5 points have more effect in improving the results than larger samples rmse values declined from 62 27 4 46 76 7 m3 s to 32 8 14 4 23 5 33 9 m3 s using seven observed points in ponte nuovo santa lucia ponte felcino and ponte rosciano cross sections respectively in fact minimizing the width of uncertainty intervals is fundamental in building a model narrower uncertainty intervals mean a higher probability density of estimated rating curves for this reason the uncertainty bands for the proposed model are investigated in this study fig 9 shows the mean rating curve and 95 confidence interval for 2000 subsamples of two and three reference points no substantial differences between the two mean curves could be observed however the bands of uncertainty for three points cases are diminished this uncertainty analysis included only the random errors caused by gauging both stage and discharge according to mcmillan and westerberg 2015 errors in rating curve estimation could result from random instrumental errors and epistemic errors such as channel cross section changes since the cross sections studied in this paper were relatively stable over the study period only random errors are considered 3 3 comparison between the proposed model and the classical one the 2000 subsets of each sample size are employed to construct the rating curves using the proposed and classical models the sample size ranges from 4 to 15 measurements and the statistical measures mape and rmse are then used to compare the two models it should be mentioned that observed data on construction rating curves were not used in calculating the mape and rmse values fig 10 compares the statistical measures obtained from the two models for the ponte nuovo cross section the color of each point identifies the associated sample size the 1 1 line divides each plot in this figure into two portions specifying what model is performing better it can be observed that the mape and rmse values tend to decrease with increasing sample size for both models the proposed model tends to outperform the classical one especially for small sample sizes in many cases the hydrometric data from the field is only available for low and medium stages deriving the stage discharge curve for high levels has particular importance in flood control therefore to establish the performance of the proposed model in such conditions we limit the range of data to a determined threshold of non exceedance probability of water levels the probability of water level h not exceeding the threshold h is p h h the non exceedance probability is assumed to be in a range of 0 5 1 after arranging the recorded data in ascending order based on their levels h the non exceedance probability of each stage is computed hence the threshold h is the stage related to each required probability table 2 provides the values of h associated with the non exceedance probability from 0 5 to 1 when p h h 1 it means that the threshold h hmax and all available data are used in the analysis procedure whereas p h h 0 5 means that 50 of the available data associated with lower stages are employed the calculations of the non exceedance probability are based on the available collected data in each site and might not reflect reality according to manfreda et al 2020 the threshold of p h h 0 8 removes the floods from the dataset of the chiascio and tiber rivers thus high stage events in this paper denote floods that exceed the stage of p h h 0 8 while low and medium stage events are related to stages lower than that threshold in order to show the effect of sample size and the threshold variation the mean difference between statistical measures of models 1 and 2 are represented in fig 11 as a function of sample size employed in the construction rating curves the mean differences between statistical measures for each sample size are computed as follows 13 rmse 2 1 rms e 2 rms e 1 14 mape 2 1 map e 2 map e 1 where 1 and 2 refer to model 1 and model 2 respectively the mean values of statistical measures for each model are computed from the results of the 2000 subsets fig 11a shows the mean difference between the results of models 2 and 1 in terms of rmse as a function of sample size for various thresholds in the studied cross sections the negative values denote that the proposed model outperforms the classical one whereas the positive values refer to the relative advantages of the classical model fig 11a illustrates that model 2 outperforms model 1 for small sample sizes while the differences become smaller for larger samples in general the advantage of model 2 is more evident for lower thresholds however this is not a rule and in some cases the differences have a random distribution resulting from the data used for example in the ponte nuovo section the preference of model 2 is arranged according to the threshold except for p h h 0 7 or h 4 05 m where the data used within the range h 3 66 4 05 m are more randomly distributed as seen in fig 9a similarly the differences in mape shown in fig 11b denote that model 2 performs better than model 1 for all explored sample sizes in three cross sections results of both mape and rmse reveal that model 2 outperforms model 1 in both low and high water levels in the case of small sample sizes the derived rating curves based on all available data are used to measure the uncertainty the mean value of rating curves derived based on 5 points samples and its 95 confidence interval are shown in fig 12 the mean rating curve of model 1 appears to differ from the rating of model 2 at high stages in the santa lucia and ponte rosciano sections however they are close to each other in the ponte nuovo and ponte felcino sections the results indicated that using model 2 yields a notable decline in the uncertainty bands this feature evolved noticeably at high stages fig 13 provides a similar analysis of uncertainty for the cases of 10 points as can be seen the uncertainty bands are significantly diminished for both models fig 14 shows the mean rating curve and its 95 confidence interval for 2000 subsets of three reference points the outcomes of this study imply that the reference points at the lowest stages lead to more significant errors therefore the measurements at very shallow water levels are not employed in deriving rating curves in fig 14 also the three reference points are limited and distributed in the range of low and medium water levels the results of fig 14 denote that the exclusion of the lowest gauging leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the proposed model the model reasonably evaluates discharges at high water levels based on low and medium reference measurements it can be seen that most of the observed data not used in the construction of the rating curves are located inside uncertainty bands it is interesting to explore other methods like idw such as the kriging method the kriging is a geostatistical technique that uses the weighted combination of the observed values around the unknown point of interest it aims to minimize the variance of errors isaaks and srivastava 1989 burrough et al 2015 in this method the variance of the distance difference between observed points is represented by a semi variogram a mathematical function is used to fit the empirical variogram a tool used to investigate the spatial autocorrelation structure of the data the variogram of the ponte nuovo data is shown in fig 15 the horizontal axis represents the difference in stage and the vertical axis represents the semi variance of corresponding discharges the resulting empirical variogram can be fitted very well using a gaussian distribution investigating all other sections indicates that the gaussian distribution is a sound choice to fit the variogram for discharge stage data this might help reduce the required data for establishing the variogram by a priori assuming a gaussian distribution however due to the apparent trend of increasing discharge with stage the ordinary kriging failed to generate accurate weights when the estimate is extrapolated rather than interpolated the universal kriging which requires obtaining a deterministic function representing the data trend is used in such situations isaaks and srivastava 1989 in this case more data is needed to fit the deterministic function and the empirical variogram of residuals which might not be suitable for the topic of limited data in contrast the idw is an effective tool in restricted data environments it is a simple method easy to employ and most importantly it has a rational background it is because the rating curves were more accurate in the neighboring stages to the reference point in addition it has a significant role in improving the results the procedure proposed in this paper is advantageous in constructing rating curves in new sites specifically in the case of limited funding and building more reliable rating curves in gauged sites however the impact of heterogeneous roughness water surface slope or energy slope and the variation in cross section are not included in this study because this information might not be available in limited data conditions considering the variation of roughness leads to improvement in maghrebi s relationship ahmadi and maghrebi 2019 vatanchi and maghrebi 2019 and hence enhances the proposed approach in hysteresis conditions where the water surface slope and rating flow are not the same for a selected level in two floods the data used in generating the rating curve should be taken during only the rising or falling stage ahmadi and maghrebi 2019 however further analysis of the performance of the proposed method is required the optimal implementation of the proposed model requires picking the appropriate reference points as in this study previous studies have shown that maghrebi s relation may lead to higher errors at the lowest stages ahmadi and maghrebi 2019 vatanchi and maghrebi 2019 low stages are generally affected by local section control but fortunately these stages can be distinguished by representing the data in a log log scale plot to highlight the change in the rating curve slope fenton and keller 2001 manfreda et al 2020 we can conclude from the above analysis that the proposed model is an effective alternative especially in data scarce environments the results of a large number of explored samples show a considerable decrease in errors and uncertainty bands 4 conclusion rating curves are robust tools for continuously evaluating streamflows by gauging water levels discharge measurements need to be continuous and the used methods should be simple sufficient and cost effective therefore the purpose of this study is to present an approach for estimating rating curves using minimum gauging data mainly in ungauged sites with limited funding a procedure to generate rating curves based on a stage discharge relationship combined with the inverse distance weighting idw method was introduced in this study in order to determine the appropriate value of the α parameter in idw a trial and error procedure using different values of α from 0 to 5 is implemented to this end 2000 subsamples in different sizes selected randomly from the observed data of four cross sections were generated and the corresponding rating curves were delivered the mean absolute percentage error mape and the root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the results additional cross sections from the tiber river were used to validate the method and to compare it with the classical model in many cases the hydrometric data from the field are only available for low and medium stages therefore to establish the performance of the proposed model in such conditions we limited the utilized data to low and medium water levels the findings are summarized as follows using one reference point yielded satisfactory rating curves in most cases the lowest reference levels introduced the worst rating curves while the best results were associated with the medium and high stages the estimated rating curves were highly dependent on the selected reference point increasing the value of the α parameter in idw leads to more dominance of each rating curve in its vicinity it is found that α 0 corresponds to the least favorable results while α 1 is the most appropriate value the mape and rmse criteria values decrease monotonically with increasing the number of used reference points sample sizes of less than 5 points have more effect in improving the results than larger samples the proposed model outperforms the classical one especially for small sample sizes the results indicated that using the proposed model yields a notable decline in the uncertainty bands this feature evolved noticeably at high stages the uncertainty bands are significantly diminished for both models with increasing sample sizes the proposed model showed high potential efficiency in developing rating curves in data scarce environments a few reference points will effectively build a reliable rating curve even if they are distributed at low and medium stages the results denoted that the exclusion of the lowest gauging leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the proposed model the proposed method is advantageous in constructing rating curves in data scarce environments however in alluvial rivers where the cross section is unstable and the geometrical parameters are variables further investigations of the applicability of this method in such conditions are required moreover further analysis of the performance of the proposed technique is required in unsteady flow conditions credit authorship contribution statement ghadeer ali software data curation writing original draft investigation validation mahmoud f maghrebi

1726,multispecies arbor shrub mixed stands have long been applied in vegetation restoration of the chinese loess plateau and are expected to provide better production and ecosystem services than pure stands however whether higher species and structural diversity will help mitigate the limitations of drought on plantations growth remain poorly quantified we collected samples of the arbor platycladus orientalis linn and shrub caragana korshinskii kom under different stand structures with the same site conditions using dendroecological methods analyzed the resistance recovery and resilience of mixed and pure stands in response to extreme drought and compared the differences of recovery capacity under different tree species and stand structures based on the theory of full resilience results suggest that drought has a lag effect on plantations growth radial growth of mixed and pure stands was mainly limited by drought stress in autumn and winter of the previous year and late spring and early summer of the current year the recovery after the extreme drought of both planted p orientalis and c korshinskii mixed stands were significantly p 0 05 higher than pure stands and there are tradeoffs between resistance and recovery comparing the different tree species even if the drought induced p orientalis growth reduction reaches 58 5 mixed stands and 41 6 pure stands it still has the possibility of recover fully while c korshinskii is difficult to recover to the previous level and the mixed mode also affects the response of plantations to drought stress therefore the growth habits and adaptability of different planted species to drought stress should be considered in the future afforestation projects and select tree species with complementary traits for mixed planting taken together these findings have important significance for mitigating the limitations of drought on plantations growth and maintaining the ecological function stability of plantations in the western loess plateau keywords radial growth extreme drought recovery stand structures dendroecology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction forests as the main body of terrestrial ecosystems are an important natural carbon sink bonan 2008 cai et al 2022 in the context of currently climate change plantation forests are considered to be an effective way to enhance carbon stock capacity in ecologically fragile areas feng et al 2022 hua et al 2022 in view of china s carbon neutrality strategy of 2060 the healthy and stable development of plantation forests will contribute significantly to the achievement of the goal cai et al 2022 the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme droughts vicente serrano et al 2014 camarero et al 2015 which will have a negative impact on biodiversity and plant production of plantations ecosystem wang et al 2020 li et al 2021 manrique alba et al 2022 compared with natural stands planted stands have a relatively simple stand structure and species composition thus they are expected to show higher sensitivity to climate change navarro cerrillo et al 2020 camarero et al 2021 both the direct hydraulic performance is limited and indirect impacts such as fires and insect pests caused by extreme drought can lead to individual trees death and resulting in increased plantation forests mortality brzostek et al 2014 allen et al 2015 camarero et al 2015 seidl et al 2017 earles et al 2018 in the process of plantations construction mixed stands will produce complementarity effects between forest stands compared to pure stands due to the diversity of species composition and structures as well as intra and interspecific competition which will generate changes in the growth trajectories of plantation forests gotelli and colwell 2001 pretzsch et al 2010 gamfeldt et al 2013 forrester 2014 previous researches have revealed that multispecies stands mixtures or mixed stands with different functional traits e g evergreen and deciduous species broad leaved and needle leaved species have more efficient use of resources e g light and nutrients and better growth compared with single species stands monocultures or pure stands forrester 2014 feng et al 2022 and more resistance to external disturbances such as insect pests jactel et al 2020 however regarding whether higher species and structural diversity will help mitigate the limitations of drought on plantation growth there are inconsistent results on these questions bolte et al 2009 griess and knoke 2011 pretzsch 2014 fares et al 2015 navarro cerrillo et al 2020 liu et al 2022 therefore given the importance of ecosystem services functions of plantations under the current climate change scenario and considering the limiting effects of drought stress on plantations growth there is an urgent need to investigate the response of mixed and pure stands to extreme drought to provide effective strategic planning for plantations management to quantify the relationships between tree growth and extreme drought lloret et al 2011 proposed to compare the radial growth differences of trees before during and after a drought based on tree ring width indicator that is using the resistance rt recovery rc and resilience rs to investigate the recovery capacity of different tree species and the same tree species in different habitats to extreme drought in recent years the above methods have been widely used in the fields of climate change and forest ecology rais et al 2014 wang et al 2019a ovenden et al 2021 however due to there has the adaptability of trees under different habitats to the local environment as a result the ecological effects exist differences induced by the same drought event under different habitats and ultimately reduced the comparability of the drought vulnerability indices between sampling sites to address these questions schwarz et al 2020 proposed the concept of line of full resilience see methods section on the basis of the numerical relationships among rt rc and rs which allows a comparison of the recovery capacity of different sites tree species after drought and thereby provides a more in depth and systematic understanding of the vulnerability of plantations to extreme droughts the loess plateau is one of the areas with the most severe soil erosion in the world due to the impacts of both natural and man made activities the natural forests have destroyed and plantation forests dominate wang et al 2011 feng et al 2016 che et al 2022a platycladus orientalis linn and caragana korshinskii kom are the dominant tree species for afforestation of the chinese loess plateau jiang et al 2015 che et al 2022b although previous studies have investigated the response of radial growth of p orientalis and c korshinskii to climate xiao et al 2015 wang et al 2019b che et al 2023 these studies were mainly conducted for pure stands however the competition for resources light water and nutrients was different between arbor shrub mixed stands with different proportions and arbor shrub pure stands pretzsch et al 2013 wu et al 2018 forrester 2019 which in turn affects the capacity of plantations to resist external disturbances such knowledge may be more important for the ecological function stability maintenance and regulation of plantations in the western loess plateau for these reasons we selected sampling sites of planted arbor p orientalis shrub c korshinskii pure stand and p orientalis c korshinskii mixed stands in the western loess plateau using dendroecological methods to investigate the changes in vulnerability of mixed and pure stands in response to drought stress and its influencing factors considering that the species composition and structure of mixed stands were higher than the corresponding pure stands we hypothesized that the p orientalis c korshinskii mixed stands might have a higher recovery after drought compared with the pure stands this study aimed to answer two questions a are the resistance recovery and resilience of mixed stands to drought stress higher than the pure stands under the same drought event b how does the resilience change of mixed stands and pure stands to extreme drought over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and species the study area is located 104 48 e 104 67 e 35 64 n 35 73 n it belongs to the loess hilly and gully region we selected mixed stands and pure stands sampling sites with similar site conditions including yinwa mountains planted p orientalis pure stand pp c korshinskii pure stand pc p orientalis mixed stand mp1 c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 qinglan mountains planted p orientalis mixed stand mp2 and c korshinskii mixed stand mc2 fig 1 the climate is temperate continental arid climate with intense surface evaporation the average annual temperature is 7 14 the average annual precipitation is 399 mm the soil type is mainly loessal soil the vegetation types are mainly planted vegetation including platycladus orientalis linn pinus tabuliformis carr populus tomentosa carr caragana korshinskii kom picea crassifolia kom and amygdalus davidiana carr c de vos p orientalis is an evergreen tree species naturally distributed in northern northwestern and southwestern china it is sensitive to hydrothermal condition and is a light loving species with a well developed shallow root system and strong adaptability which can growth normally both in dry barren soil on the rock wall and slopes it has become one of the dominant tree species for afforestation in the semi arid loess plateau due to the low water demand and has an important moisture holding and water soil conservation function jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2019b sun et al 2021 c korshinskii is a shrub species naturally distributed in inner mongolia alxa league bayannur league western ningxia gansu hexi corridor and other desert areas it has become the dominant shrub species for reforestation in the loess plateau due to its strong utility in controlling shifting sands and water soil conservation function li et al 2006 fang et al 2007 che et al 2022b 2 2 tree ring data we collected the p orientalis tree cores and the c korshinskii tree discs at each sampling sites in july 2021 the sturdier individuals were selected for the p orientalis sampling and one core per tree was extracted at 20 cm using increment borers with a total of 116 tree cores c korshinskii tree discs were sampled by selecting healthy shrub branches and one disc was collected per tree with a total of 76 tree discs we measured two perpendicular directions randomly selected for shrub c korshinskii then using lintab measuring system to measure tree ring width using cofecha program holmes 1983 to check the cross dating results due to the planting time of plantation was same within each sampling site we used the regional curve standardization method to detrend cook 1985 briffa et al 1992 che et al 2022b 2023 several statistics such as mean sensitivity ms and expressed population signal eps are summarized in table 1 2 3 climate data this study collected the average monthly temperature and monthly precipitation data of the dingxi dx and huining hn meteorological stations china meteorological data network https data cma cn the data from dx station was used to analyze the relationships between ring width chronologies and temperature and precipitation in addition based on the observation data of the hn station we calculated the monthly resolved standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei 01 which further considers the effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration on regional dry wet conditions wells et al 2004 vicente serrano et al 2010 beguería et al 2014 che et al 2022b correlation analysis between ring width chronologies and climatic factors from september of the previous year to september of the current year were done using the dendroclim2002 program 2 4 determination of extreme drought years extreme drought year usually defined as a year in which precipitation is anomalously below average or the standardized drought index e g spei is below a certain threshold resulting in exceptionally narrow tree rings in forest stands due to water limitation in this study we determined the extreme drought years in the study area based on spei 01 and tree ring width according to literature theory and methods wang et al 2019a schwarz et al 2020 che et al 2023 moreover we use spei 01 0 of march to september as an alternative year mainly because spei 01 0 corresponds well to p pet 0 a standard of quantifying water shortage in this study area zang et al 2020 che et al 2023 fig s1 finally we identified 1995 pc and mc2 2000 pp and mp1 2011 pp mp1 pc mc1 mp2 and mc2 and 2016 pp mp1 and mp2 as extreme drought years for each sampling site 2 5 tree resistance recovery and resilience we applied the rt rc and rs proposed by lloret et al 2011 to assess the vulnerability of plantations to extreme drought in this study we selected 2 years as the reference time because we found that the growth of planted p orientalis and c korshinskii generally returns to its preceding level within 2 years after an extreme drought in addition this also avoided the impacts of other drought events on plantations growth schwarz et al 2020 che et al 2023 moreover in this study one way analysis of variance anova is used to compare the differences of tree resistance recovery and resilience at each sampling site however lloret s method could not compare recovery capacity of trees under different sampling sites or stand structures after extreme drought this decreases the need to use dendroecological methods to guide the implementation of plantation management strategies for this reason schwarz et al 2020 introduced the framework of the line of full resilience this method hypothesized that the tree species can recover fully under a certain drought event i e rs 1 the function equation is as follows 1 rc 1 rt then through a power function fitting of rt and rc of different individuals on the sampling site tree species scale to establish the line of actual resilience the function equation is as follows 2 rc α r t β finally by comparing the deviation and intersection between the two curves we can determine the recovery capacity of different tree species or stand structures thereby more in depth and systematic assess the recovery of trees in response to extreme droughts 3 results 3 1 the characteristics of radial growth and tree ring chronologies of mixed stands and pure stands the variations of radial growth of p orientalis and c korshinskii showed obvious difference under different stand structures fig 2 a among them the variations of p orientalis mixed stands in the yinwa mountains were significantly p 0 05 greater than the pure stands the mean ring width ranges from 0 24 to 2 14 mm yr 1 in mixed stands and 0 12 to 1 68 mm yr 1 in pure stands however the variations of c korshinskii mixed stands were significantly p 0 05 less than pure stands the mean ring width ranges from 0 07 to 0 77 mm yr 1 in mixed stands and 0 29 to 0 98 mm yr 1 in pure stands fig 2a the comparisons between the average monthly temperature and precipitation in extreme drought years and multi year average record suggested that both single month droughts high temperature and low precipitation may and july 2000 and long term droughts 2011 and 2016 during the growing seasons can cause anomalously reductions of radial growth fig 2b moreover the tree ring chronologies showed that the mean sensitivity ms of mixed stands were lower than the corresponding pure stands the signal to noise ratio snr of each chronological series were high and the expressed population signal eps were greater than 0 85 fig s2 table 1 indicating that the chronologies we established can be used to dendroecological studies 3 2 response of mixed stands and pure stands to drought stress correlation analysis indicated that the radial growth of the p orientalis mixed stands in yinwa mountains and qinglan mountains were significantly and positively p 0 05 correlated with spei 01 in whole hydrological year namely november mp1 and mp2 december mp2 of the previous year and april july mp1 may and september mp2 of the current year fig 3 radial growth of p orientalis pure stand pp and c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 in yinwa mountains was significantly p 0 05 and positively correlated with spei 01 in november and december of the previous year in addition the growth of mc1 was significantly p 0 05 and negatively correlated with spei 01 in september of the current year moreover the growth of c korshinskii pure stand pc was significantly p 0 05 and positively correlated with spei 01 in september and december of the previous year june and september of the current year fig 3 3 3 variations of drought vulnerability indices of mixed stands and pure stands to extreme droughts 3 3 1 difference of drought vulnerability indices of plantations under different stand structures under the same drought event 2011 the resistance of p orientalis pure stand pp 0 67 to extreme drought was significantly p 0 05 higher than mixed stand mp1 0 47 and the latter was significantly lower than mp2 2011 and 2016 fig 4 a however the recovery of p orientalis mixed stand mp1 2 70 after extreme drought 2011 was significantly higher than mp2 2 30 fig 4c and the recovery of mp1 2 44 after extreme drought 2016 was significantly p 0 05 higher than pure stand pp 1 54 under the same drought event 2011 the resilience of mp2 1 39 was significantly higher than mp1 1 21 and the latter was significantly lower than pp 1 49 fig 4e the resistance of c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 to extreme drought was significantly p 0 05 lower than mixed stand mc2 while the recovery was significantly higher than mc2 fig 4a and 4b in other words there are tradeoffs between resistance and recovery in addition the recovery of c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 1 51 after extreme drought 2011 was also significantly p 0 05 higher than pure stand pc 1 31 fig 4d in this study there was no significant difference between the resilience of c korshinskii mixed and pure stands fig 4f furthermore comparing the number of drought induced anomalously growth reduction events under different stand structures we found that the number of growth reduction events in mixed stands were less than pure stands mp2 compared to pp in 2000 thus further indicating that mixed stands are more resistance to extreme drought than pure stands fig 4a c e 3 3 2 difference in recovery capacity of plantations after extreme drought under different tree species and mixed mode the fitting results of the line of full resilience and line of actual resilience showed that the line of actual resilience of p orientalis mixed stand mp2 had the highest degree of overlap with the line of full resilience with the abscissa of the intersection 0 2757 was minimum fig 5 c that is p orientalis in mp2 had the strongest recovery capacity after extreme drought even if extreme drought induced p orientalis growth reduction reaches 72 5 there is still the potential could recover fully the degree of overlap between line of full resilience and line of actual resilience of pp and mp1 were lower than mp2 and the abscissa of the intersections were larger 0 58477 for pure stands and 0 55559 for mixed stands in other words even if the extreme drought induced p orientalis growth reduction reaches 41 6 pure stands and 44 5 mixed stands it still has the possibility could recover fully to growth levels before the drought events fig 5a and b the degree of overlap of two curves in c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 was higher than pure stand pc with the abscissa of the intersection being 0 95633 while the abscissa of the intersection for pure stand was 1 26971 fig 5d and e moreover the abscissa of the intersection for c korshinskii mixed stand mc2 was the largest 1 63305 fig 5f these results indicate that once extreme drought has affected the c korshinskii growth its subsequent growth will be difficult to recover to the previous level and may cause continuous growth reduction 4 discussion 4 1 major climatic factors affecting radial growth of mixed stands and pure stands many previous studies have reported that drought stress was the main limiting factor on the radial growth of p orientalis and c korshinskii huang et al 2006 wang et al 2019b che et al 2022b our results are consistent with the above phenomena both p orientalis mixed and pure stands as well as c korshinskii pure stands are limited by drought stress during the growing season may july when high temperatures limit the cambium activity and decrease or even stop cell division thus limiting tree growth jiang et al 2015 however there is a difference in the time of drought stress in mixed stands and pure stands the c korshinskii mixed stand in the yinwa mountains mc1 showed a significantly negatively correlated with spei 01 in september the reason may be related to the mixed mode of plantations with mp1 and mc1 located at the same site where the p orientalis was planted in the level trench and the c korshinskii was planted at the edge of the trench fig 1 and the understory herbaceous cover was 10 30 as the tree height of the arbor p orientalis 7 5 m was significantly higher than the shrub c korshinskii 2 0 m table 1 thus increasing the intensity of light interception together with being planted in the same level trench making it the light availability of the c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 significantly weaker than the pure stand pc in the same area climate growth relationships suggested that radial growth of c korshinskii in mc1 was significantly and positively correlated with temperature during the growing season fig s3 which further indicates the limiting role of local microhabitats i e mixed mode on plantations growth le maire et al 2013 forrester 2014 in addition correlation analysis showed that the radial growth of plantation forests was significantly and positively correlated with drought stress in autumn and winter of the previous year the warming of the non growing season is not conducive to the existence of winter snow cover and the increase in temperature will affect the carbon stock capacity of the plantations due to increased transpiration and carbohydrate consumption thus depleting the water and nutrients required for tree growth in the next year mcdowell et al 2011 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019b these results further confirmed the lagged effects of drought stress on tree growth wu et al 2018 che et al 2022b 4 2 multispecies mixing enhanced the recovery after the extreme drought of plantations the low resistance of mixed and pure stands to extreme drought corresponds to high recovery fig 4 that is there are tradeoffs between resistance and recovery gazol et al 2017 manrique alba et al 2022 these phenomena illustrate the acclimatation strategies of plantation forests for local environments during their long term evolution moreover the recovery after extreme drought of p orientalis c korshinskii mixed stands was significantly higher than pure stands under the same drought event which are consistent with our hypothesis however resistance and resilience did not show mixed stands is higher than pure stands the reason may be explained by the numerical relationships among drought vulnerability indices ruijven and berendse 2010 lloret et al 2011 manrique alba et al 2022 loreau et al 2001 found that mixed stands will create more biomass compared with pure stands called the biodiversity ecosystem functioning bef relationship which increase the canopy area and leaf area of mixed tree species allowing them to maintain a higher competitive advantage during the growth process when extreme droughts occur the higher structural variations within mixed stands generates complementarity effects making plantations better recruitment and maintaining the composition diversity of mixed tree species grossiord 2019 navarro cerrillo et al 2020 feng et al 2022 based on the results of the previous section the recovery capacity after the extreme drought may be related to the mixed mode under the same climatic and site conditions the resistance and resilience in mp2 were stronger than mp1 fig 4 even if the extreme drought induced p orientalis growth reduction reaches 72 5 it still has the possibility to recover fully in addition the number of drought induced anomalously growth reduction events were also less in mp2 than mp1 the p orientalis and c korshinskii in mp2 were planted in a different level trench with 4 m spacing between adjacent level trench planting p orientalis and c korshinskii respectively fig 1 compared with mp1 of mixed planting in the same level trench this ensured the complementarity effect of mixed stands without excessive competition which allowing more space for p orientalis and c korshinskii to obtain light and water resources benavides et al 2016 navarro cerrillo et al 2020 in contrast the resources light required for c korshinskii growth in mc1 is blocked by the p orientalis canopy as the stand develops the complementarity effect of mixed stands subsequently decreases and competition for resources increases forrester 2014 making the radial growth of c korshinskii in mc1 significantly limited by temperature the growth of c korshinskii in mc2 is not significantly correlated with temperature throughout the year fig s3a therefore local microhabitats i e mixed mode are also important factors to be considered in the future vegetation restoration of the loess plateau moreover comparing different tree species both the variations in drought vulnerability indices and line of full resilience indicated that arbor p orientalis had higher recovery after extreme drought compared with shrub c korshinskii the reasons may be related to the hydraulic performance and water use strategies developed during the adaptation of different tree species for the local environments wu et al 2018 during normal years c korshinskii mainly uses shallow 0 30 cm and middle layer soil water 30 140 cm when drought occurs middle layer water cannot meet the water demand of c korshinskii thus it will increase the utilization proportion of deep soil water greater than140 cm li 2020 if the water supply in deep soil is inadequate due to extreme drought which will cause a decline on the radial growth of c korshinskii as the stand develops the high frequency and intensity of drought events may further weaken the recovery capacity after drought of c korshinskii in contrast p orientalis has well developed shallow roots and has a stronger ability to use shallow soil water when drought occurs the well developed root systems can extend horizontally to use water at different locations at the same depth to maintain growth there has a stronger competitive advantage and adaptability to extreme drought compared with c korshinskii zang et al 2014 zhao 2017 wu et al 2018 thus showed higher recovery after drought however it should be noted that in this study we used an experimental design for sampling including pure and mixed stands different trees are samples in such stands but a real replication of sites is lacking in the design which is the limitation of this study consequently whether the differences between pure and mixed stands can be attributed to other specific characteristics of each stand is the next work we need to do 4 3 implications of loess plateau forestry practices for plantation forest management the variations of the drought vulnerability indices of mixed and pure stands suggested that both the stand structures and mixed mode affect the recovery capacity of the plantations after drought regardless of p orientalis and c korshinskii mixed stands have higher recovery after drought than pure stands in other words multispecies stands mixtures or mixed stands are more suitable for afforestation than single species monocultures or pure stands in the semi arid loess plateau moreover non climatic factors such as mixed mode also have a directly regulatory effect on plantations growth linares et al 2010 young et al 2017 che et al 2022a compared with mixed planting in same level trench alternate planting in the different level trench may be more beneficial to enhance the recovery after drought of plantations furthermore shrub c korshinskii is less in recovery after extreme drought than arbor p orientalis therefore the resistance of planted c korshinskii to drought may not be able to keep pace with recent and future climate change if the frequency and intensity of extreme droughts continue to increase and there may be a continuous growth reduction consequently in the future vegetation restoration appropriate plantation management practices e g mixed planting between arbor and shrub shrub coppicing are needed to mitigate excessive depletion of soil moisture and enhance the recovery of plantations to extreme droughts che et al 2022b piao et al 2022 the planner should consider both the growth habit and adaptability to drought stress of different planted tree species with tree species such as complementary traits selected for mixed planting on the basis of the climate growth relationships and local conditions to maximize the use of limited water resources 5 conclusions this study investigated the response of mixed and pure stands of planted arbor p orientalis and shrub c korshinskii to drought stress and variations of vulnerability after extreme drought in the western loess plateau we found that drought stress has a lag effect on plantations growth the recovery after the extreme drought in mixed stands was significantly higher than the corresponding pure stands and there are tradeoffs between resistance and recovery moreover the recovery capacity of p orientalis after extreme drought was stronger than c korshinskii therefore in the future vegetation restoration construction of the loess plateau the adaptive capacity of different planted species to drought stress and their recovery after extreme drought should be considered simultaneously and select tree species with complementary traits for mixing planting and the suitable mixed mode should be determined on the basis of local conditions to effectively improve the ecosystem quality and stability of plantations in the western

1726,multispecies arbor shrub mixed stands have long been applied in vegetation restoration of the chinese loess plateau and are expected to provide better production and ecosystem services than pure stands however whether higher species and structural diversity will help mitigate the limitations of drought on plantations growth remain poorly quantified we collected samples of the arbor platycladus orientalis linn and shrub caragana korshinskii kom under different stand structures with the same site conditions using dendroecological methods analyzed the resistance recovery and resilience of mixed and pure stands in response to extreme drought and compared the differences of recovery capacity under different tree species and stand structures based on the theory of full resilience results suggest that drought has a lag effect on plantations growth radial growth of mixed and pure stands was mainly limited by drought stress in autumn and winter of the previous year and late spring and early summer of the current year the recovery after the extreme drought of both planted p orientalis and c korshinskii mixed stands were significantly p 0 05 higher than pure stands and there are tradeoffs between resistance and recovery comparing the different tree species even if the drought induced p orientalis growth reduction reaches 58 5 mixed stands and 41 6 pure stands it still has the possibility of recover fully while c korshinskii is difficult to recover to the previous level and the mixed mode also affects the response of plantations to drought stress therefore the growth habits and adaptability of different planted species to drought stress should be considered in the future afforestation projects and select tree species with complementary traits for mixed planting taken together these findings have important significance for mitigating the limitations of drought on plantations growth and maintaining the ecological function stability of plantations in

diversity will help mitigate the limitations of drought on plantation growth there are inconsistent results on these questions bolte et al 2009 griess and knoke 2011 pretzsch 2014 fares et al 2015 navarro cerrillo et al 2020 liu et al 2022 therefore given the importance of ecosystem services functions of plantations under the current climate change scenario and considering the limiting effects of drought stress on plantations growth there is an urgent need to investigate the response of mixed and pure stands to extreme drought to provide effective strategic planning for plantations management to quantify the relationships between tree growth and extreme drought lloret et al 2011 proposed to compare the radial growth differences of trees before during and after a drought based on tree ring width indicator that is using the resistance rt recovery rc and resilience rs to investigate the recovery capacity of different tree species and the same tree species in different habitats to extreme drought in recent years the above methods have been widely used in the fields of climate change and forest ecology rais et al 2014 wang et al 2019a ovenden et al 2021 however due to there has the adaptability of trees under different habitats to the local environment as a result the ecological effects exist differences induced by the same drought event under different habitats and ultimately reduced the comparability of the drought vulnerability indices between sampling sites to address these questions schwarz et al 2020 proposed the concept of line of full resilience see methods section on the basis of the numerical relationships among rt rc and rs which allows a comparison of the recovery capacity of different sites tree species after drought and thereby provides a more in depth and systematic understanding of the vulnerability of plantations to extreme droughts the loess plateau is one of the areas with the most severe soil erosion in the world due to the impacts of both natural and man made activities the natural forests have destroyed and plantation forests dominate wang et al 2011 feng et al 2016 che et al 2022a platycladus orientalis linn and caragana korshinskii kom are the dominant tree species for afforestation of the chinese loess plateau jiang et al 2015 che et al 2022b although previous studies have investigated the response of radial growth of p orientalis and c korshinskii to climate xiao et al 2015 wang et al 2019b che et al 2023 these studies were mainly conducted for pure stands however the competition for resources light water and nutrients was different between arbor shrub mixed stands with different proportions and arbor shrub pure stands pretzsch et al 2013 wu et al 2018 forrester 2019 which in turn affects the capacity of plantations to resist external disturbances such knowledge may be more important for the ecological function stability maintenance and regulation of plantations in the western loess plateau for these reasons we selected sampling sites of planted arbor p orientalis shrub c korshinskii pure stand and p orientalis c korshinskii mixed stands in the western loess plateau using dendroecological methods to investigate the changes in vulnerability of mixed and pure stands in response to drought stress and its influencing factors considering that the species composition and structure of mixed stands were higher than the corresponding pure stands we hypothesized that the p orientalis c korshinskii mixed stands might have a higher recovery after drought compared with the pure stands this study aimed to answer two questions a are the resistance recovery and resilience of mixed stands to drought stress higher than the pure stands under the same drought event b how does the resilience change of mixed stands and pure stands to extreme drought over time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and species the study area is located 104 48 e 104 67 e 35 64 n 35 73 n it belongs to the loess hilly and gully region we selected mixed stands and pure stands sampling sites with similar site conditions including yinwa mountains planted p orientalis pure stand pp c korshinskii pure stand pc p orientalis mixed stand mp1 c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 qinglan mountains planted p orientalis mixed stand mp2 and c korshinskii mixed stand mc2 fig 1 the climate is temperate continental arid climate with intense surface evaporation the average annual temperature is 7 14 the average annual precipitation is 399 mm the soil type is mainly loessal soil the vegetation types are mainly planted vegetation including platycladus orientalis linn pinus tabuliformis carr populus tomentosa carr caragana korshinskii kom picea crassifolia kom and amygdalus davidiana carr c de vos p orientalis is an evergreen tree species naturally distributed in northern northwestern and southwestern china it is sensitive to hydrothermal condition and is a light loving species with a well developed shallow root system and strong adaptability which can growth normally both in dry barren soil on the rock wall and slopes it has become one of the dominant tree species for afforestation in the semi arid loess plateau due to the low water demand and has an important moisture holding and water soil conservation function jiang et al 2015 wang et al 2019b sun et al 2021 c korshinskii is a shrub species naturally distributed in inner mongolia alxa league bayannur league western ningxia gansu hexi corridor and other desert areas it has become the dominant shrub species for reforestation in the loess plateau due to its strong utility in controlling shifting sands and water soil conservation function li et al 2006 fang et al 2007 che et al 2022b 2 2 tree ring data we collected the p orientalis tree cores and the c korshinskii tree discs at each sampling sites in july 2021 the sturdier individuals were selected for the p orientalis sampling and one core per tree was extracted at 20 cm using increment borers with a total of 116 tree cores c korshinskii tree discs were sampled by selecting healthy shrub branches and one disc was collected per tree with a total of 76 tree discs we measured two perpendicular directions randomly selected for shrub c korshinskii then using lintab measuring system to measure tree ring width using cofecha program holmes 1983 to check the cross dating results due to the planting time of plantation was same within each sampling site we used the regional curve standardization method to detrend cook 1985 briffa et al 1992 che et al 2022b 2023 several statistics such as mean sensitivity ms and expressed population signal eps are summarized in table 1 2 3 climate data this study collected the average monthly temperature and monthly precipitation data of the dingxi dx and huining hn meteorological stations china meteorological data network https data cma cn the data from dx station was used to analyze the relationships between ring width chronologies and temperature and precipitation in addition based on the observation data of the hn station we calculated the monthly resolved standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei 01 which further considers the effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration on regional dry wet conditions wells et al 2004 vicente serrano et al 2010 beguería et al 2014 che et al 2022b correlation analysis between ring width chronologies and climatic factors from september of the previous year to september of the current year were done using the dendroclim2002 program 2 4 determination of extreme drought years extreme drought year usually defined as a year in which precipitation is anomalously below average or the standardized drought index e g spei is below a certain threshold resulting in exceptionally narrow tree rings in forest stands due to water limitation in this study we determined the extreme drought years in the study area based on spei 01 and tree ring width according to literature theory and methods wang et al 2019a schwarz et al 2020 che et al 2023 moreover we use spei 01 0 of march to september as an alternative year mainly because spei 01 0 corresponds well to p pet 0 a standard of quantifying water shortage in this study area zang et al 2020 che et al 2023 fig s1 finally we identified 1995 pc and mc2 2000 pp and mp1 2011 pp mp1 pc mc1 mp2 and mc2 and 2016 pp mp1 and mp2 as extreme drought years for each sampling site 2 5 tree resistance recovery and resilience we applied the rt rc and rs proposed by lloret et al 2011 to assess the vulnerability of plantations to extreme drought in this study we selected 2 years as the reference time because we found that the growth of planted p orientalis and c korshinskii generally returns to its preceding level within 2 years after an extreme drought in addition this also avoided the impacts of other drought events on plantations growth schwarz et al 2020 che et al 2023 moreover in this study one way analysis of variance anova is used to compare the differences of tree resistance recovery and resilience at each sampling site however lloret s method could not compare recovery capacity of trees under different sampling sites or stand structures after extreme drought this decreases the need to use dendroecological methods to guide the implementation of plantation management strategies for this reason schwarz et al 2020 introduced the framework of the line of full resilience this method hypothesized that the tree species can recover fully under a certain drought event i e rs 1 the function equation is as follows 1 rc 1 rt then through a power function fitting of rt and rc of different individuals on the sampling site tree species scale to establish the line of actual resilience the function equation is as follows 2 rc α r t β finally by comparing the deviation and intersection between the two curves we can determine the recovery capacity of different tree species or stand structures thereby more in depth and systematic assess the recovery of trees in response to extreme droughts 3 results 3 1 the characteristics of radial growth and tree ring chronologies of mixed stands and pure stands the variations of radial growth of p orientalis and c korshinskii showed obvious difference under different stand structures fig 2 a among them the variations of p orientalis mixed stands in the yinwa mountains were significantly p 0 05 greater than the pure stands the mean ring width ranges from 0 24 to 2 14 mm yr 1 in mixed stands and 0 12 to 1 68 mm yr 1 in pure stands however the variations of c korshinskii mixed stands were significantly p 0 05 less than pure stands the mean ring width ranges from 0 07 to 0 77 mm yr 1 in mixed stands and 0 29 to 0 98 mm yr 1 in pure stands fig 2a the comparisons between the average monthly temperature and precipitation in extreme drought years and multi year average record suggested that both single month droughts high temperature and low precipitation may and july 2000 and long term droughts 2011 and 2016 during the growing seasons can cause anomalously reductions of radial growth fig 2b moreover the tree ring chronologies showed that the mean sensitivity ms of mixed stands were lower than the corresponding pure stands the signal to noise ratio snr of each chronological series were high and the expressed population signal eps were greater than 0 85 fig s2 table 1 indicating that the chronologies we established can be used to dendroecological studies 3 2 response of mixed stands and pure stands to drought stress correlation analysis indicated that the radial growth of the p orientalis mixed stands in yinwa mountains and qinglan mountains were significantly and positively p 0 05 correlated with spei 01 in whole hydrological year namely november mp1 and mp2 december mp2 of the previous year and april july mp1 may and september mp2 of the current year fig 3 radial growth of p orientalis pure stand pp and c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 in yinwa mountains was significantly p 0 05 and positively correlated with spei 01 in november and december of the previous year in addition the growth of mc1 was significantly p 0 05 and negatively correlated with spei 01 in september of the current year moreover the growth of c korshinskii pure stand pc was significantly p 0 05 and positively correlated with spei 01 in september and december of the previous year june and september of the current year fig 3 3 3 variations of drought vulnerability indices of mixed stands and pure stands to extreme droughts 3 3 1 difference of drought vulnerability indices of plantations under different stand structures under the same drought event 2011 the resistance of p orientalis pure stand pp 0 67 to extreme drought was significantly p 0 05 higher than mixed stand mp1 0 47 and the latter was significantly lower than mp2 2011 and 2016 fig 4 a however the recovery of p orientalis mixed stand mp1 2 70 after extreme drought 2011 was significantly higher than mp2 2 30 fig 4c and the recovery of mp1 2 44 after extreme drought 2016 was significantly p 0 05 higher than pure stand pp 1 54 under the same drought event 2011 the resilience of mp2 1 39 was significantly higher than mp1 1 21 and the latter was significantly lower than pp 1 49 fig 4e the resistance of c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 to extreme drought was significantly p 0 05 lower than mixed stand mc2 while the recovery was significantly higher than mc2 fig 4a and 4b in other words there are tradeoffs between resistance and recovery in addition the recovery of c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 1 51 after extreme drought 2011 was also significantly p 0 05 higher than pure stand pc 1 31 fig 4d in this study there was no significant difference between the resilience of c korshinskii mixed and pure stands fig 4f furthermore comparing the number of drought induced anomalously growth reduction events under different stand structures we found that the number of growth reduction events in mixed stands were less than pure stands mp2 compared to pp in 2000 thus further indicating that mixed stands are more resistance to extreme drought than pure stands fig 4a c e 3 3 2 difference in recovery capacity of plantations after extreme drought under different tree species and mixed mode the fitting results of the line of full resilience and line of actual resilience showed that the line of actual resilience of p orientalis mixed stand mp2 had the highest degree of overlap with the line of full resilience with the abscissa of the intersection 0 2757 was minimum fig 5 c that is p orientalis in mp2 had the strongest recovery capacity after extreme drought even if extreme drought induced p orientalis growth reduction reaches 72 5 there is still the potential could recover fully the degree of overlap between line of full resilience and line of actual resilience of pp and mp1 were lower than mp2 and the abscissa of the intersections were larger 0 58477 for pure stands and 0 55559 for mixed stands in other words even if the extreme drought induced p orientalis growth reduction reaches 41 6 pure stands and 44 5 mixed stands it still has the possibility could recover fully to growth levels before the drought events fig 5a and b the degree of overlap of two curves in c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 was higher than pure stand pc with the abscissa of the intersection being 0 95633 while the abscissa of the intersection for pure stand was 1 26971 fig 5d and e moreover the abscissa of the intersection for c korshinskii mixed stand mc2 was the largest 1 63305 fig 5f these results indicate that once extreme drought has affected the c korshinskii growth its subsequent growth will be difficult to recover to the previous level and may cause continuous growth reduction 4 discussion 4 1 major climatic factors affecting radial growth of mixed stands and pure stands many previous studies have reported that drought stress was the main limiting factor on the radial growth of p orientalis and c korshinskii huang et al 2006 wang et al 2019b che et al 2022b our results are consistent with the above phenomena both p orientalis mixed and pure stands as well as c korshinskii pure stands are limited by drought stress during the growing season may july when high temperatures limit the cambium activity and decrease or even stop cell division thus limiting tree growth jiang et al 2015 however there is a difference in the time of drought stress in mixed stands and pure stands the c korshinskii mixed stand in the yinwa mountains mc1 showed a significantly negatively correlated with spei 01 in september the reason may be related to the mixed mode of plantations with mp1 and mc1 located at the same site where the p orientalis was planted in the level trench and the c korshinskii was planted at the edge of the trench fig 1 and the understory herbaceous cover was 10 30 as the tree height of the arbor p orientalis 7 5 m was significantly higher than the shrub c korshinskii 2 0 m table 1 thus increasing the intensity of light interception together with being planted in the same level trench making it the light availability of the c korshinskii mixed stand mc1 significantly weaker than the pure stand pc in the same area climate growth relationships suggested that radial growth of c korshinskii in mc1 was significantly and positively correlated with temperature during the growing season fig s3 which further indicates the limiting role of local microhabitats i e mixed mode on plantations growth le maire et al 2013 forrester 2014 in addition correlation analysis showed that the radial growth of plantation forests was significantly and positively correlated with drought stress in autumn and winter of the previous year the warming of the non growing season is not conducive to the existence of winter snow cover and the increase in temperature will affect the carbon stock capacity of the plantations due to increased transpiration and carbohydrate consumption thus depleting the water and nutrients required for tree growth in the next year mcdowell et al 2011 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019b these results further confirmed the lagged effects of drought stress on tree growth wu et al 2018 che et al 2022b 4 2 multispecies mixing enhanced the recovery after the extreme drought of plantations the low resistance of mixed and pure stands to extreme drought corresponds to high recovery fig 4 that is there are tradeoffs between resistance and recovery gazol et al 2017 manrique alba et al 2022 these phenomena illustrate the acclimatation strategies of plantation forests for local environments during their long term evolution moreover the recovery after extreme drought of p orientalis c korshinskii mixed stands was significantly higher than pure stands under the same drought event which are consistent with our hypothesis however resistance and resilience did not show mixed stands is higher than pure stands the reason may be explained by the numerical relationships among drought vulnerability indices ruijven and berendse 2010 lloret et al 2011 manrique alba et al 2022 loreau et al 2001 found that mixed stands will create more biomass compared with pure stands called the biodiversity ecosystem functioning bef relationship which increase the canopy area and leaf area of mixed tree species allowing them to maintain a higher competitive advantage during the growth process when extreme droughts occur the higher structural variations within mixed stands generates complementarity effects making plantations better recruitment and maintaining the composition diversity of mixed tree species grossiord 2019 navarro cerrillo et al 2020 feng et al 2022 based on the results of the previous section the recovery capacity after the extreme drought may be related to the mixed mode under the same climatic and site conditions the resistance and resilience in mp2 were stronger than mp1 fig 4 even if the extreme drought induced p orientalis growth reduction reaches 72 5 it still has the possibility to recover fully in addition the number of drought induced anomalously growth reduction events were also less in mp2 than mp1 the p orientalis and c korshinskii in mp2 were planted in a different level trench with 4 m spacing between adjacent level trench planting p orientalis and c korshinskii respectively fig 1 compared with mp1 of mixed planting in the same level trench this ensured the complementarity effect of mixed stands without excessive competition which allowing more space for p orientalis and c korshinskii to obtain light and water resources benavides et al 2016 navarro cerrillo et al 2020 in contrast the resources light required for c korshinskii growth in mc1 is blocked by the p orientalis canopy as the stand develops the complementarity effect of mixed stands subsequently decreases and competition for resources increases forrester 2014 making the radial growth of c korshinskii in mc1 significantly limited by temperature the growth of c korshinskii in mc2 is not significantly correlated with temperature throughout the year fig s3a therefore local microhabitats i e mixed mode are also important factors to be considered in the future vegetation restoration of the loess plateau moreover comparing different tree species both the variations in drought vulnerability indices and line of full resilience indicated that arbor p orientalis had higher recovery after extreme drought compared with shrub c korshinskii the reasons may be related to the hydraulic performance and water use strategies developed during the adaptation of different tree species for the local environments wu et al 2018 during normal years c korshinskii mainly uses shallow 0 30 cm and middle layer soil water 30 140 cm when drought occurs middle layer water cannot meet the water demand of c korshinskii thus it will increase the utilization proportion of deep soil water greater than140 cm li 2020 if the water supply in deep soil is inadequate due to extreme drought which will cause a decline on the radial growth of c korshinskii as the stand develops the high frequency and intensity of drought events may further weaken the recovery capacity after drought of c korshinskii in contrast p orientalis has well developed shallow roots and has a stronger ability to use shallow soil water when drought occurs the well developed root systems can extend horizontally to use water at different locations at the same depth to maintain growth there has a stronger competitive advantage and adaptability to extreme drought compared with c korshinskii zang et al 2014 zhao 2017 wu et al 2018 thus showed higher recovery after drought however it should be noted that in this study we used an experimental design for sampling including pure and mixed stands different trees are samples in such stands but a real replication of sites is lacking in the design which is the limitation of this study consequently whether the differences between pure and mixed stands can be attributed to other specific characteristics of each stand is the next work we need to do 4 3 implications of loess plateau forestry practices for plantation forest management the variations of the drought vulnerability indices of mixed and pure stands suggested that both the stand structures and mixed mode affect the recovery capacity of the plantations after drought regardless of p orientalis and c korshinskii mixed stands have higher recovery after drought than pure stands in other words multispecies stands mixtures or mixed stands are more suitable for afforestation than single species monocultures or pure stands in the semi arid loess plateau moreover non climatic factors such as mixed mode also have a directly regulatory effect on plantations growth linares et al 2010 young et al 2017 che et al 2022a compared with mixed planting in same level trench alternate planting in the different level trench may be more beneficial to enhance the recovery after drought of plantations furthermore shrub c korshinskii is less in recovery after extreme drought than arbor p orientalis therefore the resistance of planted c korshinskii to drought may not be able to keep pace with recent and future climate change if the frequency and intensity of extreme droughts continue to increase and there may be a continuous growth reduction consequently in the future vegetation restoration appropriate plantation management practices e g mixed planting between arbor and shrub shrub coppicing are needed to mitigate excessive depletion of soil moisture and enhance the recovery of plantations to extreme droughts che et al 2022b piao et al 2022 the planner should consider both the growth habit and adaptability to drought stress of different planted tree species with tree species such as complementary traits selected for mixed planting on the basis of the climate growth relationships and local conditions to maximize the use of limited water resources 5 conclusions this study investigated the response of mixed and pure stands of planted arbor p orientalis and shrub c korshinskii to drought stress and variations of vulnerability after extreme drought in the western loess plateau we found that drought stress has a lag effect on plantations growth the recovery after the extreme drought in mixed stands was significantly higher than the corresponding pure stands and there are tradeoffs between resistance and recovery moreover the recovery capacity of p orientalis after extreme drought was stronger than c korshinskii therefore in the future vegetation restoration construction of the loess plateau the adaptive capacity of different planted species to drought stress and their recovery after extreme drought should be considered simultaneously and select tree species with complementary traits for mixing planting and the suitable mixed mode should be determined on the basis of local conditions to effectively improve the ecosystem quality and stability of plantations in the western

1727,modeling of lateral carbon movement is critical for investigating carbon cycle in inland waters but it is quite challenging especially in headwater regions due mainly to the shortage of observations in this study long term soil and carbon losses documented by sediment deposition before check dam were firstly integrated to the widely used soil and water assessment toll swat for investigating the lateral movement of soil and carbon in a typical ungagged headwater basin on the chinese loess plateau clp then the effects of land use and land cover lulc changes on soil and carbon losses in the typical loess watershed fangta river basin ftrb were investigated our case study suggested that sediment and carbon fluxes documented by sediment records could provide key information for model calibration and validation in ungagged headwater regions and the satisfactory performance suggested the promising use of sediment records in modeling of lateral carbon movement headwater regions on the clp suffered serious soil and carbon losses during the past decades and soil and carbon loss intensities were 6 821 6 t km 2 yr 1 and 16 9 t km 2 yr 1 during the study period 1976 2016 respectively lulc changes characterized by conversion from cropland to forest reversed the deterioration of soil and carbon losses caused by climate change our study identified the integration of sediment records and hydrological model in soil and lateral carbon movement investigation under dramatic environmental changes keywords data integration land use and land cover changes modeling soil and carbon losses ungagged watersheds data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lateral carbon flux from land to inland waters was estimated to be 2 95 pg c yr 1 comparable to the net carbon sink of global terrestrial ecosystems regnier et al 2022 lateral carbon from uplands migrates horizontally across landscapes eroded and deposited along slopes li et al 2019 liu et al 2003 transported in terrestrial water bodies raymond et al 2008 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2019c and eventually entering the oceans liu et al 2020 regnier et al 2013 syvitski et al 2022 at the same time laterally transferred carbon may deposit in water bodies such as rivers lakes and reservoirs hilton and west 2020 mariappan et al 2021 mendonca et al 2017 then some so them may be emitted from water bodies to atmosphere raymond et al 2008 yue et al 2016 laterally transferred carbon along the land to ocean continuum is a topic with broad interest as it greatly changes the spatial pattern of organic carbon on earth surface and affects the terrestrial aquatic and marine ecosystems hilton 2017 li et al 2022 soil erosion is the dominant source for the lateral movement of carbon contributing more than half of the lateral carbon flux in inland waters luo et al 2022 qu et al 2020 accurate modeling of lateral carbon loss induced by soil erosion is vital for better constraining the estimates of ecosystem carbon exchange especially for understanding the role of river networks the largest biogeochemical nexus between the continents ocean and atmosphere pilla et al 2022 previous modeling studies have revealed that environmental changes greatly changed the patterns of soil erosion globally as well as the amount and composition of erosion induced land carbon delivery rabiei et al 2022 razmi et al 2022 yue et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 however there are few long term studies about the temporal evolution of erosion induced carbon fluxes and their responses to environmental changes battin et al 2023 headwater regions are the dominant source of water sediment carbon in rivers connected to the rest of the river networks by small headwater streams alexander et al 2007 creed et al 2017 datry et al 2018 it was estimated that headwater regions covered 60 of stream length nadeau and rains 2007 providing approximately 70 of water and 65 of nitrogen to inland waters alexander et al 2007 and contributing more than 70 of greenhouse gas emission from global water bodies li et al 2021 moreover headwater regions are more sensitive to environmental changes especially when considering the alteration of underlying surface caused by human activities during the past decades indicating potential intense changes of erosion induced lateral carbon movement in these regions however the observation of lateral carbon movement in headwater regions is very limited as most traditional gaging systems mainly focused on downstream rivers acuña et al 2014 sediment deposition in reservoirs lakes and rives well documented historical hydrological events mills et al 2017 radbourne et al 2017 and hydrological components e g rainfall runoff and sediment can be interpreted based on the sediment depositions at annual or event scales providing a powerful tool for inferring historical hydrological processes in ungagged headwater regions nafchi et al 2021 wang et al 2019b wei et al 2017b xiao et al 2023 meanwhile physically based hydrological models have been widely used for simulating hydrological processes for a continuous time period but data shortage limited parameter estimation for models especially for headwater regions with few observations doetterl et al 2016 therefore the integration of sediment deposition records and hydrological models can be a promising method for investigating lateral carbon movement from land to inland waters because hydrological models are good at continuously simulating spatiotemporal carbon loss and sediment deposition can provide necessary support for model calibration and validation the chinese loess plateau clp is one of the most seriously eroded regions globally making it the dominant sediment source of the yellow river the most sediment laden river on the earth fu et al 2017 a large amount of sediment from the loess plateau had provided materials for sustaining the river and ocean ecosystems while carbon attached on sediment could influence the regional carbon balance more than 1 6 pg of sediment was transported by the yellow river annually during 1919 1959 hu 2016 meanwhile with 0 66 tg of poc being delivered each year liu et al 2015 in recent years large scale national ecological projects had been implemented on the clp to alleviate the serious soil erosion such as the grain for green project which was represented by remarkable reforestation and grass planting however the responses of lateral carbon loss to revegetation was still not clear mainly due to the lack of field observations therefore it is promising to integrate sediment records and hydrological modeling in investigating soil and lateral carbon losses from headwater regions on the clp therefore the objectives of this study was to 1 integrate sediment records and physically based hydrological model to study soil and carbon losses from ungagged headwater regions 2 investigate the responses of soil and carbon losses to intense land use and cover changes on the chinese loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the chinese loess plateau locates in the northwest of the china mainland which is famous for its serious soil erosion and its dominant contribution to the high sediment load of the yellow river fig 1 a the fangta river basin ftrb a typical headwater watershed locates in the middle of the clp has experienced both serious soil erosion and extensive lulc changes during the past decades fig 1b the mean annual precipitation of the ftb is 509 mm and more than 75 of the annual precipitation falls as rainstorms in the wet season june to september the original natural vegetation is the transition from forest to prairie and there are three main land use types in the ftrb the agricultural land the grass land the forest land covering more than 99 of the basin area according to the baseline 1975 land use agricultural land mainly distributed on flat mountain tops covering about 44 of the whole basin while most grassland distributed on the steep slopes along gullies fig 1c 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 swat input daily meteorological data including precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation hour were collected from a nearby weather station the ansai station which is 30 km away from the ftrb the digital

science data center https loess geodata cn data land use in five time periods including the 1975 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 were used in this study the 1975 land use data was from the national earth system science data center https loess geodata cn data land use maps at 1990 2000 and 2010 were provided by the institute of remote sensing and digital earth cas and the 2020 land use map was visually interpreted based on high resolution images from google earth 2 2 2 soil and carbon losses observations in this study soil and carbon losses observations from runoff plots were from jia s 2009 research on nearby hillslopes in the ansai county providing soil and carbon losses from slopes with gradients ranging from 10 to 30 in the ftrb a check dam was constructed at the outlet of the headwater basin which intercepted almost all sediment and attached carbon from the basin providing important carrier for reconstructing the long term soil loss of the ungauged watershed sediment and carbon deposition data during the check dam operation period 1975 1990 at the event scale was collected from previous studies li 2017 wei et al 2022 in this study the sediment and carbon deposition data during the last three operating years 1988 1990 was not used because sediment into the check dam would be drained out when the storage is almost full sun and wu 2022 2 3 methods 2 3 1 swat model

management on water sediment and nutrients yields arnold et al 1998 the swat model is temporally continuous and spatially distributed and it has been widely used in various climatic and land surface conditions for long term simulation of hydrological processes and material fluxes many studies have proven that the swat model performed well in runoff and sediment yield processes modeling at multiple scales on the clp sun et al 2020b yang and lu 2017 the swat model delineates watershed into sub basins based on the digital elevation model and the stream network then the sub basins are further subdivided into small hydrologic response units hrus and each hru is assumed to be homogeneous in terms of soil land use and topographic characteristics in the swat model soil erosion from each hru is calculated using the musle equation as followed 1 sed 11 8 q surf q peak a r e a hru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle l s usle c f r g where sed is sediment yield per day in tons ha 1 qsurf is

neitsch 2011 2 3 2 enrichment ratio calculation soil erosion is a selective processes in transporting soil particles and finer particles were more easily to be eroded and transported during erosion processes nie et al 2014 the selectivity of soil erosion would resulted in the enrichment of organic carbon and other nutrients because the preferentially delivered silt and clay particles had higher are richer in organic carbon müller nedebock et al 2016 wang et al 2019a wei et al 2017a the enrichment ratio er the ratio of nutrients in eroded sediment to that of soil is commonly used in hydrological models for nutrients loss modeling palis et al 1990 in this study one of the most widely used enrichment ration calculation method proposed by menzel 1980 was adopted 2 er a s e d u b where a and b are variable coefficients sedu is sediment yield per unit area t ha 1 in this study the two empirical coefficients a and b in the menzel equation was estimated using the field carbon loss observations as shown in fig 2 the er can be well predicted with soil loss intensity with the a of 2 40 b of 0 27 and r2 of 0 82 thus soc content in the eroded soil can be calculated using the following equation 3 c sed e r c sol where csed is the soc content in sediment from a specific hru and csol is the soc content in original soil for the corresponding hru 2 3 3 dynamic changes of soc in sediment retained by check dam sediment and the attached carbon from the entire catchment deposited layer by layer before check dam for a long period the deposited soc mineralized and decomposed through physical chemical and biological effects tong et al 2020 van oost et al 2012 in this study we introduced the transformation equation to estimate the dynamic changes of soc during the preservation period in the transformation equation the transform rate depends on the original soc content as follows 4 d c soc dt k c soc where csoc is the soc content at that time t k is the rate constant yr 1 thus the preserved soc content at any time t can be calculated using the following equation 5 c t s o c c 0 s o c e k t t 0 where ct soc is the soc content at any time t c0 soc is the initial soc content and t t0 is the preservation time since sediment and the attached carbon was retained by check dam 2 3 4 data integration in the data integration scheme fig 3 sediment simulation at each hru was provided by the swat model and the er equation was derived from field observations thus soc content in the sediment can be simulated using eqs 2 and 3 then soc content at the eroded time was further coupled with eq 5 to simulate the preserved soc sediment deposition and the preserved soc derived from dynamics of sediment profile can be used for model calibration and validation thus the framework can be used for simulating soil and carbon losses in ungagged headwater watersheds 2 3 5 model setup parameter optimization and performance evaluation in this study the whole ftrb was divided into 46 sub basins and 508 hrus based on the input dem soil and land use data the model was setup with 6 year 1976 1981 calibration and 6 year validation 1982 1987 based on the previous publications and our experiences on swat modeling in this region sun et al 2020a 2020b yang and lu 2017 zhao et al 2018 xu et al 2013 11 parameters were selected for sediment calibration table 1 swat cup was employed in this study for parameter optimization using the bayesian based optimization algorithm sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2007 a sensitivity matrix and hessian matrix are calculated to update and narrow the parameter ranges in the parameter identification process of the sufi 2 algorithm and detailed steps of sufi 2 can be referred to abbaspour et al 2004 the performance of the model was evaluated based on the criteria proposed by moriasi 2007 using the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and percent bias pbias 3 results 3 1 effectiveness of the integration method fig 4 a shows the scatterplot of observed versus simulated monthly sediment yield during the calibration and validation period visual inspection suggests that the swat model well simulated sediment yield in the ftrb because all the simulation observation points are around the 1 1 line mean monthly observed and simulated sediment yield over the calibration period were 24 063 and 26218 t respectively with a 9 0 overestimation the r2 and nse of sediment yield over the calibration period were 0 92 and 0 88 respectively indicating a very good model performance based on the thresholds proposed by moriasi 2007 mean monthly observed and simulated sediment yield during the validation period is 23590 t and 23495 t respectively the r2 nse and pbias during the validation period were 0 66 0 60 and 0 4 table 2 respectively the simulation of sediment yield over the validation period can be rated as satisfactory according to the criteria proposed by moriasi 2007 overall simulated sediment yield matched well with observed values with the r2 of 0 82 nse of 0 77 and pbias of 4 3 for the whole modeling period suggesting that sediment yield estimated using sediment deposition dynamics can be used for sediment calibration and validation in hydrological models fig 4b shows the scatterplot of observed versus simulated monthly carbon loss from the ftrb during the calibration and validation period visual comparison suggests that the swat based framework can well simulate monthly carbon loss because all the simulation observation points are along the 1 1 line more than 85 of the simulated carbon loss fall within the 50 band error as shown in fig 4b mean monthly carbon loss observation and simulation during the calibration period were 43 87 and 41 40 t respectively with a 5 60 underestimation the r2 and nse for carbon loss simulation during the calibration period were 0 65 and 0 63 respectively indicating a satisfactory performance moriasi et al 2007 mean monthly observed and simulated carbon loss during the validation period is 43 95 t and 45 66 t respectively the r2 nse and pbias during the validation period were 0 66 0 65 and 3 90 respectively the simulation of carbon loss during validation period can be rated as good using thresholds proposed by moriasi 2007 overall simulated carbon loss matched well with observations with the r2 of 0 65 nse of 0 64 and pbias of 0 9 for the whole modeling period the evaluation results suggested that carbon loss estimated using the sediment deposition dynamics can be integrated to hydrological models for simulating carbon loss from ungagged headwater watersheds 3 2 lulc changes in the ftrb land use change in the ftrb was dominated by the increase of woodland and the decrease in the cropland and grassland during the past 45 years fig s1 grassland was the dominant land use type in 1975 and 1990 taking more than 50 of the entire basin and cropland covered about 40 of the entire ftrb however woodland was the dominant land use type during the recent 2010 and 2020 land use scenario covering about 40 of the total area and only 20 of the ftrb was covered by cropland the area of both cropland and grassland decreased greatly during 1975 to 2000 especially since the 1990s fig 5 due to the implementation of large scale ecological restoration programs sun et al 2019b at the same time the area of woodland increased from 1 to 7 5 during 1975 to 1990 and then to 37 6 in 2000 during 2000 to 2010 the percentage of cropland kept decreasing from 32 5 to 15 1 of the total area while the area of grassland increased from 29 9 to 42 3 the land use conversion during the recent decade was less intense than the 1990s and 2000s and the area of woodland remain unchanged while some of the grassland were converted into cropland 3 3 temporal trends of soil and carbon losses temporal changes of soil and carbon losses under the baseline and actual land use were presented in fig 6 soil and carbon losses under the baseline land use scenario i e 1975 land use scenario increased slightly p greater than 0 05 while soil and carbon losses under actual land use decreased significantly during 1976 to 2016 p 0 05 the slightly increase in soil and carbon losses under the baseline land use scenario can be explained by the changes in precipitation global climate changed rainfall patterns on the clp significantly characterized with significant increase in extreme rainfall events during the flood season higher rainfall extremes could have caused the increase in runoff as well as severer soil and carbon losses on the loess plateau under the baseline land use scenario fig 6 and fig s2 vegetation and precipitation exert competing effects on soil loss because the intensified rainfall increases and better vegetation cover alleviates soil erosion langbein and schumm 1958 in the ft watershed the remarkable land use changes had altered the potential deterioration of soil and carbon losses caused by the changing rainfall patterns resulting the significant of decrease in both soil and carbon losses p 0 05 i e the soil and carbon losses under the actual land use scenario in fig 6 3 4 effects of lulc changes on soil and carbon losses soil loss from the ftrb under different land use scenarios and the contributions of each land use type was shown in fig 7 mean annual soil loss from the entire ftrb under the five land use scenario during the study period 1976 2016 was 80 116 75 312 53 810 39 450 and 41 227 t respectively compared with the baseline land use 1975 soil loss from the other four land use scenarios decreased by 6 0 32 8 50 8 and 48 5 respectively under the 1975 land use the contribution of cropland grassland and woodland to soil loss was 63 9 36 0 and 0 1 respectively while the land cover percentage of the three land use types was 43 8 55 2 and 1 0 respectively land use changes in the ftrb changed the composition of different vegetation types as well as the contributions of different land cover types to soil and carbon losses grassland contributed 49 8 of soil loss with the covering area of 37 2 under the 2020 land use scenario while cropland contributed 34 8 of the soil loss with the covering area of 20 2 mean annual lateral carbon loss from the ftrb under the five land use scenarios during the study period 1976 2016 was 215 4 201 9 119 5 87 6 and 92 6 t respectively showing similar decreasing trend to that of sediment yield fig 8 lulc changes reduced the lateral carbon loss from the ftrb by 6 3 44 5 59 3 and 57 0 respectively compared the baseline 1975 land use 4 discussion 4 1 soil and carbon losses from different land use types soil and carbon losses are the result of interactions among many environmental factors including rainfall topography vegetation cover and soil conditions liu et al 2022 tian et al 2015 on the loess plateau vegetation cover increased dramatically during the past decades with the evolution of land use patterns caused by ecological restoration projects greatly changing the soil and carbon fluxes from terrestrial landscape to water bodies revegetation changed the composition of different land use types with the dramatic decrease of cropland and the expansion of woodland and grassland altering the soil and carbon losses from the headwater watershed soil loss rates in forests and grasslands are generally lower than in croplands because trees and grasses provide better ground cover with the accumulation of litter and the better canopy as well as the protection of soil from better root structures sun et al 2020a in this study mean annual soil loss from cropland grassland and woodland was 13 460 5 3 375 3 and 1 363 3 t km2 yr 1 respectively paired t test indicated significant differences of soil loss intensity from the three land use types p 0 01 and the soil loss from cropland was 9 9 and 4 0 times to that from woodland and grassland respectively fig 9 a higher primary production means higher soil organic carbon content for forest and grassland sun et al 2019a in this study mean soc content for forest grassland and cropland was 4 99 4 58 and 3 62 g kg 1 respectively indicating potential higher carbon loss with the same amount of eroded soil from forest and grassland carbon loss from cropland grassland and woodland was 37 0 15 4 and 4 4 t km2 yr 1 respectively with significant difference by the paired t test p 0 01 carbon loss intensity of cropland was 8 4 and 2 4 times to those from woodland and grassland respectively fig 9b though carbon content of soil eroded from forest and grassland was much higher than that from the cropland fig 9c thus the dramatic decrease in the fraction of cropland and the expansion of woodland and grassland have greatly alleviated soil and carbon losses in this region in addition remarkable land use changes also altered the natural vegetation topography distribution vegetation patterns self organized on semiarid hillslopes mainly due to the coevolution with the erosion induced landforms saco and moreno de las heras 2013 srivastava et al 2022 for example vegetation greenness on polar facing slopes tend to be higher than on equatorial facing slopes istanbulluoglu et al 2008 kumari et al 2020 with the implementation of the grain for green project croplands on slopes higher than 25 were gradually shifted to forest and grassland resulting the changes of vegetation topography patterns in the ft watershed fig s3 thus the new vegetation topography i e croplands with lower vegetation cover on flatter slopes and forest and grass with higher vegetation cover on steeper slopes had enhanced effects of land use type changes on the decrease soil and carbon losses in the ft watershed 4 2 limitations and prospects of the integration method sediment from upland soils were retained by check dams layer by layer thus the historical hydrological processes and environmental changes were well recorded by the dynamics of sediment profiles wang et al 2014 in this study we examined the use of long term sediment and carbon deposition observations documented by sediment deposition for soil and carbon losses modeling in a typical ungagged headwater watershed the modeling results suggested that the integration of sediment deposition information and hydrological model was promising however the integration method was still subjected to uncertainties on the one hand soil and carbon losses observations provided by sediment deposition dynamics were still not long enough mainly due to the fast siltation of check dam storage and short working period for example the 18 m sediment profile in the ftrb only provided sediment deposition covering 12 years thus the data series should be extended to a longer time period especially covering the remarkable revegetation in the recent 30 years on the loess plateau a large number of check dams were built through the past decades thus soil and carbon losses observations can be extended by compiling sediment profiles from different dams in future studies meanwhile sediment was buried underground and it is difficult to estimate sediment volume for each layer accurately indicating possible uncertainties for the estimated sediment fluxes on the other hand the model structure can also be improved to reduce simulation uncertainties the er equation is critical for the modeling of carbon loss and the use of different er equations might bring large discrepancies zhang 2018 in this study we firstly localized the carbon loss er equation using field observations from runoff plots improving the calculation of carbon content in eroded soils however the er equation was derived from field observations on runoff plots with barren land and the changes of er equation caused by different land use and land cover types was neglected therefore the improvement of er equation by considering the effects of land use and cover change would be an interesting topic in future studies 5 conclusions this study for the first time integrated soil and carbon losses by sediment deposition and hydrological modeling we also investigated the effects of land use changes on soil and carbon losses in a typical ungagged headwater watershed on the chinese loess plateau our results suggested that the integration method showed good performances in simulating soil and carbon losses numeric model evaluation indices rated the soil and carbon losses simulation as very good and satisfactory respectively indicating the promising use of sediment records in improving modeling of lateral carbon movement headwater watersheds on the clp experienced remarkable land use changes under the implementation of ecological restoration projects characterized by the expansion of forest and grassland the land use changes had reversed the deterioration of soil and carbon loss owing to climate change the integration method proposed in this study can be useful for modeling of lateral carbon transfer and the findings can be valuable for formulating sustainable watershed management mitigate global climate change credit authorship

1727,modeling of lateral carbon movement is critical for investigating carbon cycle in inland waters but it is quite challenging especially in headwater regions due mainly to the shortage of observations in this study long term soil and carbon losses documented by sediment deposition before check dam were firstly integrated to the widely used soil and water assessment toll swat for investigating the lateral movement of soil and carbon in a typical ungagged headwater basin on the chinese loess plateau clp then the effects of land use and land cover lulc changes on soil and carbon losses in the typical loess watershed fangta river basin ftrb were investigated our case study suggested that sediment and carbon fluxes documented by sediment records could provide key information for model calibration and validation in ungagged headwater regions and the satisfactory performance suggested the promising use of sediment records in modeling of lateral carbon movement headwater regions on the clp suffered serious soil and carbon losses during the past decades and soil and carbon loss intensities were 6 821 6 t km 2 yr 1 and 16 9 t km 2 yr 1 during the study period 1976 2016 respectively lulc changes characterized by conversion from cropland to forest reversed the deterioration of soil and carbon losses caused by climate change our study identified the integration of sediment records and hydrological model in soil and lateral carbon movement investigation under dramatic environmental changes keywords data integration land use and land cover changes modeling soil and carbon losses ungagged watersheds data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lateral carbon flux from land to inland waters was estimated to be 2 95 pg c yr 1 comparable to the net carbon sink of global terrestrial ecosystems regnier et al 2022 lateral carbon from uplands migrates horizontally across landscapes eroded and deposited along slopes li et al 2019 liu et al 2003 transported in terrestrial water bodies raymond et al 2008 wang et al 2020 wang et al 2019c and eventually entering the oceans liu et al 2020 regnier et al 2013 syvitski et al 2022 at the same time laterally transferred carbon may deposit in water bodies such as rivers lakes and reservoirs hilton and west 2020 mariappan et al 2021 mendonca et al 2017 then some so them may be emitted from water bodies to atmosphere raymond et al 2008 yue et al 2016 laterally transferred carbon along the land to ocean continuum is a topic with broad interest as it greatly changes the spatial pattern of organic carbon on earth surface and affects the terrestrial aquatic and marine ecosystems hilton 2017 li et al 2022 soil erosion is the dominant source for the lateral movement of carbon contributing more than half of the lateral carbon flux in inland waters luo et al 2022 qu et al 2020 accurate modeling of lateral carbon loss induced by soil erosion is vital for better constraining the estimates of ecosystem carbon exchange especially for understanding the role of river networks the largest biogeochemical nexus between the continents ocean and atmosphere pilla et al 2022 previous modeling studies have revealed that environmental changes greatly changed the patterns of soil erosion globally as well as the amount and composition of erosion induced land carbon delivery rabiei et al 2022 razmi et al 2022 yue et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 however there are few long term studies about the temporal evolution of erosion induced carbon fluxes and their responses to environmental changes battin et al 2023 headwater regions are the dominant source of water sediment carbon in rivers connected to the rest of the river networks by small headwater streams alexander et al 2007 creed et al 2017 datry et al 2018 it was estimated that headwater regions covered 60 of stream length nadeau and rains 2007 providing approximately 70 of water and 65 of nitrogen to inland waters alexander et al 2007 and contributing more than 70 of greenhouse gas emission from global water bodies li et al 2021 moreover headwater regions are more sensitive to environmental changes especially when considering the alteration of underlying surface caused by human activities during the past decades indicating potential intense changes of erosion induced lateral carbon movement in these regions however the observation of lateral carbon movement in headwater regions is very limited as most traditional gaging systems mainly focused on downstream rivers acuña et al 2014 sediment deposition in reservoirs lakes and rives well documented historical hydrological events mills et al 2017 radbourne et al 2017 and hydrological components e g rainfall runoff and sediment can be interpreted based on the sediment depositions at annual or event scales providing a powerful tool for inferring historical hydrological processes in ungagged headwater regions nafchi et al 2021 wang et al 2019b wei et al 2017b xiao et al 2023 meanwhile physically based hydrological models have been widely used for simulating hydrological processes for a continuous time period but data shortage limited parameter estimation for models especially for headwater regions with few observations doetterl et al 2016 therefore the integration of sediment deposition records and hydrological models can be a promising method for investigating lateral carbon movement from land to inland waters because hydrological models are good at continuously simulating spatiotemporal carbon loss and sediment deposition can provide necessary support for model calibration and validation the chinese loess plateau clp is one of the most seriously eroded regions globally making it the dominant sediment source of the yellow river the most sediment laden river on the earth fu et al 2017 a large amount of sediment from the loess plateau had provided materials for sustaining the river and ocean ecosystems while carbon attached on sediment could influence the regional carbon balance more than 1 6 pg of sediment was transported by the yellow river annually during 1919 1959 hu 2016 meanwhile with 0 66 tg of poc being delivered each year liu et al 2015 in recent years large scale national ecological projects had been implemented on the clp to alleviate the serious soil erosion such as the grain for green project which was represented by remarkable reforestation and grass planting however the responses of lateral carbon loss to revegetation was still not clear mainly due to the lack of field observations therefore it is promising to integrate sediment records and hydrological modeling in investigating soil and lateral carbon losses from headwater regions on the clp therefore the objectives of this study was to 1 integrate sediment records and physically based hydrological model to study soil and carbon losses from ungagged headwater regions 2 investigate the responses of soil and carbon losses to intense land use and cover changes on the chinese loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the chinese loess plateau locates in the northwest of the china mainland which is famous for its serious soil erosion and its dominant contribution to the high sediment load of the yellow river fig 1 a the fangta river basin ftrb a typical headwater watershed locates in the middle of the clp has experienced both serious soil erosion and extensive lulc changes during the past decades fig 1b the mean annual precipitation of the ftb is 509 mm and more than 75 of the annual precipitation falls as rainstorms in the wet season june to september the original natural vegetation is the transition from forest to prairie and there are three main land use types in the ftrb the agricultural land the grass land the forest land covering more than 99 of the basin area according to the baseline 1975 land use agricultural land mainly distributed on flat mountain tops covering about 44 of the whole basin while most grassland distributed on the steep slopes along gullies fig 1c 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 swat input daily meteorological data including precipitation maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation hour were collected from a nearby weather station the ansai station which is 30 km away from the ftrb the digital

science data center https loess geodata cn data land use in five time periods including the 1975 1990 2000 2010 and 2020 were used in this study the 1975 land use data was from the national earth system science data center https loess geodata cn data land use maps at 1990 2000 and 2010 were provided by the institute of remote sensing and digital earth cas and the 2020 land use map was visually interpreted based on high resolution images from google earth 2 2 2 soil and carbon losses observations in this study soil and carbon losses observations from runoff plots were from jia s 2009 research on nearby hillslopes in the ansai county providing soil and carbon losses from slopes with gradients ranging from 10 to 30 in the ftrb a check dam was constructed at the outlet of the headwater basin which intercepted almost all sediment and attached carbon from the basin providing important carrier for reconstructing the long term soil loss of the ungauged watershed sediment and carbon deposition data during the check dam operation period 1975 1990 at the event scale was collected from previous studies li 2017 wei et al 2022 in this study the sediment and carbon deposition data during the last three operating years 1988 1990 was not used because sediment into the check dam would be drained out when the storage is almost full sun and wu 2022 2 3 methods 2 3 1 swat model the soil and water assessment tools swat model is developed by the agricultural research services of u s department of agriculture usda ars and it is designed to investigate the impacts of human management on water sediment and nutrients yields arnold et al 1998 the swat model is temporally continuous and spatially distributed and it has been widely used in various climatic and land surface conditions for long term simulation of hydrological processes and material fluxes many studies have proven that the swat model performed well in runoff and sediment yield processes modeling at multiple scales on the clp sun et al 2020b yang and lu 2017 the swat model delineates watershed into sub basins based on the digital elevation model and the stream network then the sub basins are further subdivided into small hydrologic response units hrus and each hru is assumed to be homogeneous in terms of soil land use and topographic characteristics in the swat model soil erosion from each hru is calculated using the musle equation as followed 1 sed 11 8 q surf q peak a r e a hru 0 56 k usle c usle p usle l s usle c f r g where sed is sediment yield per day in tons ha 1 qsurf is

are richer in organic carbon müller nedebock et al 2016 wang et al 2019a wei et al 2017a the enrichment ratio er the ratio of nutrients in eroded sediment to that of soil is commonly used in hydrological models for nutrients loss modeling palis et al 1990 in this study one of the most widely used enrichment ration calculation method proposed by menzel 1980 was adopted 2 er a s e d u b where a and b are variable coefficients sedu is sediment yield per unit area t ha 1 in this study the two empirical coefficients a and b in the menzel equation was estimated using the field carbon loss observations as shown in fig 2 the er can be well predicted with soil loss intensity with the a of 2 40 b of 0 27 and r2 of 0 82 thus soc content in the eroded soil can be calculated using the following equation 3 c sed e r c sol where csed is the soc content in sediment from a specific hru and csol is the soc content in original soil for the corresponding hru 2 3 3 dynamic changes of soc in sediment retained by check dam sediment and the attached carbon from the entire catchment deposited layer by layer before check dam for a long period the deposited soc mineralized and decomposed through physical chemical and biological effects tong et al 2020 van oost et al 2012 in this study we introduced the transformation equation to estimate the dynamic changes of soc during the preservation period in the transformation equation the transform rate depends on the original soc content as follows 4 d c soc dt k c soc where csoc is the soc content at that time t k is the rate

initial soc content and t t0 is the preservation time since sediment and the attached carbon was retained by check dam 2 3 4 data integration in the data integration scheme fig 3 sediment simulation at each hru was provided by the swat model and the er equation was derived from field observations thus soc content in the sediment can be simulated using eqs 2 and 3 then soc content at the eroded time was further coupled with eq 5 to simulate the preserved soc sediment deposition and the preserved soc derived from dynamics of sediment profile can be used for model calibration and validation thus the framework can be used for simulating soil and carbon losses in ungagged headwater watersheds 2 3 5 model setup parameter optimization and performance evaluation in this study the whole ftrb

results 3 1 effectiveness of the integration method fig 4 a shows the scatterplot of observed versus simulated monthly sediment yield during the calibration and validation period visual inspection suggests that the swat model well simulated sediment yield in the ftrb because all the simulation observation points are around the 1 1 line mean monthly observed and simulated sediment yield over the calibration period were 24 063 and 26218 t respectively with a 9 0 overestimation the r2 and nse of sediment yield over the calibration period were 0 92 and 0 88 respectively indicating a very good model performance based on the thresholds proposed by moriasi 2007 mean monthly observed and simulated sediment yield during the validation period is 23590 t and 23495 t respectively the r2 nse and pbias during the validation period were 0 66 0 60 and 0 4 table 2 respectively the simulation of sediment yield over the validation period can be rated as satisfactory according to the criteria proposed by moriasi 2007 overall simulated sediment yield matched well with observed values with the r2 of 0 82 nse of 0 77 and pbias of 4 3 for the whole modeling period suggesting that sediment yield estimated using sediment deposition dynamics can be used for sediment calibration and validation in hydrological models fig 4b shows the scatterplot of observed versus simulated monthly carbon loss from the ftrb during the calibration and validation period visual comparison suggests that the swat based framework can well simulate monthly carbon loss because all the simulation observation points are along the 1 1 line more than 85 of the simulated carbon loss fall within the 50 band error as shown in fig 4b mean monthly carbon loss observation and simulation during the calibration period were 43 87 and 41 40 t respectively with a 5 60 underestimation the r2 and nse for carbon loss simulation during the calibration period were 0 65 and 0 63 respectively indicating a satisfactory performance moriasi et al 2007 mean monthly observed and simulated carbon loss during the validation period is 43 95 t and 45 66 t respectively the r2 nse and pbias during the validation period were 0 66 0 65 and 3 90 respectively the simulation of carbon loss during validation period can be rated as good using thresholds proposed by moriasi 2007 overall simulated carbon loss matched well with observations with the r2 of 0 65 nse of 0 64 and pbias of 0 9 for the whole modeling period the evaluation results suggested that carbon loss estimated using the sediment deposition dynamics can be integrated to hydrological models for simulating carbon loss from ungagged headwater watersheds 3 2 lulc changes in the ftrb land use change in the ftrb was dominated by the increase of woodland and the decrease in the cropland and grassland during the past 45 years fig s1 grassland was the dominant land use type in 1975 and 1990 taking more than 50 of the entire basin and cropland covered about 40 of the entire ftrb however woodland was the dominant land use type during the recent 2010 and 2020 land use scenario covering about 40 of the total area and only 20 of the ftrb was covered by cropland the area of both cropland and grassland decreased greatly during 1975 to 2000 especially since the 1990s fig 5 due to the implementation of large scale ecological restoration programs sun et al 2019b at the same time the area of woodland increased from 1 to 7 5 during 1975 to 1990 and then to 37 6 in 2000 during 2000 to 2010 the percentage of cropland kept decreasing from 32 5 to 15 1 of the total area while the area of grassland increased from 29 9 to 42 3 the land use conversion during the recent decade was less intense than the 1990s and 2000s and the area of woodland remain unchanged while some of the grassland were converted into cropland 3 3 temporal trends of soil and carbon losses temporal changes of soil and carbon losses under the baseline and actual land use were presented in fig 6 soil and carbon losses under the baseline land use scenario i e 1975 land use scenario increased slightly p greater than 0 05 while soil and carbon losses under actual land use decreased significantly during 1976 to 2016 p 0 05 the slightly increase in soil and carbon losses under the baseline land use scenario can be explained by the changes in precipitation global climate changed rainfall patterns on the clp significantly characterized with significant increase in extreme rainfall events during the flood season higher rainfall extremes could have caused the increase in runoff as well as severer soil and carbon losses on the loess plateau under the baseline land use scenario fig 6 and fig s2 vegetation and precipitation exert competing effects on soil loss because the intensified rainfall increases and better vegetation cover alleviates soil erosion langbein and schumm 1958 in the ft watershed the remarkable land use changes had altered the potential deterioration of soil and carbon losses caused by the changing rainfall patterns resulting the significant of decrease in both soil and carbon losses p 0 05 i e the soil and carbon losses under the actual land use scenario in fig 6 3 4 effects of lulc changes on soil and carbon losses soil loss from the ftrb under different land use scenarios and the contributions of each land use type was shown in fig 7 mean annual soil loss from the entire ftrb under the five land use scenario during the study period 1976 2016 was 80 116 75 312 53 810 39 450 and 41 227 t respectively compared with the baseline land use 1975 soil loss from the other four land use scenarios decreased by 6 0 32 8 50 8 and 48 5 respectively under the 1975 land use the contribution of cropland grassland and woodland to soil loss was 63 9 36 0 and 0 1 respectively while the land cover percentage of the three land use types was 43 8 55 2 and 1 0 respectively land use changes in the ftrb changed the composition of different vegetation types as well as the contributions of different land cover types to soil and carbon losses grassland contributed 49 8 of soil loss with the covering area of 37 2 under the 2020 land use scenario while cropland contributed 34 8 of the soil loss with the covering area of 20 2 mean annual lateral carbon loss from the ftrb under the five land use scenarios during the study period 1976 2016 was 215 4 201 9 119 5 87 6 and 92 6 t respectively showing similar decreasing trend to that of sediment yield fig 8 lulc changes reduced the lateral carbon loss from the ftrb by 6 3 44 5 59 3 and 57 0 respectively compared the baseline 1975 land use 4 discussion 4 1 soil and carbon losses from different land use types soil and carbon losses are the result of interactions among many environmental factors including rainfall topography vegetation cover and soil conditions liu et al 2022 tian et al 2015 on the loess plateau vegetation cover increased dramatically during the past decades with the evolution of land use patterns caused by ecological restoration projects greatly changing the soil and carbon fluxes from terrestrial landscape to water bodies revegetation changed the composition of different land use types with the dramatic decrease of cropland and the expansion of woodland and grassland altering the soil and carbon losses from the headwater watershed soil loss rates in forests and grasslands are generally lower than in croplands because trees and grasses provide better ground cover with the accumulation of litter and the better canopy as well as the protection of soil from better root structures sun et al 2020a in this study mean annual soil loss from cropland grassland and woodland was 13 460 5 3 375 3 and 1 363 3 t km2 yr 1 respectively paired t test indicated significant differences of soil loss intensity from the three land use types p 0 01 and the soil loss from cropland was 9 9 and 4 0 times to that from woodland and grassland respectively fig 9 a higher primary production means higher soil organic carbon content for forest and grassland sun et al 2019a in this study mean soc content for forest grassland and cropland was 4 99 4 58 and 3 62 g kg 1 respectively indicating potential higher carbon loss with the same amount of eroded soil from forest and grassland carbon loss from cropland grassland and woodland was 37 0 15 4 and 4 4 t km2 yr 1 respectively with significant difference by the paired t test p 0 01 carbon loss intensity of cropland was 8 4 and 2 4 times to those from woodland and grassland respectively fig 9b though carbon content of soil eroded from forest and grassland was much higher than that from the cropland fig 9c thus the dramatic decrease in the fraction of cropland and the expansion of woodland and grassland have greatly alleviated soil and carbon losses in this region in addition remarkable land use changes also altered the natural vegetation topography distribution vegetation patterns self organized on semiarid hillslopes mainly due to the coevolution with the erosion induced landforms saco and moreno de las heras 2013 srivastava et al 2022 for example vegetation greenness on polar facing slopes tend to be higher than on equatorial facing slopes istanbulluoglu et al 2008 kumari et al 2020 with the implementation of the grain for green project croplands on slopes higher than 25 were gradually shifted to forest and grassland resulting the changes of vegetation topography patterns in the ft watershed fig s3 thus the new vegetation topography i e croplands with lower vegetation cover on flatter slopes and forest and grass with higher vegetation cover on steeper slopes had enhanced effects of land use type changes on the decrease soil and carbon losses in the ft watershed 4 2 limitations and prospects of the integration method sediment from upland soils were retained by check dams layer by layer thus the historical hydrological processes and environmental changes were well recorded by the dynamics of sediment profiles wang et al 2014 in this study we examined the use of long term sediment and carbon deposition observations documented by sediment deposition for soil and carbon losses modeling in a typical ungagged headwater watershed the modeling results suggested that the integration of sediment deposition information and hydrological model was promising however the integration method was still subjected to uncertainties on the one hand soil and carbon losses observations provided by sediment deposition dynamics were still not long enough mainly due to the fast siltation of check dam storage and short working period for example the 18 m sediment profile in the ftrb only provided sediment deposition covering 12 years thus the data series should be extended to a longer time period especially covering the remarkable revegetation in the recent 30 years on the loess plateau a large number of check dams were built through the past decades thus soil and carbon losses observations can be extended by compiling sediment profiles from different dams in future studies meanwhile sediment was buried underground and it is difficult to estimate sediment volume for each layer accurately indicating possible uncertainties for the estimated sediment fluxes on the other hand the model structure can also be improved to reduce simulation uncertainties the er equation is critical for the modeling of carbon loss and the use of different er equations might bring large discrepancies zhang 2018 in this study we firstly localized the carbon loss er equation using field observations from runoff plots improving the calculation of carbon content in eroded soils however the er equation was derived from field observations on runoff plots with barren land and the changes of er equation caused by different land use and land cover types was neglected therefore the improvement of er equation by considering the effects of land use and cover change would be an interesting topic in future studies 5 conclusions this study for the first time integrated soil and carbon losses by sediment deposition and hydrological modeling we also investigated the effects of land use changes on soil and carbon losses in a typical ungagged headwater watershed on the chinese loess plateau our results suggested that the integration method showed good performances in simulating soil and carbon losses numeric model evaluation indices rated the soil and carbon losses simulation as very good and satisfactory respectively indicating the promising use of sediment records in improving modeling of lateral carbon movement headwater watersheds on the clp experienced remarkable land use changes under the implementation of ecological restoration projects characterized by the expansion of forest and grassland the land use changes had reversed the deterioration of soil and carbon loss owing to climate change the integration method proposed in this study can be useful for modeling of lateral carbon transfer and the findings can be valuable for formulating sustainable watershed management mitigate global climate change credit authorship

1728,rainfall erosion has been calculated and predicted by various soil loss equations but the progressions of overland flow and sediment transport are less dynamically described in this study cellular automata ca models based on single flow direction algorithm sfd average value multi flow direction algorithm amfd and remaining average value multi flow direction algorithm ramfd were constructed simultaneously erosion model was constructed by dividing soil erosion into inter rill rill and gully erosions according to critical water depth the ca models were validated at three scales a theoretical slope an in situ model slope and the natural basin the results demonstrated the efficient performance of ramfd in the runoff ascension and recession stages while sfd and amfd presented unconcentrated runoff distribution especially in the in situ slope and basin simulation besides ramfd model occurred sediment deposition in the basin upstream while sfd and amfd presented continuous erosion furthermore the runoff nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of three models were 0 85 0 95 and 0 65 0 94 and the erosion root mean square error rmse were 0 5 1 0 kg min and 0 3 0 45 102kg min in the theoretical slope and natural basin respectively meanwhile the nse and rmse values of ramfd exhibited the best performance indicating that this model effectively balanced water distribution while controlling the flow direction to a greater extent overall it is justified to develop an erosion prediction model based on the classification of erosion types and the rules governing water flow allocation will inevitably result in qualitative and quantitative differences of runoff and erosion keywords rainfall erosion overland flow sediment yields cellular automata data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion has brought serious predicaments and challenges to environmental governance around the world for erosion prediction many models have been developed the universal soil loss equation usle has been widely used since it was put forward wischmeier et al 1958 meanwhile a revised version of this model rusle was obtained based on more extensive data renard and freimund 1994 and it is still widely applied in many countries such as the northwest loess region of china and muscat oman xu et al 2022 mahmood et al 2023 however the dynamic process of erosion is unable to be reproduced by the above empirical models and new methods for effectuating runoff and sediment transport are the imperative demand for this issue predicting the generation and dissipation of runoff is of priority when tackling soil erosion mathematical model built by saint venant equations sve have been used as an effective way lighthill and whitham 1955 the original form of the motion wave model was given for uniform rainfall in time and space henderson and wooding 1964 subsequently various shallow water equations and kinematic wave approximation theories have been extensively applied including coupling overland flow with rainfall infiltration defining unit discharge in manning s formula as a parabolic curve nonpoint source nps model and conducting accurate time integration smith and woolhiser 1971 woolhiser and ligget 1976 kavvas et al 2006 gottardi and venutelli 2008 besides some models determined the flow direction on basis of digital elevation model dem including single flow direction sfd algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 wilson et al 2007 and multiple flow direction mfd algorithm quinn et al 1991 mfd have been further developed to different algorithms such as fd model and remaining average value ramfd model seibert and mcglynn 2007 shao et al 2015 these flow direction algorithms own superior applicability in complex terrain but their distinction in runoff prediction is lack of adequate analysis on basis of the approximate methods of predicting overland flow the research about soil particle detachment and sediment transport have made great progress the integrated hydrology model inhm without a prior assumption of a specific hydrologic response mechanism was designed and developed freeze and harlan 1969 vanderkwaak and loague 2001 christophoer et al 2006 using the continuity equation ce the process of transport can be described bennet 1974 gatti et al 2023 in addition some simplified models for runoff and sediment yield and transport processes at different scales have also been proposed the answers model which treats runoff and erosion as independent processes incorporated critical shear stress and unit water flow dynamics making it suitable for small watershed scales beasley et al 1980 the lisem model based on the motion wave equation was specifically designed for soil erosion at the farmland scale de roo 1996 the agnps model has also been proposed and its erosion calculation was mainly based on the rusle equation which was relatively limited and can only be applied in a large watershed yuan et al 2003 additionally the water erosion prediction model has been developed to guide rainfall erosion predictions in rill and inter rill areas with applications in both farmland and slope contexts hafzullah et al 2020 although the numerical analysis methods have been improved these methods exhibit restrictions on multiscale issue and computational ability and the differences of the erosion types including rill and gully erosion were ignored for this paper three flow direction rules including sfd amfd and ramfd were introduced in ca models for dynamically describing the generation and dissipation of runoff meanwhile assuming that sediments totally transport with overland flow the ca model of soil erosion was accomplished by differentiating inter rill rill and gully erosions from each other in every cell under artificial and natural rainfall conditions the performance of these models on forecasting overland flow and sediment transports was discussed and how the flow direction rules impact on runoff and erosion was analyzed 2 methodology typical ca model named as a is a computation algorithm based dynamics model that consists of six components 1 a l d n u t c r where l d represents the cellular space d is the dimension n represents the neighborhood type u represents the cellular states t represents the time c represents the boundary conditions and r represents the evolutionary rules the cellular states are a series of parameters that describe the overland flow and sediment transport it need to be stored in the ca space for the corresponding calculations in this paper the set of cellular sates are comprised of four components 2 u x e h s where x is the land cover type of cells e is the altitude elevation m h is the water level elevation m s is the amount of sediments m 2 1 the spatial structure of cells the research on complex geographic phenomena must be established from the simplest geographic elements in the ca model a two dimensional lattice composed of multiple square grids is adopted as defined in the moore neighborhood banks 1971 every central cell owns four primary cardinal neightbor cells and four secondary diagonal neighbor cells 4 4 n which has been demonstrated excellent performance in runoff prediction than eight cells with the same priority shao et al 2015 besides the boundary cells can be divided three groups based on the net flow values the closed cells without flow discharge the input cells with net inflow the output cells with net outflow fig 1 2 2 the accomplishment of soil erosion process 2 2 1 the production process of runoff for central cells the overland flow is determined by rainfall intensity infiltration depression storage and water allocation of adjacent cells it is expressed as eq 3 3 h i h r i it v w i j 1 n h f j 1 n h y where hi represents water depth at cell i m hr is rainfall intensity iit is the average infiltration rate at the time t m vi is vegetation interception m wi is depression storage increment m hf is water allocation from neighbor cell m h y is water distribution from neighbor cell m the infiltration means that rainwater will flow down the pore space under the action of gravity molecular force etc typical calculating method is adopted for describing rate of infiltration process horton 1940 it is expressed as eq 4 4 i it f 1 f 0 f 1 e α t t where f 0 is the initial infiltration rate of soil m min f 1 is the stable infiltration rate m min α is the attenuation coefficient during the rainfall process some of raindrops will be partially adsorbed on the plant surface owing to surface tension or evaporate directly in the air resulting in vegetation interception it can be expressed as eq 5 aston 1979 5 v v cm 1 e x p β h r v cm e r t where v cm is the precipitation sorption capacity of the forest canopy expressed as the thickness of the water layer on the projected area of the forest canopy m β is the attenuation coefficient e is the surface evaporation intensity of wet tree m h r is the ratio of tree surface area to canopy projection area when rainfall reaches the surface or runoff flows on the surface runoff will fill and stagnate in the potholes generating depression storage the calculation method of puddle storage in this study uses linsley s stepwise accumulation calculation method linsley et al 1975 and the mathematical expression is described as 6 w i δ h i e h i s d where δhi is overland flow increment of the cell i m sd is the maximum depression storage m the water distribution between neighbor cells and central cells is mainly influenced by the force between runoff and hillslope surface because of its unusual complexity in different scales there is a lot of applicable formulas and many of them need a larger number of parameters in this paper the simplified and typical manning formula is adopted 7 q h i 5 3 j 1 2 d δ t n where q represents available water distribution between cells m j represents the slope determined by water elevation of 9 cells m m d represents the side length of cell m n is the manning coefficient δt is time step h the slope of a cell is defined as a function of the change rate of elevation of nine cells in the east west and north south directions and it can be calculated by third order inverse distance squared power differential method 8 f x z 7 z 1 2 z 8 z 2 z 9 z 3 8 d f y z 3 z 1 2 z 6 z 4 z 9 z 7 8 d j arctan f x 2 f y 2 where fx is the elevation change rate in north south direction m m fy is the elevation change rate in east west direction m m z 1 z 9 represent water elevation of 9 cells mm 2 2 2 the process of soil erosion according to the different erosion dynamical mechanism soil erosion can be classified into many modes generally soil erosion can be divided into splash erosion sheet flow erosion rill erosion gully erosion liu et al 2004 and the splash erosion and sheet flow erosion can be unified named inter rill erosion because they are both induced by rainfall impaction zhang et al 1998 chaplot and bissonnais 2003 therefore soil erosion on a sloped land can be divided into inter rill erosion and runoff erosion thomas and wesley 1994 which can be expressed by 9 s i a 1 h r 2 δ t ρ s 2 s i a 2 j 0 ρ h i δ t ρ s 2 where si represents erosion depth during every time step m ρ represents density of water 103kg m3 ρ s represents bulk density of soil 103kg m3 j 0 represents the slope determined by elevation of 9 cells m m a 1 is the calibration constant of inter rill erosion 1015kg2 min m7 a 2 represents the calibration constant of runoff erosion 106kg min m3 the process of gully development consists of retroactive erosion bottom undercutting and bank expansion bingner et al 2016 the retroactive erosion and bank expansion usually occurs to the gully experiencing a period of instability and can be neglected if the gully is stable gordon et al 2012 thus the change of gully bottom elevation can be written in the form sidorchuk et al 2001 10 s i b 1 δ t s i v st h i 1 h i 2 3 j 0 1 2 162 n v st 2 2 b 2 ρ g h i 5 3 j 0 3 2 n ρ s ρ g h i n b 3 c b 4 11 v st 2 ρ s ρ g d 50 2 9 μ where si is the accumulated sediments at cell i m g is the gravitational acceleration m2 min c is the cohesion of soil kg m b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 are the coefficients varying from different soil and vegetation coverage vst is the stokes fall velocity in laminar flow m min d 50 is the median particle size of sediment m for ascertaining the erosion type the location of every cell is necessary to be figured out in gullies owing to the catchment the water depth is larger than that of hillslope therefore the condition that a cell is located in gullies can be expressed by 12 h av k h max where hav represent the average water depth of 9 cells m hmax represents the maximum gully depth in whole area k represents a constant in 0 0 5 if it is explicit that a cell is located in hillslope inter rill and rill erosions should be discriminated the ability of water flow in rills to disperse the soil is proportional to its shear stress in rill the rill erosion occurs only if the water flow shear stress is greater than the critical shear stress crouch and novruzi 1989 nearing et al 1990 it can be described as the critical water depth when applied to the ca model 13 h l δ t τ g 5 3 j 0 2 1 j 0 2 7 12 n d 2 where hl is the critical water depth m τ is the critical shear stress related to types of soil m2 min2 2 3 conversion rules 2 3 1 water distribution the water distribution among cells are mainly influenced by existing water depth available water distribution described as manning s formula flow traveling time determined by flow velocity and distribution rules fig 2 it can be described as follows a calculate the maximum water depth allocated from central cell to neighbor cells compare it with the existing water depth and adopt the smaller one as the initial allocated water depth hi b determine the cells receiving water allocation on basis of distribution rules and the available water distribution ha is also obtained c assuming low volume sediment content have little impaction on runoff velocity the traveling time that water flowing into neighbor cell tn can be calculate by eq 14 and the final distribution hf can be calculated by eq 15 14 t n n d n 1 2 j 2 h i 3 2 15 h f h a δ t t n δ t t n h a δ t t n where dn is the length of flowing path equal to d or 20 5 d respectively for the cardinal cells and diagonal cells zn is water elevation of neighbor cell 2 3 2 sediment transports the sediment transports among cells contain discrimination of erosion types calculation of erosion depth sediment carrying capacity and updating elevation fig 3 the process can be described as follows a determine the type of soil erosion is by comparing hav and khmax hi and hl only if hi equals to zero the sediment will settle down and the elevation will increase b calculate the erosion depth by eq 9 and eq 10 and update the cumulative erosion depth si t and elevation ei t of cell i at time t c calculate the available sediment transports sa based on the water distribution d considering the sediment carrying capacity sc of certain overland flow which can be written in form of eq 16 finkner et al 1989 the final sediment transports sf is the smaller one between sa and sc 16 s c c 1 ρ g h i 5 3 j 0 3 2 n c 2 d n δ t ρ s d 2 where c 1 is an constant c 2 is an exponent that reflects the degree of turbulence 2 3 3 distribution rules 1 single flow direction algorithm sfd means that the water of central grid flows into a single neighbor cell to minimize the height differences and reach equilibrium conditions between the lowest cell and central cell fig 4 the details can be described as follows a calculate the maximum water elevation difference δz max between neighbor cells and central cell there is no water distribution if δz max is less than or equal to zero b determine which neighbor cell receives water allocation thereby the water distribution δh is obtained c compare δh and hi and choose the smaller one as the available water distribution ha 2 average value multi flow direction algorithm amfd means that water transport from central cell to multiple neighbor cells in order to reach equilibrium conditions in a neighborhood area fig 5 the determination process can be expressed as follows a calculate the average water elevationof 9 cells zav the central cell below the mean water elevation allocate no water b eliminate neighbor cells with higher water elevation than zav c comparing the sum of water distribution from central cell to potential cells with hi the smaller one is the water allocation from central cell hn d determine available water distribution ha proportional to the water level elevation difference 3 remaining average value multi flow direction algorithm the basic principle of ramfd is similar to amfd and their discrepancy is that ramfd eliminates the neighbor cells until their water elevations are not higher than the average water elevation of remain cells fig 6 it is described as follows a the first step is the same as that in the process of sfd b eliminate neighbor cells with higher water elevation than zi calculate the mean average of remain cells zav and repeat the above steps until no cell is eliminated c calculate the summation of the water requirement for neighbor cells and compare it with hi to confirm the water allocation hn d the final step is the same as that in the process of amfd 3 model validation with analytical solution at a assuming slope the ca models are firstly demonstrated by comparing them with the analytical methods including the kinematic wave function for describing water distribution smith 1997 and an approximate model for calculating sediment yields tao et al 2018 in order to simulate the surface flow and soil erosion the 50 m long and 20 m wide hypothetical plane at a uniform gradient of 10 was considered the rainfall with an intensity of 1 mm min and a duration of 30 min is stable and uniform on the slope surface the hydraulic roughness of the slope surface was expressed by the manning coefficient that the value is 0 02 the upper cells under closed state the bottom cells under open state a cell size of 0 1 m and a time step of 0 01 min were set during the simulating process furthermore the ca models were applied on the slope with two states impervious and infiltrating respectively for quantitatively evaluating the discrepancies between numerical analysis and ca simulation results nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and root mean square error rmse were adopted 17 nse 1 i n o i c i 2 i n o i o 2 18 rmse i n o i c i 2 n where o i is the observed data c i is the simulated data o is the arithmetic mean of the observed data the results showed that sfd achieved equilibrium relatively quickly with smoother recession limbs in both the hydrographs and sediment curves on the contrary amfd took the longest time to reach equilibrium and the recession time for runoff and erosion rates was short these two models represented the upper and lower envelopes of the runoff hydrographs and sediment yield curves compared to the numerical analysis respectively this suggests that ramfd and the numerical analysis shared the most similar curve shapes particularly during the equilibrium stage fig 7 moreover the presence of infiltration significantly reduced the peaks of runoff and sediment yield rates the nse values were consistently above 0 9 and rmse for runoff ranged from 5 5 to 7 5 mm h while the rmse for erosion rate ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 kg min these findings indicate a strong agreement between ramfd and the numerical analysis table 1 however the performance of the other models was not as satisfactory as ramfd as evidenced by the large discrepancies in their nse and rmse values compared to the numerical analysis 4 model validation with field experiment at small plot scale 4 1 in situ experiment and simulating parameters 4 1 1 model test rainfall simulation experiment was conducted for verifying the performance of the ca models in the mountainous region of lincang city yunnan province china taking a bare excavation slope with a gradient of 45 as an example the rainfall simulation test was designed including water supply system rainfall system and test apparatus fig 8 the water supply system was composed of a small reservoir providing water and a booster bump providing ample hydraulic pressure the rainfall system mainly contained rain sprinklers fixed to the support structure fig 9 a three dimensional 3d laser scanner with a precision of 3 1 mm at a distance of 271 m was incorporated in the test apparatus and employed in the test area of 6 m long and 6 m wide after rainfall meanwhile for all trials the artificial rainfall intensity was set at 1 mm min which produces raindrops with the median diameter of 1 0 to 2 1 mm and impact kinetic energy ranged from 2 84 to 12 6 j m2 min furthermore the cumulative rainfall duration was 14 h as artificial rainfall was carried out 7 times in 2 days accompanied by with 8 times of 3d scanning including initial states 4 1 2 simulation parameters based on the 3d scanning dem of the slope with a elevation precision of 0 1 mm and a horizontal resolution of 5 mm was established correspondingly the cell side length of 5 mm was set and there were 880 660 cells in total the natural density ρ s of the slope soil was 1 8 103 kg m3 and the median particle size of the lost soil d50 was 0 25 mm permeability parameters consisted of initial permeability stable permeability and attenuation coefficient f 0 f 1 and α which were 0 27 mm min 0 23 mm min and 0 52 respectively the depression storage parameter sd equal to 0 35 mm were adopted the erosion in the experimental area included rill erosion and inter rill erosion and the parameters a 1 and a 2 were 0 11 and 0 13 the two parameters c 1 and c 2 describing sediment carrying capacity were set as 0 1 and 1 25 furthermore a manning s coefficient n of 0 025 and a time step of 1 s were applied in the simulation because there was no vegetation on the slope which located in the weathered layer the vegetation interception was ignored 4 2 modeling results it was observed that the simulated surface runoff by sfd exhibited lower concentration and continuity resulting in ephemeral dispersed water flow in the direction of maximum gradient after 120 min of rainfall fig 10 a the erosion depth mapping obtained by afd also displayed discontinuous characteristics similar to the runoff results fig 10b in the satge of runoff ascention amfd performed better than sfd however it had a limitation of sheet flow perpendicular to the maximum gradient direction in the central area due to extensive water exchange with surrounding cells fig 10c d on the other hand the mappings obtained by ramfd showed concentrated confluence in the rill and the presence of a thin layer of overland flow on the slope surface closely resembling the natural state fig 10e f additionally slight differences were observed in the maximum runoff and erosion depths among the three models indicating the influence of flow distribution rules these observations highlight that ramfd effectively balances water distribution while controlling the flow direction to a greater extent the significance of distribution rules in governing runoff and soil erosion processes based on the dem the accumulated sediments were calculated as an antithesis to the simulated results simulated by ca models fig 11 with rainfall undergoing the disparity between the actual erosion amount and the simulated erosion amount increased resulting in a difference of 5 10 in the final state among the three models sfd produced the largest sediment yields and exhibited the largest deviation from reality while ramfd demonstrated excellent performance in predicting soil erosion furthermore the gradient consistency defined as the ratio of the gradients obtained by simulation and 3d scanning was calculated fig 12 it revealed a decreasing trend in accuracy as the rainfall process advanced this was mainly attributed to the heterogeneity of gradient distribution caused by changes in topographic relief leading to more deviations in the identification of erosion types among the three models the ramfd model showed the best agreement with the observed data with a minimum accuracy of approximately 85 in summary the ramfd model exhibits great potential for predicting runoff sediment transport and topographic changes 5 model validation with field measurements at watershed scale 5 1 watershed data before being applied into real world problem the model should be further tested in natural conditions therefore a watershed located in lincang city was chosen due to its complex topography the dem with a horizontal resolution of 1 m was constructed by points cloud oringinating from an unmanned aerial vehicle fig 13 consequently 1 m 1 m cell size was set for entire simulation process with 12 104 cells covering the whole watershed the boundary of the lattice did not contain any input cells but only consisted of closed and outlet cells considering the vegetation and geotechnical conditions five land use types were considered 1 crop silt 2 sparse grassland gravelly soil 3 bare gravelly soil 4 shrub granite weathered soil and 5 forest gravelly soil fig 14 different runoff and erosion parameters were set respectively tables 2 and 3 5 2 modeling results one rainfall event which was well documented and happened recently was chosen for the simulation during 30 min the intensity time history curve recorded by hydrological station was characterized by two rainfall intensity peaks which were 12 6 mm and 20 4 mm respectively it indicates that the duration and intensity of the rainfall event is complicated enough to be ideal for testing the model performance in surface runoff and soil erosion the hydrograph observed during the selected rainfall events were described fig 15 it illustrates that continuous rainfall led to a rapid increase in overland flow at 18 min and runoff reached its maximum value when the rainfall ceased among the models sfd produced the highest runoff and exhibited the slowest dissipation amfd yielded the lowest runoff indicating faster water transfer between cells the ramfd model showed the closest agreement with the measured results with an nse value of 0 94 and an rmse value of 0 76 mm h furthermore the actual erosion sediment was estimated based on the recorded overland flow and sediment concentration from the hydrological station fig 16 during the 0 7 min and 50 75 min periods the sediment concentration was recorded as 0 indicating no sediment yield the sfd model demonstrated a high peak in sediment yield rate with gradual recession limbs amfd performed poorly in simulating soil erosion suggesting its inability to adapt to complex terrains the most notable and accurate simulation results were achieved by the ramfd model which closely matched the measured data moreover the nse and rmse values of ramfd confirmed its effectiveness in dynamically describing soil erosion the simulated runoff mappings at different time steps based on ramfd was presented fig 17 with the increase of accumulated rainfall overland flow tended to accumulated in the bottom of the basin from where it further traveled to the outlet in 30 min the surface runoff culminated in a climax of 2 2 mm h and then it was gradually dissipated as the runoff gathering in the gully the maximum water depth was close to 220 mm in addition at the intersection of some ditches the runoff converges into a deep pool and still exists partially at 60 min due to the undulating terrain to sum up all the characteristics of overland flow have been captured by ramfd the cumulative erosion depth was depicted at different time steps fig 18 initially soil erosion was primarily influenced by the slope resulting in severe erosion occurring in the ridge of the basin while sediment accumulated in the gully over time gully erosion transitioned from sediment deposition to soil erosion by the 60th minute the maximum depth of gully erosion reached approximately 3 mm which was more than three times greater than the erosion depth on the hillslope concurrently sediment deposition occurred in the cells adjacent to the gully particularly in the upstream areas the coexistence of soil erosion and sediment deposition observed in the model aligns with the actual erosion patterns confirming the representativeness of the ramfd model in predicting soil erosion based on sfd and amfd hydrographs and erosion mappings were aslo obtained fig 19 when compared to the results obtained from the ramfd model both sfd and amfd models exhibited poor representation of the continuous distribution characteristics of runoff and water depth in the gully consequently there were discrepancies in gully erosion between the upstream and downstream regions the amfd model in particular displayed uniformity in the hydrograph causing the differences between gully erosion and other forms of erosion to diminish in conclusion both the sfd and amfd methods have limitations in simulating runoff and predicting sediment yield include the significant homogenization in the upstream areas and discontinuous distribution patterns in the downstream regions in practice the allocation of water to cells is not limited to specific situations but changes based on rainfall conditions and runoff characteristics hence the ramfd model aligns better with the natural state 6 discussion 6 1 accumulated sediment yields of different erosion types at the watershed in previous research it was considered that inter rill erosion caused by raindrop kinetic energy contributes a little to soil erosion rill erosion with limited transport capacity is the main source of eroded sediments and gully erosion as the main channel for sediment transport cerdan et al 2002 brodowski 2010 liu and liu 2020 mohseni and hosseinzadeh 2022 in previous soil erosion models using physical equations such as geowepp two types of erosion namely inter rill and rill erosion were considered this model was capable of simulating soil loss or deposition for each grid of the dem in on site scenarios renschler 2003 the mpsiac model classified erosion into upland and channel erosion but it required prior determination of the location and morphology of the channels casabella gonzalez et al 2023 however none of these models can perform real time classification of erosion types at each grid or provide sediment yields for different erosion types in this study the total sediment yields was calculated by integrating the erosion rate in time domain fig 20 a the results showed that the erosion amount of sfd was the largest among three models while that of ramfd was the closest to the measured value moreover the distinction of inter rill rill and gully erosions according to critical water depths make their amounts available to be accumulated fig 20b d gully erosion of sfd and amfd occurred in 23 min later than that of ramfd meanwhile three types of erosion accounted for 3 4 72 76 and 20 25 of the total it demonstrated the aforementioned inference about the contribution of different erosion types and the rationality of dividing erosion types based on the critical water depths 6 2 sensitivity analysis based on ramfd at the watershed parameter sensitivity analysis which discusses about how the inputs of model parameters influence the outputs have been used to evaluate the model stability by previous studies ferreira et al 1995 runoff sensitivity analysis of runca indicated that a variation range of 80 to 80 in the permeability coefficient resulted in a runoff change rate of 60 to 120 shao et al 2015 erosion sensitivity analysis of mpsiac revealed that erosion rate was most significantly influenced by runoff characteristics with erosion rate varying by over 100 under 20 change rate and the next most influential factors were upland and channel erosion factors with variation rates ranging from 30 to 40 under the same conditions casabella gonzalez et al 2023 according to previous research methods ramfd was chosen and the change range of parameters was set as 80 80 firstly the sensitivity of runoff parameters including infiltration interception depression and manning coefficients was analyzed fig 21 a the results showed that the infiltration parameters had the greatest impact on the overland flow especially the stable infiltration coefficient manning coefficient owned a negative influence on the confluence process inferior to the infiltration parameters the sensitivity analysis on sediment yields was also proceeded in the same way fig 21b the infiltration parameters manning coefficients erosion parameters and soil parameters were taken into investigation the results showed that the seepage coefficients influenced significantly on sediment yields with an output deviation of 100 the escalation of soil parameters greatly diminishes the sediment yields diametrically opposed to rill erosion coefficient in general the sensitivity of the model to main parameters conforms to the description of physical processes by various formulas proving the superiority of ca model in runoff and erosion prediction 6 3 assumptions of boundary conditions the establishment of appropriate boundary conditions is a crucial requirement in soil erosion models and previous models have commonly assumed the presence of inlet and outlet boundaries in this study we defined the inlet closed boundary and outlet based on input closed and output cells respectively in the in situ experimental setup the upper area subjected to rainfall was beyond the coverage of the 3d scanning derived dem and the objective rills were not present as a result these cells were considered to receive a minimal amount of upstream overflow the closed boundaries were assumed to achieve a balance between inflow and outflow on the lateral boundaries and thus were designated as closed cells additionally at the small plot scale the outlet was defined as the entire bottom surface with the lowest elevation which was similar to the watershed scale in cases where multiple areas exhibited relatively low elevations multiple outlets were considered requiring manual judgment during the modeling process this is casued by the utilization of manning s formula which is a simplified form of the fluid motion equation this approach is commonly applied in soil erosion models including the surface runoff module in the answers beasley et al 1980 geowepp renschler 2003 topkapi ciarapica and todini 2003 and runca shao et al 2015 alternatively models based on the navier stokes equation or simplified versions of it allow for stricter regulations on fluid movement direction eliminating the need for explicit inlet and outlet definitions such as the soil erosion model with effective time stepping gatti et al 2023 6 4 limitations of data measurement the validation of runoff and erosion models is typically conducted through three comparative approaches referencing previous research conducting on site model experiments and utilizing collected hydrological and soil erosion data from the field tao et al 2018 maurya et al 2021 hao et al 2022 gatti et al 2023 in this study these three methods were employed to validate the model under three different scenarios a hypothetical flat slope a model slope with artificially created rills and a natural watershed with existing rills and gullies for the model experiments certain variables such as water film height and flow velocity were not directly measured due to measurement limitations however the erosion data was used as an indirect evaluation of the runoff simulation particularly focusing on changes in slope gradient which have not been extensively examined in previous studies moreover it was demonstrated that hydrological and erosion data could be mutually validated providing a means to compensate for data limitations in either aspect hao et al 2022 in the case of natural basin we primarily obtained data on runoff depth and estimated erosion based on flow and sediment concentration measurements while previous erosion evaluations often involved multiple monitoring points throughout the entire watershed our study was limited in data availability and was unable to achieve such comprehensive coverage instead we supplemented the simulated erosion phenomena with actual observations particularly emphasizing sediment deposition in the upstream area of the ramfd model overall despite the data limitations our research was complemented by other aspects during the validation process demonstrating the robust performance of the model in erosion prediction 7 conclusion based on cellular automata this paper constructs overland flow and sediment yield models verified on multiple scales and the following conclusions were obtained 1 for predicting runoff ca model was built up by considering the impact of infiltration interception and depression meanwhile three flow rules sfd amfd and ramfd were selected as water distribution rules the runoff models applied in an ideal slope without rills or gullies a small model test with rills and the natural watershed with rills and gullies and the generation and dissipation of runoff were perfectly simulated furthermore nse of sfd and amfd were about 0 8 in the ideal slope and watershed while ramfd was the best in prediction runoff as nse and rsme were individually about 0 98 and 2 6 mm h in the ideal slope and 0 94 and 0 76 mm h in the watershed it demonstrated that ramfd is capable of balancing water distribution while controlling the flow direction to a greater extent 2 soil erosion was divided into inter rill rill and gully erosions according to the critical water depth based on which soil erosion model was constructed it was also examined in three scales similar to the runoff model the results show that sfd and amfd were biased in predicting erosion amount and their nse were 0 8 0 9 in the ideal slope and 0 6 0 8 in the basin on the contrary the erosion amount of ramfd was consistent with analytical solution result and measurement data moreover in the basin the sediment deposition of ramfd occurred in the area adjacent to the gully thus it can be concluded that different water distribution rules also impact on the soil erosion prediction and ramfd owns advantages for describing the dynamic process in both slope and basin scales 3 this study applied ca model for overland flow and sediment transports based on some simplifying assumptions even though it has been demonstrated in different scales the limitations still exist in practical promotion when describing runoff manning s formula was used which is not a completely correct simplification gully erosion is characterized by not only downward erosion but also lateral expansion which was not accounted for in the erosion model furthermore the impacts of vegetation on runoff is considered but it is capable of influencing the sediment transport such as the rhizome causes an increase in soil cohesion and the grassland leads to sedimentation these issues constrain the application of ca models in erosion prediction and evaluation and need to be further researched declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements

1728,rainfall erosion has been calculated and predicted by various soil loss equations but the progressions of overland flow and sediment transport are less dynamically described in this study cellular automata ca models based on single flow direction algorithm sfd average value multi flow direction algorithm amfd and remaining average value multi flow direction algorithm ramfd were constructed simultaneously erosion model was constructed by dividing soil erosion into inter rill rill and gully erosions according to critical water depth the ca models were validated at three scales a theoretical slope an in situ model slope and the natural basin the results demonstrated the efficient performance of ramfd in the runoff ascension and recession stages while sfd and amfd presented unconcentrated runoff distribution especially in the in situ slope and basin simulation besides ramfd model occurred sediment deposition in the basin upstream while sfd and amfd presented continuous erosion furthermore the runoff nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of three models were 0 85 0 95 and 0 65 0 94 and the erosion root mean square error rmse were 0 5 1 0 kg min and 0 3 0 45 102kg min in the theoretical slope and natural basin respectively meanwhile the nse and rmse values of ramfd exhibited the best performance indicating that this model effectively balanced water distribution while controlling the flow direction to a greater extent overall it is justified to develop an erosion prediction model based on the classification of erosion types and the rules governing water flow allocation will inevitably result in qualitative and quantitative differences of runoff and erosion keywords rainfall erosion overland flow sediment yields cellular automata data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion has brought serious predicaments and challenges to environmental governance around the world for erosion prediction many models have been developed the universal soil loss equation usle has been widely used since it was put forward wischmeier et al 1958 meanwhile a revised version of this model rusle was obtained based on more extensive data renard and freimund 1994 and it is still widely applied in many countries such as the northwest loess region of china and muscat oman xu et al 2022 mahmood et al 2023 however the dynamic process of erosion is unable to be reproduced by the above empirical models and new methods for effectuating runoff and sediment transport are the imperative demand for this issue predicting the generation and dissipation of runoff is of priority when tackling soil erosion mathematical model built by saint venant equations sve have been used as an effective way lighthill and whitham 1955 the original form of the motion wave model was given for uniform rainfall in time and space henderson and wooding 1964 subsequently various shallow water equations and kinematic wave approximation theories have been extensively applied including coupling overland flow with rainfall infiltration defining unit discharge in manning s formula as a parabolic curve nonpoint source nps model and conducting accurate time integration smith and woolhiser 1971 woolhiser and ligget 1976 kavvas et al 2006 gottardi and venutelli 2008 besides some models determined the flow direction on basis of digital elevation model dem including single flow direction sfd algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 wilson et al 2007 and multiple flow direction mfd algorithm quinn et al 1991 mfd have been further developed to different algorithms such as fd model and remaining average value ramfd model seibert and mcglynn 2007 shao et al 2015 these flow direction algorithms own superior applicability in complex terrain but their distinction in runoff prediction is lack of adequate analysis on basis of the approximate methods of predicting overland flow the research about soil particle detachment and sediment transport have made great progress the integrated hydrology model inhm without a prior assumption of a specific hydrologic response mechanism was designed and developed freeze and harlan 1969 vanderkwaak and loague 2001 christophoer et al 2006 using the continuity equation ce the process of transport can be described bennet 1974 gatti et al 2023 in addition some simplified models for runoff and sediment yield and transport processes at different scales have also been proposed the answers model which treats runoff and erosion as independent processes incorporated critical shear stress and unit water flow dynamics making it suitable for small watershed scales beasley et al 1980 the lisem model based on the motion wave equation was specifically designed for soil erosion at the farmland scale de roo 1996 the agnps model has also been proposed and its erosion calculation was mainly based on the rusle equation which was relatively limited and can only be applied in a large watershed yuan et al 2003 additionally the water erosion prediction model has been developed to guide rainfall erosion predictions in rill and inter rill areas with applications in both farmland and slope contexts hafzullah et al 2020 although the numerical analysis methods have been improved these methods exhibit restrictions on multiscale issue and computational ability and the differences of the erosion types including rill and gully erosion were ignored for this paper three flow direction rules including sfd amfd and ramfd were introduced in ca models for dynamically describing the generation and dissipation of runoff meanwhile assuming that sediments totally transport with overland flow the ca model of soil erosion was accomplished by differentiating inter rill rill and gully erosions from each other in every cell under artificial and natural rainfall conditions the performance of these models on forecasting overland flow and sediment transports was discussed and how the flow direction rules impact on runoff and erosion was analyzed 2 methodology typical ca model named as a is a computation algorithm based dynamics model that consists of six components 1 a l d n u t c r where l d represents the cellular space d is the dimension n represents the neighborhood type u represents the cellular states t represents the time c represents the boundary conditions and r represents the evolutionary rules the cellular states are a series of parameters that describe the overland flow and sediment transport it need to be stored in the ca space for the corresponding calculations in this paper the set of cellular sates are comprised of four components 2 u x e h s where x is the land cover type of cells e is the altitude elevation m h is the water level elevation m s is the amount of sediments m 2 1 the spatial structure of cells the research on complex geographic phenomena must be established from the simplest geographic elements in the ca model a two dimensional lattice composed of multiple square grids is adopted as defined in the moore neighborhood banks 1971 every central cell owns four primary cardinal neightbor cells and four secondary diagonal neighbor cells 4 4 n which has been demonstrated excellent performance in runoff prediction than eight cells with the same priority shao et al 2015 besides the boundary cells can be divided three groups based on the net flow values the closed cells without flow discharge the input cells with net inflow the output cells with net outflow fig 1 2 2 the accomplishment of soil erosion process 2 2 1 the production process of runoff for central cells the overland flow is determined by rainfall intensity infiltration depression storage and water allocation of adjacent cells it is expressed as eq 3 3 h i h r i it v w i j 1 n h f j 1 n

water allocation from neighbor cell m h y is water distribution from neighbor cell m the infiltration means that rainwater will flow down the pore space under the action of gravity molecular force etc typical calculating method is adopted for describing rate of infiltration process horton 1940 it is expressed as eq 4 4 i it f 1 f 0 f 1 e α t t where f 0 is the initial infiltration rate of soil m min f 1 is the stable infiltration rate m min α is the attenuation coefficient during the rainfall process some of raindrops will be partially adsorbed on the plant surface owing to surface tension or evaporate directly in the air resulting in vegetation interception it can be expressed as eq 5 aston 1979 5 v v cm 1 e x p β h r v cm e r t where v cm is the precipitation sorption capacity of the forest canopy expressed as the thickness of the water layer on the projected area of the forest canopy m β is the attenuation coefficient e is the surface evaporation intensity of wet tree m h r is the ratio of tree surface area to canopy projection area when rainfall reaches the surface or runoff flows on the surface runoff will fill and stagnate in the potholes generating depression storage the calculation method of puddle storage in this study uses linsley s stepwise accumulation calculation method linsley et al 1975 and the mathematical expression is described as 6 w i δ h i e h i s d where δhi is overland flow increment of the cell i m sd is the maximum depression storage m the water distribution between neighbor cells and central cells is mainly influenced by the force between runoff and hillslope surface because of its unusual complexity in different scales there is a lot of applicable formulas and many of them need a larger number of parameters in this paper the simplified and typical manning formula is adopted 7 q h i 5 3 j 1 2 d δ t n where q represents available water distribution between cells m j represents the slope determined by water elevation of 9 cells m m d represents the side length of cell m n is the manning coefficient δt is time step h the slope of a cell is defined as a function of the change rate of elevation of nine cells in the east

arctan f x 2 f y 2 where fx is the elevation change rate in north south direction m m fy is the elevation change rate in east west direction m m z 1 z 9 represent water elevation of 9 cells mm 2 2 2 the process of soil erosion according to the different erosion dynamical mechanism soil erosion can be classified into many modes generally soil erosion can be divided into splash erosion sheet flow erosion rill erosion gully erosion liu et al 2004 and the splash erosion and sheet flow erosion can be unified named inter rill erosion because they are both induced by rainfall impaction zhang et al 1998 chaplot and bissonnais 2003 therefore soil erosion on a sloped land can be divided into inter rill erosion and runoff erosion thomas and wesley 1994 which can be expressed by 9 s i a 1 h r 2 δ t ρ s 2 s i a 2 j 0 ρ h i δ t ρ s 2 where si represents erosion depth during every time step m ρ represents density of water 103kg m3 ρ s represents bulk density of soil 103kg m3 j 0 represents the slope determined by elevation of 9 cells m m a 1 is the calibration constant of inter rill erosion 1015kg2 min m7 a 2 represents the calibration constant of runoff erosion 106kg min m3 the process of gully development consists of retroactive erosion bottom undercutting and bank expansion bingner et al 2016 the retroactive erosion and bank expansion usually occurs to the gully experiencing a period of instability and can be neglected if the gully is stable gordon et al 2012 thus the change of gully bottom elevation can be written in the form sidorchuk et al 2001 10 s i b 1 δ t s i v st h i 1 h i

particle size of sediment m for ascertaining the erosion type the location of every cell is necessary to be figured out in gullies owing to the catchment the water depth is larger than that of hillslope therefore the condition that a cell is located in gullies can be expressed by 12 h av k h max where hav represent the average water depth of 9 cells m hmax represents the maximum gully depth in whole area k represents a constant in 0 0 5 if it is explicit that a cell is located in hillslope inter rill and rill erosions should be discriminated the ability of water flow in rills to disperse the soil is proportional to its shear stress in rill the rill erosion occurs only if the water flow shear stress is greater than the critical shear stress crouch and novruzi 1989 nearing et al 1990 it can be described as the critical water depth when applied to the ca model 13 h l δ t τ g 5 3 j 0 2 1 j 0 2 7 12 n d 2 where hl is the critical water depth m τ is the critical shear stress related to types of soil m2 min2 2 3 conversion rules 2 3 1 water distribution the water distribution among cells are mainly influenced by existing water depth available water distribution described as manning s formula flow traveling time determined by flow velocity and distribution rules fig 2 it can be described as follows a calculate the maximum water depth allocated from central cell to neighbor cells compare it with the existing water depth and adopt the smaller one as the initial allocated water depth hi b determine the cells receiving water allocation on basis of distribution rules and the available water distribution ha is also obtained c assuming low volume sediment content have little impaction on runoff velocity the traveling time that water flowing into neighbor cell tn can be calculate by eq 14 and the final distribution hf can be calculated by eq 15 14 t n n d n 1 2 j 2 h i 3 2 15 h f h a δ t t n δ t t n h a δ t t n where dn is the length of flowing path equal to d or 20 5 d respectively for the cardinal cells and diagonal cells zn is water elevation of neighbor cell 2 3 2 sediment transports the sediment transports among cells contain discrimination of erosion types calculation of erosion depth sediment carrying capacity and updating elevation fig 3 the process can be described as follows a determine the type of soil erosion is by comparing hav and khmax hi and hl only if hi equals to zero the sediment will settle down and the elevation will increase b calculate the erosion depth by eq 9 and eq 10 and update the cumulative erosion depth si t and elevation ei t of cell i at time t c calculate the available sediment transports sa based on the water distribution d considering the sediment carrying capacity sc of certain overland flow which can be written in form of eq 16 finkner et al 1989 the final sediment transports sf is the smaller one between sa and sc 16 s c c 1 ρ g h i 5 3 j 0 3 2 n c 2 d n δ t ρ s d 2 where c 1 is an constant c 2 is an exponent that reflects the degree of turbulence 2 3 3 distribution rules 1 single flow direction algorithm sfd means that the water of central grid flows into a single neighbor cell to minimize the height differences and reach equilibrium conditions between the lowest cell and central cell fig 4 the details can be described as follows a calculate the maximum water elevation difference δz max between neighbor cells and central cell there is no water distribution if δz max is less than or equal to zero b determine which neighbor cell receives water allocation thereby the water distribution δh is obtained c compare δh and hi and choose the smaller one as the available water distribution ha 2 average value multi flow direction algorithm amfd means that water transport from central cell to multiple neighbor cells in order to reach equilibrium conditions in a neighborhood area fig 5 the determination process can be expressed as follows a calculate the average water elevationof 9 cells zav the central cell below the mean water elevation allocate no water b eliminate neighbor cells with higher water elevation than zav c comparing the sum of water distribution from central cell to potential cells with hi the smaller one is the water allocation from central cell hn d determine available water distribution ha proportional to the water level elevation difference 3 remaining average value multi flow direction algorithm the basic principle of ramfd is similar to amfd and their discrepancy is that ramfd eliminates the neighbor cells until their water elevations are not higher than the average water elevation of remain cells fig 6 it is described as follows a the first step is the same as that in the process of sfd b eliminate neighbor cells with higher water elevation than zi calculate the mean average of remain cells zav and repeat the above steps until no cell is eliminated c calculate the summation of the water requirement for neighbor cells and compare it with hi to confirm the water allocation hn d the final step is the same as that in the process of amfd 3 model validation with analytical solution at a assuming slope the ca models are firstly demonstrated by comparing them with the analytical methods including the kinematic wave function for describing water distribution smith 1997 and an approximate model for calculating sediment yields tao et al 2018 in order to simulate the surface flow and soil erosion the 50 m long and 20 m wide hypothetical plane at a uniform gradient of 10 was considered the rainfall with an intensity of 1 mm min and a duration of 30 min is stable and uniform on the slope surface the hydraulic roughness of the slope surface was expressed by the manning coefficient that the value is 0 02 the upper cells under closed state the bottom cells under open state a cell size of 0 1 m and a time step of 0 01 min were set during the simulating process furthermore the ca models were applied on the slope with two states impervious and infiltrating respectively for quantitatively evaluating the discrepancies between numerical analysis and ca simulation results nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and root mean square error rmse were adopted 17 nse 1 i n o i c i 2 i n o i o 2 18 rmse i n o i c i 2 n where o i is the observed data c i is the simulated data o is the arithmetic mean of the observed data the results showed that sfd achieved equilibrium relatively quickly with smoother recession limbs in both the hydrographs and sediment curves on the contrary amfd took the longest time to reach equilibrium and the recession time for runoff and erosion rates was short these two models represented the upper and lower envelopes of the runoff hydrographs and sediment yield curves compared to the numerical analysis respectively this suggests that ramfd and the numerical analysis shared the most similar curve shapes particularly during the equilibrium stage fig 7 moreover the presence of infiltration significantly reduced the peaks of runoff and sediment yield rates the nse values were consistently above 0 9 and rmse for runoff ranged from 5 5 to 7 5 mm h while the rmse for erosion rate ranged from 0 5 to 0 8 kg min these findings indicate a strong agreement between ramfd and the numerical analysis table 1 however the performance of the other models was not as satisfactory as ramfd as evidenced by the large discrepancies in their nse and rmse values compared to the numerical analysis 4 model validation with field experiment at small plot scale 4 1 in situ experiment and simulating parameters 4 1 1 model test rainfall simulation experiment was conducted for verifying the performance of the ca models in the mountainous region of lincang city yunnan province china taking a bare excavation slope with a gradient of 45 as an example the rainfall simulation test was designed including water supply system rainfall system and test apparatus fig 8 the water supply system was composed of a small reservoir providing water and a booster bump providing ample hydraulic pressure the rainfall system mainly contained rain sprinklers fixed to the support structure fig 9 a three dimensional 3d laser scanner with a precision of 3 1 mm at a distance of 271 m was incorporated in the test apparatus and employed in the test area of 6 m long and 6 m wide after rainfall meanwhile for all trials the artificial rainfall intensity was set at 1 mm min which produces raindrops with the median diameter of 1 0 to 2 1 mm and impact kinetic energy ranged from 2 84 to 12 6 j m2 min furthermore the cumulative rainfall duration was 14 h as artificial rainfall was carried out 7 times in 2 days accompanied by with 8 times of 3d scanning including initial states 4 1 2 simulation parameters based on the 3d scanning dem of the slope with a elevation precision of 0 1 mm and a horizontal resolution of 5 mm was established correspondingly the cell side length of 5

consisted of initial permeability stable permeability and attenuation coefficient f 0 f 1 and α which were 0 27 mm min 0 23 mm min and 0 52 respectively the depression storage parameter sd equal to 0 35 mm were adopted the erosion in the experimental area included rill erosion and inter rill erosion and the parameters a 1 and a 2 were 0 11 and 0 13 the two parameters c 1 and c 2 describing sediment carrying capacity were set as 0 1 and 1 25 furthermore a manning s coefficient n of 0 025 and a time step of 1 s were applied in the simulation because there was no vegetation on the slope which located in the weathered layer the vegetation interception was ignored 4 2 modeling results it was observed that the simulated surface runoff by sfd exhibited lower concentration and continuity resulting in ephemeral dispersed water flow in the direction of maximum gradient after 120 min of rainfall fig 10 a the erosion depth mapping obtained by afd also displayed discontinuous characteristics similar to the runoff results fig 10b in the satge of runoff ascention amfd performed better than sfd however it had a limitation of sheet flow perpendicular to the maximum gradient direction in the central area due to extensive water exchange with surrounding cells fig 10c d on the other hand the mappings obtained by ramfd showed concentrated confluence in the rill and the presence of a thin layer of overland flow on the slope surface closely resembling the natural state fig 10e f additionally slight differences were observed in the maximum runoff and erosion depths among the three models indicating the influence of flow distribution rules these observations highlight that ramfd effectively balances water distribution while controlling the flow direction to a greater extent the significance of distribution rules in governing runoff and soil erosion processes based on the dem the accumulated sediments were calculated as an antithesis to the simulated results simulated by ca models fig 11 with rainfall undergoing the disparity between the actual erosion amount and the simulated erosion amount increased resulting in a difference of 5 10 in the final state among the three models sfd produced the largest sediment yields and exhibited the largest deviation from reality while ramfd demonstrated excellent performance in predicting soil erosion furthermore the gradient consistency defined as the ratio of the gradients obtained by simulation and 3d scanning was calculated fig 12 it revealed a decreasing trend in accuracy as the rainfall process advanced this was mainly attributed to the heterogeneity of gradient distribution caused by changes in topographic relief leading to more deviations in the identification of erosion types among the three models the ramfd model showed the best agreement with the observed data with a minimum accuracy of approximately 85 in summary the ramfd model exhibits great potential for predicting runoff sediment transport and topographic changes 5 model validation with field measurements at watershed scale 5 1 watershed data before being applied into real world problem the model should be further tested in natural conditions therefore a watershed located in lincang city was chosen due to its complex topography the dem with a horizontal resolution of 1 m was constructed by points cloud oringinating from an unmanned aerial vehicle fig 13 consequently 1 m 1 m cell size was set for entire simulation process with 12 104 cells covering the whole watershed the boundary of the lattice did not contain any input cells but only consisted of closed and outlet cells considering the vegetation and geotechnical conditions five land use types were considered 1 crop silt 2 sparse grassland gravelly soil 3 bare gravelly soil 4 shrub granite weathered soil and 5 forest gravelly soil fig 14 different runoff and erosion parameters were set respectively tables 2 and 3 5 2 modeling results one rainfall event which was well documented and happened recently was chosen for the simulation during 30 min the intensity time history curve recorded by hydrological station was characterized by two rainfall intensity peaks which were 12 6 mm and 20 4 mm respectively it indicates that the duration and intensity of the rainfall event is complicated enough to be ideal for testing the model performance in surface runoff and soil erosion the hydrograph observed during the selected rainfall events were described fig 15 it illustrates that continuous rainfall led to a rapid increase in overland flow at 18 min and runoff reached its maximum value when the rainfall ceased among the models sfd produced the highest runoff and exhibited the slowest dissipation amfd yielded the lowest runoff indicating faster water transfer between cells the ramfd model showed the closest agreement with the measured results with an nse value of 0 94 and an rmse value of 0 76 mm h furthermore the actual erosion sediment was estimated based on the recorded overland flow and sediment concentration from the hydrological station fig 16 during the 0 7 min and 50 75 min periods the sediment concentration was recorded as 0 indicating no sediment yield the sfd model demonstrated a high peak in sediment yield rate with gradual recession limbs amfd performed poorly in simulating soil erosion suggesting its inability to adapt to complex terrains the most notable and accurate simulation results were achieved by the ramfd model which closely matched the measured data moreover the nse and rmse values of ramfd confirmed its effectiveness in dynamically describing soil erosion the simulated runoff mappings at different time steps based on ramfd was presented fig 17 with the increase of accumulated rainfall overland flow tended to accumulated in the bottom of the basin from where it further traveled to the outlet in 30 min the surface runoff culminated in a climax of 2 2 mm h and then it was gradually dissipated as the runoff gathering in the gully the maximum water depth was close to 220 mm in addition at the intersection of some ditches the runoff converges into a deep pool and still exists partially at 60 min due to the undulating terrain to sum up all the characteristics of overland flow have been captured by ramfd the cumulative erosion depth was depicted at different time steps fig 18 initially soil erosion was primarily influenced by the slope resulting in severe erosion occurring in the ridge of the basin while sediment accumulated in the gully over time gully erosion transitioned from sediment deposition to soil erosion by the 60th minute the maximum depth of gully erosion reached approximately 3 mm which was more than three times greater than the erosion depth on the hillslope concurrently sediment deposition occurred in the cells adjacent to the gully particularly in the upstream areas the coexistence of soil erosion and sediment deposition observed in the model aligns with the actual erosion patterns confirming the representativeness of the ramfd model in predicting soil erosion based on sfd and amfd hydrographs and erosion mappings were aslo obtained fig 19 when compared to the results obtained from the ramfd model both sfd and amfd models exhibited poor representation of the continuous distribution characteristics of runoff and water depth in the gully consequently there were discrepancies in gully erosion between the upstream and downstream regions the amfd model in particular displayed uniformity in the hydrograph causing the differences between gully erosion and other forms of erosion to diminish in conclusion both the sfd and amfd methods have limitations in simulating runoff and predicting sediment yield include the significant homogenization in the upstream areas and discontinuous distribution patterns in the downstream regions in practice the allocation of water to cells is not limited to specific situations but changes based on rainfall conditions and runoff characteristics hence the ramfd model aligns better with the natural state 6 discussion 6 1 accumulated sediment yields of different erosion types at the watershed in previous research it was considered that inter rill erosion caused by raindrop kinetic energy contributes a little to soil erosion rill erosion with limited transport capacity is the main source of eroded sediments and gully erosion as the main channel for sediment transport cerdan et al 2002 brodowski 2010 liu and liu 2020 mohseni and hosseinzadeh 2022 in previous soil erosion models using physical equations such as geowepp two types of erosion namely inter rill and rill erosion were considered this model was capable of simulating soil loss or deposition for each grid of the dem in on site scenarios renschler 2003 the mpsiac model classified erosion into upland and channel erosion but it required prior determination of the location and morphology of the channels casabella gonzalez et al 2023 however none of these models can perform real time classification of erosion types at each grid or provide sediment yields for different erosion types in this study the total sediment yields was calculated by integrating the erosion rate in time domain fig 20 a the results showed that the erosion amount of sfd was the largest among three models while that of ramfd was the closest to the measured value moreover the distinction of inter rill rill and gully erosions according to critical water depths make their amounts available to be accumulated fig 20b d gully erosion of sfd and amfd occurred in 23 min later than that of ramfd meanwhile three types of erosion accounted for 3 4 72 76 and 20 25 of the total it demonstrated the aforementioned inference about the contribution of different erosion types and the rationality of dividing erosion types based on the critical water depths 6 2 sensitivity analysis based on ramfd at the watershed parameter sensitivity analysis which discusses about how the inputs of model parameters influence the outputs have been used to evaluate the model stability by previous studies ferreira et al 1995 runoff sensitivity analysis of runca indicated that a variation range of 80 to 80 in the permeability coefficient resulted in a runoff change rate of 60 to 120 shao et al 2015 erosion sensitivity analysis of mpsiac revealed that erosion rate was most significantly influenced by runoff characteristics with erosion rate varying by over 100 under 20 change rate and the next most influential factors were upland and channel erosion factors with variation rates ranging from 30 to 40 under the same conditions casabella gonzalez et al 2023 according to previous research methods ramfd was chosen and the change range of parameters was set as 80 80 firstly the sensitivity of runoff parameters including infiltration interception depression and manning coefficients was analyzed fig 21 a the results showed that the infiltration parameters had the greatest impact on the overland flow especially the stable infiltration coefficient manning coefficient owned a negative influence on the confluence process inferior to the infiltration parameters the sensitivity analysis on sediment yields was also proceeded in the same way fig 21b the infiltration parameters manning coefficients erosion parameters and soil parameters were taken into investigation the results showed that the seepage coefficients influenced significantly on sediment yields with an output deviation of 100 the escalation of soil parameters greatly diminishes the sediment yields diametrically opposed to rill erosion coefficient in general the sensitivity of the model to main parameters conforms to the description of physical processes by various formulas proving the superiority of ca model in runoff and erosion prediction 6 3 assumptions of boundary conditions the establishment of appropriate boundary conditions is a crucial requirement in soil erosion models and previous models have commonly assumed the presence of inlet and outlet boundaries in this study we defined the inlet closed boundary and outlet based on input closed and output cells respectively in the in situ experimental setup the upper area subjected to rainfall was beyond the coverage of the 3d scanning derived dem and the objective rills were not present as a result these cells were considered to receive a minimal amount of upstream overflow the closed boundaries were assumed to achieve a balance between inflow and outflow on the lateral boundaries and thus were designated as closed cells additionally at the small plot scale the outlet was defined as the entire bottom surface with the lowest elevation which was similar to the watershed scale in cases where multiple areas exhibited relatively low elevations multiple outlets were considered requiring manual judgment during the modeling process this is casued by the utilization of manning s formula which is a simplified form of the fluid motion equation this approach is commonly applied in soil erosion models including the surface runoff module in the answers beasley et al 1980 geowepp renschler 2003 topkapi ciarapica and todini 2003 and runca shao et al 2015 alternatively models based on the navier stokes equation or simplified versions of it allow for stricter regulations on fluid movement direction eliminating the need for explicit inlet and outlet definitions such as the soil erosion model with effective time stepping gatti et al 2023 6 4 limitations of data measurement the validation of runoff and erosion models is typically conducted through three comparative approaches referencing previous research conducting on site model experiments and utilizing collected hydrological and soil erosion data from the field tao et al 2018 maurya et al 2021 hao et al 2022 gatti et al 2023 in this study these three methods were employed to validate the model under three different scenarios a hypothetical flat slope a model slope with artificially created rills and a natural watershed with existing rills and gullies for the model experiments certain variables such as water film height and flow velocity were not directly measured due to measurement limitations however the erosion data was used as an indirect evaluation of the runoff simulation particularly focusing on changes in slope gradient which have not been extensively examined in previous studies moreover it was demonstrated that hydrological and erosion data could be mutually validated providing a means to compensate for data limitations in either aspect hao et al 2022 in the case of natural basin we primarily obtained data on runoff depth and estimated erosion based on flow and sediment concentration measurements while previous erosion evaluations often involved multiple monitoring points throughout the entire watershed our study was limited in data availability and was unable to achieve such comprehensive coverage instead we supplemented the simulated erosion phenomena with actual observations particularly emphasizing sediment deposition in the upstream area of the ramfd model overall despite the data limitations our research was complemented by other aspects during the validation process demonstrating the robust performance of the model in erosion prediction 7 conclusion based on cellular automata this paper constructs overland flow and sediment yield models verified on multiple scales and the following conclusions were obtained 1 for predicting runoff ca model was built up by considering the impact of infiltration interception and depression meanwhile three flow rules sfd amfd and ramfd were selected as water distribution rules the runoff models applied in an ideal slope without rills or gullies a small model test with rills and the natural watershed with rills and gullies and the generation and dissipation of runoff were perfectly simulated furthermore nse of sfd and amfd were about 0 8 in the ideal slope and watershed while ramfd was the best in prediction runoff as nse and rsme were individually about 0 98 and 2 6 mm h in the ideal slope and 0 94 and 0 76 mm h in the watershed it demonstrated that ramfd is capable of balancing water distribution while controlling the flow direction to a greater extent 2 soil erosion was divided into inter rill rill and gully erosions according to the critical water depth based on which soil erosion model was constructed it was also examined in three scales similar to the runoff model the results show that sfd and amfd were biased in predicting erosion amount and their nse were 0 8 0 9 in the ideal slope and 0 6 0 8 in the basin on the contrary the erosion amount of ramfd was consistent with analytical solution result and measurement data moreover in the basin the sediment deposition of ramfd occurred in the area adjacent to the gully thus it can be concluded that different water distribution rules also impact on the soil erosion prediction and ramfd owns advantages for describing the dynamic process in both slope and basin scales 3 this study applied ca model for overland flow and sediment transports based on some simplifying assumptions even though it has been demonstrated in different scales the limitations still exist in practical promotion when describing runoff manning s formula was used which is not a completely correct simplification gully erosion is characterized by not only downward erosion but also lateral expansion which was not accounted for in the erosion model furthermore the impacts of vegetation on runoff is considered but it is capable of influencing the sediment transport such as the rhizome causes an increase in soil cohesion and the grassland leads to sedimentation these issues constrain the application of ca models in erosion prediction and evaluation and need to be further researched declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements

1729,the potential risk of multiple contaminants mobilization from sediment was evaluated under the infiltration of reactive organic matter om during groundwater recharge significant nh4 n po4 3 as fe and mn release were observed which show elevated peaks in the initial stage 0 19 d and declines afterwards until reach quite low and stable content 20 37 d when re oxidize with so4 2 38 65 d the reducing condition is stimulated to release more fe and mn however no as nh4 n and po4 3 the microbial reductive fe oxides dissolution is the main driving force for nh4 n po4 3 as fe and mn release the nh4 n and po4 3 release was attributed by passive mobilization from fe mn oxides due to its dissolution the cation exchange also works significantly on nh4 release while desorption works on po4 3 as well microorganism responses to the infiltration reactive om and further impacts the mobilization of multiple contaminants the precipitation of secondary fe mn minerals accompanied by co precipitation and or re absorption lower down their aqueous levels however this aqueous contamination risk was hidden in solid reactive secondary minerals when oxidizer like so4 2 perturbs the recurrence of fe and mn contamination occurs this shows the perennial release of nutrients and trace elements should be paid attention in areas with reactive om infiltration followed by redox groundwater chemistry fluctuations potentially in hyporheic zone of river lake managed aquifer recharge zone etc keywords risk nutrients as mobilization groundwater mn exogenous om redox conditions data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction geogenic contaminated groundwater gcg is widely distributed throughout the world which poses a great challenge for safe drinking water jia et al 2018 jia 2021 wang et al 2021 fendorf et al 2010 intensive studies have focused on the researches involving distribution pattern as well as geochemical hydrogeological and microbial processes contributing to the enrichment of gcg however more studies are taking place to highlight the importance of the impact of anthropogenic activities on the mobilization of gcg farnsworth hering 2011 jia et al 2018 schafer et al 2020 fakhreddine et al 2021 the natural background component in groundwater is to some extent chemically and microbially equilibrium with surrounding aquifer sediment if the infiltration of human pollutants or water table fluctuation occur the redox dissolution precipitation ion exchange conditions are inevitably changed in aquifer appelo postma 2005 neil et al 2012 the subsequent re equilibrium processes could be triggered involving redox mineral dissolution precipitation and ion exchange reactions the secondary contamination may occur in this circumstance the redox sensitive components like as and mn release contributed by the redox fluctuation triggered by pollutants solute infiltration is commonly reported in mar projects when dissolved oxygen and or nitrates are infiltrated into aquifers with primary hypoxic or anoxic conditions as release could occur due to oxidative dissolution of pyrite minerals jones and pichler 2007 jin et al 2016 prommer et al 2018 study shows the elevated groundwater mn is significant in the urbanization areas of the pearl river delta in china the decomposition of om in domestic sewage and industrial wastewater was thought to be an important cause hou et al 2020 discharge of wastewater pollutants destroys the balance of natural mn geochemical cycles and increases the release of mn from aquifers to groundwater at historically contaminated sites zhai et al 2022 the change of ion exchange condition affected by solute infiltration also promotes as mobilization due to the sufficient concentration of dissolved ca2 and mg2 in the primary groundwater it is helpful for as as arsenate to adsorb to layered silicate clay minerals in aquifer however problem comes when recharge water with limited aqueous ca2 and mg2 leads to the desorption of as from sediment sarah et al 2015 in bolivar australia po4 3 in the recharge water limits the amount of as adsorbed on fe hydroxy oxides causing as release during the mar injection vanderzalm et al 2011 2013 intensive studies have shown that natural organic matter nom which generally includes dissolved organic matter dom and deposited sediment organic matter som is critical in triggering the reduction of sensitive components such as fe oxides and as v as electron carriers or electron donors rowland et al 2007 guo et al 2019 kulkarni et al 2017 schittich et al 2018 studies also show nom works for nh4 n and po4 3 mobilization in groundwater sun et al 2022 tao et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 however the effect of anthropogenic sourced exogenous om on contaminants mobilization from aquifer sediment remain unclear the biodegradable c input from surface to groundwater is common in anthropogenic perturbation areas like landfill petrochemical plant river lake with sewage pollution etc the secondary contamination risk were reported referring to as mn and total hardness delemos et al 2006 jia et al 2018 feng et al 2023 this study we focused on the release patterns of multiples contaminants from sediment including redox sensitive component like as fe mn as well as nutrients like nh4 n and po4 3 although the groundwater as fe and mn mobilization is intensively studied in natural field condition fendorf et al 2010 wang et al 2019 2021 the potential contamination of their release under anthropogenic c source and its long term risk is not fully understood radloff et al 2007 and groundwater nh4 n and po4 3 is also a new concern in strong interaction zone between groundwater and rive lake ocean which is a potential pollution source for cyanobacterial bloom in surface water kazmierczak et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 sun et al 2022 we collected as bearing sediments from field aquifers for column experiments and selected small molecular om that could be easily consumed by microorganisms to ensure high microbial activities the experiments were set with relatively high biodegradable c to simulate the high rank risk of multiple contaminants release under anthropogenic penetration the further re oxidization of the reducing column was conducted to see the potential risks referring to further disturbance like redox groundwater chemistry fluctuations caused by human activities this study could have scientific significance for the management and control of environmental risks caused by the leakage and infiltration of exogenous om like landfill leachate petroleum pollutant 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments design the sediment samples were collected from a depth of 20 m below the surface of jianghan plain which is affected by high levels of groundwater as the sediment is mainly gray black fine to silty sand and emits a pungent sulfur odor at certain depths to preserve the samples they were wrapped in aluminum foil sealed in a sterile polyethylene bag and stored in the dark at 20 c during transportation upon arrival at the laboratory the sediment samples were stored in an ultra low temperature refrigerator at 80 c the groundwater here is closely connected to the yangtze river and shows seasonal fluctuation in water table as well as groundwater chemistry groundwater here and surrounding area is affected by high as fe mn nh4 n and po4 3 to ensure that the properties of the materials used in each experimental system remain consistent the collected sediments were homogenized air dried at room temperature 25 c and sieved through a 100 mesh screen this was also done to avoid the generation of preferential flow in the column during the experiment the homogenized aquifer sediment were used to evenly fill columns 1 2 and 3 synthetic groundwater sgw containing different oms were injected into columns 1 500 mg l 1 sodium lactate 2 1000 mg l 1 glucose and 3 1000

local groundwater 46 mg l na 40 mg l ca2 12 mg l mg2 122 mg l hco3 99 4 or 71 mg l cl 10 or 48 mg l so4 2 the major ion concentration was referring to the actual groundwater in the sampling area yu 2016 ionic strength was consistent across the different groups the sgw as well as the entire column system setup were sterilized before starting sterilized controls were prepared by autoclaving at 121 c for 25 min rowland et al 2007 considering the groundwater flow rate as well as the minimum rotational speed of the peristaltic pump and satisfying the requirements of sample collection in a short time 0 292 ml min was chosen for flow rate of sgw gauze and 1 cm thick glass beads were placed at both ends of the column the fluid was pumped from the bottom to the top to reduce the uneven distribution of the fluid in the column after n2 99 999 was injected into the column for 10 min the overflow occurred and the air in the column was removed a sampling port was set for each column the sampling period for each indicator was set to at least once every 3 days or 5 days due to the timeliness of sample testing and the large amount of samples required to test toc and hco3 the sampling interval of toc and hco3 was lengthened appropriately on the 38th day the sgw was changed so4 2 was increased from 10 to 48 mg l cl decreased from 99 4 to 71 mg l for ion charge balance and other conditions were consistent the purpose of increasing the concentration of so4 2 is to simulate the release potential of nutrients and metal loid s in scenario of groundwater chemistry fluctuation this is common in areas including hyporheic zone of river lake managed aquifer recharge zone or regions affected by monsoon kulkarni et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 as an oxidant the increase of so4 2 concentration will change the redox state and processes in the column the experimental period of column experiment was 65 days the pore volume in the columns 1 pv 37 5 was measured prior to the reaction and the sgw without oms was pumped into the reactor for 24 h to stabilize the solid liquid system in each column all column experiments were conducted at room temperature after 1 day of

solution the ph and fe ii were tested immediately after sampling at the end of the experiment the sediment in each column was immediately removed wrapped in tinfoil and stored in an anaerobic seal sheltered from light the sediment samples were evenly divided into four sections in the anaerobic chamber each of these samples were then divided into several parts for sediment extraction characterization and microbial testing the aqueous nh4 n and po4 3 concentration collected from the batch experiments using same sediment were analyzed in this study the soil liquid ratio was set at 1 10 in batch study an important reason for this ratio is to make sure enough water is available for different index analysis in order to ensure that each system maintains an anaerobic environment and the sampling process is independent of each other destructive sampling is adopted in batch experiment samples were taken regularly for 1 d 3 d 6 d 10 d 15 d 20 d 30 d and 60 d details of batch

column experiment 0 20 days the concentrations of nh4 n and po4 3 in the effluent were high but the overall concentrations decreased along with time fig 2 the highest toc content was consumed in the glucose column but nh4 n and po4 3 concentrations were similar to sodium lactate it is worth mentioning that the release of nh4 n almost peaked at the beginning and remained stable except for slight fluctuations during the first 15 days the concentration of po4 3 has a slow release and increase process in the early stage reaching the maximum release about 15 20 days fig 2 compared with the column experiment the concentrations of nh4 n and po4 3 in the batch experiment also reached the maximum release at the initial stage but began to decrease significantly without the stable stage to maintain high values in addition nh4 n and po4 3 in the controlling group without om were released similarly although their concentrations were significantly lower than those in other groups 3 2 the release patterns of as fe and mn with the infiltration of reactive om high concentrations of glucose and sodium lactate stimulated the release of as fe and mn in the early stage of the experiment 0 20 days but glucose had a significantly stronger effect on these releases and the risk was higher fig 2 lower concentration of sodium lactate 500 mg l did not contribute to the release of mn in the early stage 0 20 days but caused as release in the system with sodium lactate as carbon source the significant release of mn and partial release of fe were stimulated in the short term but there was little effect on as at the early stage of the experiment the sulfate concentration was low after increasing its concentration the so4 2 effluent concentration of all three columns remained above 20 mg l the consumption amount was about 30 mg l with more so4 2 addition on 38th day the reducing condition was stimulated to release more fe and mn in columns infiltrated with sodium lactate but not as fig 2 the change in water chemistry did not cause any fluctuation referring to as fe mn in the glucose system the as and mn were all below the detection limit after the 52nd day 3 3 the distribution characteristics of multiple components in solid phase of sediments four species were extracted for as fe and mn including exchangeable ones carbonate combined ones fe mn oxide combined ones and organic combined ones the amount of fe mn oxides combined specie was decreased significantly after infiltration with c sources fig 3 the morphology of fe bearing minerals in the solid samples obtained at the end of the experiment was shown in fig 4 and the content changes were shown in table 1 in the fe 2p spectrum fe 2p3 2 peak binding energy was lower and fe 2p1 2 peak binding energy was higher the results showed that fe in the sediments of column 2 and column 3 after 120 days of infiltration were mainly fe ii s fe ii o and fe iii o and the peak values of fe 2p3 2 were about 709 6 ev 711 0 ev and 714 6 ev respectively the main mineral form was fe iii o the peak value of 44 1 ev can be recognized as as iii 44 1 45 1 ev and the peak value of 45 3 ev can be recognized as as v 45 9 ev the percentages of as iii were 49 5 and 55 2 respectively table 2 the binding energy at 284 1 284 8 286 3 and 287 5 ev represents ch bond aliphatic cc bond co bond of phenols alcohols or ethers and carbonyl co bond respectively more aliphatic compounds were produced in the sodium lactate system while the organic compounds in the glucose system were mainly decomposed into small molecules of alcohols and aggregated at the influent end indicating that the microbial activity at the influent end was higher 3 4 sediment microbiology the hierarchical cluster analysis of microbial samples in sediments of different layers in two columns was carried out by using euclidean distance algorithm the results showed that there were significant differences in sediment microbial composition stimulated by glucose and sodium lactate shannon index is an index reflecting species diversity including species abundance and the evenness of species distribution among various individuals the higher shannon value is the higher species abundance of the sample is compared with the original sediment the microbial community diversity was increased by sodium lactate and decreased by glucose fig 5 refer to table s1 for details in the same column the microbial community composition in the sediments near the inlet and outlet differed significantly fig 6 at the phylum level actinobacteria was the dominant bacteria in the original sediments 79 2 followed by proteobacteria 6 4 and firmicutes 5 5 the addition of glucose and sodium lactate significantly reduced the abundance of actinobacteria while glucose stimulated firmicutes the highest abundance 47 7 61 0 and proteobacteria 14 7 26 5 at different locations sodium lactate had an obvious effect on the growth of proteobacteria 8 5 14 1 and firmicutes the highest abundance 59 8 73 8 in the sediments of the two columns acidobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi patescibacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria at the genus level in the original sediment samples janibacter saccharopolyspora pseudonocardia nocardioides streptomyces arthrobacter and other bacteria were found in the glucose column column 2 a large number of anaerobic bacteria such as acidogenic bacteria propionicicella propionibacteriaceae and clostridium clostridium sensu stricto 9 clostridium sensu stricto 3 were enriched near the inlet some of the high abundance strains we found at the outlet include acidobacteriales clostridium sensu stricto 12 saccharimonadales myxococcales candidatus koribacter and sporomusa in sodium lactate column column 3 we found the sulfate reducing bacteria sbr1031 desulfurispora facultative anaerobic bacteria rhodoplanes and clostridium clostridium sensu stricto 7 as a carbon source glucose stimulates microbial fermentation to produce acids further to maintain slightly acidic and anaerobic environments the bacteria involved in s and fe reduction candidatus koribacter desulfovibrio were also identified and inside the column containing sodium lactate the abundance of brevundimonas thiobacillus anaerolinea xanthobacter propionibacteriaceae and allorhizobium neorhizobium pararhizobium rhizobium were higher 4 discussion 4 1 the release of nh4 n and po4 3 contributed by fe reductive dissolution cation exchange or om decomposition significant nh4 n and po4 3 release were both observed in batch and column study figs 2 7 generally this elevated release peaks in the initial stage and declines afterwards until shows quite low and stable nh4 n and po4 3 content in the column study the flow condition offers more details about the process contributing to the release and enrichment of nh4 n and po4 3 the ratio of nh4 n and total dissolved phosphorus tdp was frequently used to trace the origin of groundwater nh4 n and p bedford et al 1999 slomp and van cappellen 2004 redfield et al 1963 studies have shown that po4 3 is considered to be the main p species in circumneutral groundwater mcarthur et al 2004 neidhardt et al 2018 if the nh4 n po4 p ratio is equal to the redfield ratio 16 1 then the dissolved p mainly comes from the decomposition of organic compounds containing p if the ratio is lower than 16 1 it indicates that there are other sources of p such as reductive dissolution of iron oxides with absorbed p tao et al 2020 2022 zhou et al 2022 in the early stage of our experiment 0 20 d when the release of p occurred the ph value was close to neutral around 7 8 therefore it could use the amount of po4 p to represent tdp the nh4 n p ratio is far below 16 1 fig 8 which usually around 0 5 in the column outlet flow this clearly indicated that the release of p was mainly caused by passive dissolution induced by the reductive dissolution of fe oxides the p release pattern also supported this it showed po4 3 release was not significant until fe reduction initiated after 3 days followed by a gradual increase trend until it peaked around 19 days fig 2 the potential po4 3 absorption on newly formed secondary fe minerals was limited compared with released content during that period the main process to lower down the aqueous po4 3 is the precipitation of vivianite fe3 po4 2 h2o 8 borch fendorf 2007 neidhardt et al 2018 this was obvious in the column of 1000 mg l glucose due to the high content of fe release the si of vivianite was mostly above 0 with highest of 6 6 indicating that precipitation was more likely to occur leading to the decline of aqueous po4 3 fig 2 in contrast to po4 3 the nh4 n release pattern showed almost reaching peak at the beginning and remaining quite stable content until around 15 days although the fe reduction was not triggered in the first 3 days nh4 n almost reached peak the p origin discussed above indicated the decomposition of sediment om contributing to aqueous n and p was limited since sodium lactate or glucose provide the c source for microbial dissimilation reduction the cation exchange could play quite high role in releasing nh4 n the increase of nh4 due to cation exchange with na was reported in several cases carrey et al 2014 rysgaard et al 1999 seitzinger et al 1991 the cation exchange between na and nh4 n can be well explained in the batch experiment in the absence of exogenous om the microbial degradation of om and reductive dissolution of fe oxides was limited but nh4 still released to a certain extent fig 7 the significant decrease of na ca2 and mg2 content in the outlet water support the occurrence of cation exchange fig 9 there was no release of nh4 in the late stage indicating that the maximum release of nh4 had been reached in the early stage 0 20 d as well as the equilibrium state however cation exchange is not limited to replacing nh4 from sediments but also exchange with other components such as h ca2 etc huang et al 2011 which could explain na is still consumed even nh4 is under detection limit in the later stage feammox that reduces the concentration of nh4 n is less likely to occur because it is inhibited in systems containing excessive om burgin and hamilton 2007 the release pattern of nh4 n and po4 3 in the batch study was slightly different from the column study which showed more quickly to reach peak and decline this was possibly due to high liquid soil ratio favoring the redox desorption and re adsorption reactions the addition of c sources in the batch group showed the elevated nh4 n and po4 3 release while the controlled group without c addition exhibited much lower levels fig 7 the controlled group and group of 500 mg l sodium lactate showed quite low and stable nh4 n and po4 3 content after 20 days while the group of 500 mg l glucose showed this pattern after 30 days fig 7 the initial high amount of nh4 n and po4 3 release was accompanied with significant fe reduction and release fig 7 this indicated the nh4 n and po4 3 release was highly related to the fe reduction in the batch study the controlled group without c addition in the batch study gave insight on the relative contribution of reductive dissolution cation exchange or om decomposition on nh4 n and po4 3 release the aqueous fe was under detection and orp was high indicating that fe reduction did not occur in the controlled group in this scenario the nh4 n and po4 3 release should mainly due to the cation exchange and or desorption the cation exchange could help to release nh4 n carrey et al 2014 since absorbed nh4 was the main specie of nh4 in the sediment this release amount could be quite high in this batch study the ratio of cation exchange attribute to nh4 n release was roughly calculated to be around 23 nh4 n released in controlled group nh4 n released in c added group 0 33 1 46 the rest part of nh4 should be mainly from passive mobilization during reductive dissolution of fe oxides adsorbed inorganic p and fe bound inorganic p are main p specie in the sediment in this batch study the calculated ratio of desorption attribute to po4 3 was around 38 po4 3 released in controlled group po4 3 released in c added group 0 21 0 56 the rest part of po4 3 was also believed to be mainly from passive mobilization due to reductive fe dissolution in general cation exchange and release through reductive fe dissolution are the main processes for controlling nh4 n enrichment in aqueous solutions the reductive fe dissolution contributes mostly to po4 3 release while the precipitation of vivianite lowers down its level the decomposition of om containing n and p in sediments contributed limited part of the release of n and p the quite low and stable nh4 n and po4 3 content in the later stage of both batch and column study showed that the initial released nh4 n and po4 3 are re absorbed precipitated in the sediment although part of nh4 n and po4 3 are flushed out in the column study simpson and williams 1970 willett 1982 borch fendorf 2007 this newly distributed nh4 n and po4 3 in the sediment are reactive and susceptive to the environmental change simpson and williams 1970 willett 1982 and therefore may cause a risk of secondary contamination 4 2 the release of as fe and mn and its groundwater level affected by om reactive sediment pools and secondary precipitation similarly to the release of nh4 n and po4 3 as fe and mn were mobilized significantly at the early stage 0 20 d with the infiltration of glucose and sodium lactate followed by decline to relatively low level and remain stable fig 2 however they were more fluctuated at the early stage when input with higher so4 2 initial 10 mg l increased to 48 mg l in 38 days the stabled aqueous fe and mn were mobilized again to some extent while as remained at low concentration level the microbial consumption of c source is the engine for as fe and mn mobilization the toc consumption and bix index calculated from three dimensional fluorescence clearly indicated that the microbial process was persistent in the whole experiment period fig 2 s1 the bix generally showed an upward trend with its value most above 1 0 indicating that the strongly conducted microbial mineralization of om the high as is consistent with high level of proteins like component and low content of humus like component also support strong microbial mineralization fig s2 3 the variation of c source reactivity leads to the different extent of mobilization of as fe and mn even increase its content from 500 to 1000 mg l sodium lactate can only mobilize maximum fe of 2 07 mg l as of 7 56 µg l mn of 1 14 mg l similar to 500 mg l group femax 1 86 mg l asmax 21 55 µg l mnmax 1 14 mg l fig 2 to be comparable the 1000 mg l glucose cause around one order of magnitude higher mobilization femax 39 94 mg l asmax 42 29 µg l mnmax 9 21 mg l fig 2 this clearly indicated that glucose is more favorable for microbial activity on reductive dissolution of as bearing fe mn oxides hydroxides the improvement of om reactivity could significantly enhance the release of as fe and mn harvey et al 2002 wang et al 2019 the sediment mineral provided source and sink of as fe and mn controlling the amount could be released to aqueous and influencing the precipitated amount the reactivity of as bearing fe mn oxides hydroxides also determined the extent of as fe and mn mobilization with higher reactive one possess more elevated mobilization jia et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the aqueous as fe and mn were mainly derived from fe mn oxides combined species which were the main loss parts of sediment fe fig 3 most of them should be reductive dissolved and flushed out and part of them were precipitated into other forms of fe more fe mn oxides bound as fe and mn were consumed in group with 1000 mg l glucose which was consistent with quite higher aqueous as fe mn content figs 2 3 therefore the content and reactivity of fe mn oxides was one controlling factor to determine the release content of as fe mn along the flow path group with 1000 mg l glucose showed decreased trend of fe mn oxides bound fe and mn distribution while 1000 mg l sodium lactate was opposite this should be due to the variation of the extent of reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides and precipitation of secondary fe mn minerals the decline of as fe and mn was contributed by the precipitation of secondary fe mn minerals frequently known as siderite feco3 mackinawite fes and rhodochrosite mnco3 jia et al 2014 2018 li et al 2022 here in our study the si value above 0 frequently occurred indicating the possibility of precipitation of these minerals fig 2 this was also supported by the sediment analysis as well as its color change during the experiment with increase of so4 2 in inlet on 38th day the strong so4 2 reduction occurred leading to the formation of mackinawite fes this was evidenced by xrf results showed that the sulfur content in sediments increased significantly and the sulfurization degree was more significant near the inlet end tables 1 2 as well as the significant column clogging after 40th day also the change of original yellow brown to black color of the sediments showing the precipitation of fe minerals with reducing state together with the previous studies guo et al 2016 ying et al 2017 li et al 2022 we believed the precipitation of siderite mackinawite rhodochrosite were responsible for the decline of as fe and mn even with the continuous input of high om the mobilization of as fe and mn was not persistent the quick decline to low level indicating this contamination risk was controllable the precipitation of second fe mn minerals and re absorption processes helped to lower down this contamination however this risk was still hidden in this reactive secondary minerals when oxidizer like so4 2 perturbation occurred the fe and mn contamination deteriorates again 4 3 the risk of multiple contaminants release affected by groundwater flow condition and redox fluctuation the groundwater flow rate could also be an important reason influencing contaminants enrichment with same sediment cultured in batch study feng et al 2023 if normalize to same water sediment ratio in this column study the maximum as fe mn mobilized is 615 µg l 184 mg l and 134 mg l porosity of 0 375 sediment density of 1 215 g cm3 respectively refer to the supplementary materials for calculation this is just a simplified calculation the real case release may not reach this high but certainly reflect enhanced mobilization occurs this much enhanced mobilization could be partly due to the zero flow rate in batch study which should be more favorable for the enhancement of reducing condition and related reactions banzhaf and hebig 2016 the batch study could to some extent reflects the stagnant groundwater condition which was mostly reported in high as affected areas buschmann et al 2007 van geen et al 2008 jia et al 2014 2018 interestingly when re oxidize with so4 2 on 38th day the reducing condition was stimulated to release more fe and mn fig 2 at this third stage the fe reduction should be attributed by hs the product of so4 2 reduction guo et al 2016 jia et al 2017 the hs should be more reactive to reduce fe mn oxides than sodium lactate stimulated microbial reduction therefore causing elevated fe and mn release while no obvious effect on glucose group studies have shown that hs plays a key role in reducing fe oxides and promoting as release jia et al 2017 guo et al 2016 this process which is directly combined with microbial sulfate reduction exhibits rapid chemical reaction kinetics and is surface controlled through electron transfer kocar et al 2010 poulton et al 2004 sun et al 2016 no further enrichment of as nh4 n and po4 3 with the so4 2 addition was observed this indicated the release amount of them related to fe reduction is lower than the ones being re absorbed to precipitated reactive secondary minerals this so4 2 addition was simulating circumstance of the change of groundwater chemistry and redox condition which frequently occurred in strong interaction zone of surface water and groundwater like mar area hyporheic zone or regions affected by monsoon kulkarni et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 it is reported that the oxygen interception caused by groundwater level fluctuations in the mar project will lead to the precipitation of dissolved mn and fe in the reduction zone in the form of oxides farnsworth hering 2011 in the reductive aquifer where pyrite is distributed studies have shown that due to the oxidation of pyrite the injection of aerobic water results in a significant release of as fe so4 2 and h jones and pichler 2007 wallis et al 2011 sun et al 2020 the precipitation of second fe mn minerals and re absorption processes help to lower down this contamination however this risk is still hidden in the reactive secondary minerals when redox fluctuation or other redox sensitive component input occurs the trace element contamination could deteriorate again 4 4 microorganism s response to the infiltration reactive om and its impact on the mobilization of multiple contaminants in this study the addition of glucose and sodium lactate significantly increased the abundance of firmicutes and proteobacteria many studies have shown that firmicutes contain a large number of as resistant strains corsini et al 2010 therefore microorganism with this strain could survive in high as environment proteobacteria is a phylogenetic group prevails in fe iii reduction sediments lloyd 2003 some proteobacteria play an important role in promoting fe mn reduction and oxidation in the environment at the genus level a large proliferation of clostridium in both columns was observed especially in the glucose column clostridium is the main bacteria in glucose culture gounou et al 2010 parker et al 2018 su et al 2020 as well as being the most studied fermentation microorganism of reduced fe iii francis and dodge 1988 dobbin et al 1999 zhang et al 2019 enrichment culture studies have shown that fe iii is reduced much faster with glucose as an electron donor than with acetate or lactate gagen et al 2019 and a higher percentage of fe reduction in glucose compared to acetate or lactic acid lentini et al 2012 gagen et al 2019 this was consistent with this study fig 2 clostridium has been widely reported in as affected aquifers rowland et al 2007 héry et al 2010 liao et al 2011 clostridium isolated from the high as affected aquifer in the jianghan plain has been proven to have the ability to reduce as and fe jie et al 2017 clostridium can reduce soluble fe iii or amorphous fe hydrogen oxides and bind to doc to promote as migration deng et al 2018 qiao et al 2021 the presence of acid producing bacteria like acidobacteriales and acetanaerobacterium contributed to the decrease of ph the acidic environment favors the release of fe in glucose column in the sodium lactate column we found some bacteria e g brevundimonas candidatus koribacter that may be involved in the fe cycle and more sulfur reducing bacteria which are different from those in the glucose column brevundimonas has been identified as bacteria associated with as metabolism suggesting that they may play a critical role mobilizing as in this study herbel and fendorf 2006 cavalca et al 2010 desulfocapsa known could disproportionate intermediate sulfur species i e inorganic sulfur sulfite or thiosulfate was observed here dar et al 2007 finster et al 2013 indicating it may participate in sulfide reduction processes microbial sulfate reduction has a bidirectional effect on as behavior because sulfide production promotes the reduction as bearing fe mn oxides but also co precipitation of as burton et al 2014 guo et al 2016 this explains the elevated fe and mn but no effect on as release after more so4 2 was input at 38 days fig 2 microorganisms are the main driving force for c and s biogeochemical cycles madsen 2011 turan et al 2019 bilen and turan 2022 based on the functional predictions of out levels using the faprotax database chemoheterotrophy aerobic chemoheterotrophy s transformation degradation of aromatic compounds dark hydrogen oxidation and fermentation are prominent functional groups in groundwater fig 10 indicating that c and s metabolism are major functions in this study the s cycle was related to the increase of so4 2 concentration in the later stage which stimulated the growth of s reducing bacteria faprotax did not predict any as metabolic function this may due to only finished sediment was used for microorganism analysis the as metabolic function could be covered by s metabolic function which is the main process in the later stage 5 environmental implications in our previous work based on batch study exogenous om stimulated the release of as fe and mn followed by a decline contributed by secondary precipitation to low levels feng et al 2023 similar release pattern were also observed in this column study the as concentration in this study was similar with field groundwater however if same liquid solid ratio was normalized the maximum as fe and mn was one magnitude higher in batch study high liquid solid ratio and stagnant environment are favorable for the microbial dissimilation reduction therefore when the exogenous om is infiltrated in aquifer with low groundwater flow condition the risk of reductive dissolution release of as fe and mn could be high the quick flow rate could to some extent weaken the reducing environment and promote the contaminants dilution groundwater recharge containing reactive om could triggers a series of reactions in groundwater first triggered mobilization of multiple contaminants in groundwater could be observed followed by sequestration of contaminants due to precipitation and re adsorption recurrence of pollution responses to redox groundwater chemistry fluctuation is also possible fig 11 the low level of fe and mn in the later stage was stimulated to further mobilization by the re oxidization with so4 2 this showed that in the redox groundwater chemistry fluctuation zone the disappeared groundwater contamination could occur again due to the high reactivity of secondary minerals fig 11 these areas including hyporheic zone of river lake managed aquifer recharge zone or regions affected by monsoon kulkarni et al 2018 wallis et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 therefore we should pay attention to the perennial release of poisonous trace elements like as and mn as well as nutrients like n and p in those areas 6 conclusion the infiltration of reactive om could greatly affect the groundwater redox condition accompanied by a series of reactions including redox reactions mineral dissolution precipitation ion exchange and surface complexation significant release of nh4 n and po4 3 were both observed which shows elevated mobilization peaks in the initial stage 0 19 d and declines afterwards until shows quite low and stable content 20 37 d similar release pattern was found with as fe and mn however they were more fluctuated at the early stage when input with higher so4 2 initial 10 mg l increase to 48 mg l in 38th day the stabled aqueous fe and mn is to some extent mobilized again while as nh4 n and po4 3 remain unchanged with low level the passive mobilization via reductive fe dissolution together with cation exchange are the main processes controlling aqueous nh4 n enrichment the passive mobilization via reductive fe dissolution contributes mostly to p release and vivianite precipitation constrains its level the initial released nh4 n and po4 3 are eventually re absorbed precipitated in sediment the microbial consumption of c source is the engine for as fe and mn mobilization the sediment mineral provides source and sink of as fe and mn controlling the amount could stay in aqueous the decline of as fe and mn was due to the precipitation of secondary fe mn minerals like siderite feco3 mackinawite fes and rhodochrosite mnco3 supported by the dark transition of sediment color beginning on 9th day microorganism responsed to the infiltration reactive om and further worked on the mobilization of these multiple contaminants even with the continuous input of high amount of om the mobilization of as fe mn nh4 n and po4 3 is not persistent the decline to low level indicating this contamination risk is constrained the precipitation of secondary fe mn minerals and co precipitation re absorption processes help to lower down the contamination however this risk is still hidden in this reactive secondary minerals when redox groundwater chemistry fluctuates which frequently occurs in strong interaction zone of surface water and groundwater like mar area hyporheic zone or regions affected by monsoon the perennial release of trace elements and nutrients could come up again declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

1729,the potential risk of multiple contaminants mobilization from sediment was evaluated under the infiltration of reactive organic matter om during groundwater recharge significant nh4 n po4 3 as fe and mn release were observed which show elevated peaks in the initial stage 0 19 d and declines afterwards until reach quite low and stable content 20 37 d when re oxidize with so4 2 38 65 d the reducing condition is stimulated to release more fe and mn however no as nh4 n and po4 3 the microbial reductive fe oxides dissolution is the main driving force for nh4 n po4 3 as fe and mn release the nh4 n and po4 3 release was attributed by passive mobilization from fe mn oxides due to its dissolution the cation exchange also works significantly on nh4 release while desorption works on po4 3 as well microorganism responses to the infiltration reactive om and further impacts the mobilization of multiple contaminants the precipitation of secondary fe mn minerals accompanied by co precipitation and or re absorption lower down their aqueous levels however this aqueous contamination risk was hidden in solid reactive secondary minerals when oxidizer like so4 2 perturbs the recurrence of fe and mn contamination occurs this shows the perennial release of nutrients and trace elements should be paid attention in areas with reactive om infiltration followed by redox groundwater chemistry fluctuations potentially in hyporheic zone of river lake managed aquifer recharge zone etc keywords risk nutrients as mobilization groundwater mn exogenous om redox conditions data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction geogenic contaminated groundwater gcg is widely distributed throughout the world which poses a great challenge for safe drinking water jia et al 2018 jia 2021 wang et al 2021 fendorf et al 2010 intensive studies have focused on the researches involving distribution pattern as well as geochemical hydrogeological and microbial processes contributing to the enrichment of gcg however more studies are taking place to highlight the importance of the impact of anthropogenic activities on the mobilization of gcg farnsworth hering 2011 jia et al 2018 schafer et al 2020 fakhreddine et al 2021 the natural background component in groundwater is to some extent chemically and microbially equilibrium with surrounding aquifer sediment if the infiltration of human pollutants or water table fluctuation occur the redox dissolution precipitation ion exchange conditions are inevitably changed in aquifer appelo postma 2005 neil et al 2012 the subsequent re equilibrium processes could be triggered involving redox mineral dissolution precipitation and ion exchange reactions the secondary contamination may occur in this circumstance the redox sensitive components like as and mn release contributed by the redox fluctuation triggered by pollutants solute infiltration is commonly reported in mar projects when dissolved oxygen and or nitrates are infiltrated into aquifers with primary hypoxic or anoxic conditions as release could occur due to oxidative dissolution of pyrite minerals jones and pichler 2007 jin et al 2016 prommer et al 2018 study shows the elevated groundwater mn is significant in the urbanization areas of the pearl river delta in china the decomposition of om in domestic sewage and industrial wastewater was thought to be an important cause hou et al 2020 discharge of wastewater pollutants destroys the balance of natural mn geochemical cycles and increases the release of mn from aquifers to groundwater at historically contaminated sites zhai et al 2022 the change of ion exchange condition affected by solute infiltration also promotes as mobilization due to the sufficient concentration of dissolved ca2 and mg2 in the primary groundwater it is helpful for as as arsenate to adsorb to layered silicate clay minerals in aquifer however problem comes when recharge water with limited aqueous ca2 and mg2 leads to the desorption of as from sediment sarah et al 2015 in bolivar australia po4 3 in the recharge water limits the amount of as adsorbed on fe hydroxy oxides causing as release during the mar injection vanderzalm et al 2011 2013 intensive studies have shown that natural organic matter nom which generally includes dissolved organic matter dom and deposited sediment organic matter som is critical in triggering the reduction of sensitive components such as fe oxides and as v as electron carriers or electron donors rowland et al 2007 guo et al 2019 kulkarni et al 2017 schittich et al 2018 studies also show nom works for nh4 n and po4 3 mobilization in groundwater sun et al 2022 tao et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 however the effect of anthropogenic sourced exogenous om on contaminants mobilization from aquifer sediment remain unclear the biodegradable c input from surface to groundwater is common in anthropogenic perturbation areas like landfill petrochemical plant river lake with sewage pollution etc the secondary contamination risk were reported referring to as mn and total hardness delemos et al 2006 jia et al 2018 feng et al 2023 this study we focused on the release patterns of multiples contaminants from sediment including redox sensitive component like as fe mn as well as nutrients like nh4 n and po4 3 although the groundwater as fe and mn mobilization is intensively studied in natural field condition fendorf et al 2010 wang et al 2019 2021 the potential contamination of their release under anthropogenic c source and its long term risk is not fully understood radloff et al 2007 and groundwater nh4 n and po4 3 is also a new concern in strong interaction zone between groundwater and rive lake ocean which is a potential pollution source for cyanobacterial bloom in surface water kazmierczak et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 sun et al 2022 we collected as bearing sediments from field aquifers for column experiments and selected small molecular om that could be easily consumed by microorganisms to ensure high microbial activities the experiments were set with relatively high biodegradable c to simulate the high rank risk of multiple contaminants release under anthropogenic penetration the further re oxidization of the reducing column was conducted to see the potential risks referring to further disturbance like redox groundwater chemistry fluctuations caused by human activities this study could have scientific significance for the management and control of environmental risks caused by the leakage and infiltration of exogenous om like landfill leachate petroleum pollutant 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments design the sediment samples were collected from a depth of 20 m below the surface of jianghan plain which is affected by high levels of groundwater as the sediment is mainly gray black fine to silty sand and emits a pungent sulfur odor at certain depths to preserve the samples they were wrapped in aluminum foil sealed in a sterile polyethylene bag and stored in the dark at 20 c during transportation upon arrival at the laboratory the sediment samples were stored in an ultra low temperature refrigerator at 80 c the groundwater here is closely connected to the yangtze river and shows seasonal fluctuation in water table as well as groundwater chemistry groundwater here and surrounding area is affected by high as fe mn nh4 n and po4 3 to ensure that the properties of the materials used in each experimental system remain consistent the collected sediments were homogenized air dried at room temperature 25 c and sieved through a 100 mesh screen this was also done to avoid the generation of preferential flow in the column during the experiment the homogenized aquifer sediment were used to evenly fill columns 1 2 and 3 synthetic groundwater sgw containing different oms were injected into columns 1 500 mg l 1 sodium lactate 2 1000 mg l 1 glucose and 3 1000 mg l 1 sodium lactate glucose and sodium lactate are common carbon sources used for stimulate microbial activity guo et al 2008 gillispie et al 2016 schaefer et al 2017 the sgw was similar to that of local groundwater 46 mg l na 40 mg l ca2 12 mg l mg2 122 mg l hco3 99 4 or 71 mg l cl 10 or 48 mg l so4 2 the major ion concentration was referring to the actual groundwater in the sampling area yu 2016 ionic strength was consistent across the different groups the sgw as well as the entire column system setup were sterilized before starting sterilized controls were prepared by autoclaving at 121 c for 25 min rowland et al 2007 considering the groundwater flow rate as well as the minimum rotational speed of the peristaltic pump and satisfying the requirements of sample collection in a short time 0 292 ml min was chosen for flow rate of sgw gauze and 1 cm thick glass beads were placed at both ends of the column the fluid was pumped from the bottom to the top to reduce the uneven distribution of the fluid in the column after n2 99 999 was injected into the column for 10 min the overflow occurred and the air in the column was removed a sampling port was set for each column the sampling period for each indicator was set to at least once every 3 days or 5 days due to the timeliness of sample testing and the large amount of samples required to test toc and hco3 the sampling interval of toc and hco3 was lengthened appropriately on the 38th day the sgw was changed so4 2 was increased from 10 to 48 mg l cl decreased from 99 4 to 71 mg l for ion charge balance and other conditions were consistent the purpose of increasing the concentration of so4 2 is to simulate the release potential of nutrients and metal loid s in scenario of groundwater chemistry fluctuation this is common in areas including hyporheic zone of river lake managed aquifer recharge zone or regions affected by monsoon kulkarni et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 as an oxidant the increase of so4 2 concentration will change the redox state and processes in the column the experimental period of column experiment was 65 days the pore volume in the columns 1 pv 37 5 was measured prior to the reaction and the sgw without oms was pumped into the reactor for 24 h to stabilize the solid liquid system in each column all column experiments were conducted at room temperature after 1 day of equilibrium inflow and outflow samples were collected to monitor the ph fe fe ii mn as nh4 n cations ca2 na mg2 anions f cl no3 so4 2 po4 3 toc and three dimensional fluorescence of dom in the solution the ph and fe ii were tested immediately after sampling at the end of the experiment the sediment in each column was immediately removed wrapped in tinfoil and stored in an anaerobic seal sheltered from light the sediment samples were evenly divided into four sections in the anaerobic chamber each of these samples were then divided into several parts for sediment extraction characterization and microbial testing the aqueous nh4 n and po4 3 concentration collected from the batch experiments using same sediment were analyzed in this study the soil liquid ratio was set at 1 10 in batch study an important reason for this ratio is to make sure enough water is available for different index analysis in order to ensure that each system maintains an anaerobic environment and the sampling process is independent of each other destructive sampling is adopted in batch experiment samples were taken regularly for 1 d 3 d 6 d 10 d 15 d 20 d 30 d and 60 d details of batch experiment condition could see feng et al 2023 fig 1 2 2 aqueous chemistry analysis the collected liquid samples were tested for hydrochemical parameters including ph fe fe ii mn as anions and cations solution ph was measured immediately using a fe 28 standard ph meter metler toledo greifensee switzerland fe ii was determined by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa some samples were filtered by 0 45 μm filter membrane and added 1 1 hno3 to ensure that ph value was less than 2 the contents of fe mn and major cations were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic

predicting the functional roles of microorganisms in biogeochemical processes it currently includes over 80 functions e g c n s fe biogeochemical functions associated with various biogeochemical processes and more than 4600 microbial species sansupa et al 2021 ke et al 2022 3 results 3 1 the release patterns of nh4 n and po4 3 with the infiltration of reactive om at the early stage of the column experiment 0 20 days the concentrations of nh4 n and po4 3 in the effluent were high but the overall concentrations decreased along with time fig 2 the highest toc content was consumed in the glucose column but nh4 n and po4 3 concentrations were similar to sodium lactate it is worth mentioning that the release of nh4 n almost peaked at the beginning and remained stable except for slight fluctuations during the first 15 days the concentration of po4 3 has a slow release and increase process in the early stage reaching the maximum release about 15 20 days fig 2 compared with the column experiment the concentrations of nh4 n and po4 3 in the batch experiment also reached the maximum release at the initial stage but began to decrease significantly without the stable stage to maintain high values in addition nh4 n and po4 3 in the controlling group without om were released similarly although their concentrations were significantly lower than those in other groups 3 2 the release patterns of as fe and mn with the infiltration of reactive om high concentrations of glucose and sodium lactate stimulated the release of as fe and mn in the early stage of the experiment 0 20 days but glucose had a significantly stronger effect on these releases and the risk was higher fig 2 lower concentration of sodium lactate 500 mg l did not contribute to the release of mn in the early stage 0 20 days but caused as release in the system with sodium lactate as carbon source the significant release of mn and partial release of fe were stimulated in the short term but there was little effect on as at the early stage of the experiment the sulfate concentration was low after increasing its concentration the so4 2 effluent concentration of all three columns remained above 20 mg l the consumption amount was about 30 mg l with more so4 2 addition on 38th day the reducing condition was stimulated to release more fe and mn in columns infiltrated with sodium lactate but not as fig 2 the change in water chemistry did not cause any fluctuation referring to as fe mn in the glucose system the as and mn were all below the detection limit after the 52nd day 3 3 the distribution characteristics of multiple components in solid phase of sediments four species were extracted for as fe and mn including exchangeable ones carbonate combined ones fe mn oxide combined ones and organic combined ones the amount of fe mn oxides combined specie was decreased significantly after infiltration with c sources fig 3 the morphology of fe bearing minerals in the solid samples obtained at the end of the experiment was shown in fig 4 and the content changes were shown in table 1 in the fe 2p spectrum fe 2p3 2 peak binding energy was lower and fe 2p1 2 peak binding energy was higher the results showed that fe in the sediments of column 2 and column 3 after 120 days of infiltration were mainly fe ii s fe ii o and fe iii o and the peak values of fe 2p3 2 were about 709 6 ev 711 0 ev and 714 6 ev respectively the main mineral form was fe iii o the peak value of 44 1 ev can be recognized as as iii 44 1 45 1 ev and the peak value of 45 3 ev can be recognized as as v 45 9 ev the percentages of as iii were 49 5 and 55 2 respectively table 2 the binding energy at 284 1 284 8 286 3 and 287 5 ev represents ch bond aliphatic cc bond co bond of phenols alcohols or ethers and carbonyl co bond respectively more aliphatic compounds were produced in the sodium lactate system while the organic compounds in the glucose system were mainly decomposed into small molecules of alcohols and aggregated at the influent end indicating that the microbial activity at the influent end was higher 3 4 sediment microbiology the hierarchical cluster analysis of microbial samples in sediments of different layers in two columns was carried out by using euclidean distance algorithm the results showed that there were significant differences in sediment microbial composition stimulated by glucose and sodium lactate shannon index is an index reflecting species diversity including species abundance and the evenness of species distribution among various individuals the higher shannon value is the higher species abundance of the sample is compared with the original sediment the microbial community diversity was increased by sodium lactate and decreased by glucose fig 5 refer to table s1 for details in the same column the microbial community composition in the sediments near the inlet and outlet differed significantly fig 6 at the phylum level actinobacteria was the dominant bacteria in the original sediments 79 2 followed by proteobacteria 6 4 and firmicutes 5 5 the addition of glucose and sodium lactate significantly reduced the abundance of actinobacteria while glucose stimulated firmicutes the highest abundance 47 7 61 0 and proteobacteria 14 7 26 5 at different locations sodium lactate had an obvious effect on the growth of proteobacteria 8 5 14 1 and firmicutes the highest abundance 59 8 73 8 in the sediments of the two columns acidobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi patescibacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria at the genus level in the original sediment samples janibacter saccharopolyspora pseudonocardia nocardioides streptomyces arthrobacter and other bacteria were found in the glucose column column 2 a large number of anaerobic bacteria such as acidogenic bacteria propionicicella propionibacteriaceae and clostridium clostridium sensu stricto 9 clostridium sensu stricto 3 were enriched near the inlet some of the high abundance strains we found at the outlet include acidobacteriales clostridium sensu stricto 12 saccharimonadales myxococcales candidatus koribacter and sporomusa in sodium lactate column column 3 we found the sulfate reducing bacteria sbr1031 desulfurispora facultative anaerobic bacteria rhodoplanes and clostridium clostridium sensu stricto 7 as a carbon source glucose stimulates microbial fermentation to produce acids further to maintain slightly acidic and anaerobic environments the bacteria involved in s and fe reduction candidatus koribacter desulfovibrio were also identified and inside the column containing sodium lactate the abundance of brevundimonas thiobacillus anaerolinea xanthobacter propionibacteriaceae and allorhizobium neorhizobium pararhizobium rhizobium were higher 4 discussion 4 1 the release of nh4 n and po4 3 contributed by fe reductive dissolution cation exchange or om decomposition significant nh4 n and po4 3 release were both observed in batch and column study figs 2 7 generally this elevated release peaks in the initial stage and declines afterwards until shows quite low and stable nh4 n and po4 3 content in the column study the flow condition offers more details about the process contributing to the release and enrichment of nh4 n and po4 3 the ratio of nh4 n and total dissolved phosphorus tdp was frequently used to trace the origin of groundwater nh4 n and p bedford et al 1999 slomp and van cappellen 2004 redfield et al 1963 studies have shown that po4 3 is considered to be the main p species in circumneutral groundwater mcarthur et al 2004 neidhardt et al 2018 if the nh4 n po4 p ratio is equal to the redfield ratio 16 1 then the dissolved p mainly comes from the decomposition of organic compounds containing p if the ratio is lower than 16 1 it indicates that there are other sources of p such as reductive dissolution of iron oxides with absorbed p tao et al 2020 2022 zhou et al 2022 in the early stage of our experiment 0 20 d when the release of p occurred the ph value was close to neutral around 7 8 therefore it could use the amount of po4 p to represent tdp the nh4 n p ratio is far below 16 1 fig 8 which usually around 0 5 in the column outlet flow this clearly indicated that the release of p was mainly caused by passive dissolution induced by the reductive dissolution of fe oxides the p release pattern also supported this it showed po4 3 release was not significant until fe reduction initiated after 3 days followed by a gradual increase trend until it peaked around 19 days fig 2 the potential po4 3 absorption on newly formed secondary fe minerals was limited compared with released content during that period the main process to lower down the aqueous po4 3 is the precipitation of vivianite fe3 po4 2 h2o 8 borch fendorf 2007 neidhardt et al 2018 this was obvious in the column of 1000 mg l glucose due to the high content of fe release the si of vivianite was mostly above 0 with highest of 6 6 indicating that precipitation was more likely to occur leading to the decline of aqueous po4 3 fig 2 in contrast to po4 3 the nh4 n release pattern showed almost reaching peak at the beginning and remaining quite stable content until around 15 days although the fe reduction was not triggered in the first 3 days nh4 n almost reached peak the p origin discussed above indicated the decomposition of sediment om contributing to aqueous n and p was limited since sodium lactate or glucose provide the c source for microbial dissimilation reduction the cation exchange could play quite high role in releasing nh4 n the increase of nh4 due to cation exchange with na was reported in several cases carrey et al 2014 rysgaard et al 1999 seitzinger et al 1991 the cation exchange between na and nh4 n can be well explained in the batch experiment in the absence of exogenous om the microbial degradation of om and reductive dissolution of fe oxides was limited but nh4 still released to a certain extent fig 7 the significant decrease of na ca2 and mg2 content in the outlet water support the occurrence of cation exchange fig 9 there was no release of nh4 in the late stage indicating that the maximum release of nh4 had been reached in the early stage 0 20 d as well as the equilibrium state however cation exchange is not limited to replacing nh4 from sediments but also exchange with other components such as h ca2 etc huang et al 2011 which could explain na is still consumed even nh4 is under detection limit in the later stage feammox that reduces the concentration of nh4 n is less likely to occur because it is inhibited in systems containing excessive om burgin and hamilton 2007 the release pattern of nh4 n and po4 3 in the batch study was slightly different from the column study which showed more quickly to reach peak and decline this was possibly due to high liquid soil ratio favoring the redox desorption and re adsorption reactions the addition of c sources in the batch group showed the elevated nh4 n and po4 3 release while the controlled group without c addition exhibited much lower levels fig 7 the controlled group and group of 500 mg l sodium lactate showed quite low and stable nh4 n and po4 3 content after 20 days while the group of 500 mg l glucose showed this pattern after 30 days fig 7 the initial high amount of nh4 n and po4 3 release was accompanied with significant fe reduction and release fig 7 this indicated the nh4 n and po4 3 release was highly related to the fe reduction in the batch study the controlled group without c addition in the batch study gave insight on the relative contribution of reductive dissolution cation exchange or om decomposition on nh4 n and po4 3 release the aqueous fe was under detection and orp was high indicating that fe reduction did not occur in the controlled group in this scenario the nh4 n and po4 3 release should mainly due to the cation exchange and or desorption the cation exchange could help to release nh4 n carrey et al 2014 since absorbed nh4 was the main specie of nh4 in the sediment this release amount could be quite high in this batch study the ratio of cation exchange attribute to nh4 n release was roughly calculated to be around 23 nh4 n released in controlled group nh4 n released in c added group 0 33 1 46 the rest part of nh4 should be mainly from passive mobilization during reductive dissolution of fe oxides adsorbed inorganic p and fe bound inorganic p are main p specie in the sediment in this batch study the calculated ratio of desorption attribute to po4 3 was around 38 po4 3 released in controlled group po4 3 released in c added group 0 21 0 56 the rest part of po4 3 was also believed to be mainly from passive mobilization due to reductive fe dissolution in general cation exchange and release through reductive fe dissolution are the main processes for controlling nh4 n enrichment in aqueous solutions the reductive fe dissolution contributes mostly to po4 3 release while the precipitation of vivianite lowers down its level the decomposition of om containing n and p in sediments contributed limited part of the release of n and p the quite low and stable nh4 n and po4 3 content in the later stage of both batch and column study showed that the initial released nh4 n and po4 3 are re absorbed precipitated in the sediment although part of nh4 n and po4 3 are flushed out in the column study simpson and williams 1970 willett 1982 borch fendorf 2007 this newly distributed nh4 n and po4 3 in the sediment are reactive and susceptive to the environmental change simpson and williams 1970 willett 1982 and therefore may cause a risk of secondary contamination 4 2 the release of as fe and mn and its groundwater level affected by om reactive sediment pools and secondary precipitation similarly to the release of nh4 n and po4 3 as fe and mn were mobilized significantly at the early stage 0 20 d with the infiltration of glucose and sodium lactate followed by decline to relatively low level and remain stable fig 2 however they were more fluctuated at the early stage when input with higher so4 2 initial 10 mg l increased to 48 mg l in 38 days the stabled aqueous fe and mn were mobilized again to some extent while as remained at low concentration level the microbial consumption of c source is the engine for as fe and mn mobilization the toc consumption and bix index calculated from three dimensional fluorescence clearly indicated that the microbial process was persistent in the whole experiment period fig 2 s1 the bix generally showed an upward trend with its value most above 1 0 indicating that the strongly conducted microbial mineralization of om the high as is consistent with high level of proteins like component and low content of humus like component also support strong microbial mineralization fig s2 3 the variation of c source reactivity leads to the different extent of mobilization of as fe and mn even increase its content from 500 to 1000 mg l sodium lactate can only mobilize maximum fe of 2 07 mg l as of 7 56 µg l mn of 1 14 mg l similar to 500 mg l group femax 1 86 mg l asmax 21 55 µg l mnmax 1 14 mg l fig 2 to be comparable the 1000 mg l glucose cause around one order of magnitude higher mobilization femax 39 94 mg l asmax 42 29 µg l mnmax 9 21 mg l fig 2 this clearly indicated that glucose is more favorable for microbial activity on reductive dissolution of as bearing fe mn oxides hydroxides the improvement of om reactivity could significantly enhance the release of as fe and mn harvey et al 2002 wang et al 2019 the sediment mineral provided source and sink of as fe and mn controlling the amount could be released to aqueous and influencing the precipitated amount the reactivity of as bearing fe mn oxides hydroxides also determined the extent of as fe and mn mobilization with higher reactive one possess more elevated mobilization jia et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the aqueous as fe and mn were mainly derived from fe mn oxides combined species which were the main loss parts of sediment fe fig 3 most of them should be reductive dissolved and flushed out and part of them were precipitated into other forms of fe more fe mn oxides bound as fe and mn were consumed in group with 1000 mg l glucose which was consistent with quite higher aqueous as fe mn content figs 2 3 therefore the content and reactivity of fe mn oxides was one controlling factor to determine the release content of as fe mn along the flow path group with 1000 mg l glucose showed decreased trend of fe mn oxides bound fe and mn distribution while 1000 mg l sodium lactate was opposite this should be due to the variation of the extent of reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides and precipitation of secondary fe mn minerals the decline of as fe and mn was contributed by the precipitation of secondary fe mn minerals frequently known as siderite feco3 mackinawite fes and rhodochrosite mnco3 jia et al 2014 2018 li et al 2022 here in our study the si value above 0 frequently occurred indicating the possibility of precipitation of these minerals fig 2 this was also supported by the sediment analysis as well as its color change during the experiment with increase of so4 2 in inlet on 38th day the strong so4 2 reduction occurred leading to the formation of mackinawite fes this was evidenced by xrf results showed that the sulfur content in sediments increased significantly and the sulfurization degree was more significant near the inlet end tables 1 2 as well as the significant column clogging after 40th day also the change of original yellow brown to black color of the sediments showing the precipitation of fe minerals with reducing state together with the previous studies guo et al 2016 ying et al 2017 li et al 2022 we believed the precipitation of siderite mackinawite rhodochrosite were responsible for the decline of as fe and mn even with the continuous input of high om the mobilization of as fe and mn was not persistent the quick decline to low level indicating this contamination risk was controllable the precipitation of second fe mn minerals and re absorption processes helped to lower down this contamination however this risk was still hidden in this reactive secondary minerals when oxidizer like so4 2 perturbation occurred the fe and mn contamination deteriorates again 4 3 the risk of multiple contaminants release affected by groundwater flow condition and redox fluctuation the groundwater flow rate could also be an important reason influencing contaminants enrichment with same sediment cultured in batch study feng et al 2023 if normalize to same water sediment ratio in this column study the maximum as fe mn mobilized is 615 µg l 184 mg l and 134 mg l porosity of 0 375 sediment density of 1 215 g cm3 respectively refer to the supplementary materials for calculation this is just a simplified calculation the real case release may not reach this high but certainly reflect enhanced mobilization occurs this much enhanced mobilization could be partly due to the zero flow rate in batch study which should be more favorable for the enhancement of reducing condition and related reactions banzhaf and hebig 2016 the batch study could to some extent reflects the stagnant groundwater condition which was mostly reported in high as affected areas buschmann et al 2007 van geen et al 2008 jia et al 2014 2018 interestingly when re oxidize with so4 2 on 38th day the reducing condition was stimulated to release more fe and mn fig 2 at this third stage the fe reduction should be attributed by hs the product of so4 2 reduction guo et al 2016 jia et al 2017 the hs should be more reactive to reduce fe mn oxides than sodium lactate stimulated microbial reduction therefore causing elevated fe and mn release while no obvious effect on glucose group studies have shown that hs plays a key role in reducing fe oxides and promoting as release jia et al 2017 guo et al 2016 this process which is directly combined with microbial sulfate reduction exhibits rapid chemical reaction kinetics and is surface controlled through electron transfer kocar et al 2010 poulton et al 2004 sun et al 2016 no further enrichment of as nh4 n and po4 3 with the so4 2 addition was observed this indicated the release amount of them related to fe reduction is lower than the ones being re absorbed to precipitated reactive secondary minerals this so4 2 addition was simulating circumstance of the change of groundwater chemistry and redox condition which frequently occurred in strong interaction zone of surface water and groundwater like mar area hyporheic zone or regions affected by monsoon kulkarni et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 it is reported that the oxygen interception caused by groundwater level fluctuations in the mar project will lead to the precipitation of dissolved mn and fe in the reduction zone in the form of oxides farnsworth hering 2011 in the reductive aquifer where pyrite is distributed studies have shown that due to the oxidation of pyrite the injection of aerobic water results in a significant release of as fe so4 2 and h jones and pichler 2007 wallis et al 2011 sun et al 2020 the precipitation of second fe mn minerals and re absorption processes help to lower down this contamination however this risk is still hidden in the reactive secondary minerals when redox fluctuation or other redox sensitive component input occurs the trace element contamination could deteriorate again 4 4 microorganism s response to the infiltration reactive om and its impact on the mobilization of multiple contaminants in this study the addition of glucose and sodium lactate significantly increased the abundance of firmicutes and proteobacteria many studies have shown that firmicutes contain a large number of as resistant strains corsini et al 2010 therefore microorganism with this strain could survive in high as environment proteobacteria is a phylogenetic group prevails in fe iii reduction sediments lloyd 2003 some proteobacteria play an important role in promoting fe mn reduction and oxidation in the environment at the genus level a large proliferation of clostridium in both columns was observed especially in the glucose column clostridium is the main bacteria in glucose culture gounou et al 2010 parker et al 2018 su et al 2020 as well as being the most studied fermentation microorganism of reduced fe iii francis and dodge 1988 dobbin et al 1999 zhang et al 2019 enrichment culture studies have shown that fe iii is reduced much faster with glucose as an electron donor than with acetate or lactate gagen et al 2019 and a higher percentage of fe reduction in glucose compared to acetate or lactic acid lentini et al 2012 gagen et al 2019 this was consistent with this study fig 2 clostridium has been widely reported in as affected aquifers rowland et al 2007 héry et al 2010 liao et al 2011 clostridium isolated from the high as affected aquifer in the jianghan plain has been proven to have the ability to reduce as and fe jie et al 2017 clostridium can reduce soluble fe iii or amorphous fe hydrogen oxides and bind to doc to promote as migration deng et al 2018 qiao et al 2021 the presence of acid producing bacteria like acidobacteriales and acetanaerobacterium contributed to the decrease of ph the acidic environment favors the release of fe in glucose column in the sodium lactate column we found some bacteria e g brevundimonas candidatus koribacter that may be involved in the fe cycle and more sulfur reducing bacteria which are different from those in the glucose column brevundimonas has been identified as bacteria associated with as metabolism suggesting that they may play a critical role mobilizing as in this study herbel and fendorf 2006 cavalca et al 2010 desulfocapsa known could disproportionate intermediate sulfur species i e inorganic sulfur sulfite or thiosulfate was observed here dar et al 2007 finster et al 2013 indicating it may participate in sulfide reduction processes microbial sulfate reduction has a bidirectional effect on as behavior because sulfide production promotes the reduction as bearing fe mn oxides but also co precipitation of as burton et al 2014 guo et al 2016 this explains the elevated fe and mn but no effect on as release after more so4 2 was input at 38 days fig 2 microorganisms are the main driving force for c and s biogeochemical cycles madsen 2011 turan et al 2019 bilen and turan 2022 based on the functional predictions of out levels using the faprotax database chemoheterotrophy aerobic chemoheterotrophy s transformation degradation of aromatic compounds dark hydrogen oxidation and fermentation are prominent functional groups in groundwater fig 10 indicating that c and s metabolism are major functions in this study the s cycle was related to the increase of so4 2 concentration in the later stage which stimulated the growth of s reducing bacteria faprotax did not predict any as metabolic function this may due to only finished sediment was used for microorganism analysis the as metabolic function could be covered by s metabolic function which is the main process in the later stage 5 environmental implications in our previous work based on batch study exogenous om stimulated the release of as fe and mn followed by a decline contributed by secondary precipitation to low levels feng et al 2023 similar release pattern were also observed in this column study the as concentration in this study was similar with field groundwater however if same liquid solid ratio was normalized the maximum as fe and mn was one magnitude higher in batch study high liquid solid ratio and stagnant environment are favorable for the microbial dissimilation reduction therefore when the exogenous om is infiltrated in aquifer with low groundwater flow condition the risk of reductive dissolution release of as fe and mn could be high the quick flow rate could to some extent weaken the reducing environment and promote the contaminants dilution groundwater recharge containing reactive om could triggers a series of reactions in groundwater first triggered mobilization of multiple contaminants in groundwater could be observed followed by sequestration of contaminants due to precipitation and re adsorption recurrence of pollution responses to redox groundwater chemistry fluctuation is also possible fig 11 the low level of fe and mn in the later stage was stimulated to further mobilization by the re oxidization with so4 2 this showed that in the redox groundwater chemistry fluctuation zone the disappeared groundwater contamination could occur again due to the high reactivity of secondary minerals fig 11 these areas including hyporheic zone of river lake managed aquifer recharge zone or regions affected by monsoon kulkarni et al 2018 wallis et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 therefore we should pay attention to the perennial release of poisonous trace elements like as and mn as well as nutrients like n and p in those areas 6 conclusion the infiltration of reactive om could greatly affect the groundwater redox condition accompanied by a series of reactions including redox reactions mineral dissolution precipitation ion exchange and surface complexation significant release of nh4 n and po4 3 were both observed which shows elevated mobilization peaks in the initial stage 0 19 d and declines afterwards until shows quite low and stable content 20 37 d similar release pattern was found with as fe and mn however they were more fluctuated at the early stage when input with higher so4 2 initial 10 mg l increase to 48 mg l in 38th day the stabled aqueous fe and mn is to some extent mobilized again while as nh4 n and po4 3 remain unchanged with low level the passive mobilization via reductive fe dissolution together with cation exchange are the main processes controlling aqueous nh4 n enrichment the passive mobilization via reductive fe dissolution contributes mostly to p release and vivianite precipitation constrains its level the initial released nh4 n and po4 3 are eventually re absorbed precipitated in sediment the microbial consumption of c source is the engine for as fe and mn mobilization the sediment mineral provides source and sink of as fe and mn controlling the amount could stay in aqueous the decline of as fe and mn was due to the precipitation of secondary fe mn minerals like siderite feco3 mackinawite fes and rhodochrosite mnco3 supported by the dark transition of sediment color beginning on 9th day microorganism responsed to the infiltration reactive om and further worked on the mobilization of these multiple contaminants even with the continuous input of high amount of om the mobilization of as fe mn nh4 n and po4 3 is not persistent the decline to low level indicating this contamination risk is constrained the precipitation of secondary fe mn minerals and co precipitation re absorption processes help to lower down the contamination however this risk is still hidden in this reactive secondary minerals when redox groundwater chemistry fluctuates which frequently occurs in strong interaction zone of surface water and groundwater like mar area hyporheic zone or regions affected by monsoon the perennial release of trace elements and nutrients could come up again declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
