11900,one hundred and sixty six bacterial strains were isolated from a highly polluted location of adi ganga surface water sw n 144 groundwater gw n 22 system for their multi metal and antibiotic resistance study a bod 5 of 45 mg l and orp of 368 mv with faecal coliform contamination 1800 100 ml was noted for sw along with elevated levels of zn 228 μg l and mn 396 μg l however no faecal coliform could be detected in gw sample multi metal tolerance was observed to be a common property among the strains isolated resistance to seven or more heavy metals was prevalent among 70 of the sw bacterial population remaining 30 comprised isolates from both sw and gw resistant to 2 6 metals bacterial resistance to metals was highest for pb followed by cr mo ni hg cd as cu co zn muti antibiotic resistance profiling indicated very high resistance towards ampicillin chloramphenicol aerosporin and streptomycin whereas the population was considerably sensitive to ciprofloxacin and gentamycin high mar index of 0 8 sw and 0 3 gw is a threat to the health of mankind and a possible indication of origin of multidrug resistant bacterial infections correlation in heavy metal and antibiotic resistance suggested their natural co selection acquisition of such genetic elements by disease causing pathogenic microbes might confer resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics contamination of gw with such multi metal and antibiotic resistant strains may spread the resistance property to human microflora graphical abstract image 1 keywords adi ganga antibiotic resistance cluster analysis mar index multi metal resistance nearby groundwater 1 introduction the emerging population of world has created immense pressure on land use which demands more of land space to establish newer communities migration of rural populations into urban areas also demands land space for settlements abia et al 2018 often these populations create informal settlements beside the river banks eventually encroaching the river flow besides rivers throughout the world have acted as open dumping sites where many a times the municipal wastes are being discharged untreated due to large population size and low socioeconomic status govender et al 2011 di cesare et al 2016 rivers have also been the largest recipients of domestic refuse as well as industrial effluents as a result the water bodies become heavily polluted which adversely impact the ecophysiological characteristic of the rivers worldwide many river water quality have been impacted by the uncontrolled waste disposal and overuse as in the sw sw of addis ababa ethiopia alemayehu 2001 yellow river and heihe river basin in china liu and xia 2004 qi and luo 2007 upper colorado river basin in the western united states meko et al 2007 kano river basin in northern nigeria ahmad and haie 2018 etc similar decaying of a river stream adi ganga in the city of kolkata west bengal india has been recently reported ghosh et al 2019 adi ganga was once the main flow of river hooghly during 15th to 17th century which has eventually dried up due to rapid urbanization channel bank encroachment disposal of raw sewage domestic wastes municipal wastes slaughterhouse and crematory wastes poor management of anthropogenic solid wastes and above all lack of maintenance i e irregular dredging of the canal das et al 2015 ghosh et al 2019 that the sw quality of this canal with respect to important water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen turbidity total hardness alkalinity biological oxygen demand oil and grease and zinc is terminally degraded has been reported by ghosh et al 2019 no other study has been systematically done to estimate the impact of the water pollution of this large open canal flowing through the heart of the city kolkata organic wastes domestic refuse untreated sewage and xenobiotics such as unused pharmaceuticals and personal care products drugs metabolites illicit drugs and transformation products have been noted to act as very good nutritional sources for microbial populations and contribute to the development of resistant genes fatta kassinos et al 2011 uncontrolled and prolonged garbage dissemination of both physical and chemical nature hosts many disease causing organisms and microbial communities that bear resistance properties to various xenobiotics common among those are antibiotic and heavy metal resistance co occurrence of which have been frequently reported kimiran erdem et al 2015 matyar et al 2013 icgen and yilmaz 2014 moreover use of antibiotics in livestock feed to increase their life expectancy is increasing day by day matyar et al 2014 besides industrial effluents add excess of heavy metals to sws throughout the world prabu 2009 zhang et al 2011 sws have been considered to be the potential hot spots where heavy metal and antibiotic resistant bacteria evolve ichen and yilmaz 2014 members of aeromonas citrobacter enterococcus vibrio etc have been found to co select multiple antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes mondragon et al 2011 matyar et al 2013 he et al 2016 horizontal gene transfer is one of the very popular routes through which bacteria share their resistance properties across communities resulting in evolved microbial populations capable of adapting to the harsh environment mandal et al 2016 like that of the present heavily polluted adi ganga sws are considered to be the major transmitters of pollutants to groundwater gw through geological fractures stanford and ward 1993 alemayehu 2001 ghosh et al 2019 freshwater resources are becoming fewer with increasing population pressure and thus gw from the aquifers situated beside such heavily polluted canal might also be at threat which needs urgent monitoring significant degradation of the physico chemical water quality of the gw in the adjoining aquifers of adi ganga has only been reported by ghosh et al 2019 recently however response of the bacterial populations inhabiting such heavily polluted canal and adjoining gw to various anthropogenic stresses remains underexplored till date no hydrogeomicrobial investigation has been carried out to monitor the extent of microbial adaptation to the heavy metal and antibiotic contamination of this canal neither any study has been conducted to decipher whether these microbes cause any cross contamination into the adjoining aquifers the sw sometimes and the gw from adjoining aquifers to a major extent are regularly used by the locales for their domestic use therefore monitoring of the microbiolocal parameters of the groundwater presence of antibiotic resistant bacterial populations which might pose serious health threats such as severe systemic infections and multi drug resistance seiler and berendonk 2012 to the population stands imperative several studies have reported groundwater quality degradation as a consequence of surface water contamination abundance of antibiotic resistance genes have been reported in groundwater near a municipal solid waste landfill chen et al 2017 industrial and other human activities have been found to degrade the physicochemical quality of surface and groundwater of aceh province mariana et al 2021 total and faecal coliforms have also been found in a sw gw quality profiling study sasakova et al 2018 bacterial resistance to heavy metals and antibiotics and their co selection have been repeatedly reported in various contaminated sites cesare et al 2015 wang et al 2021 the purpose of the present study is therefore to analyse the microbial impact on polluted adi ganga sw and consequently on the adjoining gw indicator bacterial test resistance profiling against several heavy metals and broad spectrum antibiotics and their statistical analysis have been carried out for the sw gw samples to understand the effect of sw pollution on the adjoining gw sources the study shall be helpful in biomonitoring the environmental condition of such a highly polluted water body and possible contamination of the aquifer around additionally the study also establishes a correlation in the multi metal and multi antibiotic resistance mar patterns in the bacterial populations recovered which can further act as bioindicators for heavy metal or antibiotic contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection study area a highly contaminated area of adi ganga at tollygunge south kolkata gps location 22 28 55 829 n 88 20 45 938 e was identified based on the physical characteristics of the sw and visual evidences of garbage deposition for sample collection fig 1 supplementary fig 1 the reason for this location to be selected for the study of bacterial multi antibiotic and heavy metal resistance were i presence of

were recovered and characterized following their enrichment and growth in luria bertani lb medium and minimal salt medium ghosh and sar 2013 under aerobic condition at 30 c spread plate technique was used to isolate the microbes from one hundred μl of each of the two serially diluted samples isolation of bacterial populations from both the samples was based on enrichment of the agar medium with filter sterilized adi ganga wastewater followed by incubation at 30 c for 7 days a total of one hundred and sixty five morphologically distinct colonies were picked up from both the samples the isolates were purified by sub culturing on lb plates and finally stocked in 15 glycerol 80 c bacterial isolates obtained from adi ganga sw or gw were designated as ag or gw respectively followed by h or c denoting heterotrophic or chemolithotrophic mode of isolation along with their strain numbers suffixed indicator bacterial analysis for total and faecal coliforms was performed for both sw and gw samples according to who 2011 guidelines maximum probable number of total coliforms was analysed by multiple tube fermentation method with 5 tubes each for 1 1 10 1 and 10 2 dilutions of the respective samples inoculated in double strength ds and single strength ss lactose broth with inverted durham s tubes the tubes were incubated for 24 48 h at 37 c and checked for growth and gas formation completing the presumptive test further confirmatory test was performed by reinoculating the growth culture in a 3 ml lactose broth to check for gas production following this peptone water was inoculated with the respective samples in duplicates and incubating them for 18 h at 37 c production of indole was confirmed by adding 0 1 ml kovac s reagent for pink coloured ring formation completed test was performed by agar streak method on m endo agar occurrence of metallic sheen upon growth at 37 c was checked for the confirmation of presence of thermotolerant e coli faecal coliforms who 2011 2 6 heavy metal tolerance study multiple metal resistance was tested for all the 165 isolates against 10 different salts of heavy metal ions i e pb2 mo2 cd2 zn2 cu2 ni2 as3 co2 hg2 cr6 maximum tolerable concentrations mtc for each metal were determined by agar dilution method sarkar et al 2013 graded concentrations for each element i e pb cd co and cr 1 5 mm cu 2 15 mm zn 1 7 5 mm mo 5 20 mm ni 0 5 5 mm as 2 5 10 mm hg 0 01 0 1 mm were used for mtc determination of individual isolates the gradients of concentrations used in this study were considered after detailed literature study sabry et al 1997 sarkar et al 2013 lb agar plates supplemented with graded concentrations of each metal salt were inoculated aseptically with the each bacterial isolate obtained from sw and gw followed by incubation for 36 48 h at 37 c 2 7 antibiotic resistance profiling resistance against six broad spectrum antibiotics with different modes of action i e ampicillin streptomycin aerosporine chloramphenicol ciprofloxacin and gentamycin were tested for all 165 isolates graded concentrations of each of the antibiotics in the range of 5 60 μg l were supplemented to lb agar plates followed by inoculation with pure cultures of the isolates and incubation for 24 h at 37 c the concentration range of the broad spectrum antibiotics were selected based on the observations of chitanand et al 2010 and olalemi et al 2019 where the mar of coliforms has been investigated minimum inhibitory concentration mic of a particular antibiotic for the population was the lowest concentration of the antibiotic that inhibited the growth of 50 for mic50 or 90 for mic90 of the population mar index for each isolate was calculated using the formula mar a b where a represents the number of antibiotics to which the resistance phenotype is depicted by the test isolate and b represents the total number of antibiotics to which the test isolate has been subjected for susceptibility krumperman 1983 sandhu et al 2016 2 8 statistical analysis the response of heavy metal tolerance study and the antibiotic susceptibility tests on the bacterial populations recovered from surface as well as gw was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis based on unweighted paired group mean arithmatic analysis upgma and principal component analysis pca to understand if there is any linkage in the resistance or tolerance properties in the bacterial populations the statistical analysis was performed using the software mvsp 3 21 3 results 3 1 sample details the sw collected visually appeared to be greyish black in colour stinking with pungent smell and highly polluted with urban debris the gw collected was however clear and regularly used for household consumption the physicochemical parameters of both the sw and gw along with their recommended limits for drinking as well as irrigational purposes have been enlisted in table 1 the physical parameters like ph electrical conductivity temperature turbidity and tds of both surface and ground water were found to be well within the standard irrigation and drinking water limits according to is 10 500 who 2004 the bod5 obtained for sw i e 45 mg l is almost 7 5 fold higher than that defined for drinking purpose who 2004 the cod value obtained i e 760 mg l is also higher than the irrigational standard and 70 fold higher than the drinking standard value the hardness of the sw and the alkalinity of both surface and ground water is found to be much higher than the limit defined by is 10 500 2012 http cgwb gov in documents wq standards pdf guideline the other physic chemical parameters like cl f so4 2and no3 2 values of collected surface and ground water are within standard limits for both irrigation and drinking purpose however concentration of po4 3 anion of the sw was found to be 3 times higher than the drinking standard but that of the gw was much below the who standard value i e 0 1 mg l as mentioned by choudhary et al 2014 heavy metal analysis of both sw and gw indicated that the concentration of as ni co cu se cd and cr were well within the recommended drinking and irrigational limits who 2004 https oaktrust library tamu edu bitstream handle 1969 1 87829 pdf 94 pdf sequence 1 isallowed y however metals like zn and mn showed their preponderance in sw sample while gw sample contained high levels of mn i e 355 μg l noticeably zn contamination found in adi ganga sw 228 μg l was well within the irrigational limit but it was 22 times greater than that recommended for drinking purpose however mn contamination found in both the samples was 2 and 1 5 fold higher with respect to the irrigational limit whereas 4 and 3 5 times higher than the potable limit for sw and gw respectively the sw and gw parameters showed statistically significant i e p 0 05 positive correlation value of 0 4307 with p uncorrected 0 0402 among each other 3 2 enrichment of bacterial isolates heterotrophic enrichment of bacterial isolates both from sw and gw revealed a higher abundance than that in chemolithotrophic enrichment amendment of the heterotrophic media plates with filter sterilized adi ganga water revealed its nutritive role as heterotrophic growth was found to be possible only when the enrichment was done with the above mentioned supplementation total bacterial count of sw on lb agar medium showed 11 1012 colony forming units cfu whereas that from gw revealed a total cfu of 3 107 however chemolithotrophic enrichment on minimal salt medium showed 104 fold lesser count for sw yielding around 3 7 109 cfu groundwater showed no growth upon chemolithotrophic enrichment the bacterial strains thus isolated were named as agh i e adi ganga heterotrophic agc adi ganga chemolithotrophic and gwh groundwater heterotrophic respectively followed by arabic numerals according to their serial during isolation a total of 166 morphologically distinct isolates i e 131 heterotrophic and 13 chemoautotrophic isolates from sw and 22 heterotrophic isolates from gw were selected to study their heavy metal tolerance and antibiotic resistance properties multiple tube fermentation test for identification of the presence of total and faecal coliforms in the sw and gw samples resulted in gas formation in all the tubes of sw whereas no such observation was found for gw in any of the tubes gas formation in all the five tubes of three dilutions of sw indicated a maximum probable number of 1800 coliforms per 100 ml of sw who 2011 further confirmation of gas production in lactose broth formation of pink coloured ring upon addition of kovac s reagent and production of metallic sheen by the streak culture on m endo agar confirmed presence of faecal coliforms in sw supplementary fig 2 the gw was found to be free from faecal coliform contamination as none of the indicator tests turned true for gw sample 3 3 heavy metal tolerance studies tolerance of the bacterial isolates obtained from the contaminated sw and gw of adjoining area against 10 heavy metals pb2 mo2 cd2 zn2 cu2 ni2 as3 co2 hg2 cr6 was investigated the response of the bacterial population recovered as shown in supplementary fig 3 revealed that the resistance property was well spread among the isolates the overall response of the agh agc and gwh isolates were converted to their survival percent against increasing concentrations of the metals fig 2 a it was noted that the heterotrophic bacterial populations both from adi ganga sw and those isolated from gw revealed similar trend of resistance towards pb 1 2 5 mm mo 5 15 mm ni 1 2 5 mm as 2 5 5 mm hg 0 01 0 1 mm co 1 mm and cr 1 2 5 mm the chemolithotrophic bacterial isolates also showed high resistance towards pb mo cd ni hg and cr however resistance towards cd zn and cu was pronounced in strains isolated from adi ganga both heterotrophically and chemoautotrophically rather than those indigenous to gw no resistance moreover the gwh strains lost their resistance property at higher concentrations of the metals provided whereas 10 20 of the agh and or agc isolates still survived at such high concentrations the survival percent response towards the provided heavy metals at their initial concentrations indicated that the toxicity of metals increased in the order pb cr mo ni hg cd as cu co zn further a pie chart prepared on the basis of the number of heavy metals towards which a bacterial strain was resistant revealed that a major percentage 25 16 of the bacteria showed multi heavy metal resistance property fig 2b only 4 of the strains all belonging to agh type were deca resistant r i e resistant to all 10 metals provided the percentage of bacteria showing various resistance properties are as follows deca r 4 nona r 25 octa r 22 hepta r 19 hexa r 16 penta r 9 tetra r 3 tri r 0 6 and di r 0 6 strains of varying combinations of resistance patterns interestingly deca to hepta resistance property solely belonged to strains isolated from adi ganga sw groundwater isolates could depict hexa penta and tetra resistance properties only to understand the linkage in the sensitivity towards the heavy metals the multi heavy metal resistance pattern was plotted the pattern predominating in a particular resistant type was considered to understand the linkage fig 3 the resistant types showed significant percentage values from nona r to tetra r 25 3 therefore these patterns were considered for further analysis resistance to zn in nona r types was found to be linked with co inocta r types conclusively the linkage was in the following sequence zn nona r zn co octa r zn co as zn cu cd hepta r zn cu cd co zn cd as co hexa r zn cd cu as co hepta r zn cd cu as co hg tetra r finally the maximum tolerance values of the population for each metal were calculated based on the response towards individual concentrations of each metal a particular concentration at which at least 50 of the population survived was considered to be the mtc value for that particular population it was found that pb mo ni and cr showed an mtc value of 2 5 mm 20 mm 2 5 mm and 2 5 mm respectively for overall population as well as the agh agc and gwh populations supplementary table 1 mtc values for cd and cu was found to be 2 5 mm for both overall populations and the agh population but it declined for agc and gwh populations agc population showed an mtc value of 1 mm for cd and was sensitive to 2 5 mm of cu whereas agh population was sensitive to both cd and cu at 1 and 2 5 mm respectively for toxic element as the overall population tolerated 2 5 mm of as out of which the agh population was found to reveal higher tolerance till 5 mm whereas gwh could bear only 2 5 mm however agc population was sensitive to 2 5 mm of as conversely the isolates obtained from adi ganga i e both agh and agc were sensitive to co at a concentration of 1 mm whereas those isolated from groundwater 57 showed an mtc value of 1 mm interestingly the overall bacterial population revealed an mtc value of 0 1 mm against hg an element generally known to be bactericidal or bacteristatic in nature noticeably 60 of agh populations could easily withstand 0 1 mm however mtc values for agc and gwh populations decreased to 0 05 mm and 0 01 mm respectively 3 4 antibiotic resistance profile of the isolates the bacterial strains isolated were also subjected to broad spectrum antibiotic susceptibility tests to decipher the antibiotic resistance profile of the population various broad spectrum antibiotics such as cell wall inhibitor ampicillin cell membrane inhibitor aerosporine polymixin b protein synthesis inhibitor streptomycin gentamycin and chloramphenicol and dna synthesis inhibitor ciprofloxacin fluoroquinolones were used for the antibiotic susceptibility test the concentration range for each antibiotic was from 5 to 60 μg l respectively the antibacterial response profile against each antibiotic for individual response at the lowest concentration has been provided in supplementary fig 2 the bacterial population 72 was found to be highly resistant to ampicillin even at the highest concentration used i e 60 μg l table 2 both mic50 and mic90 was found to be above the highest concentration 60 μg l used in the study supplementary table 2 resistance towards chloramphenicol was found to be reduced i e only 8 of the isolate survived at the highest concentration and 53 survived at 30 mm therefore the mic50 for chlomphenicol was found to be at 30 mm whereas mic90 was 60 mm further the antibiotic susceptibility of the total population increased in the order aerosporin streptomycin gentamycin ciprofloxacin with mic50 mic90 values at 30 60 15 60 5 30 and 5 15 mm respectively supplementary table 2 depending on the antimicrobial susceptibility response of the isolates obtained from sw and ground water mar index were calculated and have been presented in table 3 among the 144 isolates obtained from sw 28 and 26 of the isolates depicted mar index of 0 3 and 0 5 respectively another 10 and 2 of the sw population even showed a mar index as high as 0 7 and 0 8 on the contrary only 10 of the gw isolates revealed a maximum mar index of 0 3 whereas a high number of isolates covering 76 of the gw population obtained showed a mar index value of 76 remaining 14 of the isolates were found to be susceptible 3 5 bacterial multi heavy metal and multi antibiotic resistance to find relatedness or dependency in the heavy metal and antibiotic resistance properties the response of the isolates were categorized according to the number of antibiotics to which they were resistant in each deca resistant to tetra resistant resistance to heavy isolates supplementary table 3 among the few deca resistant isolates none of them were found to possess resistance to all the six antibiotics used 29 of them individually revealed resistance to chloramphenicol ampicillin streptomycin and aerosporin and another 29 were resistant to the above antibiotics except streptomycin a maximum of 43 isolates were found to be resistant to ampicillin and aerosporin only heavy metal nona resistant isolates even did not show any penta antibiotic resistance however 17 of the isolates were associated with resistance to ampicillin chloramphenicol streptomycin gentamycin and aerosporin tetra antibiotic resistance followed by a combination of three antibiotics out of the above five except gentamycin for 32 of the strain 29 and 15 were resistant to a combination of any two or one antibiotics out of the six studied except ciprofloxacin and 7 were found to be sensitive however penta antibiotic resistance was found in 3 5 and 10 of octa hexa and penta heavy metal resistant isolates respectively the tri and di antibiotic resistance towards chloramphenicol ampicillin and aerosporin was found to be the most prevalent characteristic in the multi heavy metal resistant isolates i eocta hepta hexa and penta resistant strains resistance towards four different antibiotics was a phenomenon that occurred less frequently and followed the order chloramphenicol ampicillin aerosporin and streptomycin gentamycin ciprofloxacin among the 21 gw isolates obtained resistance to cr mo ni and hg was prominent 100 100 95 and 90 of the gw pollution was found to be resistant to initial concentrations of each metal respectively followed by as and co 67 and 57 however 81 of these isolates were resistant only towards ampicillin and rest showed resistance towards aerosporin 3 6 statistical interpretation unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analysis based on the tolerance response of the bacterial population towards various heavy metals and antibiotics was performed individually for isolates obtained from sw and gw another upgma based dendrogram was plotted depending on the cumulative response of the total population to understand the linkage among the resistance or tolerance properties of antibiotics and the heavy metal contaminants of the adi ganga canal fig 4 the cluster analysis in all the three cases divided the antibiotics and heavy metals against which the tolerance was tested in two broad and major clades for sw isolates relatedness was found among co zn and aerosporine gentamycin and streptomycin another clade related the bacterial response towards as cu cd hg ni mo cr pb and ampicillin and chloramphenicol fig 4a for gw isolates relatedness was found for ampicillin resistance with tolerance to co as ni hg cr mo and pb on the other hand the other clade depicted relatedness among resistance towards aerosporine gentamycin ciprofloxacin streptomycin and chloramphenicol with that of cd cu and zn fig 4b based on overall response it was found that resistance property for ampicillin was highly linked with tolerance to as cu cd hg ni mo cr and pb the other clade revealed linkage in tolerance property towards co and zn with gentamycin ciprofloxacin streptomycin aerosporin and ampicillin resistance phenotype fig 4c a principal component analysis based on the resistance tolerance response of the isolates clearly located the majority of isolates obtained from sw in a zone indicated by brown triangles surrounded by a brown oval different from those isolated from gw indicated by blue triangles surrounded by a blue oval fig 5 the pca explains a cumulative percent variance of 67 a percent variance value above 50 indicates that the data points are very much spread out from the mean and are relatively independent and unrelated from one another the euclidean biplot also shows the relatedness of the parameters among themselves and are coherent to the observations from cluster analysis resistance to chloramphenicol is found to be related to tolerance towards cu cd hg cr ni pb resistance to streptomycin aerosporin and ampicillin are highly linked to tolerance to as and co zn and mo show minimal relatedness to any other parameters tested whereas gentamycin and ciprofloxacin cluster together and show a distant relation to streptomycin co and as tolerance 4 discussion characterization of the water quality parameters of adi ganga sw and adjoining gw revealed important insights regarding an open polluted water body system which might have long term negative environmental impacts the orp value of the open sw was found to be extremely low i e 368 mv which indicates that the water is extremely deficient of dissolved oxygen this observation is further supported by the fact that this highly polluted canal has extremely low do value i e 0 81 mg l this clearly indicates that there is little dissolved oxygen present in the water to support aquatic life i e fish or crustaceans which respire utilizing the dissolved oxygen within the water microbes usually use the dissolved oxygen for respiration degrading the organic matter available in the base of the water bodies but due to uncontrolled dissemination of organic matter from various sources higher rates of decomposition of these organic matter utilizes the available dissolved oxygen till it gets exhausted consequently creating an unusually high bod value of around 45 mg l and a cod value of 760 mg l a similar trend of cod has been reported by kazi et al 2009 for sw collected from mancharlake pakistan the gw parameters like temperature ph tds orp do alkalinity and hardness were in well agreement with the values found for gw samples studied from assam taiwan and usa lin et al 2006 sharif et al 2008 verma et al 2015 however the electrical conductivity of the gw was much higher than that of the sw but was found to be within the permissible limits the conductivity of water sample indicates its ionic strength and degree of ionic mineralization i e the conductivity of the water is affected by the presence of dissolved inorganic solids such as dissolved anions and cations increase in alkalinity and the presence of elevated concentrations of heavy metals sechriest et al 1960 naudet et al 2004 mishra et al 2014 the presence of high concentration of phosphate and chloride ions above permissible limits in the sw might be due to domestic wastage and agricultural sources such as potash fertilizers etc the presence of the cremation ground nearby study area might contribute to high phosphate concentrations along with organic c addition due to disposal of fly ash and unburnt flesh kaur and mehra 2011 organic material from flesh and vegetable wastes might also be contributed by the informal markets settled along the bank of the river for a considerably long stretch in the study area bacterial decomposition of these organic materials might lead to the further lowering of redox potential of the water of these areas the heavy metal analysis has however revealed concentrations of as ni co cu se cd and cr to be within permissible limits but unusually high concentrations of zn and mn higher than the drinking water permissible limits are found in sw as well as gw respectively high concentration of zn and mn might have important implications as it is generally known to be contributed by metal containing fertilizers sewage sludge and liquid manure zn is also used as a nutritional additive in animal feed for fish production and livestock farming seiler and berendonk 2012 zinc concentration was also found to be the highest in khosk river water in shiraz southwest iran which has been considered to be contributed anthropogenically salati and moore 2010 predominance of heterotrophic bacterial population over chemoautotrophic bacteria indicates a high disposition towards organic carbon decomposition in the adi ganga aquatic system enrichment of the heterotrophic bacteria with filter sterilized adi ganga sw revealed that the sw essentially played a nutritive role in growth of heterotrophs both from surface as well as gw interestingly a few number of chemoautotrophs could be isolated only from adi ganga sw indicating that the waste water harboured inorganic electron donors and c sources supporting aerobic chemoautotrophic growth however no such chemoautotrophic bacterial population could be retrieved from gw source faecal contamination of the adi ganga sw was evident from the multiple tube fermentation test the load of faecal coliforms in the sw was extremely high i e 1800 coliforms 100 ml indicating poor household sanitation practices and excessive untreated sewerage disposal however the faecal coliform contamination was not found in the gw sample from adjoining area of the river rendering the water microbiologically safe very high faecal contamination of canal water and shallow groundwaters adjoining the area have already been found in an urban river kokolo canal jerusalem river in democratic republic of congo kayembe et al 2018 a study at the nanded godavari river indicated faecal contamination in the range of 540 92 103 cfu per 100 ml chitanand et al 2010 another study by jurado et al 2019 reported faecal contamination in urban surface water of besòs river delta spain however similar to our observations faecal indicator organisms could not be detected in the groundwater and was thought to be naturally attenuated when river water infiltrates the aquifer system although mixing of physicochemical parameters imparted due to infiltration and dissolution of solutes from surface to aquifer water is possible survival of surface water microbial species in aquifer environment seems to be limited due to change in the availability of nutrition oxygen concentrations temperature and other crucial parameters required for microbial sustenance groundwater samples collected from river groundwater interfaces are being repeatedly reported to bear human specific adenoviruses although faecal contamination is not detected at times haramoto and nishida 2011 jurado et al 2019 therefore groundwater must be checked for presence of such viruses or other human specific pathogens before allowing it for human consumption the heavy metal tolerance study indicates that the tolerance property is well spread among the bacterial population isolated from the adi ganga aquifer system the isolates obtained from the polluted canal were found to reveal higher or more pronounced tolerance towards all the heavy metals considered in this study this might be due to the undefined contamination of the canal water from non point sources previous studies have demonstrated contamination with heavy metals such as as cd pb and hg through anthropogenic sources such as disposal of animal feed and sewage fertilizers etc yu et al 2017 bampidis et al 2013 importantly this is of major concern that most of the bacterial population recovered revealed multi metal tolerance i e they were highly resistant to five to nine metals out of ten studied sabry et al 1997 characterized the multi metal tolerance property of the bacterial population recovered from sea water and found only 2 47 6 17 11 11 25 9 and 16 to be octa r to tetra r in contrast bacterial isolates recovered from adi ganga aquifer system show around ten fold higher nona and octa resistance approx 3 and 1 5 fold higher hepta and hexa resistance resistance whereas 2 5 fold lower penta resistance such high multi metal resistance may co select various other antimicrobial resistance properties as co selection is a well studied phenomenon reported earlier baker austin et al 2006 yu et al 2017 very high resistance towards pb cr mo and ni were evident from their tolerance response similar observations have been reported by sabry et al 1997 bacterial survival response towards the well known bactericidal agent hg was found to be very high for adi ganga isolates i e the mtc lies beyond 0 1 mm a concentration found to inhibit growth of bacterial population in several previous studies nieto et al 1989 riley and taylor 1989 sabry et al 1997 however bacterial population recovered from gw was also found to possess hg resistance which could resist 0 01 mm to a considerable extent such high resistance to pb and hg might be contributed by the wastes disposed by a vermillion factory although located at a distance from the banks yet is in close vicinity of the study area as pb and hg forms the main constituent of vermillion several other studies have reported even higher hg resistance to 40 mg l to 75 mg l shiratori et al 1989 de et al 2003 many studies have already reported that bacterial hg resistance is associated with resistance to other microbial agents by virtue of carrying plasmids or transposons encoding common resistance genetic markers barbieri et al 1996 von canstein et al 1999 de souza et al 2006 further bacterial resistance was found to decrease in the order cd as cu co zn presence of cattle sheds along the bank of the sw in the study area and consequent uncontrolled deposition of livestock wastes and nutritiveadditions might contribute in the elevated levels of metals like zn mn etc seiler and berendonk 2012 similar response towards cd resistance has been reported by de souza et al 2006 lower resistance towards as cu and co can be attributed to low concentration of these elements in the sw however considerably high concentration of zn could be detected in sw yet bacterial resistance towards zn was found to be very low this might be due to reduction in bioavailability of zn due to complex formation with organic matter forstner and wittman 1979 or complexation with antibiotics available in the waste water from human sewage or direct deposition poole 2017 metal toxicity has been found to be directly related to the environmental conditions since the prevailing redox controls metal speciation and thus complex formation with biological molecules prevalence of negative redox condition in the canal and enrichment of heterotrophic bacteria indicating huge organic carbon degradation leads to further reduction in do which reduces the solubility of zn and thus zn becomes less bioavailable schulz zunkel and krueger 2009 therefore in spite of high concentrations of zn in the sw samples the bacterial population was found to be majorly sensitive to high concentrations of this metal the sensitivity pattern of the multi metal resistant bacterial population derived the possible linkage in the resistance properties towards various metals sensitivity to zn was found to be consequently linked to co cu cd as and hg the gene product of czrc has been well documented to act as an efflux pump for zn cd as well as co presumably absence of which causes linked sensitivity to these elements few other studies have also demonstrated positive correlation among zn and cu resistance calomiris et al 1984 and zn cd and hg resistance timoney et al 1978 indicating possible co selection of resistance towards these elements although direct correlation of zn and as resistance has not been established yet reduction in permeability has been found to be a common mechanism shared by prokaryotes for as cu zn mn and co resistance baker austin et al 2006 various bacterial mechanism viz reduction in permeability drug and metal alteration efflux and sequestration as well as alteration of cellular targets are the common pathways involved in prokaryotic metal and antibiotic resistance these mechanisms have been reported to provide resistance to a wide variety of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin tetracycline chloramphenicol rifampicin as well as β lactams del castillo 1991 silver and phung 1996 bontidean et al 2000 levy 2002 mukhopadhyay and rosen 2002 barkay et al 2003 nies 2003 ruiz et al 2003 roberts 2005 wright 2005 the most predominant resistance was found against ampicillin chloramphenicol and aerosporin which might be attributed to contamination of the canal water with domestic sewage and persistence of these compounds at sub lethal concentrations al riyami et al 2018 pronounced resistance to ampicillin and chloramphenicol has also been reported by several studies earlier timoney et al 1978 de souza et al 2006 holzel et al 2012 a comparative resistance profile of bacterial strains isolated from various surface water and groundwater samples indicates that the antibiotic resistance response of strains isolated in this study corroborates well with the previous observations table 4 predominant bacterial resistance in both sw and gw was found against ampicillin and chloramphenicol which might be due to faecal contamination of the sw and possible transfer of genetic elements to groundwater microbes higher incidence of ampicillin chloramphenicol and streptomycin resistance have also been found in other aquatic environments corroborating our observations boon and cattanach 1999 ash et al 2002 cardonha et al 2004 titilawo et al 2014 chitanand et al 2010 mic data in supplementary table 2 indicated that the next effective antibiotic was found to be streptomycin followed by high sensitivity to gentamycin and ciprofloxacin sensitivity of bacterial population to gentamycin has also been reported in environmental isolates recovered from mhlathuze river kwazulu natal lin et al 2003 similar findings regarding resistance to aerosporine and streptomycin have been documented by sabry et al 1997 supplementary table 3 clearly defines that octa hexa and penta multimetal resistant isolates show very high mar property this co resistance to multi metal and multi antibiotic of the bacterial populations generally arise from cross resistance for co selection or co regulation baker austin et al 2006 noticeably the bacterial populations recovered from polluted canal are found to show mar index as high as 0 8 however those recovered from gw show considerably lower mar index of 0 3 yet it indicates that the mar property of these isolates also lie within high risk group the mar index has been considered to be a good tool for health risk assessment which identifies the exposure of isolates to high or low antibiotic use region where a mar index 0 2 indicates a high risk source of contamination davis and brown 2016 sandhu et al 2016 a high mar index in the range of 0 5 0 8 has been reported for faecal coliforms isolated from river water in osun state nigeria titilawo et al 2015 such high antibiotic resistance might occur due to the direct dissemination of faecal and urinary wastes into the canal which contain most of the antibiotic concentrations being taken by an individual kumar and pal 2017 the occurrence of such high mar indexed bacterial populations might lead to serious multi drug resistant bacterial infections which may cause rising difficulties in treatment of such infections alanis 2005 seiler and berendonk 2012 this along with multi metal bacterial resistance clearly indicates that there are possible leaky junctions in the aquifer system adjacent to the adi ganga canal where intermittent but slow mixing of solutes are possible chances statistical interpretations including correlation study and cluster analysis also establish the fact that there are possibilities that the gw aquifer system adjacent to polluted adi ganga might get contaminated eventually correlation study has shown significant positive correlation among gw and sw quality parameters implying the range of contaminants of adi ganga follow a similar pattern in the gw further fig 4c clearly shows that hierarchical cluster analysis clades the cumulative heavy metal and antibiotic resistance properties based on the response of total bacterial population in a way very similar to that of gw population this study further supports our previous findings of deterioration of gw quality due to uncontrolled pollution of adi ganga sw ghosh et al 2019 these bacterial populations and their resistance or tolerance properties might act as bioindicators of the level of contamination caused in the gw aquifer systems due to anthropogenic contamination of natural water bodies although faecal contamination of the groundwater has not been found yet infiltration of genetic materials such as plasmids or transposons into the aquifer system might spread horizontal gene transfer imparting high bacterial resistance to heavy metals as well as antibiotics mobile genetic elements plasmids transposons insertion sequences and integrons have been found to show strong positive correlation with antibiotic resistance genes hence these resistance properties can be mediated through microorganisms even in the absence of detectable concentrations of antibiotics chen et al 2017 upon human consumption these elements may further spread the resistance properties in human system gut and other exposed microbiome challenging available therapeutic options 4 1 mechanistic basis to approach analyse and manage the problem multi metal and multi antibiotic resistance is a real environmental threat as it reduces the efficacy of existing therapeutic options various factors contribute towards uncontrolled growth and spread of multi antibiotic resistance species which when eventually enters human body prove to be increasingly pathogenic factors like rampant usage of antibiotics use of disinfectants at sub lethal doses dissemination of sewer to natural sources without proper treatment usage of antibiotics in livestock feeds to increase commercial values etc have immensely contributed in evolution of antibiotic resistance genes kumar and pal 2017 in our present study multi antibiotic and metal resistance have been found in the isolated bacterial diversity with mar as high as 0 8 this indicates prolonged exposure to sub lethal concentrations of antibiotics and regular tolerance to heavy metals moreover the resistance pattern was also observed in the isolates obtained from gw although no faecal contamination could be identified in gw as found in sw this essentially indicates that the multimetal and antibiotic resistance has been acquired horizontally through extrachromosomal inheritance one of the mechanistic approach to analyse this problem is through thorough detection of antibiotic resistance genes args prevailing in the sw and gw this environmental threat must be controlled by taking several precautionary measures such as regulating the rampant use of antibiotics at sub lethal doses chanellising the sewer of the city through proper waste treatments and maintaining complete disinfection procedures as incomplete disinfection causes resurge of resistant strains reducing use of antibiotics in animal feedstock and regulating its use under the supervision of veterinary practitioner 5 conclusion the positive correlation among sw and gw parameters presence of innumerous faecal coliforms high mar index of the sw isolates and high resistance to toxic metals like pb and hg high concentrations of zn and mn in the sw evidently proves that the degradation of the water quality is due to anthropogenic activities moreover very high faecal contamination of sw is a clear sign of extremely poor sanitation practices availability of multi metal and multi antibiotic resistant bacterial population in aquifers is a serious threat to mankind since gw abstracted from these aquifers are still used for regular consumption genetic markers encoding multi resistance properties are generally transferred horizontally among bacterial populations chen et al 2017 which may get introduced into the human system through consumption of the contaminated aquifer gw this might pose a serious future challenge as prolonged dissemination of these genetic markers may confer multidrug resistance to the human microflora difficult to be treated with existing antimicrobial agents as an effective intervention strategy the groundwater in these region must be uv sterilized before human consumption so as to destroy any resistant bacteria or genetic element encoding metal antibiotic resistance immediate reformative actions must be taken to stop unsanitized faecal discharge unhindered disposal of crematory livestock and industrial wastes into the sw and treatments of domestic and sewage disposals are required to minimize further contamination and restore gw quality further studies including genomic footprints to detect multimetal and antibiotic resistant species and human specific pathogens and viruses shall help to determine the signature bacterial and viral communities and their infiltration in the aquifer systems moreover physical and biochemical treatment of the contaminated sw can be implemented to save further gw contamination as well as to use the sw for economy promoting activities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

11900,one hundred and sixty six bacterial strains were isolated from a highly polluted location of adi ganga surface water sw n 144 groundwater gw n 22 system for their multi metal and antibiotic resistance study a bod 5 of 45 mg l and orp of 368 mv with faecal coliform contamination 1800 100 ml was noted for sw along with elevated levels of zn 228 μg l and mn 396 μg l however no faecal

antibiotic resistance profiling indicated very high resistance towards ampicillin chloramphenicol aerosporin and streptomycin whereas the population was considerably sensitive to ciprofloxacin and gentamycin high mar index of 0 8 sw and 0 3 gw is a threat to the health of mankind and a possible indication of origin of multidrug resistant bacterial infections correlation in heavy metal and antibiotic resistance suggested their natural co selection acquisition of such genetic elements by disease causing pathogenic microbes might confer resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics

cluster analysis mar index multi metal resistance nearby groundwater 1 introduction the emerging population of world has created immense pressure on land use which demands more of land space to establish newer communities migration of rural populations into urban areas also demands land space for settlements abia et al 2018 often these populations create informal settlements beside the river banks eventually encroaching the river flow besides rivers throughout the world have acted as open dumping sites where many a times the municipal wastes are being discharged untreated due to large population size and low socioeconomic status govender et al 2011 di cesare et al 2016 rivers have also been the largest recipients of domestic refuse as well as industrial effluents as a result the water bodies become heavily polluted which adversely impact the ecophysiological characteristic of the rivers worldwide many river water quality have been impacted by the uncontrolled waste disposal and overuse as in the sw sw of addis ababa ethiopia alemayehu 2001 yellow river and heihe river basin in china liu and xia 2004 qi and luo 2007 upper colorado river basin in the western united states meko et al 2007 kano river basin in northern nigeria ahmad and haie 2018 etc similar decaying of a river stream adi ganga in the city of kolkata west bengal india has been recently reported ghosh et al 2019 adi ganga was once the main flow of river hooghly during 15th to 17th century which has eventually dried up due to rapid urbanization channel bank encroachment disposal of raw sewage domestic wastes municipal wastes slaughterhouse and crematory wastes poor management of anthropogenic solid wastes and above all lack of maintenance i e irregular dredging of the canal das et al 2015 ghosh et al 2019 that the sw quality of this canal with respect to important water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen turbidity total hardness alkalinity biological oxygen demand oil and grease and zinc is terminally degraded has been reported by ghosh et al 2019 no other study has been systematically done to estimate the impact of the water pollution of this large open canal flowing through the heart of the city kolkata organic wastes domestic refuse untreated sewage and xenobiotics such as unused pharmaceuticals and personal care products drugs metabolites illicit drugs and transformation products have been noted to act as very good nutritional sources for microbial populations and contribute to the development of resistant genes fatta kassinos et al 2011 uncontrolled and prolonged garbage dissemination of both physical and chemical nature hosts many disease causing organisms and microbial communities that bear resistance properties to various xenobiotics common among those are antibiotic and heavy metal resistance co occurrence of which have been frequently reported kimiran erdem et al 2015 matyar et al 2013 icgen and yilmaz 2014 moreover use of antibiotics in livestock feed to increase their life expectancy is increasing day by day matyar et al 2014 besides industrial effluents add excess of heavy metals to sws throughout the world prabu 2009 zhang et al 2011 sws have been considered to be the potential hot spots where heavy metal and antibiotic resistant bacteria evolve ichen and yilmaz 2014 members of aeromonas citrobacter enterococcus vibrio etc have been found to co select multiple antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes mondragon et al 2011 matyar et al 2013 he et al 2016 horizontal gene transfer is one of the very popular routes through which bacteria share their resistance properties across communities resulting in evolved microbial populations capable of adapting to the harsh environment mandal et al 2016 like that of the present heavily polluted adi ganga sws are considered to be the major transmitters of pollutants to groundwater gw through geological fractures stanford and ward 1993 alemayehu 2001 ghosh et al 2019 freshwater resources are becoming fewer with increasing population pressure and thus gw from the aquifers situated beside such heavily polluted canal might also be at threat which needs urgent monitoring significant degradation of the physico chemical water quality of the gw in the adjoining aquifers of adi ganga has only been reported by ghosh et al 2019 recently however response of the bacterial populations inhabiting such heavily polluted canal and adjoining gw to various anthropogenic stresses remains underexplored till date no hydrogeomicrobial investigation has been carried out to monitor the extent of microbial adaptation to the heavy metal and antibiotic contamination of this canal neither any study has been conducted to decipher whether these microbes cause any cross contamination into the adjoining aquifers the sw sometimes and the gw from adjoining aquifers to a major extent are regularly used by the locales for their domestic use therefore monitoring of the microbiolocal parameters of the groundwater presence of antibiotic resistant bacterial populations which might pose serious health threats such as severe systemic infections and multi drug resistance seiler and berendonk 2012 to the population stands imperative several studies have reported groundwater quality degradation as a consequence of surface water contamination abundance of antibiotic resistance genes have been reported in groundwater near a municipal solid waste landfill chen et al 2017 industrial and other human activities have been found to degrade the physicochemical quality of surface and groundwater of aceh province mariana et al 2021 total and faecal coliforms have also been found in a sw gw quality profiling study sasakova et al 2018 bacterial resistance to heavy metals and antibiotics and their co selection have been repeatedly reported in various contaminated sites cesare et al 2015 wang et al 2021 the purpose of the present study is therefore to analyse the microbial impact on polluted adi ganga sw and consequently on the adjoining gw indicator bacterial test resistance profiling against several heavy metals and broad spectrum antibiotics and their statistical analysis have been carried out for the sw gw samples to understand the effect of sw pollution on the adjoining gw sources the study shall be helpful in biomonitoring the environmental condition of such a highly polluted water body and possible contamination of the aquifer around additionally the study also establishes a correlation in the multi metal and multi antibiotic resistance mar patterns in the bacterial populations recovered which can further act as bioindicators for heavy metal or antibiotic contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection study area a

were recovered and characterized following their enrichment and growth in luria bertani lb medium and minimal salt medium ghosh and sar 2013 under aerobic condition at 30 c spread plate technique was used to isolate the microbes from one hundred μl of each of the two serially diluted samples isolation of bacterial populations from both the samples was based on enrichment of the agar medium with filter sterilized adi ganga wastewater followed by incubation at 30 c for 7 days a total of one hundred and sixty five morphologically distinct colonies were picked up from both the samples the isolates were purified by sub culturing on lb plates and finally stocked in 15 glycerol 80 c bacterial isolates obtained from adi ganga sw or gw were designated as ag or gw respectively followed by h or c denoting heterotrophic or chemolithotrophic mode of isolation along with their strain numbers suffixed indicator bacterial analysis for total and faecal coliforms was performed for both sw and gw samples according to who 2011 guidelines maximum probable number of total coliforms was analysed by multiple tube fermentation method with 5 tubes each for 1 1 10 1 and 10 2 dilutions of the respective samples inoculated in double strength ds and single strength ss lactose broth with inverted durham s tubes the tubes were incubated for 24 48 h at 37 c and checked for growth and gas formation completing the presumptive test further confirmatory test was performed by reinoculating the growth culture in a 3 ml lactose broth to check for gas production following this peptone water was inoculated with the respective samples in duplicates and incubating them for 18 h at 37 c production of indole was confirmed by adding 0 1 ml kovac s reagent for pink coloured ring formation

literature study sabry et al 1997 sarkar et al 2013 lb agar plates supplemented with graded concentrations of each metal salt were inoculated aseptically with the each bacterial isolate obtained from sw and gw followed by incubation for 36 48 h at 37 c 2 7 antibiotic resistance profiling resistance against six broad spectrum antibiotics with different modes of action i e ampicillin streptomycin aerosporine chloramphenicol ciprofloxacin and gentamycin were tested for all 165 isolates graded concentrations of each of the antibiotics in the range of 5 60 μg l were supplemented to lb agar plates followed by inoculation with pure cultures of the isolates and incubation for 24 h at 37 c the concentration range of the broad spectrum antibiotics were selected based on the observations of chitanand et al 2010 and olalemi et al 2019 where the mar of coliforms has been investigated minimum inhibitory concentration mic of a particular antibiotic for the population was the lowest concentration of the antibiotic that inhibited the growth of 50 for mic50 or 90 for mic90 of the population mar index for each isolate was calculated using the formula mar a b where a represents the number of antibiotics to which the resistance phenotype is depicted by the test isolate and b represents the total number of antibiotics to which the test isolate has been subjected for susceptibility krumperman 1983 sandhu et al 2016 2 8 statistical analysis the response of heavy metal tolerance study and the antibiotic susceptibility tests on the bacterial populations recovered from surface as well as gw was subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis based on unweighted paired group mean arithmatic analysis upgma and principal component analysis pca to understand if there is any linkage in the resistance or tolerance properties in the bacterial populations the statistical analysis was performed using the software mvsp 3 21 3 results 3 1 sample details the sw collected visually appeared to be greyish black in colour stinking with pungent smell and highly polluted with urban debris the gw collected was however clear and regularly used for household consumption the physicochemical parameters of both the sw and gw along with their recommended limits for drinking as well as irrigational purposes have been enlisted in table 1 the physical parameters like ph electrical conductivity temperature turbidity and tds of both surface and ground water were found to be well within the standard irrigation and drinking water limits according to is 10 500 who 2004 the bod5 obtained for sw i e 45 mg l is almost 7 5 fold higher than that defined for drinking purpose who 2004 the cod value obtained i e 760 mg l is also higher than the irrigational standard and 70 fold higher than the drinking standard value the hardness of the sw and the alkalinity of both surface and ground water is found to be much higher than the limit defined by is 10 500 2012 http cgwb gov in documents wq

355 μg l noticeably zn contamination found in adi ganga sw 228 μg l was well within the irrigational limit but it was 22 times greater than that recommended for drinking purpose however mn contamination found in both the samples was 2 and 1 5 fold higher with respect to the irrigational limit whereas 4 and 3 5 times higher than the potable limit for sw and gw respectively the sw and gw parameters showed statistically significant i e p 0 05 positive correlation value of 0 4307 with p uncorrected 0 0402 among each other 3 2 enrichment of bacterial isolates heterotrophic enrichment of bacterial isolates both from sw and gw revealed a higher abundance than that in chemolithotrophic enrichment amendment of the heterotrophic media plates with filter sterilized adi ganga water revealed its nutritive role as heterotrophic growth was found to be possible only when the enrichment was done with the above mentioned supplementation total bacterial count of sw on lb agar medium showed 11 1012 colony forming units cfu whereas that from gw revealed a total cfu of 3 107 however chemolithotrophic enrichment on minimal salt medium showed 104 fold lesser count for sw yielding around 3 7 109 cfu groundwater showed no growth upon chemolithotrophic enrichment the bacterial strains thus isolated were named as agh i e adi ganga heterotrophic agc adi ganga chemolithotrophic and gwh groundwater heterotrophic respectively followed by arabic numerals according to their serial during isolation a total of 166 morphologically distinct isolates i e 131 heterotrophic and 13 chemoautotrophic isolates from sw and 22 heterotrophic isolates from gw were selected to study their heavy metal tolerance and antibiotic resistance properties multiple tube fermentation test for identification of the presence of total and faecal coliforms in the sw and gw samples resulted in gas formation in all the tubes of sw whereas no such observation was found for gw in any of the tubes gas formation in all the five tubes of three dilutions of sw indicated a maximum probable number of 1800 coliforms per 100 ml of sw who 2011 further confirmation of gas production in lactose broth formation of pink coloured ring upon addition of kovac s reagent and production of metallic sheen by the streak culture on m endo agar confirmed presence of faecal coliforms in sw supplementary fig 2 the gw was found to be free from faecal coliform contamination as none of the indicator tests turned true for gw sample 3 3 heavy metal tolerance studies tolerance of the bacterial isolates obtained from the contaminated sw and gw of adjoining area against 10 heavy metals pb2 mo2 cd2 zn2 cu2 ni2 as3 co2 hg2 cr6 was investigated the response of the bacterial population recovered as shown in supplementary fig 3 revealed that the resistance property was well spread among the isolates the overall response of the agh agc and gwh isolates were converted to their survival percent against increasing concentrations of the metals fig 2 a it was noted that the heterotrophic bacterial populations both from adi ganga sw and those isolated from gw revealed similar trend of resistance towards pb 1 2 5 mm mo 5 15 mm ni 1 2 5 mm as 2 5 5 mm hg 0 01 0 1 mm co 1 mm and cr 1 2 5 mm the chemolithotrophic bacterial isolates also showed high resistance towards pb mo cd ni hg and cr however resistance towards cd zn and cu was pronounced in strains isolated from adi ganga both heterotrophically and chemoautotrophically rather than those indigenous to gw no resistance moreover the gwh strains lost their resistance property at higher concentrations of the metals provided whereas 10 20 of the agh and or agc isolates still survived at such high concentrations the survival percent response towards the provided heavy metals at their initial concentrations indicated that the toxicity of metals increased in the order pb cr mo ni hg cd as cu co zn further a pie chart prepared on the basis of the number of heavy metals towards which a bacterial strain was resistant revealed that a major percentage 25 16 of the bacteria showed multi heavy metal resistance property fig 2b only 4 of the strains all belonging to agh type were deca resistant r i e resistant to all 10 metals provided the percentage of bacteria showing various resistance properties are as follows deca r 4 nona r 25 octa r 22 hepta r 19 hexa r 16 penta r 9 tetra r 3 tri r 0 6 and di r 0 6 strains of varying combinations of resistance patterns interestingly deca to hepta resistance property solely belonged to strains isolated from adi ganga sw groundwater isolates could depict hexa penta and tetra resistance properties only to understand the linkage in the sensitivity towards the heavy metals the multi heavy metal resistance pattern was plotted the pattern predominating in a particular resistant type was considered to understand the linkage fig 3 the resistant types showed significant percentage values from nona r to tetra r 25 3 therefore these patterns were considered for further analysis resistance to zn in nona r types was found to be linked with co inocta r types conclusively the linkage was in the following sequence zn nona r zn co octa r zn co as zn cu cd hepta r zn cu cd co zn cd as co hexa r zn cd cu as co hepta r zn cd cu as co hg tetra r finally the maximum tolerance values of the population for each metal were calculated based on the response towards individual concentrations of each metal a particular concentration at which at least 50 of the population survived was considered to be the mtc value for that particular population it was found that pb mo ni and cr showed an mtc value of 2 5 mm 20 mm 2 5 mm and 2 5 mm respectively for overall population as well as the agh agc and gwh populations supplementary table 1 mtc values for cd and cu was found to be 2 5 mm for both overall populations and the agh population but it declined for agc and gwh populations agc population showed an mtc value of 1 mm for cd and was sensitive to 2 5 mm of cu whereas agh population was sensitive to both cd and cu at 1 and 2 5 mm respectively for toxic element as the overall population tolerated 2 5 mm of as out of which the agh population was found to reveal higher tolerance till 5 mm whereas gwh could bear only 2 5 mm however agc population was sensitive to 2 5 mm of as conversely the isolates obtained from adi ganga i e both agh and agc were sensitive to co at a concentration of 1 mm whereas those isolated from groundwater 57 showed an mtc value of 1 mm interestingly the overall bacterial population revealed an mtc value of 0 1 mm against hg an element generally known to be bactericidal or bacteristatic in nature noticeably 60 of agh populations could easily withstand 0 1 mm however mtc values for agc and gwh populations decreased to 0 05 mm and 0 01 mm respectively 3 4 antibiotic resistance profile of the isolates the bacterial strains isolated were also subjected to broad spectrum antibiotic susceptibility tests to decipher the antibiotic resistance profile of the population various broad spectrum antibiotics such as cell wall inhibitor ampicillin cell membrane inhibitor aerosporine polymixin b protein synthesis inhibitor streptomycin gentamycin and chloramphenicol and dna synthesis inhibitor ciprofloxacin fluoroquinolones were used for the antibiotic susceptibility test the concentration range for each antibiotic was from 5 to 60 μg l respectively the antibacterial response profile against each antibiotic for individual response at the lowest concentration has been provided in supplementary fig 2 the bacterial population 72 was found to be highly resistant to ampicillin even at the highest concentration used i e 60 μg l table 2 both mic50 and mic90 was found to be above the highest concentration 60 μg l used in the study supplementary table 2 resistance towards chloramphenicol was found to be reduced i e only 8 of the isolate survived at the highest concentration and 53 survived at 30 mm therefore the mic50 for chlomphenicol was found to be at 30 mm whereas mic90 was 60 mm further the antibiotic susceptibility of the total population increased in the order aerosporin streptomycin gentamycin ciprofloxacin with mic50 mic90 values at 30 60 15 60 5 30 and 5 15 mm respectively supplementary table 2 depending on the antimicrobial susceptibility response of the isolates obtained from sw and ground water mar index were calculated and have been presented in table 3 among the 144 isolates obtained from sw 28 and 26 of the isolates depicted mar index of 0 3 and 0 5 respectively another 10 and 2 of the sw population even showed a mar index as high as 0 7 and 0 8 on the contrary only 10 of the gw isolates revealed a maximum mar index of 0 3 whereas a high number of isolates covering 76 of the gw population obtained showed a mar index value of 76 remaining 14 of the isolates were found to be susceptible 3 5 bacterial multi heavy metal and multi antibiotic resistance to find relatedness or dependency in the heavy metal and antibiotic resistance properties the response of the isolates were categorized according to the number of antibiotics to which they were resistant in each deca resistant to tetra resistant resistance to heavy isolates supplementary table 3 among the few deca resistant isolates none of them were found to possess resistance to all the six antibiotics used 29 of them individually revealed resistance to chloramphenicol ampicillin streptomycin and aerosporin and another 29 were resistant to the above antibiotics except streptomycin a maximum of 43 isolates were found to be resistant to ampicillin and aerosporin only heavy metal nona resistant isolates even did not show any penta antibiotic resistance however 17 of the isolates were associated with resistance to ampicillin chloramphenicol streptomycin gentamycin and aerosporin tetra antibiotic resistance followed by a combination of three antibiotics out of the above five except gentamycin for 32 of the strain 29 and 15 were resistant to a combination of any two or one antibiotics out of the six studied except ciprofloxacin and 7 were found to be sensitive however penta antibiotic resistance was found in 3 5 and 10 of octa hexa and penta heavy metal resistant isolates respectively the tri and di antibiotic resistance towards chloramphenicol ampicillin and aerosporin was found to be the most prevalent characteristic in the multi heavy metal resistant isolates i eocta hepta hexa and penta resistant strains resistance towards four different antibiotics was a phenomenon that occurred less frequently and followed the order chloramphenicol ampicillin aerosporin and streptomycin gentamycin ciprofloxacin among the 21 gw isolates obtained resistance to cr mo ni and hg was prominent 100 100 95 and 90 of the gw pollution was found to be resistant to initial concentrations of each metal respectively followed by as and co 67 and 57 however 81 of these isolates were resistant only towards ampicillin and rest showed resistance towards aerosporin 3 6 statistical interpretation unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analysis based on the tolerance response of the bacterial population towards various heavy metals and antibiotics was performed individually for isolates obtained from sw and gw another upgma based dendrogram was plotted depending on the cumulative response of the total population to understand the linkage among the resistance or tolerance properties of antibiotics and the heavy metal contaminants of the adi ganga canal fig 4 the cluster analysis in all the three cases divided the antibiotics and heavy metals against which the tolerance was tested in two broad and major clades for sw isolates relatedness was found among co zn and aerosporine gentamycin and streptomycin another clade related the bacterial response towards as cu cd hg ni mo cr pb and ampicillin and chloramphenicol fig 4a for gw isolates relatedness was found for ampicillin resistance with tolerance to co as ni hg cr mo and pb on the other hand the other clade depicted relatedness among resistance towards aerosporine gentamycin ciprofloxacin streptomycin and chloramphenicol with that of cd cu and zn fig 4b based on overall response it was found that resistance property for ampicillin was highly linked with tolerance to as cu cd hg ni mo cr and pb the other clade revealed linkage in tolerance property towards co and zn with gentamycin ciprofloxacin streptomycin aerosporin and ampicillin resistance phenotype fig 4c a principal component analysis based on the resistance tolerance response of the isolates clearly located the majority of isolates obtained from sw in a zone indicated by brown triangles surrounded by a brown oval different from those isolated from gw indicated by blue triangles surrounded by a blue oval fig 5 the pca explains a cumulative percent variance of 67 a percent variance value above 50 indicates that the data points are very much spread out from the mean and are relatively independent and unrelated from one another the euclidean biplot also shows the relatedness of the parameters among themselves and are coherent to the observations from cluster analysis resistance to chloramphenicol is found to be related to tolerance towards cu cd hg cr ni pb resistance to streptomycin aerosporin and ampicillin are highly linked to tolerance to as and co zn and mo show minimal relatedness to any other parameters tested whereas gentamycin and ciprofloxacin cluster together and show a distant relation to streptomycin co and as tolerance 4 discussion characterization of the water quality parameters of adi ganga sw and adjoining gw revealed important insights regarding an open polluted water body system which might have long term negative environmental impacts the orp value of the open sw was found to be extremely low i e 368 mv which indicates that the water is extremely deficient of dissolved oxygen this observation is further supported by the fact that this highly polluted canal has extremely low do value i e 0 81 mg l this clearly indicates that there is little dissolved oxygen present in the water to support aquatic life i e fish or crustaceans which respire utilizing the dissolved oxygen within the water microbes usually use the dissolved oxygen for respiration degrading the organic matter available in the base of the water bodies but due to uncontrolled dissemination of organic matter from various sources higher rates of decomposition of these organic matter utilizes the available dissolved oxygen till it gets exhausted consequently creating an unusually high bod value of around 45 mg l and a cod value of 760 mg l a similar trend of cod has been reported by kazi et al 2009 for sw collected from mancharlake pakistan the gw parameters like temperature ph tds orp do alkalinity and hardness were in well agreement with the values found for gw samples studied from assam taiwan and usa lin et al 2006 sharif et al 2008 verma et al 2015 however the electrical conductivity of the gw was much higher than that of the sw but was found to be within the permissible limits the conductivity of water sample indicates its ionic strength and degree of ionic mineralization i e the conductivity of the water is affected by the presence of dissolved inorganic solids such as dissolved anions and cations increase in alkalinity and the presence of elevated concentrations of heavy metals sechriest et al 1960 naudet et al 2004 mishra et al 2014 the presence of high concentration of phosphate and chloride ions above permissible limits in the sw might be due to domestic wastage and agricultural sources such as potash fertilizers etc the presence of the cremation ground nearby study area might contribute to high phosphate concentrations along with organic c addition due to disposal of fly ash and unburnt flesh kaur and mehra 2011 organic material from flesh and vegetable wastes might also be contributed by the informal markets settled along the bank of the river for a considerably long stretch in the study area bacterial decomposition of these organic materials might lead to the further lowering of redox potential of the water of these areas the heavy metal analysis has however revealed concentrations of as ni co cu se cd and cr to be within permissible limits but unusually high concentrations of zn and mn higher than the drinking water permissible limits are found in sw as well as gw respectively high concentration of zn and mn might have important implications as it is generally known to be contributed by metal containing fertilizers sewage sludge and liquid manure zn is also used as a nutritional additive in animal feed for fish production and livestock farming seiler and berendonk 2012 zinc concentration was also found to be the highest in khosk river water in shiraz southwest iran which has been considered to be contributed anthropogenically salati and moore 2010 predominance of heterotrophic bacterial population over chemoautotrophic bacteria indicates a high disposition towards organic carbon decomposition in the adi ganga aquatic system enrichment of the heterotrophic bacteria with filter sterilized adi ganga sw revealed that the sw essentially played a nutritive role in growth of heterotrophs both from surface as well as gw interestingly a few number of chemoautotrophs could be isolated only from adi ganga sw indicating that the waste water harboured inorganic electron donors and c sources supporting aerobic chemoautotrophic growth however no such chemoautotrophic bacterial population could be retrieved from gw source faecal contamination of the adi ganga sw was evident from the multiple tube fermentation test the load of faecal coliforms in the sw was extremely high i e 1800 coliforms 100 ml indicating poor household sanitation practices and excessive untreated sewerage disposal however the faecal coliform contamination was not found in the gw sample from adjoining area of the river rendering the water microbiologically safe very high faecal contamination of canal water and shallow groundwaters adjoining the area have already been found in an urban river kokolo canal jerusalem river in democratic republic of congo kayembe et al 2018 a study at the nanded godavari river indicated faecal contamination in the range of 540 92 103 cfu per 100 ml chitanand et al 2010 another study by jurado et al 2019 reported faecal contamination in urban surface water of besòs river delta spain however similar to our observations faecal indicator organisms could not be detected in the groundwater and was thought to be naturally attenuated when river water infiltrates the aquifer system although mixing of physicochemical parameters imparted due to infiltration and dissolution of solutes from surface to aquifer water is possible survival of surface water microbial species in aquifer environment seems to be limited due to change in the availability of nutrition oxygen concentrations temperature and other crucial parameters required for microbial sustenance groundwater samples collected from river groundwater interfaces are being repeatedly reported to bear human specific adenoviruses although faecal contamination is not detected at times haramoto and nishida 2011 jurado et al 2019 therefore groundwater must be checked for presence of such viruses or other human specific pathogens before allowing it for human consumption the heavy metal tolerance study indicates that the tolerance property is well spread among the bacterial population isolated from the adi ganga aquifer system the isolates obtained from the polluted canal were found to reveal higher or more pronounced tolerance towards all the heavy metals considered in this study this might be due to the undefined contamination of the canal water from non point sources previous studies have demonstrated contamination with heavy metals such as as cd pb and hg through anthropogenic sources such as disposal of animal feed and sewage fertilizers etc yu et al 2017 bampidis et al 2013 importantly this is of major concern that most of the bacterial population recovered revealed multi metal tolerance i e they were highly resistant to five to nine metals out of ten studied sabry et al 1997 characterized the multi metal tolerance property of the bacterial population recovered from sea water and found only 2 47 6 17 11 11 25 9 and 16 to be octa r to tetra r in contrast bacterial isolates recovered from adi ganga aquifer system show around ten fold higher nona and octa resistance approx 3 and 1 5 fold higher hepta and hexa resistance resistance whereas 2 5 fold lower penta resistance such high multi metal resistance may co select various other antimicrobial resistance properties as co selection is a well studied phenomenon reported earlier baker austin et al 2006 yu et al 2017 very high resistance towards pb cr mo and ni were evident from their tolerance response similar observations have been reported by sabry et al 1997 bacterial survival response towards the well known bactericidal agent hg was found to be very high for adi ganga isolates i e the mtc lies beyond 0 1 mm a concentration found to inhibit growth of bacterial population in several previous studies nieto et al 1989 riley and taylor 1989 sabry et al 1997 however bacterial population recovered from gw was also found to possess hg resistance which could resist 0 01 mm to a considerable extent such high resistance to pb and hg might be contributed by the wastes disposed by a vermillion factory although located at a distance from the banks yet is in close vicinity of the study area as pb and hg forms the main constituent of vermillion several other studies have reported even higher hg resistance to 40 mg l to 75 mg l shiratori et al 1989 de et al 2003 many studies have already reported that bacterial hg resistance is associated with resistance to other microbial agents by virtue of carrying plasmids or transposons encoding common resistance genetic markers barbieri et al 1996 von canstein et al 1999 de souza et al 2006 further bacterial resistance was found to decrease in the order cd as cu co zn presence of cattle sheds along the bank of the sw in the study area and consequent uncontrolled deposition of livestock wastes and nutritiveadditions might contribute in the elevated levels of metals like zn mn etc seiler and berendonk 2012 similar response towards cd resistance has been reported by de souza et al 2006 lower resistance towards as cu and co can be attributed to low concentration of these elements in the sw however considerably high concentration of zn could be detected in sw yet bacterial resistance towards zn was found to be very low this might be due to reduction in bioavailability of zn due to complex formation with organic matter forstner and wittman 1979 or complexation with antibiotics available in the waste water from human sewage or direct deposition poole 2017 metal toxicity has been found to be directly related to the environmental conditions since the prevailing redox controls metal speciation and thus complex formation with biological molecules prevalence of negative redox condition in the canal and enrichment of heterotrophic bacteria indicating huge organic carbon degradation leads to further reduction in do which reduces the solubility of zn and thus zn becomes less bioavailable schulz zunkel and krueger 2009 therefore in spite of high concentrations of zn in the sw samples the bacterial population was found to be majorly sensitive to high concentrations of this metal the sensitivity pattern of the multi metal resistant bacterial population derived the possible linkage in the resistance properties towards various metals sensitivity to zn was found to be consequently linked to co cu cd as and hg the gene product of czrc has been well documented to act as an efflux pump for zn cd as well as co presumably absence of which causes linked sensitivity to these elements few other studies have also demonstrated positive correlation among zn and cu resistance calomiris et al 1984 and zn cd and hg resistance timoney et al 1978 indicating possible co selection of resistance towards these elements although direct correlation of zn and as resistance has not been established yet reduction in permeability has been found to be a common mechanism shared by prokaryotes for as cu zn mn and co resistance baker austin et al 2006 various bacterial mechanism viz reduction in permeability drug and metal alteration efflux and sequestration as well as alteration of cellular targets are the common pathways involved in prokaryotic metal and antibiotic resistance these mechanisms have been reported to provide resistance to a wide variety of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin tetracycline chloramphenicol rifampicin as well as β lactams del castillo 1991 silver and phung 1996 bontidean et al 2000 levy 2002 mukhopadhyay and rosen 2002 barkay et al 2003 nies 2003 ruiz et al 2003 roberts 2005 wright 2005 the most predominant resistance was found against ampicillin chloramphenicol and aerosporin which might be attributed to contamination of the canal water with domestic sewage and persistence of these compounds at sub lethal concentrations al riyami et al 2018 pronounced resistance to ampicillin and chloramphenicol has also been reported by several studies earlier timoney et al 1978 de souza et al 2006 holzel et al 2012 a comparative resistance profile of bacterial strains isolated from various surface water and groundwater samples indicates that the antibiotic resistance response of strains isolated in this study corroborates well with the previous observations table 4 predominant bacterial resistance in both sw and gw was found against ampicillin and chloramphenicol which might be due to faecal contamination of the sw and possible transfer of genetic elements to groundwater microbes higher incidence of ampicillin chloramphenicol and streptomycin resistance have also been found in other aquatic environments corroborating our observations boon and cattanach 1999 ash et al 2002 cardonha et al 2004 titilawo et al 2014 chitanand et al 2010 mic data in supplementary table 2 indicated that the next effective antibiotic was found to be streptomycin followed by high sensitivity to gentamycin and ciprofloxacin sensitivity of bacterial population to gentamycin has also been reported in environmental isolates recovered from mhlathuze river kwazulu natal lin et al 2003 similar findings regarding resistance to aerosporine and streptomycin have been documented by sabry et al 1997 supplementary table 3 clearly defines that octa hexa and penta multimetal resistant isolates show very high mar property this co resistance to multi metal and multi antibiotic of the bacterial populations generally arise from cross resistance for co selection or co regulation baker austin et al 2006 noticeably the bacterial populations recovered from polluted canal are found to show mar index as high as 0 8 however those recovered from gw show considerably lower mar index of 0 3 yet it indicates that the mar property of these isolates also lie within high risk group the mar index has been considered to be a good tool for health risk assessment which identifies the exposure of isolates to high or low antibiotic use region where a mar index 0 2 indicates a high risk source of contamination davis and brown 2016 sandhu et al 2016 a high mar index in the range of 0 5 0 8 has been reported for faecal coliforms isolated from river water in osun state nigeria titilawo et al 2015 such high antibiotic resistance might occur due to the direct dissemination of faecal and urinary wastes into the canal which contain most of the antibiotic concentrations being taken by an individual kumar and pal 2017 the occurrence of such high mar indexed bacterial populations might lead to serious multi drug resistant bacterial infections which may cause rising difficulties in treatment of such infections alanis 2005 seiler and berendonk 2012 this along with multi metal bacterial resistance clearly indicates that there are possible leaky junctions in the aquifer system adjacent to the adi ganga canal where intermittent but slow mixing of solutes are possible chances statistical interpretations including correlation study and cluster analysis also establish the fact that there are possibilities that the gw aquifer system adjacent to polluted adi ganga might get contaminated eventually correlation study has shown significant positive correlation among gw and sw quality parameters implying the range of contaminants of adi ganga follow a similar pattern in the gw further fig 4c clearly shows that hierarchical cluster analysis clades the cumulative heavy metal and antibiotic resistance properties based on the response of total bacterial population in a way very similar to that of gw population this study further supports our previous findings of deterioration of gw quality due to uncontrolled pollution of adi ganga sw ghosh et al 2019 these bacterial populations and their resistance or tolerance properties might act as bioindicators of the level of contamination caused in the gw aquifer systems due to anthropogenic contamination of natural water bodies although faecal contamination of the groundwater has not been found yet infiltration of genetic materials such as plasmids or transposons into the aquifer system might spread horizontal gene transfer imparting high bacterial resistance to heavy metals as well as antibiotics mobile genetic elements plasmids transposons insertion sequences and integrons have been found to show strong positive correlation with antibiotic resistance genes hence these resistance properties can be mediated through microorganisms even in the absence of detectable concentrations of antibiotics chen et al 2017 upon human consumption these elements may further spread the resistance properties in human system gut and other exposed microbiome challenging available therapeutic options 4 1 mechanistic basis to approach analyse and manage the problem multi metal and multi antibiotic resistance is a real environmental threat as it reduces the efficacy of existing therapeutic options various factors contribute towards uncontrolled growth and spread of multi antibiotic resistance species which when eventually enters human body prove to be increasingly pathogenic factors like rampant usage of antibiotics use of disinfectants at sub lethal doses dissemination of sewer to natural sources without proper treatment usage of antibiotics in livestock feeds to increase commercial values etc have immensely contributed in evolution of antibiotic resistance genes kumar and pal 2017 in our present study multi antibiotic and metal resistance have been found in the isolated bacterial diversity with mar as high as 0 8 this indicates prolonged exposure to sub lethal concentrations of antibiotics and regular tolerance to heavy metals moreover the resistance pattern was also observed in the isolates obtained from gw although no faecal contamination could be identified in gw as found in sw this essentially indicates that the multimetal and antibiotic resistance has been acquired horizontally through extrachromosomal inheritance one of the mechanistic approach to analyse this problem is through thorough detection of antibiotic resistance genes args prevailing in the sw and gw this environmental threat must be controlled by taking several precautionary measures such as regulating the rampant use of antibiotics at sub lethal doses chanellising the sewer of the city through proper waste treatments and maintaining complete disinfection procedures as incomplete disinfection causes resurge of resistant strains reducing use of antibiotics in animal feedstock and regulating its use under the supervision of veterinary practitioner 5 conclusion the positive correlation among sw and gw parameters presence of innumerous faecal coliforms high mar index of the sw isolates and high resistance to toxic metals like pb and hg high concentrations of zn and mn in the sw evidently proves that the degradation of the water quality is due to anthropogenic activities moreover very high faecal contamination of sw is a clear sign of extremely poor sanitation practices availability of multi metal and multi antibiotic resistant bacterial population in aquifers is a serious threat to mankind since gw abstracted from these aquifers are still used for regular consumption genetic markers encoding multi resistance properties are generally transferred horizontally among bacterial populations chen et al 2017 which may get introduced into the human system through consumption of the contaminated aquifer gw this might pose a serious future challenge as prolonged dissemination of these genetic markers may confer multidrug resistance to the human microflora difficult to be treated with existing antimicrobial agents as an effective intervention strategy the groundwater in these region must be uv sterilized before human consumption so as to destroy any resistant bacteria or genetic element encoding metal antibiotic resistance immediate reformative actions must be taken to stop unsanitized faecal discharge unhindered disposal of crematory livestock and industrial wastes into the sw and treatments of domestic and sewage disposals are required to minimize further contamination and restore gw quality further studies including genomic footprints to detect multimetal and antibiotic resistant species and human specific pathogens and viruses shall help to determine the signature bacterial and viral communities and their infiltration in the aquifer systems moreover physical and biochemical treatment of the contaminated sw can be implemented to save further gw contamination as well as to use the sw for economy promoting activities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

11901,the contentious results of elevated as and cd levels in both sri lankan rice and in agrochemicals have recently raised tremendous attention these claims could not standalone due to the study s

for chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu risk assessment in addition analysis of these elements in water soil and agrochemicals was used to estimate their geochemical behavior the majority of agrochemicals and fertilizers had cd cr and pb grain cd contents in rice varieties were ranged from not detectable to 158 9 μg kg 1 in both cultivation seasons and soil was sought to be the primary cd source as se hg and pb were also not detectable in both rice grain and straws native variety pachcha perumal rice grain showed a low cd accumulation in both seasons at both regions kuruluthuda and

much research has been reported on heavy metal metalloid contamination in rice and soil and water to the best of our knowledge these have been reported for randomly collected samples only a few systematic scientific studies have been conducted to determine the intrusion of heavy metals through water soil and other sources agro chemicals and organic manure into the rice it is widely believed that trvs are better at resisting the absorption of heavy metals than nihrvs rascio et al 2008 a recent study reported that the as cd and pb contents in selected trvs kalu heenati pokkali gurusinghe wee kahawanu sudu murunga and unakola samba were below the limit of quantification loq pb 0 04 ppm as 0 02 ppm and cd 0 01 ppm kariyawasam et al 2016 the objective of this work is to study the influences of cultivation conditions a nature of the soil b irrigation water c agrochemicals and d seasonal variations yala and maha on the toxic element accumulation in different parts grain and straws of rice plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental locations paddy cultivation for the study was carried out in two locations fig 1 a one at rambewa in anuradhapura of ncp where high levels of heavy metals and ckdu has been reported for an extended period of time chandrajith et al 2011 jayasumana et al 2015b the other location was wilgoda in kurunegala of north western province nwp where ckdu etiology was not detected at the time of this study jayasekara et al 2015 the north central province land surface is spotted with man made reservoirs arranged in a cascade system with many micro and meso catchments bandara et al 2008 results from several previous investigations indicated high levels of toxic metals in the soil waters and rice cultivated in this region s rice paddies jayasumana et al 2015c therefore two nearby farms approximately 500 m apart were selected one has been used for organic cultivation and the other for conventional cultivation the experiment was conducted using a split plot design fig 1b where traditional rice varieties trv and newly improved hybrid varieties nihrv were grown each variety received a sub treatment with three replicates in a gross area of 11 m2 the design used a nested blocking structure with split plots nested within whole plots fig 1b and c ten rice varieties five traditional rice varieties trv namely suwandel madathawalu pachchaperumal kalu heeneti kuruluthuda and five new improved hybrid rice varieties nihrv namely bg 300 bg 352 bg 358 bg 360 and bg 366 were selected for the experiments the growth duration for all was in the range of three to three and half months the study was carried out under two farming conditions organic and fertilized presence of conventional agrochemicals at both yala and maha seasons at each location the department of agriculture doa recommended agrochemical and fertilizer management practices during the experimental period for the fertilized and conventional paddy fields organic farming was practiced in the absence of pesticides however organic manure compost and organic fertilizer were incorporated fig s1 natural pest control mechanisms water control repellent plants manual weed removal see supporting information fig s1 were employed for the organically cultivated paddy fields rice seeds for nihrvs and trvs were obtained from the rice research and development institute batalagoda sri lanka and a certified organic farm in kurunegala 2 2 sampling 2 2 1 sampling of soil and water at the beginning of the field experiments soil from the surface 0 20 cm and sub surface 20 40 cm were collected using a soil auger from the experimental sites since the water sources were different and there was no control over the flow of irrigation water to the paddy fields water sampling n 3 was carried out at one month intervals during growth samples were collected into polypropylene sampling bottles and preserved using ultra pure nitric acid ph 2 samples were stored in a cool box 4 c for transportation and then stored in the refrigerator until analysis 2 2 2 sampling and processing of rice paddy plant samples were collected at maturity rice plants were uprooted and different plant parts grains straws and roots were separated and oven dried at 85 c until reaching a constant weight the moisture content of each plant part was determined from the weight loss upon drying dried plant matter was ground using a wooden pestle and a mortar to obtain a homogeneous powder 2 2 3 digestion of samples the chemical reagents calibration standards matrix modifiers digestion acids and auxiliaries used were trace grade or ultra pure purchased from sigma aldrich fischer and inorganic ventures unless otherwise noted a 0 50 g portion of powdered samples from rice grains and straws were digested using microwave acid digestion mars 6 express and milestone ethos easy ultra pure hno3 hcl 9 ml 3 ml according to us epa 3052 method usepa 1995 wathudura et al 2019 digests were cooled and transferred to polypropylene vessels and brought into 25 00 ml with de ionized water usepa 1995 the same microwave acid digestion method was adopted for the digestion of soil and fertilizers however before digestion soil samples were air dried for approximately 96 h at 25 30 c and subsequently sieved through a 500 μm sieve to separate acid insoluble silica sand particles a 0 5 ml portion from each pesticide was used for digestion usepa 1995 a 20 00 ml portion of the water samples was heated on the hot plate with 9 ml of ultra pure conc hno3 to reduce the volume to 10 15 ml once cooled the samples were quantitatively dilution with de ionized water transferred to polypropylene vessels 25 00 ml international 2012 2 2 4 analysis of samples an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas hitachi za 3000 polarized zeeman background corrector was used for elemental analysis cd cr and pb concentrations were determined using optimized graphite furnace aas methods pyro coated graphite tubes were utilized with mg no3 2 and nh4h2po4 matrix modifiers for cd and pb respectively a 10 μl of each of these modifiers was injected into 20 μl samples before the analysis samples were injected into the graphite tube at a rate of 4 μl s 1 arsenic analysis was performed using the hydride generation method hitachi hfs 4 followed by the pre reduction of all arsenic species to as3 using 10 ascorbic acid and 20 potassium iodide the same procedure was employed for se but in the absence of ki as it can produce elemental se then arsenic selenium hydride was aspirated into the quartz tube with subsequent treatment with 5 hcl and 1 nabh4 mercury analysis was carried out using a cold vapor generation method sncl2 in hcl was used to reduce mercury ions to mercury atomic vapor at room temperature it was passed through the quartz absorption cell of the aas a crm was not available for water therefore spike recovery tests were carried out using a graphite furnace at a 15 tolerance limit commercially available 1000 mg l aas stock standard solutions were used to prepare calibration standards in a 10 ultra pure nitric acid hydrochloric acid 3 1 solution 2 2 5 determination of physicochemical parameters of water and soil water hardness electrical conductivity and ph were determined according to standard epa methods 130 2 120 1 and 9040 c respectively soil cation exchange capacity cec was determined using a modified ammonium acetate compulsory displacement method chapman 1965 peiris et al 2019 samples were washed with de ionized water five times before starting the cation extraction to reduce interference from soluble salts first a 20 0 ml portion of de ionized water was added to each 1 0 g sample of soil in a centrifuge tube next the tube was placed on a shaker and shaken at 180 rpm for 5 min the sample was vacuum filtered and the leachate was saved for further analysis after the fifth wash 10 ml of na acetate ph 7 buffer was added to the sample and the mixture was shaken for 10 min this process was repeated three times to ensure that exchange sites were saturated with sodium ions soil samples were then washed three times with ethanol to remove excess sodium ions finally sodium ions were displaced with nh4 acetate ph 7 three times and they are measured by faas chapman 1965 2 2 6 data analysis and statistical treatment data analysis and statistical treatment were performed using microsoft excel 2013 and spss 23 0 statistical analysis software in addition grubb s outlier test was carried out for outlier rejection 3 results and discussion 3 1 recovery tests with certified reference materials crm practical quantification limits pql s n 10 for se as hg cd pb and cr were found to be 15 μg kg 1 10 μg kg 1 10 μg kg 1 2 μg kg 1 5

elements in the agrochemicals used in paddy cultivation during the yala and maha seasons in kurunegala and anuradhapura arsenic and mercury were below the detection limits in all the agrochemicals studied elevated levels of cd 1 80 mg kg 1 and 3 44 mg kg 1 were detected in mop and tsp respectively organic fertilizers also contained substantial amounts of cd 0 44 mg kg 1 in organic fertilizer and 1 67 mg kg 1 in local compost from plant and animal manure heavy metals in bio solids may be found in inorganic or organically complex affecting their chemical reactions in the soil these heavy metals may accumulate in soil with repeated fertilizer applications mortvedt 1995 all five fertilizers analyzed were positive for the presence of cr mcpa and diamet diazinon had slightly elevated levels of cd 34 67 μg l 1 and 19 76 μg l 1 while in bispyribac sodium lower cd levels were detected 1 90 μg l 1 cr was also detected in all four pesticides and ranged from 10 30 μg l 1 to 179 14 μg l 1 the surfactant also contained low amounts of cd in the range of 0 09 0 15 μg l 1 arsenic content in agrochemicals used in the cultivation was below the limit of detection the control of pesticides act no 33 of 1980 designates authorized analyst where the rop can accept analytical results accordingly samples of 28 pesticide formulations were tested at the industrial technology institute iti of the ministry of technology and research sri lanka using a hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy only three of the tested pesticides glyphosate acid equivalent 360 g l ec carbofuran 3 g glyphosate acid equivalent 360 g l sl have been found to contain low quantities of arsenic 334 μg kg 1 166 μg kg 1 and 370 μg kg 1 respectively the arsenic contents of mcpa bispyribac sodium diamet diazinon and propanil pretilachlor were reported below their limit of quantification loq of 50 μg kg 1 wijesekara and marambe 2011 cd was present in all the fertilizers and pesticides however they were within the slsi maximum allowable limits 10 mg kg 1 according to the sri lankan department of agriculture standards the amount of tsp required for a 1 acre paddy field for a cultivation season is approximately 55 5 kg and the average tsp cd content in the present investigation was 1 8 mg kg 1 therefore if fertilizer application is restricted to this limit for 10 years only 2 g of cd will be added to the 1 acre paddy this will not lead to excessive pollution due to fertilizer use organic manure is widely thought to contain low concentrations of toxic elements therefore it can be used as an alternative to chemical fertilizers however according to the findings of this study organic manure contains significant amounts of cd cr and pb and they should be used with caution as fertilizers similar high heavy metal contents were reported in poultry waste manure 0 84 0 87 cd 54 4 54 6 cu 980 987 fe 5 26 5 92 pb and 308 328 zn mg kg sahito et al 2015 therefore the authors highlighted the risk of using them in agriculture 3 3 heavy metal metalloid contents and physicochemical parameters determined in irrigation water there was no control of the irrigation water fed to the paddy fields the primary sources were rain and lake water mahakanadara lake was one of the significant sources of water for the paddy fields in anuradhapura irrigation water can be a potential source of the toxic elements detected in the rice grain it is in equilibrium with rice plants for a long time during cultivation ayers and westcot 1985a 1985b the contents of cd and cr in irrigation water were lower in maha below the detection limits bdl compared to yala table s1 in the yala season the mean cd content in the kurunegala paddy field ranged from 0 1 0 1 to 0 2 0 1 μg l 1 however the contents of cd were bdl in maha cultivation season the difference is significant p 0 05 concerning the contents of cr in the yala season elevated cr 157 9 22 7 μg l 1 were detected in a fertilized paddy field in kurunegala in contrast the concentration during the maha season was 26 2 1 6 μg l 1 the lower contents of metal ions could be primarily due to the heavy rainfall maha is the wet cultivation season and yala is the dry season the rainfall ranges from 600 mm 1000 mm in the maha season and 100 mm 1400 mm in the yala season suppiah 1985 due to the high rainfall the irrigation water is not utilized during the yala season which could be a possible reason for the low levels of metal ion contents in irrigation water utilized in the maha season the ph of irrigation water was neutral to slightly basic 7 0 7 2 at both locations table s1 there were no distinct correlations observed for hardness versus metal ion content in the irrigation water however with increasing water hardness the chelation ability of toxic metal ions to the soil humic acids ha reduces this could lead to high bioavailability of metal ions cd and cr plant uptake from the soil solution meador 1991 warwick et al 1998 3 4 cd content in agricultural soil and physicochemical parameters soil can be a potential primary source of toxic elements both locations contained soil with elevated levels of cd table s2 however they were below the threshold value of 1 mg kg 1 cd set by the european union the maximum permissible value for cr content in agricultural soil is 100 mg kg 1 tóth et al 2016 the cr contents detected in all soils were 1 5 of this value table s2 tsp or rock phosphate could be a potential source for cd the fertilizer usage was approximately 74 000 mts per year in 1975 chandrajith et al 2010 most cd that enters into the soil remains on the surface soil available to the active plant roots loganathan and hedley 1997 however surface soil cd and deep soil cd were not significantly different p 0 05 in both locations reflecting pollution due to fertilizer the solubility mobility and bioavailability of trace metals in soils depend on their speciation controlled by soil ph organic matter clay content and secondary minerals rieuwerts et al 1998 therefore soil type plays a significant role in the accumulation and persistence of soil trace metals further land uses and management practices can affect the dynamics of trace metals concentrations in soils xu et al 2016 heavy metals and metalloids in soils are derived from the soil parent materials lithogenic source and various anthropogenic sources most of which involve several metal loid s many different anthropogenic sources of heavy metal loid contamination affect both agricultural and urban soil alloway 2013 wuana and okieimen 2011 soil ph levels ranged from mildly acidic to neutral 6 5 7 0 in paddy fields grown in anuradhapura and mildly acidic in kurunegala 6 4 6 8 table s3 there can be a positive correlation between high acidity in the soil and increased availability of soil cd lai et al 2010 römkens et al 2009 the soil ph in the organic paddy field during the yala season is near neutral has reduced cd and shows a slight correlation with ph the data obtained for the kurunegala paddy fields show an inverse relationship to the ph cd availability concept heavy metals availability to plants is higher in acidic soils and decreases as the soil ph increases this is due to sorption onto soil colloids precipitation or association with dissolved organic colloids under acidic conditions soil colloids sorption of heavy metal cations is at a minimum and the solution concentrations are relatively high as soil ph rises the sorption of heavy metal cations increases and the solubility of oxides decreases the sorption of heavy metals that occur in anionic forms decreases with increasing soil ph and as a result their solution concentrations and availability are increased guo et al 2007 cd pollution in the mahaweli river scheme concerning ckdu was observed among farming communities bandara et al 2011 the uptake of toxic elements from plants is highly influenced by the cec of the soil guo et al 2007 low soil ph 4 5 5 2 higher organic matter content 2 3 and higher cec of 18 20 c mol kg 1 in upcountry soil have a summative effect in the easy release of cd from the soil with the heavy surface runoff in the upcountry wet zone bandara et al 2011 moreover the cd solubility and dynamics of immobilization el naggar et al 2019 may be attributed to the redox potential eh changes of the soil water matrix at low soil ph frohne et al 2011 lemonte et al 2017 shaheen et al 2014 3 5 toxic element content in rice grain metalloids as and se and heavy metals pb and hg were below the detection limits in all rice varieties similar results cd pb hg nd and cr 600 800 μg kg except for as 100 μg kg 1 were observed in previous work on estimating the arsenic content in rice grain jayasumana et al 2015b the maximum permissible limits of heavy metal loids that can be present in milled rice according to who fao safe limits are 200 μg kg 1 200 μg kg 1 300 μg kg 1 2000 μg kg 1 and 20 μg kg 1 for cd as inorganic pb cr and hg respectively alimentarius 2001 fao 2011 joint 2011 fig 2 shows the average cd content in rice grain of different rice varieties separately harvested from the paddy fields in the yala season the mean cd content in rice in the yala season ranged from 3 1 0 3 to 158 9 90 0 μg kg 1 the trv kuruluthuda grown in kurunegala under both organic and fertilized conditions showed highest cd content 158 9 90 0 and 126 8 11 7 μg kg 1 nihrv bg 300 also showed elevated levels of cd 101 2 4 0 μg kg 1 pachcha perumal showed the lowest cd content in both cultivation seasons in kurunegala cd content in organically grown rice and fertilized rice were 7 4 1 3 μg kg 1 and 7 2 0 1 μg kg 1 respectively however cd content in pachcha perumal was exceptionally low under fertilized conditions organic bg 360 in anuradhapura showed the highest cd of 107 6 3 9 μg kg 1 while bg 358 showed the lowest content of 5 7 0 6 μg kg 1 trv suwandel showed the highest content of cd 132 9 8 9 μg kg 1 in the conventionally grown paddy field and nihrv bg 366 had the lowest content of cd 3 1 0 3 μg kg 1 bg 366 showed the lowest value of 3 1 0 3 μg kg 1 cd in the yala season this is observed only in the fertilized paddy rice grown in anuradhapura pachcha perumal showed a remarkable low level of cd ranging from 7 2 0 1 to 8 8 0 5 μg kg 1 this high tolerance for cd was consistent in both cultivation locations under both conditions the mean cd contents of all the rice varieties grown in paddy fields kurunegala organic kurunegala fertilized anuradhapura organic and anuradhapura conventional were 42 4 33 3 44 7 26 2 41 1 25 6 and 37 4 23 1 μg kg 1 respectively their means were not statistically significant p 0 05 fertilized rice in anuradhapura showed the lowest cd content in their rice grain in contrast fertilized rice in kurunegala showed the highest average content of cd the cd content of the rice grown in the maha season ranged from 4 3 1 3 to 110 4 14 3 μg kg 1 like the yala season the trv kuruluthuda showed the highest cd content in their grains in kurunegala organically grown rice showed 59 6 14 3 μg kg 1 while conventionally grown rice showed 110 4 14 3 μg kg 1 bg 358 grown in the kurunegala paddy field also showed elevated cd levels 71 2 6 7 μg kg 1 on the other hand pachcha perumal showed the lowest cd content under both cultivation conditions in kurunegala the average cd content in organically grown rice was 4 3 1 3 μg kg 1 while conventionally grown rice showed 6 6 1 2 μg kg 1 however organic pachcha perumal was low in accumulated cd organic bg 366 showed the highest content of cd 78 5 12 8 μg kg 1 in anuradhapura while trv pachcha perumal showed the lowest content of 7 4 12 9 μg kg 1 cd fertilized bg 366 showed the highest cd content 72 4 22 1 μg kg 1 and cd contents of pachcha perumal below the detection limits the global mean rice cd contents table 3 in kurunegala organic kurunegala fertilized anuradhapura organic and anuradhapura fertilized were 39 8 21 7 58 0 24 1 50 1 26 4 and 51 4 30 0 μg kg 1 respectively their means were not significantly different p 0 05 fertilized rice grown in kurunegala showed the highest mean cd content while rice grown under organic conditions showed the lowest cd in both cultivation seasons the rice grown in kurunegala under conventional fertilizer conditions showed the highest mean content of cd the trvs cultivated in both seasons under two different fertilizer management conditions showed low mean contents of cd in their rice grain at both locations kurunegala and anuradhapura this was observed in all the locations except for kurunegala s organically grown paddy field during the maha season nihrvs contained less cd content 8 5 5 1 μg kg 1 than trvs 43 0 5 5 μg kg 1 the mean cd content in both variety types was higher in the maha season than in the yala season the trvs cultivated during the yala season under two different fertilizer management conditions showed high mean contents of cr in their rice grain in both locations however this pattern was reversed in the maha season table s4 except for this observation there were no distinct accumulation patterns observed in the yala season nihrvs grown in the fertilized paddy field in kurunegala showed the highest mean cr value of 112 1 19 6 μg kg 1 whereas nihrvs grown under conventional fertilizer management conditions in anuradhapura during the yala season showed the lowest cr content of 38 5 13 6 μg kg 1 in the yala season trvs pachcha perumal kalu heeneti and mada thawalu showed low cd contents compared to nihrvs and other trvs pachcha perumal showed this high tolerance at both locations under two cultivation conditions during the yala season however the trvs kalu heeneti and mada thawalu showed elevated cd levels at the anuradhapura paddy field under organic conditions and conventional conditions respectively nihrvs specially bg 300 showed elevated levels of cd on most occasions in the maha season trvs pachcha perumal kalu heeneti mada thawalu and nihrv bg 300 showed low cd contents compared to the rest of the nihrvs and other trvs jayasumana et al also observed no significant difference in arsenic content between nihrv rice samples from high and low ckdu prevalence areas trvs grown without the use of agrochemicals contain significantly less arsenic 11 6 64 2 g kg jayasumana et al 2015c however if the tvs are grown with fertilizers and pesticides it is obvious that they contain toxic metals as well another study examined the arsenic cadmium lead and chromium content in 91 rice samples both polished and unpolished collected from ckdu endemic anuradhapura and matale and non endemic areas kandy ampara kegalle gampaha matara and colombo in sri lanka and found no significant difference between endemic and non endemic areas s herath et al 2018 analysis of different rice varieties genotypes and origins has shown that the effects of cd on rice growth and development varied greatly among cultivars jun 1992 some varieties were highly tolerant to soil stress imposed by cd while others were susceptible differences existed among the cultivars for cd uptake and distribution in rice plants however the difference was not necessarily related to rice genotypes rice varieties respond differently to fertilizer vegetative growth phase parameters such as plant height number of tillers plant and number of leaves plant vary under different field conditions bhowmick and nayak 2000 david and barker 1978 traditional rice varieties are considered to have a weaker response to fertilizer amarasinghe et al 2012 contents of cd in rice varied with no apparent relation to cultivation conditions organic or conventional of rice suggesting other influencing factors of the soil and climatic conditions the several distinct patterns were observed being governed by for example ionic properties charge an affinity for organic compounds and ph dependent formation and solubility of complexes that vary with ph tyler and olsson 2001 although several studies have shown positive correlations with cd content in rice grain and soil with the soil s cec such distinct correlations were not observed in the current study box and whisker plots were constructed for the rice grain cd content of the pachcha perumal variety fig 3 it was the most resistant variety there is a notable effect from cultivation location and cultivation conditions on the accumulation of cd in the rice grain p 0 05 3 6 ckdu risk assessment based on acceptable daily intake adi there is a diversity in regulations across the globe for health risk assessment for heavy metal loid s antoniadis et al 2017 2019 however the world health organization who has established a provisional tolerable weekly intake ptwi for cadmium at 7 μg kg 1 of body weight this ptwi weekly value corresponds to a daily tolerable intake level of 70 μg of cadmium for the average 70 kg man and 60 μg of cadmium per day for the average 60 kg woman sebastian and prasad 2014 the per capita rice consumption is 108 kg year average of 2004 08 or about 300 g per day which provides about 1000 calories or almost half of the average total daily calorie intake department of senses and statistics 2015 for pachcha perumal the daily intake of cd is 2 2 0 1 μg consuming rice varieties with high cd content bg 352 16 2 0 5 μg daily will lead to a high cd intake table 4 a diet with less cd content is recommended for people living in ckdu hot spot locations where drinking water is contaminated with cd jayasumana et al 2015a concerns regarding elevated cd levels in the sri lankan diet specifically rice have been raised in many studies in some irrigation farming areas cd concentrations in rice could reach 0 1 mg kg 1 equating to weekly ingestion rates of 10 μg kg 1 body weight per week renal failure was prevalent in residents of these high cd areas this disease is linked to elevated cd levels in the diet bandara et al 2008 3 7 toxic element content in rice straws rice straws analyzed along with the rice root had significant amounts of cd table s5 the average cd content in dried rice straws was 71 8 μg kg 1 ranging from 2 7 140 9 μg kg 1 the moisture content of rice was in the range of 12 1 15 6 rice varieties grown in kurunegala produced a relatively high content of cd in their straws the use of straws as organic manure could be dangerous as they contain high levels of cd and cr tables s5 and s6 the metals will be retained in the soil and transferred to and accumulated in the rice grain in subsequent seasons 3 8 testing

lanka rice cultivators are faced with a choice in selection between traditional and high yielding rice varieties they always tend to grow high yielding rice for the sake of getting more profit there is a myth that the cultivation of traditional varieties is difficult compared to newly improved varieties herath et al 1982 however in this study such difficulties were not experienced with organic cultivation nutrient deficiency symptoms were not significant and all the plants grown under organic conditions were healthy fig s3 the current study proposes that trvs still can be grown in sri lanka with a high yield 4 0 mg ha 1 farmers can be encouraged to grow such varieties the health risk associated with consuming unhealthy rice can be reduced or controlled it can be recommended that rice research institutes step in and develop more improved seeds of such varieties and distribute them among farmers to promote organic rice cultivation in sri lanka as the content of se was below the detection limits in rice consuming these rice varieties could lead to a deficiency in se causing health effects van rij et al 1979 vinceti et al 2001 se could be introduced to fertilizers and se retaining soil amendments such as bio char karunanayake et al 2019 could be an alternative to slowly release selenium to soil johansson et al 2016 4 conclusions the results obtained in this study show that ten rice varieties grown under controlled experimental conditions did not contain alarming cd cr as hg and pb below who limit the soil was sought to be the main cd reservoir and soil cd content generally increased with decreasing soil ph some traditional varieties especially pachcha perumal repeatedly showed remarkably high resistance to cadmium absorption in both seasons the varieties madathawalu and kuruluthuda were moderately resistive compared to the other cultivated varieties however no statistically significant difference p 0 05 in the accumulation of cd was observed compared to that in newly improved hybrid varieties or in the rice between ckdu endemic area and non endemic area the correlations were tested linear regression to fit data on to freundlich model this study

11901,the contentious results of elevated as and cd levels in both sri lankan rice and in agrochemicals have recently raised tremendous attention these claims could not standalone due to the study s poorly designed sampling and analytical methodologies in this work selected traditional sri lankan rice and hybrid rice varieties were cultivated under fertilized and organic conditions using a split plot design during yala may to august and maha september to march seasons in two regions anuradhapura and kurunegala as cd cr hg pb and se contents were determined in harvested rice grain and straws for chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu risk assessment in addition analysis of these elements in water soil and agrochemicals was used to estimate their geochemical behavior the majority of agrochemicals and fertilizers had cd cr and pb grain cd contents in rice varieties were ranged from not detectable to 158 9 μg kg 1 in both cultivation seasons and soil was sought to be the primary cd source as se hg and pb were also not detectable in both rice grain and straws native variety pachcha perumal rice grain showed a low cd accumulation in both seasons at both regions kuruluthuda and madathawalu showed a moderate accumulation versus other varieties cultivating and consuming these native traditional rice varieties practicing organic farming could be a possible way to combat ckdu risks the correlations between the rice grain cd content and farming condition location or season of cultivation were tested linear regression to fit data on to freundlich model and no distinct statistical correlations were observed p 0 05 mean chromium contents 38 5 112 1 μg kg 1 detected in the rice grain were not alarming soil irrigation water and agrochemicals were free from as and hg

cultivation of paddy has become the major agricultural industry in the country and it is mainly cultivated as a wetland crop during the two seasons yala and maha rice can uptake various forms of both toxic and nutritional elements from the soil solution these elements are translocated from roots to straw and ultimately to the rice grain payus and talip 2014 different types of rice crops may have divergent abilities to absorb and accumulate elements in their different parts in ancient times over 400 different traditional rice varieties trv are said to have been grown all over sri lanka

province ncp became the first region in the country where the chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu appeared approximately two decades ago among the paddy cultivating community toxic heavy metals and metalloids mainly cadmium cd and arsenic as present in the agricultural soil irrigation water and agrochemicals used in the cultivation and ultimately the rice obtained from paddy in this region were suspected to be the culprits of this deadly disease agriculture is an essential part of this country however excessive use of agrochemicals and irresponsible and harmful agricultural practices cause soil and irrigation water pollution hou et al 2020 this ultimately leads to contamination of the human food chain sri lanka has the highest usage of synthetic fertilizer to land in

much research has been reported on heavy metal metalloid contamination in rice and soil and water to the best of our knowledge these have been reported for randomly collected samples only a few systematic scientific studies have been conducted to determine the intrusion of heavy metals through water soil and other sources agro chemicals and organic manure into the rice it is widely believed that trvs are better at resisting the absorption of heavy metals than nihrvs rascio et al 2008 a recent study reported that the as cd and pb contents in selected trvs kalu heenati pokkali gurusinghe wee kahawanu sudu murunga and unakola samba were below the limit of quantification loq pb 0 04 ppm as 0 02 ppm and cd 0 01 ppm kariyawasam et al 2016 the objective of this work is to study the

straws of rice plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental locations paddy cultivation for the study was carried out in two locations fig 1 a one at rambewa in anuradhapura of ncp where high levels of heavy metals and ckdu has been reported for an extended period of time chandrajith et al 2011 jayasumana et al 2015b the other location was wilgoda in kurunegala of north western province nwp where ckdu etiology was not detected at the time of this study jayasekara et al 2015 the north central province land surface is spotted with man made reservoirs arranged in a cascade system with many micro and meso catchments bandara et al 2008 results from several previous investigations indicated high levels of toxic metals in the soil waters and rice cultivated in this region s rice paddies jayasumana et al 2015c therefore two nearby farms approximately 500 m apart were selected one has been used for organic cultivation and the other for conventional cultivation the experiment was conducted using a split plot design fig 1b where traditional rice varieties trv and newly improved hybrid varieties nihrv were grown each variety received a sub treatment with three replicates in a gross area of 11 m2 the design used a nested blocking structure with split plots nested within whole plots fig 1b and c ten rice varieties five traditional rice varieties trv namely suwandel madathawalu pachchaperumal kalu heeneti kuruluthuda and five new improved hybrid rice varieties nihrv namely bg 300 bg 352 bg 358 bg 360 and bg 366 were selected for the experiments the growth duration for all was in the range of three to three and half months the study was carried out under two farming conditions organic and fertilized presence of conventional agrochemicals at both yala and maha seasons at each location the department of agriculture doa recommended agrochemical and fertilizer management practices during the experimental period for the fertilized and conventional paddy fields organic farming was practiced in the absence of pesticides however organic manure compost and organic fertilizer were incorporated fig s1 natural pest control mechanisms water control repellent plants manual weed removal see supporting information fig s1 were employed for the organically cultivated paddy fields rice seeds for nihrvs and trvs were obtained from the rice research and development institute batalagoda sri lanka and a certified organic farm in kurunegala 2 2 sampling 2 2 1 sampling of soil and water at the beginning of the field experiments soil from the surface 0 20 cm and sub surface 20 40 cm were collected using a soil auger from the experimental sites since the water sources were different and there was no control over the flow of irrigation water to the paddy fields water sampling n 3 was carried out at one month intervals during growth samples were collected into polypropylene sampling bottles and preserved using ultra pure nitric acid ph 2 samples were stored in a cool box 4 c for transportation and then stored in the refrigerator until analysis 2 2 2 sampling and processing of rice paddy plant samples were collected at maturity rice plants were uprooted and different plant parts grains straws and roots were separated and oven dried at 85 c until reaching a constant weight the moisture content of each plant part was determined from the weight loss upon drying dried plant matter was ground using a wooden pestle and a mortar to obtain a homogeneous powder 2 2 3 digestion of samples the chemical reagents calibration standards matrix modifiers digestion acids and auxiliaries used were trace grade or ultra pure purchased from sigma aldrich fischer and inorganic ventures unless otherwise noted a 0 50 g portion of powdered samples from rice grains and straws were digested using microwave acid digestion mars 6 express and milestone ethos easy ultra pure hno3 hcl 9 ml 3 ml according to us epa 3052 method usepa 1995 wathudura et al 2019 digests were cooled and transferred to polypropylene vessels and brought into 25 00 ml with de ionized water usepa 1995 the same microwave acid digestion method was adopted for the digestion of soil and fertilizers however before digestion soil samples were air dried for approximately 96 h at 25 30 c and subsequently sieved through a 500 μm sieve to separate acid insoluble silica sand particles a 0 5 ml portion from each pesticide was used for digestion usepa 1995 a 20 00 ml portion of the water samples was heated on the hot plate with 9 ml of ultra pure conc hno3 to reduce the volume to 10 15 ml once cooled the samples were quantitatively dilution with de ionized water transferred to polypropylene vessels 25 00 ml international 2012 2 2 4 analysis of samples an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas hitachi za 3000 polarized zeeman background corrector was used for elemental analysis cd cr and pb concentrations were determined using optimized graphite furnace aas methods pyro coated graphite tubes were utilized with mg no3 2 and nh4h2po4 matrix modifiers for cd and pb respectively a 10 μl of each of these modifiers was injected into 20 μl samples before the analysis samples were injected into the graphite tube at a rate of 4 μl s 1 arsenic analysis was performed using the hydride generation method hitachi hfs 4 followed by the pre reduction of all arsenic species to as3 using 10 ascorbic acid and 20 potassium iodide the same procedure was employed for se but in the absence of ki as it can produce elemental se then arsenic selenium hydride was aspirated into the quartz tube with subsequent treatment with 5 hcl and 1 nabh4 mercury analysis was carried out using a cold vapor generation method sncl2 in hcl was used to reduce mercury ions to mercury atomic vapor at room temperature it was passed through the quartz absorption cell of the aas a crm was not available for water therefore spike recovery tests were carried out using a graphite furnace at a 15 tolerance limit commercially available 1000 mg l aas stock standard solutions were used to prepare calibration standards in a 10 ultra pure nitric acid hydrochloric acid 3 1 solution 2 2 5 determination of physicochemical parameters of water and soil water hardness electrical conductivity and ph were determined according to standard epa methods 130 2 120 1 and 9040 c respectively soil cation exchange capacity cec was determined using a modified ammonium acetate compulsory displacement method chapman 1965 peiris et al 2019 samples were washed with de ionized water five times before starting the cation extraction to reduce interference from soluble salts first a 20 0 ml portion of de ionized water was added to each 1 0 g sample of soil in a centrifuge tube next the tube was placed on a shaker and shaken at 180 rpm for 5 min the sample was vacuum filtered and the leachate was saved for further analysis after the fifth wash 10 ml of na acetate ph 7 buffer was added to the sample and the mixture was shaken for 10 min this process was repeated three times to ensure that exchange sites were saturated with sodium ions soil samples were then washed three times with ethanol to remove excess sodium ions finally sodium ions were displaced with nh4 acetate ph 7 three times and they are measured by faas chapman 1965 2 2 6 data analysis and statistical treatment data analysis and statistical treatment were performed using microsoft excel 2013 and spss 23 0 statistical analysis software in addition grubb s outlier test was carried out for outlier rejection 3 results and

elements in the agrochemicals used in paddy cultivation during the yala and maha seasons in kurunegala and anuradhapura arsenic and mercury were below the detection limits in all the agrochemicals studied elevated levels of cd 1 80 mg kg 1 and 3 44 mg kg 1 were detected in mop and tsp respectively organic fertilizers also contained substantial amounts of cd 0 44 mg kg 1 in organic fertilizer and 1 67 mg kg 1 in local compost from plant and animal manure heavy metals in bio solids may be found in inorganic or organically complex affecting their chemical reactions in the soil these heavy metals may accumulate in soil with repeated fertilizer applications mortvedt 1995 all five fertilizers analyzed were positive for the presence of cr mcpa and diamet diazinon had slightly elevated levels of cd 34 67 μg l 1 and 19 76 μg l 1 while in bispyribac sodium lower cd levels were detected 1 90 μg l 1 cr was also detected in all four pesticides and ranged from 10 30 μg l 1 to 179 14 μg l 1 the surfactant also contained low amounts of cd in the range of 0 09 0 15 μg l 1 arsenic content in agrochemicals used in the cultivation was below the limit of detection the control of pesticides act no 33 of 1980 designates authorized analyst where the rop can accept analytical results accordingly samples of 28 pesticide formulations were tested at the industrial technology institute iti of the ministry of technology and research sri lanka using a hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy only three of the tested pesticides glyphosate acid equivalent 360 g l ec carbofuran 3 g glyphosate acid equivalent 360 g l sl have been found to contain low quantities of arsenic 334 μg kg 1 166 μg kg 1 and 370 μg kg 1 respectively the arsenic contents of mcpa bispyribac sodium diamet diazinon and propanil pretilachlor were reported below their limit of quantification loq of 50 μg kg 1 wijesekara and marambe 2011 cd was present in all the fertilizers and pesticides however they were within the slsi maximum allowable limits 10 mg kg 1 according to the sri lankan department of agriculture standards the amount of tsp required for a 1 acre paddy field for a cultivation season is approximately 55 5 kg and the average tsp cd content in the present investigation was 1 8 mg kg 1 therefore if fertilizer application is restricted to this limit for 10 years only 2 g of cd will be added to the 1 acre paddy this will not lead to excessive pollution due to fertilizer use organic manure is widely thought to contain low concentrations of toxic elements therefore it can be used as an alternative to chemical fertilizers however according to the findings of this study organic manure contains significant amounts of cd cr and pb and they should be used with caution as fertilizers similar high heavy metal contents were reported in poultry waste manure 0 84 0 87 cd 54 4 54 6 cu 980 987 fe 5 26 5 92 pb and 308 328 zn mg kg sahito et al 2015 therefore the authors highlighted the risk of using them in agriculture 3 3 heavy metal metalloid contents and physicochemical parameters determined in irrigation water there was no control of the irrigation water fed to the paddy fields the primary sources were rain and lake water mahakanadara lake was one of the significant sources of water for the paddy fields in anuradhapura irrigation water can be a potential source of the toxic elements detected in the rice grain it is in equilibrium with rice plants for a long time during cultivation ayers and westcot 1985a 1985b the contents of cd and cr in irrigation water were lower in maha below the detection limits bdl compared to yala table s1 in the yala season the mean cd content in the kurunegala paddy field ranged from 0 1 0 1 to 0 2 0 1 μg l 1 however the contents of cd were bdl in maha cultivation season the difference is significant p 0 05 concerning the contents of cr in the yala season elevated cr 157 9 22 7 μg l 1 were detected in a fertilized paddy field in kurunegala in contrast the concentration during the maha season was 26 2 1 6 μg l 1 the lower contents of metal ions could be primarily due to the heavy rainfall maha is the wet cultivation season and yala is the dry season the rainfall ranges from 600 mm 1000 mm in the maha season and 100 mm 1400 mm in the yala season suppiah 1985 due to the high rainfall the irrigation water is not utilized during the yala season which could be a possible reason for the low levels of metal ion contents in irrigation water utilized in the maha season the ph of irrigation water was neutral to slightly basic 7 0 7 2 at both locations table s1 there were no distinct correlations observed for hardness versus metal ion content in the irrigation water however with increasing water hardness the chelation ability of toxic metal ions to the soil humic acids ha reduces this could lead to high bioavailability of metal ions cd and cr plant uptake from the soil solution meador 1991 warwick et al 1998 3 4 cd content in agricultural soil and physicochemical parameters soil can be a potential primary source of toxic elements both locations contained soil with elevated levels of cd table s2 however they were below the threshold value of 1 mg kg 1 cd set by the european union the maximum permissible value for cr content in agricultural soil is 100 mg kg 1 tóth et al 2016 the cr contents detected in all soils were 1 5 of this value table s2 tsp or rock phosphate could be a potential source for cd the fertilizer usage was approximately 74 000 mts per year in 1975 chandrajith et al 2010 most cd that enters into the soil remains on the surface soil available to the active plant roots loganathan and hedley 1997 however surface soil cd and deep soil cd were not significantly different p 0 05 in both locations reflecting pollution due to fertilizer the solubility mobility and bioavailability of trace metals in soils depend on their speciation controlled by soil ph organic matter clay content and secondary minerals rieuwerts et al 1998 therefore soil type plays a significant role in the accumulation and persistence of soil trace metals further land uses and management practices can affect the dynamics of trace metals concentrations in soils xu et al 2016 heavy metals and metalloids in soils are derived from the soil parent materials lithogenic source and various anthropogenic sources most of which involve several metal loid s many different anthropogenic sources of heavy metal loid contamination affect both agricultural and urban soil alloway 2013 wuana and okieimen 2011 soil ph levels ranged from mildly acidic to neutral 6 5 7 0 in paddy fields grown in anuradhapura and mildly acidic in kurunegala 6 4 6 8 table s3 there can be a positive correlation between high acidity in the soil and increased availability of soil cd lai et al 2010 römkens et al 2009 the soil ph in the organic paddy field during the yala season is near neutral has reduced cd and shows a slight correlation with ph the data obtained for the kurunegala paddy fields show an inverse relationship to the ph cd availability concept heavy metals availability to plants is higher in acidic soils and decreases as the soil ph increases this is due to sorption onto soil colloids precipitation or association with dissolved organic colloids under acidic conditions soil colloids sorption of heavy metal cations is at a minimum and the solution concentrations are relatively high as soil ph rises the sorption of heavy metal cations increases and the solubility of oxides decreases the sorption of heavy metals that occur in anionic forms decreases with increasing soil ph and as a result their solution concentrations and availability are increased guo et al 2007 cd pollution in the mahaweli river scheme concerning ckdu was observed among farming communities bandara et al 2011 the uptake of toxic elements from plants is highly influenced by the cec of the soil guo et al 2007 low soil ph 4 5 5 2 higher organic matter content 2 3 and higher cec of 18 20 c mol kg 1 in upcountry soil have a summative effect in the easy release of cd from the soil with the heavy surface runoff in the upcountry wet zone bandara et al 2011 moreover the cd solubility and dynamics of immobilization el naggar et al 2019 may be attributed to the redox potential eh changes of the soil water matrix at low soil ph frohne et al 2011 lemonte et al 2017 shaheen et al 2014 3 5 toxic element content in rice grain metalloids as and se and heavy metals pb and hg were below the detection limits in all rice varieties similar results cd pb hg nd and cr 600 800 μg kg except for as 100 μg kg 1 were observed in previous work on estimating the arsenic content in rice grain jayasumana et al 2015b the maximum permissible limits of heavy metal loids that can be present in milled rice according to who fao safe limits are 200 μg kg 1 200 μg kg 1 300 μg kg 1 2000 μg kg 1 and 20 μg kg 1 for cd as inorganic pb cr and hg respectively alimentarius 2001 fao 2011 joint 2011 fig 2 shows the average cd content in rice grain of different rice varieties separately harvested from the paddy fields in the yala season the mean cd content in rice in the yala season ranged from 3 1 0 3 to 158 9 90 0 μg kg 1 the trv kuruluthuda grown in kurunegala under both organic and fertilized conditions showed highest cd content 158 9 90

organically grown rice and fertilized rice were 7 4 1 3 μg kg 1 and 7 2 0 1 μg kg 1 respectively however cd content in pachcha perumal was exceptionally low under fertilized conditions organic bg 360 in anuradhapura showed the highest cd of 107 6 3 9 μg kg 1 while bg 358 showed the lowest content of 5 7 0 6 μg kg 1 trv suwandel showed the highest content of cd 132 9 8 9 μg kg 1 in the conventionally grown paddy field and nihrv bg 366 had the lowest content of cd 3 1 0 3 μg kg 1 bg 366 showed the lowest value of 3 1 0 3 μg kg 1 cd in the yala season this is observed only in the fertilized paddy rice grown in anuradhapura pachcha perumal showed a remarkable low level of cd ranging from 7 2 0 1 to 8 8 0 5 μg kg 1 this high tolerance for cd was consistent in both cultivation locations under both conditions the mean cd contents of all the rice varieties grown in paddy fields kurunegala organic kurunegala fertilized anuradhapura organic and anuradhapura conventional were 42 4 33 3 44 7 26 2 41 1 25 6 and 37 4 23 1 μg kg 1 respectively their means were not statistically significant p 0 05 fertilized rice in anuradhapura showed the lowest cd content in their rice grain in contrast fertilized rice in kurunegala showed the highest average content of cd the cd content of the rice grown in the maha season ranged from 4 3 1 3 to 110 4 14 3 μg kg 1 like the yala season the trv kuruluthuda showed the highest cd content in their grains in kurunegala organically grown rice showed 59 6 14 3 μg kg 1 while conventionally grown rice showed 110 4 14 3 μg kg 1 bg 358 grown in the kurunegala paddy field also showed elevated cd levels 71 2 6 7 μg kg 1 on the other hand pachcha perumal showed the lowest cd content under both cultivation conditions in kurunegala the average cd content in organically grown rice was 4 3 1 3 μg kg 1 while conventionally grown rice showed 6 6 1 2 μg kg 1 however organic pachcha perumal was low in accumulated cd organic bg 366 showed the highest content of cd 78 5 12 8 μg kg 1 in anuradhapura while trv pachcha perumal showed the lowest content of 7 4 12 9 μg kg 1 cd fertilized bg 366 showed the highest cd content 72 4 22 1 μg kg 1 and cd

under organic conditions showed the lowest cd in both cultivation seasons the rice grown in kurunegala under conventional fertilizer conditions showed the highest mean content of cd the trvs cultivated in both seasons under two different fertilizer management conditions showed low mean contents of cd in their rice grain at both locations kurunegala and anuradhapura this was observed in all the locations except for kurunegala s organically grown paddy field during the maha season nihrvs contained less cd content 8 5 5 1 μg kg 1 than trvs 43 0 5 5 μg kg 1 the mean cd content in both variety types was higher in the maha season than in the yala season the trvs cultivated during the yala season under two different fertilizer management conditions showed high mean contents of cr in their rice grain in both locations however this pattern was reversed in the maha season table s4 except for this observation there were no distinct accumulation patterns observed in the yala season nihrvs grown in the fertilized paddy field in kurunegala showed the highest mean cr value of 112 1 19 6 μg kg 1 whereas nihrvs grown under conventional fertilizer management conditions in anuradhapura during the yala season showed the lowest cr content of 38 5 13 6 μg kg 1 in the yala season trvs pachcha perumal kalu heeneti and mada thawalu showed low cd contents compared to nihrvs and other trvs pachcha perumal showed this high tolerance at both locations under two cultivation conditions during the yala season however the trvs kalu heeneti and mada thawalu showed elevated cd levels at the anuradhapura paddy field under organic conditions and conventional conditions respectively nihrvs specially bg 300 showed elevated levels of cd on most occasions in the maha season trvs pachcha perumal kalu heeneti mada thawalu and nihrv bg 300 showed low cd contents compared to the rest of the nihrvs and other trvs jayasumana et al also observed no significant difference in arsenic content between nihrv rice samples from high and low ckdu prevalence areas trvs grown without the use of agrochemicals contain significantly less arsenic 11 6 64 2 g kg jayasumana et al 2015c however if the tvs are grown with fertilizers and pesticides it is obvious that they contain toxic metals as well another study examined the arsenic cadmium lead and chromium content in 91 rice samples both polished and unpolished collected from ckdu endemic anuradhapura and matale and non endemic areas kandy ampara kegalle gampaha matara and colombo in sri lanka and found no significant difference between endemic and non endemic areas s herath et al 2018 analysis of different rice varieties genotypes and origins has shown that the effects of cd on rice growth and development varied greatly among cultivars jun 1992 some varieties were highly tolerant to soil stress imposed by cd while others were susceptible differences existed among the cultivars for cd uptake and distribution in rice plants however the difference was not necessarily related to rice genotypes rice varieties respond differently to fertilizer vegetative growth phase parameters such as plant height number of tillers plant and number of leaves plant vary under different field conditions bhowmick and nayak 2000 david and barker 1978 traditional rice varieties are considered to have a weaker response to fertilizer amarasinghe et al 2012 contents of cd in rice varied with no apparent relation to cultivation conditions organic or conventional of rice suggesting other influencing factors of the soil and climatic conditions the several distinct patterns were observed being governed by for example ionic properties charge an affinity for organic compounds and ph dependent formation and solubility of complexes that vary with ph tyler and olsson 2001 although several studies have shown positive correlations with cd content in rice grain and soil with the soil s cec such distinct correlations were not observed in the current study box and whisker plots were constructed for the rice grain cd content of the pachcha perumal variety fig 3 it was the most resistant variety there is a notable effect from cultivation location and cultivation conditions on the accumulation of cd in the rice grain p 0 05 3 6 ckdu risk assessment based on acceptable daily intake adi there is a diversity in regulations across the globe for health risk assessment for heavy metal loid s antoniadis et al 2017 2019 however the world health organization who has established a provisional tolerable weekly intake ptwi for cadmium at 7 μg kg 1 of body weight this ptwi weekly value corresponds to a daily tolerable intake level of 70 μg of cadmium for the average 70 kg man and 60 μg of cadmium per day for the average 60 kg woman sebastian and prasad 2014 the per capita rice consumption is 108 kg year average of 2004 08 or about 300 g per day which provides about 1000 calories or almost half of the average total daily calorie intake department of senses and statistics 2015 for pachcha perumal the daily intake of cd is 2 2 0 1 μg consuming rice varieties with high cd content bg 352 16 2 0 5 μg daily will lead to a

elevated cd levels in the sri lankan diet specifically rice have been raised in many studies in some irrigation farming areas cd concentrations in rice could reach 0 1 mg kg 1 equating to weekly ingestion rates of 10 μg kg 1 body weight per week renal failure was prevalent in residents of these high cd areas this disease is linked to elevated cd levels in the diet bandara et al 2008 3 7 toxic

lanka rice cultivators are faced with a choice in selection between traditional and high yielding rice varieties they always tend to grow high yielding rice for the sake of getting more profit there is a myth that the cultivation of traditional varieties is difficult compared to newly improved varieties herath et al 1982 however in this study such difficulties were not experienced with organic cultivation nutrient deficiency symptoms were not significant and all the plants grown under organic conditions were healthy fig s3 the current study proposes that trvs still can be grown in sri lanka with a high yield 4 0 mg ha 1 farmers can be encouraged to grow such varieties the health risk associated with consuming unhealthy rice can be reduced or controlled it can be recommended that rice research institutes step in and develop more improved seeds of such varieties and distribute them among farmers to promote organic rice cultivation in sri lanka as the content of se was below the detection limits in rice consuming these rice varieties could lead to a deficiency in se causing health effects van rij et al 1979 vinceti et al 2001 se could be introduced to fertilizers and se retaining soil amendments such as bio char karunanayake et al 2019 could be an alternative to slowly release selenium to soil johansson et al 2016 4 conclusions the results obtained in this study show that ten rice varieties grown under controlled experimental conditions did not contain alarming cd cr as hg and pb below who limit the soil was sought to be the main cd reservoir and soil cd content generally increased with decreasing soil ph some traditional varieties especially pachcha perumal repeatedly showed remarkably high resistance to cadmium absorption in both seasons the varieties madathawalu and kuruluthuda were moderately resistive compared to the other cultivated varieties however no statistically significant difference p 0 05 in the accumulation of cd was observed compared to that in newly improved hybrid varieties or in the rice between ckdu endemic area and non endemic area the correlations were tested linear regression to fit data on to freundlich model this study

11902,the resources of groundwater and its pollution in syria are identified and pathways of contaminants to groundwater are described then suggestions for improvement of groundwater quality in syria are evaluated syria is located in a region where water scarcity is dominant about 87 of all water in syria is mainly used for irrigation with almost 60 of this water taken from groundwater resources the rest is used for domestic and industrial purposes which account for 9 and 4 respectively due to over pumping and the increase in the number of unsustainable wells observed in recent decades groundwater is quantitatively deteriorating in general sources of groundwater contamination fall into two main categories natural and anthropogenic sources important sources of natural groundwater pollution include climate effects about 43 of groundwater has a high concentration of so 4 and or nacl this is specifically dominant in the eastern region of syria due to the harsh environment where precipitation is relatively low and evaporation is high one of the major sources of anthropogenic groundwater contamination is civil war most of the damaged regions are located on permeable rocks which increases the probability of groundwater contamination due to chemical weapons cw used it is vital to manage and control groundwater resources well with the increase in water contamination and with the absence of poor water management access to drinking water will be more of a problem than it is now graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality water resources chemical weapons syria 1 introduction syria is renowned for its special location which is the center of the world s three most dominant continents asia europe and africa and has a population of over 22 million fig 1 syria is located in a region where water scarcity is dominant water in syria has mainly used for irrigation and nearly half of irrigation systems use groundwater as their water resource salman and mualla 2004 fig 2 according to fao 2018 special report on syria the country can be divided into the five agro ecological zones aezs based on the level of annual precipitation received as shown in fig 3 zone i cover some 2 7 million hectares and have an average annual rainfall of 400 650 mm zone ii covers about 2 5 million hectares and has an average annual rainfall of 300 400 mm zone iii covers about 1 3 million hectares and has an average annual rainfall of approximately 200 300 mm zone iv is agriculturally marginal with a total area of around 1 8 million hectares and an average annual rainfall of 100 200 mm zone v is the badia or steppe it has approximately 8 3 million hectares and an average annual rainfall of less than 100 mm agriculture accounts for 87 of the water withdrawn from syria s aquifers rivers and lakes fao 2015 aw hassan 2014 unfortunately water availability from both surface and groundwater is decreasing and is expected to decrease further in the future due to the development of groundwater based agriculture water in semi arid regions where water stress is already present and precipitation is low is being over consumed and pumped compared to the previous two decades for instance irrigated areas in some regions of syria with precipitation less than 350 mm year doubled in the duration of 19 years maar 2006 even though an increase in irrigated lands using surface water from rivers or lakes such as in the euphrates river basin projects is observed the overall percentage of lands using groundwater as their resource had risen by 10 in 2004 according to maar 2006 subsequently the water table has lowered by 23 m on average in the years of overexploitation luijendijk and bruggeman 2008 this has an impact on the annual average water per capita with a reduction anticipated to reach 23 between the years 1970 and 2025 fao 2011 furthermore water quality and quantity have been affected dramatically in syria for two reasons natural and anthropogenic consequences although an example of the first is climate change which to some extent can also be considered anthropogenic human practices nowadays cause the highest percentage of damage to water resources around syria where practices have been unsustainable in recent decades the quantity of groundwater has decreased due to over pumping and the increase in the number of illegal and non sustainable wells additionally the quality is affected since salt concentrations increase with the absence of water irrigation also has a major influence on the quality of groundwater wada et al 2012 another major anthropogenic cause of damage is civil war lawrence et al 2015 discussed the effect of warfare on the ecosystem explaining that chemicals used in weapons that are built to cause damage to human lives also have an adverse effect on the environment such weapons related chemicals can contaminate surface water soil and groundwater which in turn toxifies plants animals feeding on them food irrigated by polluted water springs and rivers by the transport of contaminated sediments etc the direct effect of ongoing warfare related to water such as safe access to water for displaced people has been well examined however the indirect long term effects of warfare such as the percolation of contaminants into the soil especially in cases in which chemical weapons cw have been used have not been highlighted in the literature important sources of natural groundwater pollution in syria include geogenic factors the major sources of anthropogenic groundwater contamination in syria are climate change agricultural activities over pumping and chemical weapons this paper aims to review groundwater resources and focus on underlying natural and anthropogenic influences on water resources in syria 2 geological and hydrogeological properties of the studied area numerous studies were completed about the geological and tectonic properties of syria e g ponikarov 1966 al maleh 1976 mouty and al maleh 1992 sawaf et al 1993 sharland et al 2001 brew et al 2001 these studies concentrated on the particularly well exposed mesozoic carbonate section in the palmyride fold and thrust belt the syrian coastal ranges and the kurd dagh mountains fig 4 sharland et al 2001 provided the first sequence stratigraphic synthesis of arabian plate stratigraphy and brew et al 2001 synthesized the tectonic evolution of the entire country syria occupies an area of 186 000 km2 located in the northern part of the arabian peninsula platform syria is renowned for its sophisticated geologic and structural setting about 75 of syria s land is covered by sedimentary rocks which mostly consist of carboniferous rocks fragmented materials and evaporate rocks and the geological age of these rocks is triassic and neogene the remaining part is mainly covered with volcanic rocks such as basalt flows from the upper jurassic and lower cretaceous additionally ophiolite rocks with associated volcanic sedimentary rocks can be found in the north and northwest regions of syria ponikarov and mikihilov 1989 geologically the country can be divided into two major parts a mountainous chain in the western part which starts from the southwest and extends all the way to turkey adjacent to the mediterranean sea and the plateau part in the eastern region the western mountains function as a precipitation barrier which explains the relatively low precipitation rate on the plateau and the presence of deserts this geologic evolution and tectonic properties of syria have created conditions most suitable for preserving groundwater resources subsequently groundwater is mainly found in abundance in the western part with a relatively greater supply and subsequently better groundwater quality also numerous studies were completed about the hydrogeological properties of syria most of these studies focus on a local problem al charideh and kattaa 2016 concentrated on hydrostratigraphic properties of units in syria aw hassan 2014 studied the impact of food and agricultural policies on groundwater use in syria voss et al 2013 studied groundwater depletion and transboundary water management in the tigris euphrates luijendijk and bruggeman 2008 studied groundwater resources jabal al hass region kattan 2006 focused on the characterization of surface water and groundwater in the damascus ghotta basin jica 2001 studied of water resources development in the western and central basins in syrian la moreaux 1989 studied hydrogeological assessment figeh spring damascus wolfart 1964 worked on the hydrogeology of the damascus basin and asmael et al 2014 studied on hydrochemistry to delineate groundwater flow conditions in the mogher al mer area al charideh and kattaa 2016 provided a summary of the hydrostratigraphic units fig 5 lower and upper cretaceous aquifers are generally the main hydrogeological succession in syria the existence of paleogene neogene and jurassic aquifers is minor limestone and dolomite aquifers constitute more than 50 of other types selkhozpromexport 1979 and khouri et al 1984 described aquifer and aquitard systems in more detail the regional deep cretaceous aquifer contributes to more than 80 of aquifers in the stations shown in fig 3a which is an indication that it is part of the massive upper mesozoic sedimentary sequence that constitutes the major aquifer units in syria and the middle east as for carbonates they constitute the most extensive aquifers in syria and the most vital water resources al charideh and kattaa 2016 very few studies were done about groundwater modeling in syria groundwater modeling has been widely used to investigate groundwater system dynamics and understand flow patterns anderson and woessner 1992 chiang and kinzelbach 1998 asmael et al 2015 developed a groundwater model representing the groundwater flow system in the complex of the northeastern part of mt hermon and improved the hydrogeological understanding of this system the result of this study is indicated that the lateral discharge from the jurassic karstic aquifer into neogene conglomerates and the recharge by infiltrated meteoric precipitation are the most important mechanisms in recharging the upper aquifer horizon 3 methodological approach the geopolitical characteristics of syria turn it into a unique subject of study while natural resources are being investigated generally we can divide the data sources available in the case of study into two main periods before and post era of war in syria while it can be found several studies and sources of information about the natural geographical and socio economical structure of syria before 2011 these resources dramatically decrease in the post war period consequently there are significant knowledge gaps about the case of study in the post 2011 era this un equivalent geospatial data quality is the main challenge of the study for understanding the issue this study classified the available sources of information as main and clues in a geospatial database the main data sources are used to understand the geographical characteristics of syria and used for creating enhancing and verification of further rare data sources after the 2011 period initially the study gathered official and academic published data in the same geospatial dataset geo referencing digitizing and geoprocessing of these sources information provide is the essential content of the main database later other sources of information with a lower level of accuracy or consistency are gathered in the clue database overlapping these two databases provide a third source of geographical information that is used for the evaluation subject of study fig 6 briefly illustrates the main methodological approach of this study 4 water resources of syria 4 1 surface water there are seven main basins in syria fig 7 table 1 shows some characteristics of these basins most of the surface water in syria is shared with other neighboring countries surface water is the general source in syria the euphrates river alone accounts for about 85 of the water that is available to syria lowi 1995 it covers a total distance of 2800 km and also a population of 5 930 million inhabitants lives there the basin of orontes with a population of 3 830 million inhabitants and nearly 18 000 ha areas owns a second high capacity of precipitation the next river in terms of internal size is the oronates which originates from lebanon passing through syria and turkey is also located in this basin the most famous lake on that river is found in homs district other major rivers include the tigris khabur sajur and balikh areas that are irrigated with surface water have remarkably increased for instance 583 000 ha of irrigated lands used surface water in 2002 compared to 334 000 ha in 1985 somi et al 2002 european commission published data about surface water resources of syria in 2019 which gives remarkable information about the case of the study s surface water situation in 34 years according to this data set the recurrence percentage of surface water resources in orontes euphrates and aleppo basins remain notably high while in east regions dajleh and khabour basins is significantly low fig 8 water occurrence maps fig 9 provide critical information on surface water availability in a different region in the same period for example membidi homs and hasakeh regions are mostly recognized with permanent surface water while in regions like palmyra or aleppo surface water resources are temporary water occurrence change intensity is shown in fig 10 in 34 years east regions have increased change intensity in surface water this factor remains with no change in some northern regions and aleppo and homs another significant variable in the data set is the transition of surface water that elaborates in figs 11 and 12 the data set also provides clear information about the transition of surface water in this period the observation results indicate that in regions like hasakeh and membidi or palmyra some new seasonal and permanent surface water is available this transition reveals for the aleppo region in more detail in fig 12 4 2 groundwater in developing countries such as syria the lack of hydrological data affects groundwater resource assessment groundwater models provide the means to fill the gaps in the available data in order to improve the understanding of groundwater systems asmael et al 2015 data on water use and pumping are essential to developing a water budget or groundwater flow model the accurate monitoring of agricultural water use is an important factor in reducing the uncertainty of water balance calculation however quantifying groundwater abstraction remains a difficult but necessary challenge agriculture sectors have been used about 60 of the water withdrawn from groundwater resources fao 2015 aw hassan 2014 karstic carbonate rocks are the most interesting potential groundwater reservoirs in syria and the major middle east countries they have high economic value in the regions where they are the main exploitable resource for domestic water supply for the large cities such as damascus al charideh 2011 the main recharge zone of north syria is found on the turkish side due to very well developed karstic limestone and a higher rainfall rate however recharge is very low on the syrian side due to the lower rainfall rate the presence of impermeable neogene deposits and the low density drainage network in the upper jezireh basin several aquifer systems have been identified upper cretaceous paleogene neogene pliocene and quaternary gchs 2000 kattan 2001 2002 abou zakhem 2017 the paleogene and quaternary formations constitute good aquifers with high capacity and hydraulic conductivity the thickness of the jurassic aquifer is about 1000 m on average and can reach a thickness of 2000 m in some places within the basin according to kattan 2006 the hydraulic conductivity of this aquifer ranges from 2 to 99 3 m d and on average is about 18 m d thus the transmissivity could attain a value of around 3085 m2 d cenomanian turonian strata illustrate the cretaceous aquifer the thickness of this aquifer ranges from 400 to 1000 m the hydraulic conductivity of this aquifer system can increase to 80 m d and its transmissivity ranges from 12 to 7435 m2 d kattan 2006 this aquifer unit together with the jurassic one forms the most important water bearing system in the whole country and even in the middle east kattan 2006 un 1982 jica 2001 these two units form large fresh groundwater reservoirs with large storage and withdrawal capacity as well as a considerable discharge of issuing springs la moreaux et al 1989 the neogene deposits largely outcropped along the euphrates river where these deposits consist mainly of gypsum sandstone siltstone silty clays clays and pebbles kattan 2018 also some borehole tests of the neogene aquifer system in this region indicate a high heterogeneity of gypsum formation this formation s transmissivity values are reported at 1 6 10 4 to 8 1 10 2 m2 s un escwa and bgr 2013 abou zakhem and hafez 2015 studied about damascus oasis region they focus on a quaternary alluvial aquifer system consisting of pebble gravel sand silt and clay with 400 450 m thickness the hydraulic conductivity of this aquifer sharply varies from 3 7 to 142 m d and thus the transmissivity 165 3700 m2 d selkhozpromexport 1986 groundwater use in syria has increased considerably and is overexploited in an unsustainable manner almost 60 of all irrigated sites in syria depend on groundwater salman and mualla 2004 areas irrigated by groundwater increased by 140 from 1985 to 2002 somi et al 2002 according to fig 13 about 17 of all groundwater in syria is of good quality with large supplies meanwhile 40 is good quality but non renewable to semi renewable supplies up to 43 of groundwater has a high concentration of so 4 and or nacl the groundwater resources of damascus are nacl and mgso4 type most groundwater resources in ar raqqa and deir ez zor are mgso4 and caso4 water type a high percentage of na cl type groundwater resources are observed in aleppo city generally as sweida latakia and tartous cities have good quality groundwater resources fig 13 4 3 water usage in syria about 87 of all water is used for irrigation with almost 60 taken from groundwater resources which leads to immense and unsustainable exploitation of these resources wada et al 2012 the rest is used for domestic and industrial purposes which account for 9 and 3 respectively salman and mualla 2004 therefore the highest water consumption can be detected in areas where irrigation is common about 44 of water is consumed in the euphrates aleppo basin followed by dejlah khabour most of the groundwater wells were drilled in al hassake region for irrigation fig 14 followed by aleppo and al raqqa respectively where these regions are responsible for almost 70 of groundwater pumping in total table 2 when dividing amounts of withdrawals by the area of each region the al hassake region also accounts for the highest withdrawal per k m 2 followed by deir ez zor and ar raqqa fig 15 5 factors affecting groundwater quality 5 1 natural factors syria has 182 km of direct coastline with the mediterranean sea and this provides a relatively high level of precipitation in the coastal region however due to the presence of mountain chains along the coast they work as a barrier and block most of the movement of rain clouds from reaching the central and western parts of syria this explains the huge difference in precipitation levels in the different basins fig 16 with low precipitation levels water quantity and quality decrease with the increase in salinity concentration additionally due to climate change the temperature in the middle east is expected to rise 2 5 c which will impact precipitation levels of approximately 20 25 which will affect river flow rates this is the case in the euphrates river which is considered the main surface water resource as previously mentioned and will reduce by 29 73 by the year 2050 trondalen 2009 this is specifically dominant in the eastern region of syria due to the harsh environment where precipitation is relatively low 100 mm compared to 900 mm in the western part al charideh et al 2016 and evaporation is higher which facilitates the natural presence of these salts in many parts of the country groundwater quality and quantity have been quite degraded in quayq valley for instance high salinity and depression are present which were expected by wolfart 1966 to result from the evapotranspiration of groundwater considering the absence of halite in qwayq valley as discovered by gruzgiprovodkhoz 1982 and due to the evapotranspiration of groundwater close to earth s surface this can be an indication of the high concentrations of cl found in the valley since groundwater depth there is shallow luijendijk and bruggeman 2008 made an assessment about the jabal al hass region located near aleppo and found that its groundwater contains cl ranging from 0 5 to 3 ds m water with na cl contributes relatively more to excess salinity than other types of water such as the more dominant na so4 type a similar conclusion can be obtained from the location of the jabal al hass region according to fig 5 which is located over groundwater with high nacl fig 17 shows the highest tds to be in the jabal al hass region as well the surrounding region and al hassake have tds ranging from 2500 to 3500 mg l al hassake and aleppo contribute to more than 50 of the total number of wells in syria fig 9 syria s desert and the eastern side have precipitation of less than 200 mm which not only makes water scarce but also worsens its quality figs 17 and 18 illustrate this quite obviously so4 concentration ranges from 150 up to 2000 in desert areas and the euphrates basins while tds is between 1500 and 2500 mg l meanwhile these concentrations gradually decrease moving west where precipitation rates are higher kattan 2018 studied groundwater quality in the euphrates alluvial aquifer he found that the groundwater salinity is primarily due to na cl and so4 2 species these ions can largely be liberated from the dissolution of soluble salt minerals such as halite thenardite mirabilite and bloedite also he mentions that the groundwater quality in the different wells in this region which is unfortunately brackish to saline is harmful and unsuitable for drinking water supply in addition the paleogene and quaternary formations constitute good aquifers with high capacity and hydraulic conductivity however the remaining aquifers are found at depths of more than 1000 m particularly in the northern part of syria and have highly saline waters 5 2 anthropogenic factors agriculture is considered to be the main reason for surface and groundwater contamination some practices by farmers might lead to adverse contamination and a high concentration of nitrates in the soil due to their use of untreated sewage water for the irrigation of their plants according to kattan 2018 the euphrates river water quality in syria at all sites is generally good and suitable for drinking water supply contrary the groundwater quality in the different wells unfortunately with high nitrate concentrations is harmful and unsuitable for drinking water supply a similar case was assessed by abou zakhem and hafez 2015 in damascus oasis and they concluded that the use of direct sewage water for irrigation leads to a high concentration of zinc zn and copper cu which exceeded the standard limits defined by world health organization who and the syrian standards mcl fig 19 warfare has impacts on water availability and human lives too over 250 000 people have been killed and the number is still increasing to the present while others have been severely injured or are missing guha sapir et al 2015 direct impacts include people displaced internally and externally which creates a hard environment for them noticeable reductions in public health and more people that have low or no safe access to drinking water elsafti 2016 due to the ongoing war in syria residents are both directly and indirectly affected direct influences include internal and external displacements of people due to warfare which leads to refugees facing difficulty meeting their basic needs such as safe access to drinking water additionally internal displacement accentuates the presence of an unbalanced concentration of population which leads to the unsustainable use of water resources in some parts of the country such as the hama region fig 20 illustrates the percentage of internally displaced people idp in october 2014 doocy et al 2015 doocy et al 2015 found that 26 2 of 2979 displaced people and 29 8 of 711 non displaced people have poor access to water another indirect influence is the possible deterioration of groundwater quality due to the leachate of contaminants into groundwater especially contaminants related to chemical weapons used in some parts of the region especially two agents of blister agents and nerve agents were used in syria blister agents such as sulfur mustard have a disastrous effect on the eyes respiratory system and internal organs even very low concentrations of the mustard agent can cause serious injuries nevertheless mustard agents decompose into harmless products by means of hydrolysis but have a low solubility in water which reduces its decomposition ivarsson et al 1992 nerve agents such as sarin and vx are extremely toxic and rapidly react when absorbed by the skin or through respiratory systems they prevent the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the nervous system which makes them horribly toxic not just to humans but to other mammals as well sarin is relatively a volatile liquid while vx is not which increases the likelihood of it percolating into groundwater additionally nerve agents such as sarin have a high solubility in water while vx is less soluble especially in warm water resembling blister agents nerve agents can decompose by means of hydrolysis with high alkalinity in the presence of neutral ph however they decompose slowly ivarsson et al 1992 these along with other by product chemicals such as disopropyl methylphosphonate dimp and isopropyl methylphosphonic acid impa were identified by the organization for prohibition of chemical weapons opcw laboratories when samples were taken from syria after the renowned 21 august incident that took place in ghouta near damascus groundwaters are vulnerable to dimp and impa contamination moore et al 2000 table 3 shows temporal and spatial data of cw attacks that took place in syria during the ongoing civil war pita and domingo 2014 and table 4 provides the geological and hydrogeological properties of these regions in addition groundwater quality in these regions is mentioned in table 4 it can be observed that most of the areas with attacks have permeable soil which helps with the chemicals percolate into soil and groundwater this can be hazardous especially for groundwater that has insufficient supplies as this will slow down the dilution of the contaminants in groundwater systems that naturally take place due to groundwater flow just as the case in qasr samrah or abo samrah in hamah fig 21 the cw effect is not limited to groundwater but can also contaminate surface water as well ein tarma one of the sites attacked in the august 21 incident in damascus countryside is almost 400 m from the barada river there is a potential that the river conveyed some chemical contaminants downstream and distributed the contamination even more 6 results and conclusion groundwater resources are one of the most important parameters for sustainability in syria where the regional deep cretaceous aquifer is the major aquifer the most important water resources outcrop in the uplands of anti lebanon coastal and palmyrides mountains groundwater pumping in the semi arid regions of syria has increased significantly over the last two decades due to the development of groundwater based irrigated agriculture luijendijk and bruggema 2008 almost 60 of all irrigated sites in syria depend on groundwater areas that are irrigated by groundwater have increased each year but groundwater resources have been affected by natural and anthropogenic factors salinization is one of the important problems for sustainable agricultural activity this problem which is of particular concern because it can limit socio economic development in many areas continues to attract scientists attention to preserve and protect groundwater quality also global warming and climate change will continue to affect the region in addition anthropogenic factors affect water quality in syria as for the effect of warfare it could be claimed that most of the damaged regions are based on permeable soil such as limestones which increases the probability of groundwater contamination due to cw used not to mention their spatial importance ghouta for instance was renowned as a place used for irrigation from groundwater since it is close to damascus people in the capital and other areas rely on ghouta s irrigation products as their main source of food if the groundwater is polluted pollution could transfer to residents easily whether polluted groundwater is directly absorbed by trees or withdrawn by farmers to water their crops without even considering people s reliance on this water for drinking cw used in warfare is also examined chemicals used can produce harmless by products when hydrolyzed therefore they might not be hazardous however contamination might occur due to pollutants traveling through the soil consequences might be observed in the long term assuming low concentrations of chemical pollutants therefore thorough analyses of groundwater and soil quality are needed after the crisis in damaged areas if such analyses are successful in proving higher concentrations of contaminants than the accepted standards awareness must be raised in the community and solutions for water and soil remediation must be taken seriously additionally more sustainable water management must be established to preserve water quantities in the region since unsustainable withdrawing of groundwater will deplete the aquifers further in al hassake and der ez zor regions particularly groundwater has been unsustainably exploited and with the absence of recharge of resources this will worsen the situation quantitatively and qualitatively groundwater exploitation in the neogene aquifer system is limited by low aquifer productivity and water quality problems a number of surface water irrigation projects initiated over recent decades in syria have contributed to the artificial recharge of the aquifer it is important to manage and control groundwater resources well improvements in the agriculture sector are needed for the sustainability of both surface water and groundwater such as providing more wastewater treatment plants and sustainable irrigation techniques with the increase in water contamination and with the absence of poor water management access to drinking water will be more of a problem than it is now after studying the geological and hydrogeological properties of regions that were affected by cw attacks in syria and identifying the chemical agents and their by products it is very likely that the groundwater in the mentioned areas is contaminated with chemical leachate therefore more studies to experimentally measure groundwater quality should be completed as this does not just influence people s health today but also for generations in the future groundwater quality is significant for people s health in recent years there has been a considerable growth of interest in environmental issues including groundwater quality this brings with it an enormous social responsibility to sustain and safeguard our environment by monitoring and solving risk factors that may be potentially threatening health therefore a comprehensive protection and control system must be developed including the establishment of a groundwater monitoring system the delineation of critical protection zones and the control and elimination of sources of pollution it is also increasing

11902,the resources of groundwater and its pollution in syria are identified and pathways of contaminants to groundwater are described then suggestions for improvement of groundwater quality in syria are evaluated syria is located in a region where water scarcity is dominant about 87 of all water in syria is mainly used for irrigation with almost 60 of this water taken from groundwater resources the rest is used for domestic and industrial purposes which account for 9 and 4 respectively due to over pumping and the increase in the number of unsustainable wells observed in recent decades groundwater is quantitatively deteriorating in general sources of groundwater contamination fall into two main categories natural and anthropogenic sources important sources of natural groundwater pollution include climate effects about 43 of groundwater has a high concentration of so 4 and or nacl this is specifically dominant in the eastern region of syria due to the harsh environment where precipitation is relatively low and evaporation is high one of the major sources of anthropogenic groundwater contamination is civil war most of the damaged regions are located on permeable rocks which increases the probability of groundwater contamination due to chemical weapons cw used it is vital to manage and control groundwater resources well with the increase in water contamination and with the absence of poor water management access to drinking water will be more of a problem than it is now graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality water resources chemical weapons syria 1 introduction syria is renowned for its special location which is the center of the world s three most dominant continents asia europe and africa and has a population of over 22 million fig 1 syria is located in a region where water scarcity is dominant water in syria has mainly used for irrigation and nearly half of irrigation systems use groundwater as their water resource salman and mualla 2004 fig 2 according to fao 2018 special report on syria the country can be divided into the five agro ecological zones aezs based on the level of annual precipitation received as shown in fig 3 zone i cover some 2 7 million hectares and have an average annual rainfall of 400 650 mm zone ii covers about 2 5 million hectares and has an average annual rainfall of 300 400 mm zone iii covers about 1 3 million hectares and has an average annual rainfall of approximately 200 300 mm zone iv is agriculturally marginal with a total area of around 1 8 million hectares and an average annual rainfall of 100 200 mm zone v is the badia or steppe it has approximately 8 3 million hectares and an average annual rainfall of less than 100 mm agriculture accounts for 87 of the water withdrawn from syria s aquifers rivers and lakes fao 2015 aw hassan 2014 unfortunately water availability from both surface and groundwater is decreasing and is expected to decrease further in the future due to the development of groundwater based agriculture water in semi arid regions where water stress is already present and precipitation is low is being over consumed and pumped compared to the previous two decades for instance irrigated areas in some regions of syria with precipitation less than 350 mm year doubled in the duration of 19 years maar 2006 even though an increase in irrigated lands using surface water from rivers or lakes such as in the euphrates river basin projects is observed the overall percentage of lands using groundwater as their resource had risen by 10 in 2004 according to maar 2006 subsequently the water table has lowered by 23 m on average in the years of overexploitation luijendijk and bruggeman 2008 this has an impact on the annual average water per capita with a reduction anticipated to reach 23 between the years 1970 and 2025 fao 2011 furthermore water quality and quantity have been affected dramatically in syria for two reasons natural and anthropogenic consequences although an example of the first is climate change which to some extent can also be considered anthropogenic human practices nowadays cause the highest percentage of damage to water resources around syria where practices have been unsustainable in recent decades the quantity of groundwater has decreased due to over pumping and the increase in the number of illegal and non sustainable wells additionally the quality is affected since salt concentrations increase with the absence of water irrigation also has a major influence on the quality of groundwater wada et al 2012 another major anthropogenic cause of damage is civil war lawrence et al 2015 discussed the effect of warfare on the ecosystem explaining that chemicals used in weapons that are built to cause damage to human lives also have an adverse effect on the environment such weapons related chemicals can contaminate surface water soil and groundwater which in turn toxifies plants animals feeding on them food irrigated by polluted water springs and rivers by the transport of contaminated sediments etc the direct effect of ongoing warfare related to water such as safe access to water for displaced people has been well examined however the indirect long term effects of warfare such as the percolation of contaminants into the soil especially in cases in which chemical weapons cw have been used have not been highlighted in the literature important sources of natural groundwater pollution in syria include geogenic factors the major sources of anthropogenic groundwater contamination in syria are climate change agricultural activities over pumping and chemical weapons this paper aims to review groundwater resources and focus on underlying natural and anthropogenic influences on water resources in syria 2 geological and hydrogeological properties of the studied area numerous studies were completed about the geological and tectonic properties of syria e g ponikarov 1966 al maleh 1976 mouty and al maleh 1992 sawaf et al 1993 sharland et al 2001 brew et al 2001 these studies concentrated on the particularly well exposed mesozoic carbonate section in the palmyride fold and thrust belt the syrian coastal ranges and the kurd dagh mountains fig 4 sharland et al 2001 provided the first sequence stratigraphic synthesis of arabian plate stratigraphy and brew et al 2001 synthesized the tectonic evolution of the entire country syria occupies an area of 186 000 km2 located in the northern part of the arabian peninsula platform syria is renowned for its sophisticated geologic and structural setting about 75 of syria s land is covered by sedimentary rocks which mostly consist of carboniferous rocks fragmented materials and evaporate rocks and the geological age of these rocks is triassic and neogene the remaining part is mainly covered with volcanic rocks such as basalt flows from the upper jurassic and lower cretaceous additionally ophiolite rocks with associated volcanic sedimentary rocks can be found in the north and northwest regions of syria ponikarov and mikihilov 1989 geologically the country can be divided into two major parts a mountainous chain in the western part which starts from the southwest and extends all the way to turkey adjacent to the mediterranean sea and the plateau part in the eastern region the western mountains function as a precipitation barrier which explains the relatively low precipitation rate on the plateau and the presence of deserts this geologic evolution and tectonic properties of syria have created conditions most suitable for preserving groundwater resources subsequently groundwater is mainly found in abundance in the western part with a relatively greater supply and subsequently better groundwater quality also numerous studies were completed about the hydrogeological properties of syria most of these studies focus on a local problem al charideh and kattaa 2016 concentrated on hydrostratigraphic properties of units in syria aw hassan 2014 studied the impact of food and agricultural policies on groundwater use in syria voss et al 2013 studied groundwater depletion and transboundary water management in the tigris euphrates luijendijk and bruggeman 2008 studied groundwater resources jabal al hass region kattan 2006 focused on the characterization of surface water and groundwater in the damascus ghotta basin jica 2001 studied of water resources development in the western and central basins in syrian la moreaux 1989 studied hydrogeological assessment figeh spring damascus wolfart 1964 worked on the hydrogeology of the damascus basin and asmael et al 2014 studied on hydrochemistry to delineate groundwater flow conditions in the mogher al mer area al charideh and kattaa 2016 provided a summary of the hydrostratigraphic units fig 5 lower and upper cretaceous aquifers are generally the main hydrogeological succession in syria the existence of paleogene neogene and jurassic aquifers is minor limestone and dolomite aquifers constitute more than 50 of other types selkhozpromexport 1979 and khouri et al 1984 described aquifer and aquitard systems in more detail the regional deep cretaceous aquifer contributes to more than 80 of aquifers in the stations shown in fig 3a which is an indication that it is part of the massive upper mesozoic sedimentary sequence that constitutes the major aquifer units in syria and the middle east as for carbonates they constitute the most extensive aquifers in syria and the most vital water resources al charideh and kattaa 2016 very few studies were done about groundwater modeling in syria groundwater modeling has been widely used to investigate groundwater system dynamics and understand flow patterns anderson and woessner 1992 chiang and kinzelbach 1998 asmael et al 2015 developed a groundwater model representing the groundwater flow system in the complex of the northeastern part of mt hermon and improved the hydrogeological understanding of this system the result of this study is indicated that the lateral discharge from the jurassic karstic aquifer into neogene conglomerates and the recharge by infiltrated meteoric precipitation are the most important mechanisms in recharging the upper aquifer horizon 3 methodological approach the geopolitical characteristics of syria turn it into a unique subject of study while natural resources are being investigated generally we can divide the data sources available in the case of study into two main periods before and post era of war in syria while it can be found several studies and sources of information about the natural geographical and socio economical structure of syria before 2011 these resources dramatically decrease in the post war period consequently there are significant knowledge gaps about the case of study in the post 2011 era this un equivalent geospatial data quality is the main challenge of the study for understanding the issue this study classified the available sources of information as main and clues in a geospatial database the main data sources are used to understand the geographical characteristics of syria and used for creating enhancing and verification of further rare data sources after the 2011 period initially the study gathered official and academic published data in the same geospatial dataset geo referencing digitizing and geoprocessing of these sources information provide is the essential content of the main database later other sources of information with a lower level of accuracy or consistency are gathered in the clue database overlapping these two databases provide a third source of geographical information that is used for the evaluation subject of study fig 6 briefly illustrates the main methodological approach of this study 4 water resources of syria 4 1 surface water there are seven main basins in syria fig 7 table 1 shows some characteristics of these basins most of the surface water in syria is shared with other neighboring countries surface water is the general source in syria the euphrates river alone accounts for about 85 of the water that is available to syria lowi 1995 it covers a total distance of 2800 km and also a population of 5 930 million inhabitants lives there the basin of orontes with a population of 3 830 million inhabitants and nearly 18 000 ha areas owns a second high capacity of precipitation the next river in terms of internal size is the oronates which originates from lebanon passing through syria and turkey is also located in this basin the most famous lake on that river is found in homs district other major rivers include the tigris khabur sajur and balikh areas that are irrigated with surface water have remarkably increased for instance 583 000 ha of irrigated lands used surface water in 2002 compared to 334 000 ha in 1985 somi et al 2002 european commission published data about surface water resources of syria in 2019 which gives remarkable information about the case of the study s surface water situation in 34 years according to this data set the recurrence percentage of surface water resources in orontes euphrates and aleppo basins remain notably high while in east regions dajleh and khabour basins is significantly low fig 8 water occurrence maps fig 9 provide critical information on surface water availability in a different region in the same period for example membidi homs and hasakeh regions are mostly recognized with permanent surface water while in regions like palmyra or aleppo surface water resources are temporary water occurrence change intensity is shown in fig 10 in 34 years east regions have increased change intensity in surface water this factor remains with no change in some northern regions and aleppo and homs another significant variable in the data set is the transition of surface water that elaborates in figs 11 and 12 the data set also provides clear information about the transition of surface water in this period the observation results indicate that in regions like hasakeh and membidi or palmyra some new seasonal and permanent surface water is available this transition reveals for the aleppo region in more detail in fig 12 4 2 groundwater in developing countries such as syria the lack of hydrological data affects groundwater resource assessment groundwater models provide the means to fill the gaps in the available data in order to improve the understanding of groundwater systems asmael et al 2015 data on water use and pumping are essential to developing a water budget or groundwater flow model the accurate monitoring of agricultural water use is an important factor in reducing the uncertainty of water balance calculation however quantifying groundwater abstraction remains a difficult but necessary challenge agriculture sectors have been used about 60 of the water withdrawn from groundwater resources fao 2015 aw hassan 2014 karstic carbonate rocks are the most interesting potential groundwater reservoirs in syria and the major middle east countries they have high economic value in the regions where they are the main exploitable resource for domestic water supply for the large cities such as damascus al charideh 2011 the main recharge zone of north syria is found on the turkish side due to very well developed karstic limestone and a higher rainfall rate however recharge is very low on the syrian side due to the lower rainfall rate the presence of impermeable neogene deposits and the low density drainage network in the upper jezireh basin several aquifer systems have been identified upper cretaceous paleogene neogene pliocene and quaternary gchs 2000 kattan 2001 2002 abou zakhem 2017 the paleogene and quaternary formations constitute good aquifers with high capacity and hydraulic conductivity the thickness of the jurassic aquifer is about 1000 m on average and can reach a thickness of 2000 m in some places within the basin according to kattan 2006 the hydraulic conductivity of this aquifer ranges from 2 to 99 3 m d and on average is about 18 m d thus the transmissivity could attain a value of around 3085 m2 d cenomanian turonian strata illustrate the cretaceous aquifer the thickness of this aquifer ranges from 400 to 1000 m the hydraulic conductivity of this aquifer system can increase to 80 m d and its transmissivity ranges from 12 to 7435 m2 d kattan 2006 this aquifer unit together with the jurassic one forms the most important water bearing system in the whole country and even in the middle east kattan 2006 un 1982 jica 2001 these two units form large fresh groundwater reservoirs with large storage and withdrawal capacity as well as a considerable discharge of issuing springs la moreaux et al 1989 the neogene deposits largely outcropped along the euphrates river where these deposits consist mainly of gypsum sandstone siltstone silty clays clays and pebbles kattan 2018 also some borehole tests of the neogene aquifer system in this region indicate a high heterogeneity of gypsum formation this formation s transmissivity values are reported at 1 6 10 4 to 8 1 10 2 m2 s un escwa and bgr 2013 abou zakhem and hafez 2015 studied about damascus oasis region they focus on a quaternary alluvial aquifer system consisting of pebble gravel sand silt and clay with 400 450 m thickness the hydraulic conductivity of this aquifer sharply varies from 3 7 to 142 m d and thus the transmissivity 165 3700 m2 d selkhozpromexport 1986 groundwater use in syria has increased considerably and is overexploited in an unsustainable manner almost 60 of all irrigated sites in syria depend on groundwater salman and mualla 2004 areas irrigated by groundwater increased by 140 from 1985 to 2002 somi et al 2002 according to fig 13 about 17 of all groundwater in syria is of good quality with large supplies meanwhile 40 is good quality but non renewable to semi renewable supplies up to 43 of groundwater has a high concentration of so 4 and or nacl the groundwater resources of damascus are nacl and mgso4 type most groundwater resources in ar raqqa and deir ez zor are mgso4 and caso4 water type a high percentage of na cl type groundwater resources are observed in aleppo city generally as sweida latakia and tartous cities have good quality groundwater resources fig 13 4 3 water usage in syria about 87 of all water is used for irrigation with almost 60 taken from groundwater resources which leads to immense and unsustainable exploitation of these resources wada et al 2012 the rest is used for domestic and industrial purposes which account for 9 and 3 respectively salman and mualla 2004 therefore the highest water consumption can be detected in areas where irrigation is common about 44 of water is consumed in the euphrates aleppo basin followed by dejlah khabour most of the groundwater wells were drilled in al hassake region for irrigation fig 14 followed by aleppo and al raqqa respectively where these regions are responsible for almost 70 of groundwater pumping in total table 2 when dividing amounts of withdrawals by the area of each region the al hassake region also accounts for the highest withdrawal per k m 2 followed by deir ez zor and ar raqqa fig 15 5 factors affecting groundwater quality 5 1 natural factors syria has 182 km of direct coastline with the mediterranean sea and this provides a relatively high level of precipitation in the coastal region however due to the presence of mountain chains along the coast they work as a barrier and block most of the movement of rain clouds from reaching the central and western parts of syria this explains the huge difference in precipitation levels in the different basins fig 16 with low precipitation levels water quantity and quality decrease with the increase in salinity concentration additionally due to climate change the temperature in the middle east is expected to rise 2 5 c which will impact precipitation levels of approximately 20 25 which will affect river flow rates this is the case in the euphrates river which is considered the main surface water resource as previously mentioned and will reduce by 29 73 by the year 2050 trondalen 2009 this is specifically dominant in the eastern region of syria due to the harsh environment where precipitation is relatively low 100 mm compared to 900 mm in the western part al charideh et al 2016 and evaporation is higher which facilitates the natural presence of these salts in many parts of the country groundwater quality and quantity have been quite degraded in quayq valley for instance high salinity and depression are present which were expected by wolfart 1966 to result from the evapotranspiration of groundwater considering the absence of halite in qwayq valley as discovered by gruzgiprovodkhoz 1982 and due to the evapotranspiration of groundwater close to earth s surface this can be an indication of the high concentrations of cl found in the valley since groundwater depth there is shallow luijendijk and bruggeman 2008 made an assessment about the jabal al hass region located near aleppo and found that its groundwater contains cl ranging from 0 5 to 3 ds m water with na cl contributes relatively more to excess salinity than other types of water such as the more dominant na so4 type a similar conclusion can be obtained from the location of the jabal al hass region according to fig 5 which is located over groundwater with high nacl fig 17 shows the highest tds to be in the jabal al hass region as well the surrounding region and al hassake have tds ranging from 2500 to 3500 mg l al hassake and aleppo contribute to more than 50 of the total number of wells in syria fig 9 syria s desert and the eastern side have precipitation of less than 200 mm which not only makes water scarce but also worsens its quality figs 17 and 18 illustrate this quite obviously so4 concentration ranges from 150 up to 2000 in desert areas and the euphrates basins while tds is between 1500 and 2500 mg l meanwhile these concentrations gradually decrease moving west where precipitation rates are higher kattan 2018 studied groundwater quality in the euphrates alluvial aquifer he found that the groundwater salinity is primarily due to na cl and so4 2 species these ions can largely be liberated from the dissolution of soluble salt minerals such as halite thenardite mirabilite and bloedite also he mentions that the groundwater quality in the different wells in this region which is unfortunately brackish to saline is harmful and unsuitable for drinking water supply in addition the paleogene and quaternary formations constitute good aquifers with high capacity and hydraulic conductivity however the remaining aquifers are found at depths of more than 1000 m particularly in the northern part of syria and have highly saline waters 5 2 anthropogenic factors agriculture is considered to be the main reason for surface and groundwater contamination some practices by farmers might lead to adverse contamination and a high concentration of nitrates in the soil due to their use of untreated sewage water for the irrigation of their plants according to kattan 2018 the euphrates river water quality in syria at all sites is generally good and suitable for drinking water supply contrary the groundwater quality in the different wells unfortunately with high nitrate concentrations is harmful and unsuitable for drinking water supply a similar case was assessed by abou zakhem and hafez 2015 in damascus oasis and they concluded that the use of direct sewage water for irrigation leads to a high concentration of zinc zn and copper cu which exceeded the standard limits defined by world health organization who and the syrian standards mcl fig 19 warfare has impacts on water availability and human lives too over 250 000 people have been killed and the number is still increasing to the present while others have been severely injured or are missing guha sapir et al 2015 direct impacts include people displaced internally and externally which creates a hard environment for them noticeable reductions in public health and more people that have low or no safe access to drinking water elsafti 2016 due to the ongoing war in syria residents are both directly and indirectly affected direct influences include internal and external displacements of people due to warfare which leads to refugees facing difficulty meeting their basic needs such as safe access to drinking water additionally internal displacement accentuates the presence of an unbalanced concentration of population which leads to the unsustainable use of water resources in some parts of the country such as the hama region fig 20 illustrates the percentage of internally displaced people idp in october 2014 doocy et al 2015 doocy et al 2015 found that 26 2 of 2979 displaced people and 29 8 of 711 non displaced people have poor access to water another indirect influence is the possible deterioration of groundwater quality due to the leachate of contaminants into groundwater especially contaminants related to chemical weapons used in some parts of the region especially two agents of blister agents and nerve agents were used in syria blister agents such as sulfur mustard have a disastrous effect on the eyes respiratory system and internal organs even very low concentrations of the mustard agent can cause serious injuries nevertheless mustard agents decompose into harmless products by means of hydrolysis but have a low solubility in water which reduces its decomposition ivarsson et al 1992 nerve agents such as sarin and vx are extremely toxic and rapidly react when absorbed by the skin or through respiratory systems they prevent the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the nervous system which makes them horribly toxic not just to humans but to other mammals as well sarin is relatively a volatile liquid while vx is not which increases the likelihood of it percolating into groundwater additionally nerve agents such as sarin have a high solubility in water while vx is less soluble especially in warm water resembling blister agents nerve agents can decompose by means of hydrolysis with high alkalinity in the presence of neutral ph however they decompose slowly ivarsson et al 1992 these along with other by product chemicals such as disopropyl methylphosphonate dimp and isopropyl methylphosphonic acid impa were identified by the organization for prohibition of chemical weapons opcw laboratories when samples were taken from syria after the renowned 21 august incident that took place in ghouta near damascus groundwaters are vulnerable to dimp and impa contamination moore et al 2000 table 3 shows temporal and spatial data of cw attacks that took place in syria during the ongoing civil war pita and domingo 2014 and table 4 provides the geological and hydrogeological properties of these regions in addition groundwater quality in these regions is mentioned in table 4 it can be observed that most of the areas with attacks have permeable soil which helps with the chemicals percolate into soil and groundwater this can be hazardous especially for groundwater that has insufficient supplies as this will slow down the dilution of the contaminants in groundwater systems that naturally take place due to groundwater flow just as the case in qasr samrah or abo samrah in hamah fig 21 the cw effect is not limited to groundwater but can also contaminate surface water as well ein tarma one of the sites attacked in the august 21 incident in damascus countryside is almost 400 m from the barada river there is a potential that the river conveyed some chemical contaminants downstream and distributed the contamination even more 6 results and conclusion groundwater resources are one of the most important parameters for sustainability in syria where the regional deep cretaceous aquifer is the major aquifer the most important water resources outcrop in the uplands of anti lebanon coastal and palmyrides mountains groundwater pumping in the semi arid regions of syria has increased significantly over the last two decades due to the development of groundwater based irrigated agriculture luijendijk and bruggema 2008 almost 60 of all irrigated sites in syria depend on groundwater areas that are irrigated by groundwater have increased each year but groundwater resources have been affected by natural and anthropogenic factors salinization is one of the important problems for sustainable agricultural activity this problem which is of particular concern because it can limit socio economic development in many areas continues to attract scientists attention to preserve and protect groundwater quality also global warming and climate change will continue to affect the region in addition anthropogenic factors affect water quality in syria as for the effect of warfare it could be claimed that most of the damaged regions are based on permeable soil such as limestones which increases the probability of groundwater contamination due to cw used not to mention their spatial importance ghouta for instance was renowned as a place used for irrigation from groundwater since it is close to damascus people in the capital and other areas rely on ghouta s irrigation products as their main source of food if the groundwater is polluted pollution could transfer to residents easily whether polluted groundwater is directly absorbed by trees or withdrawn by farmers to water their crops without even considering people s reliance on this water for drinking cw used in warfare is also examined chemicals used can produce harmless by products when hydrolyzed therefore they might not be hazardous however contamination might occur due to pollutants traveling through the soil consequences might be observed in the long term assuming low concentrations of chemical pollutants therefore thorough analyses of groundwater and soil quality are needed after the crisis in damaged areas if such analyses are successful in proving higher concentrations of contaminants than the accepted standards awareness must be raised in the community and solutions for water and soil remediation must be taken seriously additionally more sustainable water management must be established to preserve water quantities in the region since unsustainable withdrawing of groundwater will deplete the aquifers further in al hassake and der ez zor regions particularly groundwater has been unsustainably exploited and with the absence of recharge of resources this will worsen the situation quantitatively and qualitatively groundwater exploitation in the neogene aquifer system is limited by low aquifer productivity and water quality problems a number of surface water irrigation projects initiated over recent decades in syria have contributed to the artificial recharge of the aquifer it is important to manage and control groundwater resources well improvements in the agriculture sector are needed for the sustainability of both surface water and groundwater such as providing more wastewater treatment plants and sustainable irrigation techniques with the increase in water contamination and with the absence of poor water management access to drinking water will be more of a problem than it is now after studying the geological and hydrogeological properties of regions that were affected by cw attacks in syria and identifying the chemical agents and their by products it is very likely that the groundwater in the mentioned areas is contaminated with chemical leachate therefore more studies to experimentally measure groundwater quality should be completed as this does not just influence people s health today but also for generations in the future groundwater quality is significant for people s health in recent years there has been a considerable growth of interest in environmental issues including groundwater quality this brings with it an enormous social responsibility to sustain and safeguard our environment by monitoring and solving risk factors that may be potentially threatening health therefore a comprehensive protection and control system must be developed including the establishment of a groundwater monitoring system the delineation of critical protection zones and the control and elimination of sources of pollution it is also increasing

telluric profiling bedrock structure 1 introduction the availability of water resources and adequate shelter has played very significant roles in the existence and sustenance of human settlement in any region of the planet earth water resources are natural resources required for agricultural industrial household recreational and environmental activities fresh water constitutes just about 2 5 of the water on the earth and is found mainly as groundwater with only a small fraction present above ground or in the air groundwater usually found in soil pore spaces and fractures of rock formations is not uniformly distributed everywhere with its occurrence manifesting a lot of variability from one geological formation to another ayenew et al 2008 producible and renewable zones of groundwater resources are limited and difficult to predict in crystalline bedrock by virtue of the heterogeneity and anisotropy in rock fracture systems earon et al 2015 in a typical crystalline basement complex

et al 1992 olorunniwo and olorunfemi 1987 olorunfemi et al 1995 however shallow groundwater zones in crystalline basement terrains can be tapped with minimal cost compared to the more expensive surface water development ayoade 1975 rao 2006 olutoyin et al 2014 the occurrence of groundwater in a sedimentary terrain is much more promising mainly due to presence of several porous and permeable geological strata except for the concern on chemical composition which greatly affect its quality ayoade 1975 macdonald and davies 2000 khali 2009 khatri and tyagi 2015 the major advantages regarding groundwater prospecting in hard rock terrain are its relative low cost and the chances of obtaining quality water in majorly metamorphosed rock the discontinuous characteristics of basement aquifer systems makes comprehensive understanding of the geological and hydrogeological characteristics of formations and the applicable geophysical investigations inevitable in groundwater prospecting chandra et al 2010 fractures and discontinuities faults joints shear zones and dykes are among the most important geological structures in typical hard rock terrain fractures are important in engineering geotechnical and hydrogeological practices because they provide pathways for fluid flow many economically significant petroleum geothermal and water supply reservoirs are formed in fractured rocks fractured systems control the dispersion of chemical contaminants into and through the subsurface they also affect the stability of engineering structures dams and excavations soupios

physical properties or anomalous values of geophysical properties within the earth s crust density magnetism elasticity and electrical resistivity are properties that are most commonly measured the purpose of all geophysical survey is to detect the indirect indicators and locate the potential zones for exploitation geophysical investigations using electrical electromagnetic gravity and magnetic methods have been very useful in solving hydrogeological problems geophysical methods have also been implemented in a broad spectrum of engineering applications ranging from building ground

saturation fluid conductivity porosity and permeability kelly 1977 kosinski and kelly 1981 kelly and reiter 1984 mazac et al 1985 hunterley 1986 the magnetotelluric mt method is a passive geophysical method which involves the measurements of the natural geoelectric and geomagnetic field variation of the earth from which it is possible to model the earth s resistivity structure tikhonov 1950 cagniard 1953 strangway et al 1973 beyer 1977 zohdy et al 1974 in the telluric profiling tp method the electrical conductivity structure of the subsurface is imaged by using earth s natural electromagnetic fields as a source the primary incident electromagnetic em fields are considered as planar in geometry and propagating vertically downward em waves travel diffusively in the earth so that high frequency short wavelength waves penetrate a relatively short distance while low frequency long wavelength waves reach greater depths the main advantage of tp is the wide survey depth range from hundreds of meters down to several kilometers the magnetotelluric method mt uses even lower frequencies and the survey depth can therefore even be hundreds of kilometers mt measurement requires a simultaneous time series of orthogonal components of magnetic bx by and bz and electric ex and ey fields resulting from large scale solar driven ionospheric and magnetospheric electric currents the energy sources for frequencies above 1 hz are em waves caused by distant lightning storms and they propagate within the earth ionosphere waveguide garcia and jones 2002 in the telluric current method electric current variations are measured simultaneously at two stations comparison of the acquired data permits the determination of differences in the apparent resistivity with depth at the two stations electrical resistivity method using the vertical electrical depth sounding ves technique remains a unique approach in mineral prospecting hydrogeological and engineering studies singhal and gupta 2010 this technique produces a one dimensional profile of the resistivity model beneath the midpoint of the survey and interpreted result is used to delineate the vertical 1 d variation in

in the southern part of the ancient ife city in osun state southwest nigeria ife is located within latitude 7 26 n and 7 32 n and longitude 4 29 e and 4 35 e covering an area of about 1894 km2 fig 1 ife falls within the humid tropical environment with high temperature and rainfall typical of the tropical rainforest belt ajala and olayiwola 2013 it is characterized by marked wet march october and dry seasons november february the mean monthly temperature ranges between 23 c and 27 c in the dry season the temperature can be as high as 29 4 c while in the rainy season it can be as high as 25 6 c the relative humidity ranges between 67 and 88 ajala and olayiwola 2013 the city is situated on elevation of about 270 m above mean sea level fig 2 southwestern nigeria basement complex region lies between latitudes 7 n and 10 n and longitudes 3 e and 6 e situated in the equatorial rain forest region of africa the dominant lithologies include amphibolites migmatite gneisses granites and pegmatites other important rock units are the schists made up of biotite schist quartzite schist talc tremolite schist and the muscovite schists the crystalline rocks intruded into these schistose rocks oyinloye 2011 ife is underlain by the precambrian basement complex rocks in nigeria part of the mobile belt between the west african craton and the congo craton fig 3 the major basement rocks include granite gneiss grey gneiss and mica schist the gneisses are intruded by dolerite dykes and veins of fine grained granite gneiss other minor rock types include quartz veins and pegmatite oyinloye 1998 in areas underlain by schist the basement rock is generally concealed by variably thick overburden the current relief is a product of the past and continuous weathering process giving rise to considerable reduction in height in the center of the town soils in the study area are derived from the materials of old basement complex which is mainly made up of granitic metamorphosed sedimentary rock 3 methods two geophysical methods were employed as a means of resolving ambiguities in geological profiles of subsurface materials in the study location four traverses each 100 m long at 50 m apart were outlined at the study site two telluric profiling tp data were acquired along each traverse using pqwt tc150 equipment hunan puqi geologic exploration equipment institute hunan china the equipment utilizes the natural electric field as working electromagnetic field source based on the resistivity differences of the subsurface layers and measures the natural electric field on the ground of n different frequencies in this case a maximum of 33 frequencies of electric field components this equipment consists of three major components mt receiver data recorder electric cable and copper electrodes with alloy electrode bar the resolution of measurement is up to 0 001 mv with precision of 2 electric field measurements were made by stretching a long wire connected to two electrodes at its ends and measuring the difference in voltage between the two electrodes positions fig 4 a the electrode separation employed usually depends on the telluric intensity present and the sensitivity of the recording instrument investigation using an array of three inline electrodes placed along the traverse line to form two consecutive grounded electric dipoles with the central electrode in common have been reported beyer 1977 signals from the two dipoles are filtered about a band of high geomagnetic activity to give amplitude ratio and phase difference the array is moved along the survey line to obtain continuous relative electric field intensity ratios exploration depth varies inversely with frequency and usually two or more frequencies are recorded and analyzed beyer 1977 also measurements of telluric currents via four electrodes and a voltmeter have been conducted the electrode pairs measure the potential difference at the earth s surface between two points and perpendicular components of the electric field are recorded zohdy et al 1974 in this study data was collected at each measurement point the mean point between the two electrodes along four traverses with each traverse running along n s direction point o is the point for the first set of data fig 4a the distance between the two electrodes n and m was generally between 5 and 10 m and the stepwise displacement usually kept constant for the entire line of the device along the profile line with both electrodes between 0 5 and 2 m after data collection the instrument automatically generates electric field plots indicating telluric signal amplitude variations per frequency at stations samples are presented in fig 5 and 2 d profile map cross section parallel to the profile line by the unique built in computing functions the inversion routine is most likely based on the smoothness constrained least squares method from the profile map the lateral variations with depth of subsurface geological structure is depicted and hence the delineation of the location of the geologic features of interest such as ore body cave and aquifer etc is possible vertical electrical sounding ves data were also acquired along the four traverses at interstation spacing of 60 m making a total of eight soundings abem terrameter sas 1000 abem instrument ab sweden was used for the ves investigation consecutive readings are usually taken automatically and the result are average continuously sas results are more reliable than those obtained using single shot systems schlumberger array fig 4b was adopted by virtue of its greater depth of penetration muskat and evinger 1941 roy and apparao 1971 roy and elliot 1981 banerjee and pal 1986 barker 1989 four electrode were positioned symmetrically along a straight line with the current electrodes c1 and c2 on the outside and the potential electrodes p1 and p2 as the inner electrodes placed in between c1 and c2 fig 4b the maximum current electrode spacing ab 2 was 100 m and the terrameter was used to measured and record the resistance of the subsurface the values of the resistance obtained from field measurements were multiplied with the corresponding geometric factor k to give the respective apparent resistivities the acquired data was processed with the aid of ipi2win software geoscan m ltd moscow a program for 1d automatic and manual interpretation of ves data within the framework of horizontally layered earth models samples of curves obtained as output from data processing are presented in fig 6 4 results and discussions telluric profiling results are presented as 2 d profile cross section maps figs 7 10 these pseudo sections indicate the sensitivity of mt data to the conductance of the subsurface geological sequence underlying measurement points haghighi et al 2018 prasanta et al 2005 vertical axis represents the depth from the top to the subsurface layers in meters while the horizontal axis represents the occupied points stations along the traverses in meters red orange indicates high strength and high resistivity layer competent deep fresh bedrock yellow indicates moderate strength and moderate resistivity layer competent shallow basement rock light blue and blue indicates soft broken rock formation weathered fractured rock zone the two sections along traverse 1 fig 7 reveals similar subsurface layer sequence with regolith of weathered bedrock up to a depth of about 20 m underlain by basement rock both shallow and fairly deeper aquifers are recognizable from the weathered fractured rock zone along this traverse at depth below 20 m furthermore this segment of the study location could be well suited for placement of foundation of buildings since the basement rock zone is at shallow depth below the surface traverse 2 fig 8 also manifest a similar geological sequence except that the high resistivity fresh basement is deeper and the last few meters where there is a likelihood of a fault followed by lateral and extensive weathered fractured bedrock obviously beyond the coverage of this study locations around this traverse could as well be utilized for placement of foundation of structures while the latter part with faults and fractures are well suited for borehole drilling however erection of structures on the fault segment depicted on this traverse should be avoided to forestall any adverse effect on stability of structures the subsurface layer sequence in the vicinity of traverses 3 and 4 figs 9 and 10 are mainly composed of some vast strata predominantly of weathered fractured basement at considerable depth therefore groundwater potential of regions around these two traverse is very high consequently these locations are recommended for siting of boreholes for groundwater exploitation some outcrops are also deciphered at several points along traverse 4 the ves results are interpreted in terms of expected weathering profile in a typical basement complex terrain characteristic of hard rock areas of africa fig 11 generally this consists of a sequence of topsoil usually composed of residual quartz rich soils with micas clays and laterite layer s of weathered rock fractured rock zones and basement rock fresh bedrock jones 1985 ves results are in good agreement with the tp results and provides quantitative description and interpretation of the subsurface strata in terms of layer resistivity and thickness the resistivity cross sections depict significant variations in resistivity values for the eight stations occupied along all the four traverses 1 d geoelectric model figs 12 15 generated from ves analysis and interpretation revealed a maximum of four subsurface layers which are topsoil 71 371 ωm weathered layer 22 94 ωm fractured intensely fractured bedrock 453 496 ωm and 122 311 ωm respectively and fresh basement bedrock 533 1088 ωm shallow aquifer zones constituting weathered bedrock of thickness between 1 44 and 5 17 m are recognizable at depth below 5 m at ves stations 1 4 relatively deeper zone of fractured bedrock of thickness ranging between 3 65 and 12 20 m at depth range of 2 38 5 82 m was also delineated at ves stations 1 4 this fractured zone could serve as a medium of high groundwater potential in the study location the weathered layers delineated across the study location is presumably composed of clay rich materials clayey sandy clay which are products of the weathering of the underlying schist bedrock ayolabi et al 2009 this medium is a less permeable bed of aquitard with permeability not sufficient to allow the completion of production wells hence it is safe to target the fractured zones for productive groundwater exploitation in the present study location 5 conclusion integrated geophysical survey using telluric profiling tp and vertical electrical sounding ves techniques have been employed to delineate the subsurface sequence and structure at a site reserved for future commercial development in ife southwest nigeria the study has been conducted to provide geological data to assist in identifying locations of high potentials for good groundwater resource development and also to map suitable locations for infrastructural development of the area results of the two techniques tp cross sections and geoelectric sections are in good agreement although tp technique probed far deeper depth into the subsurface than the ves technique the main geological units delineated are topsoil mainly laterite weathered layer fractured zones and fresh basement bedrock from the ground surface to depth of about 20 m the tp cross section which provided lateral subsurface variations also depict the presence of fault zones at the latter segment of a traverse the regions with fractured zone have been delineated at several spots for groundwater resource development in the study location since fractures are high potential zones to store and allow movement of groundwater in hard rocks terrain the weathered layers delineated across the study site is presumably composed of clay rich materials clayey sandy clay which are products of the weathering of the underlying schist bedrock this medium is a less permeable bed of aquitard with low permeability insufficient for productive groundwater wells furthermore areas underlain by competent fresh

at shallow depth below the surface traverse 2 fig 8 also manifest a similar geological sequence except that the high resistivity fresh basement is deeper and the last few meters where there is a likelihood of a fault followed by lateral and extensive weathered fractured bedrock obviously beyond the coverage of this study locations around this traverse could as well be utilized for placement of foundation of structures while the latter part with faults and fractures are well suited for borehole drilling however erection of structures on the fault segment depicted on this traverse should be avoided to forestall any adverse effect on stability of structures the subsurface layer sequence in the vicinity of traverses 3 and 4 figs 9 and 10 are mainly composed of some vast strata predominantly of weathered fractured basement at considerable depth therefore groundwater potential of regions around these two traverse is very high consequently these locations are recommended for siting of boreholes for groundwater exploitation some outcrops are also deciphered at several points along traverse 4 the ves results are interpreted in terms of expected weathering profile in a typical basement complex terrain characteristic of hard rock areas of africa fig 11 generally this consists of a sequence of topsoil usually composed of residual quartz rich soils with micas clays and laterite layer s of weathered rock fractured rock zones and basement rock fresh bedrock jones 1985 ves results are in good agreement with the tp results and provides quantitative description and interpretation of the subsurface strata in terms of layer resistivity and thickness the resistivity cross sections depict significant variations in resistivity values for the eight stations occupied along all the four traverses 1 d geoelectric model figs 12 15 generated from ves analysis and interpretation revealed a maximum of four subsurface layers which are topsoil 71 371 ωm weathered layer 22 94 ωm fractured intensely fractured bedrock 453 496 ωm and 122 311 ωm respectively and fresh basement bedrock 533 1088 ωm shallow aquifer zones constituting weathered bedrock of thickness between 1 44 and 5 17 m are recognizable at depth below 5 m at ves stations 1 4 relatively deeper zone of fractured bedrock of thickness ranging between 3 65 and 12 20 m at depth range of 2 38 5 82 m was also delineated at ves stations 1 4 this fractured zone could serve as a medium of high groundwater potential in the study location the weathered layers delineated across the study location is presumably composed of clay rich materials clayey sandy clay which are products of the weathering of the underlying schist bedrock ayolabi et al 2009 this medium is a less permeable bed of aquitard with permeability not sufficient to allow the completion of production wells hence it is safe to target the fractured zones for productive groundwater exploitation in the present study location 5 conclusion integrated geophysical survey using telluric profiling tp and vertical electrical sounding ves techniques have been employed to delineate the subsurface sequence and structure at a site reserved for future commercial development in ife southwest nigeria the study has been conducted to provide geological data to assist in identifying locations of high potentials for good groundwater resource development and also to map suitable locations for infrastructural development of the area results of the two techniques tp cross sections and geoelectric sections are in good agreement although tp technique probed far deeper depth into the subsurface than the ves technique the main geological units delineated are topsoil mainly laterite weathered layer fractured zones and fresh basement bedrock from the ground surface to depth of about 20 m the tp cross section which provided lateral subsurface variations also depict the presence of fault zones at the latter segment of a traverse the regions with fractured zone have been delineated at several spots for groundwater resource development in the study location since fractures are high potential zones to store and allow movement of groundwater in hard rocks terrain the weathered layers delineated across the study site is presumably composed of clay rich materials clayey sandy clay which are products of the weathering of the underlying schist bedrock this medium is a less permeable bed of aquitard with low permeability insufficient for productive groundwater wells furthermore areas underlain by competent fresh bedrock at considerable depth have been identified for future infrastructural development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

11904,this study evaluates the effect of anthropogenic activities on the quality of groundwater beneath a rural area r mel area located in the perimeter of loukkos northwest morocco ten public wells for drinking water were sampled and characterized for physicochemical parameters heavy metals and pesticides occurrence multivariate statistical analysis msa water quality index wqi and geographic information system gis were employed to identify the sources of groundwater pollution the suitability for drinking purposes and the groundwater quality distribution within the r mel aquifer the results showed that almost all the samples had concentrations of no3 and ca2 exceeding the who limits set at 50 mg l and 75 mg l respectively the heavy metal content was very low in the groundwater except for arsenic which exceeded the who threshold of 10 μg l in four locations nine pesticides including atrazine trietazine terbutryn chlorpyriphos ethyl endosulfan sulphate endosulfan alpha endosulfan beta metribuzin and metolachlor were detected in four sites however no pesticides exceeded the standard of 0 1 μg l set by the european union the principal component analysis pca demonstrated that the r mel groundwater was exposed to two types of pollution that depend on groundwater redox conditions the first being defined as the release of geogenic anthropogenic as under reducing conditions minor pollution while the second represents the nonpoint source pollution from agriculture major pollution the hierarchical cluster analysis hca has classified the samples into four clusters reflecting the rate of groundwater mineralization in the study area differently to hca the wqi has generated three groups the comparison between wqi and hca showed that the combined use of the two methods may lead to a better classification of groundwater samples the spatial distribution of no3 and wqi indicated the areas affected by irrigated agriculture and the impact of anthropogenic activities on the r mel groundwater has been assessed graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water heavy metals hydrochemistry pesticides multivariate statistical analysis water quality index 1 introduction groundwater is the most valuable fresh water resource in the earth at the present time there are areas where groundwater is considered one of the main sources of water supply for drinking industrial and irrigation purposes liu et al 2015 li et al 2016 chen et al 2018 notably in arid and semi arid regions where the groundwater plays a crucial role as the main source of water supply chen et al 2017 groundwater is generally of adequate quality for both drinking and agricultural activities rivett et al 2018 however potential sources of groundwater pollution have increased in recent years danielopol et al 2003 in fact throughout the world groundwater is heavily polluted by chemicals and the situation is even more alarming in developing countries where groundwater shows traces of nitrates nitrites chlorides ammonium heavy metals pesticides fecal coliforms and other pollutants consequently understanding the quality of the groundwater to ensure a reliable supply for various purposes is an essential step in maintaining the sustainability of these resources chen et al 2019 the agricultural operations in high vulnerability areas can have an impact on the environment economy and human health pacheco et al 2018 fertilizers and organic domestic waste might generate high levels of nitrates in the soil kumar et al 2009 since their high mobility nitrates easily pass through the soil and reach the groundwater gutiérrez et al 2018 thus although the groundwater contamination by nitrate in shallow aquifers in areas characterized by agriculture well drained soils and oxic geochemical conditions is a growing concern threatening the groundwater quality chen et al 2016 2017 the importance of no3 in evaluating groundwater pollution is likely to be crucial due to its widespread occurrence in most agricultural systems qian et al 2020 the dispersion of metals in the groundwater may originate from anthropogenic sources agriculture industry mining activities etc but can also occur naturally driving from materials of the aquifer rocks and sediments chowdhury et al 2016 the differentiation process between natural background level and contamination values of metals in groundwater could in fact carry the statue of threshold marandi and karro 2008 gao et al 2020 reported that the knowledge of natural background level nbl plays a key role in indentifying and controlling pollution in groundwater the consumption of drinking water can pose a risk if the concentration of metals exceeds standards chaturvedi et al 2018 due to the toxicity of heavy metals and their ability to accumulate in the human body herojeet et al 2015 pesticides are considered emerging contaminants that can affect groundwater quality because they are bioactive and therefore influence human health their extended usage in agricultural areas imply a risk of leakage of these compounds into the groundwater through soil leaching rojas et al 2015 akay demir et al 2019 the soil in turn plays a very important role in the control of groundwater quality it stands as a barrier that depending on its nature prevents or allows the intrusion of undesirable substances the comprehension of the processes that control groundwater quality is still an intricate operation that challenges researchers given the huge amount of data collected during a given study recently a better understanding has been achieved using multivariate statistical analysis notably principal component analysis pca factor analysis fa cluster analysis ca and discriminate analysis da barakat et al 2016 multivariate statistical techniques have become an effective tool for many hydro geochemical studies cloutier et al 2008 they can be used as unbiased methods to find natural associations between samples and or variables wenning and erickson 1994 vega et al 1998 helena et al 2000 pca was used in several studies to identify anthropogenic and natural factors influencing the groundwater quality omo irabor et al 2008 güler et al 2012 bodrud doza et al 2016 meng et al 2018 whereas hca was employed for the arrangement of groundwater samples into clusters based on the similarities of hydrochemical data this technique is one of the most widely used clustering techniques in the field of earth science cloutier et al 2008 ghesquière et al 2015 the use of a technique such as gis could indeed solve these problems to a certain degree especially when combined with a mathematical model that would reflect a clear image of the quality of this groundwater in morocco the estimated volume of useful groundwater is around 4 billion m3 extracted annually mostly allocated to agriculture 86 industry 5 5 and human consumption 8 5 laamari et al 2011 the country is adopting irrigated agriculture as a base for human development in order to meet the needs of its growing population and to increase its agricultural exports ait kadi and ziyad 2018 the deterioration of soil and water quality in irrigated areas is one of the highest ranked concerns for the moroccan ministry of agriculture the agricultural operations in rural areas are mainly linked to the exploitation of groundwater resources which require monitoring to maintain sustainability masoud et al 2018 the loukkos region is one of the major irrigated areas in morocco indeed it concentrates nearly 80 of the national production of red fruits strawberries raspberries and blueberries of which 65 are exported to the european union harbouze et al 2019 despite this interesting development the loukkos area is still suffering from a lack of data concerning the groundwater quality especially since the irrigated area is surrounded by villages which supply directly from this groundwater in fact the loukkos area has recently undergone intensive agricultural activity el bakouri et al 2007 2008 as a result a great number of fertilizers and pesticides have been recently introduced in order to intensify agricultural production and to improve crop yields moreover the characteristics of the r mel aquifer which are manifested by shallow groundwater and sandy soils make the situation more complex the main objectives of this study are to 1 conduct an exhaustive analysis of potential pollutants affecting the r mel aquifer 2 assess the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes 3 investigate the main activities leading to the deterioration of groundwater in the study area and lastly 4 generate water quality maps indicating the level of pollution in the r mel aquifer this study is envisaged to be very helpful for the scientific community and local authorities who are in charge of the safety and security of the local inhabitants of the r mel region 2 study site 2 1 description of the study area located in northwest morocco between tangier and rabat the loukkos region covers an area of 2560 km2 this region has a mediterranean climate with a wet and cool season from november to april and a hot and dry season from may to october the average annual temperature ranges between 11 c in winter and 25 c in summer and the average annual rainfall is approximately 700 mm between october and april el bakouri et al 2008 a large part of the loukkos region is dedicated to agriculture due to its topographic and edaphological characteristics the region has a useful agricultural area of 147 500 ha 45 000 ha of which are irrigated the mountainous part of the loukkos area belongs to the rif domain which has a complex geology distinct from other moroccan geological domains in these ancient formations recent units of tertiary and quaternary are deposited agricultural land is made up of the crumbling material of these geological formations the r mel region with an average altitude of 50 m 80 m is essentially made up of sandy formations of the plio quaternary which provides soil with a light texture that is easy to work and very favorable for agriculture 2 2 land cover and agriculture the main types of soil crops and agriculture in the loukkos region are shown in table 1 and presented on the cover map fig 1 the r mel area corresponding to the studied aquifer is characterized by a large irrigated zone portions 3 and 4 in fig 1 which has sandy soil with coarse to very coarse texture and cultivated for tea watermelon sugar cane horticulture cereal groundnuts fodder and citrus fruits ballouche 2013 being the main crops that require pesticides in the study area strawberries potatoes tomatoes citrus fruits groundnuts and sugar cane bakouri et al 2007 the use of chemicals has an undeniable role in the development of intensive agriculture in the loukkos region the poor fertility of the r mel soil requires an intensive intake of organic matter and fertilization ayadi hajji 2014 the main fertilizers used in the loukkos land are npk with a ratio of 14 n 28 p2o5 14 k2o urea 46 ammonium nitrate 33 5 and ammonium sulphate 21 with an average use of 3000 t y mourabit et al 2002 phytosanitary products have also helped to make this region one of the most important agricultural areas of morocco due to the quality and quantity of its harvests el bakouri 2006 2 3 the r mel groundwater the exploitable groundwater in the loukkos region is divided into four aquifers the r mel aquifer 129 mm3 the drader souir aquifer 65 mm3 the alluvial aquifer of loukkos 54 mm3 and the ouled ogbane aquifer 33 mm3 the r mel aquifer is situated in the southern part of larache city bordered by the atlantic ocean on the west and the loukkos river on the east it covers an area of approximately 245 km2 the aquifer is mainly fed by the adjacent rivers precipitations and by the return of irrigation water from groundwater and or surface sources the r mel groundwater circulates trough sandy sandstone formations and fine sand dunes from plio quaternary deposited on a substratum made up of miopliocene blue marl the soil characteristics in the r mel aquifer slight thickness with a sandy texture makes it very vulnerable to the pollution by several types of contaminants especially those derived from agriculture the studied zone has likely been exposed to effects caused by inorganic fertilizers pesticides livestock and some domestic activities 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis in this study sampling and analysis of groundwater at ten sites were conducted to investigate the quality of the r mel aquifer fig 2 the sampled public supply wells were destined specifically for domestic uses and a representative population relies principally on these resources all the samples were collected from the region of r mel r mel aquifer provided from the loukkos hydrological basin agency abhl the piezometric level of the r mel indicates that the water table varies 1 5 30 m representing a very low to relatively low depth in the southern 1 5 4 m central 4 9 m and northern 9 15 m sectors of this aquifer respectively while near the coastal area and northwestern sector the depth below the land surface was 15 30 m the analysis of the piezometric level of the r mel aquifer shows that the general flow occurs in two directions one from the south to the north east and the other toward the north west coastal zone the piezometric level of the r mel aquifer reaches its maximum in the southern part of the aquifer 65 m however while the r mel aquifer has good hydrodynamic characteristics in the south eastern sector resulting in a low hydraulic gradient the south western sector shows strong hydraulic gradient in the coastal zone and to the north of the aquifer the level drops to reach 10 m which could explain the inversion of the flow direction due to the intense groundwater abstraction in this region fig 2 a considerable volume of groundwater was pumped just before sampling to avoid taking stagnating groundwater before their filling the bottles were rinsed three times with the sampling waters the temperature ph and conductivity of the sampled groundwater were measured on the field using a cyberscan pc10 multi parameter analyzer while dissolved oxygen was determined using dissolved oxygen meter model 9500 analyzer the sampling transport and preservation were performed in accordance with standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2017 for the rest of water characterization all samples were filtered using a filter with a pore diameter of 0 45 μm whatman cellulose nitrate ion concentrations in groundwater such as nitrate nitrite phosphate and ammonium were determined in accordance with standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2017 using perkinelmer lambda 2 uv vis spectrophotometer chlorides were determined by the argentometric method apha 2017 whereas dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed using a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer according to the manufacturer instructions with a 5 0 coefficient of variation metals such ca2 mg2 and trace elements were analyzed by the direct injection of groundwater samples into an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp eos agilent 5100 five linear curves were prepared and relative standard deviation was calculated for each element these analyses were carried out in duplicate or triplicate from which the average was calculated the analysis of pesticides in groundwater included 80 active ingredients of which 23 were organophosphorus 34 were organochlorine and 23 were organonitrogen table 2 for this reason two methodologies were used for the analysis of pesticides the first was used for the determination of semi volatile organic compounds by dispersive liquid liquid micro extraction dllme and subsequent measurement was taken by the gas chromatograph triple quadrupole mass detector bruker scion gc 436 msd tq this method is based on epa method 8270d revised july 5 2014 the second method was used for the determination of organic pesticide residues by on line solid phase extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on line spe lc ms ms using evoq triple quadrupole for liquid chromatography lc tq this procedure allows the calibration of the liquid chromatograph mass mass for the subsequent identification quantification and confirmation of the different pesticides by direct injection with the on line solid phase extraction system on line spe methodology based on epa method 543 revised march 2015 extraction and analysis methods for each pesticide analyzed in the groundwater samples are listed in table 2 all the solutions were prepared using ultrapure water milli q all the analyses were performed at least in duplicate from which the average was calculated 3 2 methods 3 2 1 multivariate statistical analysis in this study msa was performed using ibm spss statistics 22 and two different analyses were applied on the data set of 15 physicochemical parameters ec ph total suspended solids tss doc cl po4 3 no3 no2 nh4 ca2 mg2 dissolved oxygen do as mn and zn to extract pca and hca parameters such as cd co cr cu fe and ni were excluded from this study since they were not detected in most samples or

with the euclidian distance was applied as a measure of similarity in order to perform the cluster analysis ca each cluster is based on a set of physicochemical parameters to find similarities between sampled locations 3 2 2 water quality index nowadays wqi has become a reliable tool for estimating the overall quality of groundwater adimalla et al 2018 adimalla and qian 2019 in most cases among a group of physicochemical parameters analyzed in groundwater some are within the allowed limits but others are not so the overall quality of groundwater is generally unknown the wqi can summarize the set of physicochemical parameters into one single number easy to interpret zaidi et al 2016 rawat et al 2019 badeenezhad et al 2020 in this study the wqi was calculated using standards recommended by who 2011 table 3 to apply this methodology 10 parameters including total hardness th ec ph cl po4 2 no3 no2 ca2 mg2 and as were chosen for the calculation of wqi being the th calculated using eq 1 suggested by todd 1980 1 t h 2 5 ca 2 4 1 mg 2 the calculation of wqi was achieved according to the classical method yidana and yidana 2010 dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 first a value ranging from 1 to 5 was assigned for each parameter according to the impact on health that this parameter could generate khanoranga and khalid 2019 table 3 a weight of 5 was assigned to no3 and as because of their high impact on water quality while a weight of 4 was assigned to ph th and ec for the other parameters a minimum weight 2 3 was attributed due to the low or indirect impact on the quality of drinking water the relative weight w i of each parameter was calculated by eq 2 2 w i w i i 1 n w i while w i represents the weight of the parameter i and n is the total number of parameters the quality rating was subsequently calculated by dividing the concentration of the variable by the standard of the parameter determined by who 2011 being the result multiplied by 100 with the use of eq 3 3 q i c i s i x 100 whereas q i is the quality rating c i is the concentration and s i is the standard regarding the ph the standard ranges from 6 5 to 8 5 who 2011 therefore the rating scale was determined by eq 4 4 q i cph 8 5 6 5 8 5 the sub index si for each parameter is calculated by eq 5 5 s i w i x q i where w i is the relative weight and q i is the scale rating of the parameter the wqi score for each well sample was defined as the sum of the sub indexes calculated for all the variables eq 6 6 w q i i 1 n w i x q i s i wqi results of all groundwater samples were subsequently classified according to the five classes of water quality as indicated in table 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 physicochemical characterization the results of physicochemical parameters of the groundwater evaluated in the study area are shown in table 5 the temperature of the sampled groundwater varied between 17 2 and 20 5 c the ph ranged from 8 3 to 9 2 thus showing that the groundwater is alkaline in nature and exceeded in seven wells the interval fixed by the standards who 2011 ec that is controlled by the concentration of dissolved solids in water is used as an important parameter for classifying drinking and irrigation waters erguvanli and yuzer 1987 the ec analysis in samples gw 6 and gw 7 showed a high level of water mineralization exceeding the who standard fixed at 1000 μs cm while a minimum value of 730 μs cm was recorded in gw 5 the average ec in the study area was 942 μs cm the doc represents the carbon related to the organic matter and gives an idea about biological activities and organic contamination in groundwater samples the concentrations of doc in groundwater were very low in all locations they ranged from 0 34 to 2 26 mg l with an average value of 1 12 mg l the do content ranged between 5 28 mg l and 7 02 mg l all groundwater samples were above the who standard for do set at 2 mg l which indicates a good level of groundwater oxygenation due to the shallow groundwater and aerated soil nitrogen forms such as no2 and nh4 have shown concentrations that are much too low in the sampled groundwater regarding no3 only two samples gw9 3 2 mg l and gw8 14 87 mg l were below the standard of 50 mg l recommended by the who for drinking water standard who 2011 and concentrations ranged up to an abnormally high concentration of 350 mg l recorded in gw 7 located in the central sector characterized by shallow depth the average no3 concentration being 140 7 mg l these values are quietly expected since nitrate contamination is closely related to the intensive agriculture particularly in sandy aquifers with shallow groundwater and irrigated systems indeed mourabit et al 2002 reported that the problem of nitrate contamination in the r mel area is mainly related to the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers certainly another study carried out in the r mel region showed that most farmers use fertilizers in a random way and without supervision tanji et al 2011 these higher concentrations may present a serious health threat for the local inhabitants in fact consumption of high concentrations of nitrate via drinking water can be associated with the increased risk of diseases like infant methemoglobine thyroid disease neural tube defects ward et al 2018 abdominal pains diarrhea vomiting hypertension and can also increase infant mortality vulpasu and racoviteanu 2016 at high concentrations the chlorides are distinguishable by their salty taste the cl content showed values ranging from 29 1 mg l to 181 7 mg l which are below the standard for drinking water fixed at 250 mg l who 2011 because of its ability to be adsorbed into soil particles po4 3 ions is rarely detected in the groundwater weaver et al 2007 the phosphate po4 3 concentrations were low in groundwater samples ranging from 0 01 to 0 11 mg l and not exceeded the standard value of 5 mg l the hardness of water is related to the water s calcium and magnesium mineralization the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ranged between 36 91 and 236 mg l and 1 91 and 11 25 mg l respectively these results show that ca2 ions were largely dominant in groundwater this dominance may be explained by the dissolution of calcite minerals or the leakage of lime applied as a soil additive among all samples only gw8 was below the ca2 standard of 75 mg l set by who 2011 in contrast none of the samples exceeded the mg2 standard of 50 mg l severe hardness in water such as ca2 and mg2 can cause diseases like alzheimer s diabetes and cardiovascular disease sengupta 2013 the dominance of ca2 over mg2 in groundwater might be ascribed to the external inputs of lime resulted from agriculture to increase the alkalinity of the soil there are many chemical processes leading to the mobilization of trace elements in the groundwater including the dissolution of carbonate and minerals especially iron oxy hydroxide bhattacharya et al 2006 kharaka et al 2006 the results presented in table 5 shows that the concentrations of heavy metals were very low in all the sampled groundwater and decreased in sequence of zn as mn co cr cu fe cd respectively while pb and hg were below the detection limit in all groundwater samples these values of dissolved metals in the r mel groundwater were in compliance with the who standard limits with the exception of arsenic which exceeds the permissible level of 10 μg l defined by who 2011 in four samples gw1 gw3 gw6 and gw9 the maximum as concentration in groundwater reached 16 9 μg l recorded in gw9 the average concentration of as was 9 76 μg l and was therefore close to the who standard given the alkaline conditions of the r mel aquifer it could be suggested that the ph has probably influenced the concentrations of trace element in this aquifer indeed kjøller et al 2004 reported that the higher concentrations of trace elements in groundwater are mainly due to the decrease of the ph in the aquifer among the processes leading to the groundwater acidification there is the formation of carbonic acid resulting from the dissolution of co2 kharaka et al 2006 as well as the influence of acidic rain and or humic acids resulting from surface water infiltrations wijngaard et al 2017 however arsenic is probably considered as the unique among heavy metalloids and oxyanions that could be mobilized under ph values between 6 5 and 8 5 and also under reducing and oxidizing conditions smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2006 reported that the mobility of arsenic increases in higher ph conditions due to the dissolution of carbonate cation exchange and silicate dissolution while the low concentrations of fe and mn in the r mel groundwater could reflect the low mineral solubility of fe and mn oxides due to the alkaline conditions those elements tend to have similar geochemical behavior in the groundwater zhang et al 2020 in addition several studies have reported that fe and mn oxides were responsible for the adsorption desorption phenomenon of heavy metals in groundwater smedley et al 2002 bhattacharya et al 2006 gomez et al 2009 these lower dissolved values of trace element could reflect the natural background level of those metals in the r mel aquifer arsenic is defined as an ubiquitous element ahoulé et al 2015 shahid et al 2018 which is available in all parts of the earth its occurrence in groundwater is closely related to the redox conditions the geology of the area and aquifer sediment climate and anthropogenic activities nriagu et al 2007 ahoulé et al 2015 arsenic is considered as one of the most toxic substances on the earth its presence in groundwater could cause both acute toxicities and chronic effects such as cancer who 2001 barbiero et al 2007 4 2 pesticide analyses in spite of the economic importance of the loukkos region it still suffers from a lack of data regarding the presence of pesticides in groundwater analyses of organochlorine organophosphorus and organonitrogen pesticides are shown in tables 6 8 respectively four drinking wells out of ten gw1 gw2 gw6 and gw9 showed the presence of pesticides out of the 80 analyzed pesticides only 9 active substances were found in concentrations that exceed the quantification limit of the test method four organochlorine pesticides were detected being three of them metabolites of endosulfan insecticide endosulfan alpha endosulfan beta and endosulfan sulphate with a total concentration of 60 5 ng l found at gw6 metholachlor was also detected but only at gw1 at a concentration of 8 3 ng l the results of organophosphorus pesticides in groundwater revealed the presence of a single active ingredient chlorpyriphos ethyl which was detected twice in gw2 and gw6 at concentrations of 8 5 ng l and 3 3 ng l respectively regarding organonitrogen pesticides all that were detected in the study area belong to the family of s triazine pesticides metribuzin was detected only once in gw6 at a concentration of 41 1 ng l while atrazine terbutryn and trietazine were detected at gw9 with a total concentration of 30 3 ng l table 9 represents the characteristics of the pesticides detected in the r mel groundwater compared to the other samples gw6 showed the highest degree of contamination with the presence of five pesticides belonging to the three analyzed chemical groups with a total concentration of 105 ng l in spite of this it did not exceed the standard fixed by the moroccan standardization of pesticides in drinking water moroccan official bulletin 2002 which coincide with those established in the european union directive 98 83 ec 1998 both regulations establish that the maximum allowable level is 0 1 μg l for each pesticide and 0 5 μg l for the sum of all pesticide concentrations in previous studies of the same study area in which less pesticides were analyzed el bakouri et al 2007 very similar results were reported in a sampling point close to gw6 of the r mel aquifer in which the sum of pesticides concentration was slightly lower 91 ng l than in this study 105 ng l as was mentioned before however previous results clearly showed the pollution the of r mel groundwater by atrazine in two sample points close to sample gw7 of this study the concentrations were 0 11 0 12 μg l which were higher than the safe level recommended for drinking water el bakouri et al 2007 in a subsequent work el bakouri et al 2008 the presence of 23 pesticides in the r mel groundwater was investigated and traces of endosulfan and their degradation products were found in the study area they found that endosulfan ether exceeds the moroccan and eu standards in certain time of the year and they concluded that alpha and beta isomers of endosulfan were degraded to endosulfan ether and endosulfan sulphate once in nature however in this work more than 10 years later the usage of endosulfan related pesticides in this area may have changed since only gw6 sample showed the presence of endosulfan related pesticides with a sum of 60 5 ng l which is below the moroccan and eu standard limit however and in another sense these results confirm the continued use of pesticides use in this rural area 4 3 multivariate statistical analysis 4 3 1 correlation matrix correlation between physicochemical parameters serve to explain the relationship between parameters in a water sample and identify the origin of dissolved compounds in water hamzaoui azaza et al 2011 table 10 shows the pearson correlation coefficients between the physicochemical parameters a significant correlation was observed between electrical conductivity ec and no3 cl and ca2 providing information about the principal parameters controlling the salinity of groundwater in the r mel aquifer a high positive correlation r 0 8 was also observed between cl and the major cations ca2 and mg2 this significant relationship informs about chemical weathering and leaching of secondary salts in the groundwater prasanna et al 2010 the reasonably good correlation between doc and as mn r 0 7 also suggests that the occurrence of as and mn might be influenced at least partially by the concentration of doc in the r mel aquifer arsenic exhibits significant positive correlation with mn r 0 62 which may indicates their common source in groundwater consequently it is supposed that trace elements which are significantly correlated could be attributed to the same source of pollution mansouri et al 2012 towfiqul islam et al 2017 despite the significant relationship between ca2 and no3 a low correlation was noted between no3 and mg2 po3 4 shows high negative correlation with ca2 and moderate correlation with mg2 and indicates that po4 3 ions might decrease with the increase of hardness in the r mel groundwater the strong relationship r 0 86 between nh4 and no2 could explain their weak concentrations in groundwater other significant correlations were also found between po3 4 ph tss doc tss as and cl doc 4 3 2 principal component analysis the output of the pca allows the extraction of four rotated factors characterized by an eigenvalue greater than 1 and constitutes approximately 88 8 of the total explained variance the results of pca loading for the 15 physicochemical parameters are shown in table 11 the first component explains 28 31 of the total variance with high positive loading of doc tss mn and as and a moderate loading of cl this component reports on the hydrogeochemical process leading to the release of as and mn in groundwater indeed several studies have attributed the release of as in groundwater to the presence of doc anawar et al 2002a halim et al 2014 anawar et al 2002b and liu et al 2003 reported that the high concentration of as in groundwater is mainly due to the high concentration of nh4 doc and po4 3 and inversely related to the concentrations of no3 do and so4 which reflects a reduced environment consequently the mobilization of as and mn in the r mel groundwater could be due to the microbial reductive dissolution of mn oxide mno hydroxide mn oh 2 which could use the high level of dissolved organic matter anawar et al 2002a 2003 liu et al 2003 halim et al 2014 this reductive dissolution of mno mn oh 2 stimulates the release of as since it is adsorbed on mno and mn oh 2 surfaces sediment zhang et al 2020 the release of arsenic in the groundwater might be ascribed to two sources the first being natural and mainly linked to rocks weathering and volcanic emissions while the second represents the anthropogenic contribution and specifically linked to some industrial and agricultural activities vithanage et al 2007 grutzmacher et al 2013 reported that in shallows aquifers the samples are commonly contaminated by both geogenic and anthropogenic sources however the geogenic contamination is defined as the exceeding of certain thresholds without the intervention of any human activity grutzmacher et al 2013 this definition complicates the assertion of the source of as in the r mel aquifer due to the large expansion of irrigated fields and the intensive use of fertilizers and agrochemicals in addition bhattacharya et al 2007 reported that despite the fact that as is often attributed to the geological setting the contribution of anthropogenic activities should not be ignored the second component pc2 explains 23 49 of variability and has a strong negative loading to po4 3 and ph and moderate loading to ca2 and mg2 this component represents the natural processes leading to the precipitation of calcium and magnesium carbonate under alkaline conditions and suggests also that low po3 4 concentrations could be due to the alkaline nature of groundwater samples pc 3 represents 21 96 of the total variability and is characterized by strong positive loading of ec no 3 and moderate loading of ca2 indicating the principal ions controlling the mineralization of groundwater in the study area the high negative loading of do toward this component could be an evidence for the stability of nitrates in the groundwater since all others inorganic nitrogenous forms were oxidized thus causing an excess of nitrates in the groundwater it has been reported that in the oxic groundwater nitrate is the most stable form ma et al 2016 hansen et al 2017 on the contrary nitrite can occur at concentrations comparable to those of nitrate under reducing conditions rivett et al 2008 the moderate loading of ca2 in this component could explain the dominance of ca2 over mg2 in the groundwater samples and suggest that ca2 might have identical source such nitrate in the groundwater generally this component relates to the anthropogenic pollution caused by the intensive farming activities in the study area lastly pc4 describes 15 03 of variability and has strong positive loadings to nh4 and no2 followed by a moderate loading of zn this last component illustrates the tendency of these compounds to be reduced under oxic groundwater conditions this hypothesis is supported since the aquifer experiences high levels of no3 ions 4 3 3 hierarchical cluster analysis the dendrogram generated from hca shows four clusters fig 3 cluster 1 contains a single sample gw7 located in the central portion of the r mel aquifer which is characterized by shallows depth and delineated by intensive farming activities this sample characterized by elevated concentrations of no3 cl and ca2 reflects the highest dissolved values of these compounds in the study area cluster 2 encompasses two sub clusters gw6 and gw1 and gw2 representing the central and northwestern portions of the r mel aquifer respectively the water quality analysis in this area reveals higher dissolved values of ca2 no3 and as and displays pesticides traces the cluster 2 tends to follow the same characteristics of cluster 1 but with less sharpness cluster 3 also consists of two sub clusters the first is composed of gw4 and gw9 while the second contains only gw8 this cluster represents both northwestern and southwestern parts of the r mel aquifer displays the lowest nitrate concentrations and provides information on the region unaffected by agricultural practices the placement of gw4 and gw9 in this cluster separately from gw8 was due to their high concentration of ca2 which likely occurs from the dissolution of bicarbonate rocks gw8 was placed alone in cluster 3 as the cleanest sample since all physicochemical parameters trace elements and pesticides were present at minor concentrations and none exceedance of who standard was recorded this sample was located away from agricultural fields and could reflect the natural background level of metals in the study area cluster 4 is formed by gw5 gw10 and gw3 these three sites have a low ec when compared to the other samples however high nitrate values 100 mg l were noted demonstrating also agricultural pollution in general the clustering results were based on the rate of groundwater mineralization and flow direction resulted in four classes in the following mineralization order cluster 1 cluster 2 cluster 4 cluster 3 4 3 4 water quality index the calculated wqi score at each of the sampled sites are described in fig 4 the results show that the wqi range between 23 76 and 174 99 the sample gw8 contained water of an excellent quality and is therefore classified as suitable for consumption by the rural population samples gw3 gw4 gw5 gw9 and gw10 have scores ranging between 50 and 100 and were classified as good water for consumption however samples gw1 gw2 gw6 and gw7 were classified as poor water type as they exceed the score of 100 with a maximum value of 174 recorded at gw7 the highest values of wqi have been found to be specifically related to the highs concentrations of nitrates calcium and to the arsenic values surpassing the standards in some locations 4 3 5 hierarchical cluster analysis and wqi fig 5 illustrates a comparison between hca and wqi classifications this comparison allows the evaluation of the similarity between the two methods it has been noticed that the samples with the closest wqi scores were classified in the same cluster and then sub cluster by comparing the clusters 1 with 2 that include gw1 gw2 gw6 and gw7 it appears that the samples were classified according to their wqi results for e g sample gw7 which is characterized by the highest wqi 174 was placed alone in cluster 1 while gw1 gw2 and gw6 which scored 102 108 and 117 respectively were classed in cluster 2 within cluster 2 gw1 and gw2 have closest wqi and were grouped in the same sub cluster separately from gw6 the samples gw4 gw9 and gw8 were characterized by the lowest wqi values 65 63 and 26 respectively and in agreement they were arranged within cluster 3 sub clustering of gw4 and gw9 separately from gw8 was also in agreement with their wqi values similarly cluster 4 comprised gw3 gw5 and gw10 which had similar wqi scores 86 85 and 80 respectively although in this case hca could not group gw3 and gw5 in the same sub cluster different from that of gw10 because of the highly similar wqi values on the other hand the hca analysis yielded four classes instead of three in the wqi classification which is normal since it depends on how the categories of water according to the wqi are established the wqi of sample gw7 is clearly higher than the ones of gw1 gw2 and gw6 fig 4 however they are all within the same category blue all waters have a wqi above 100 in the same poor quality water category probably if there were another categories of water quality for those having a wqi 150 for instance gw7 would be in the very poor quality water category however hca is able to distinguish and separate them in two clusters because it establishes more categories despite this both methods yielded similar results and their merging may lead to a better interpretation of the groundwater quality rating 4 3 6 spatial distribution the spatial distribution of nitrate in the r mel aquifer showed that almost the entire area is affected by higher levels of no3 that exceed the standard value of who 2011 fig 6 the contamination of the r mel aquifer by nitrate is mainly due to the large expansion of irrigated fields surrounding the study area the spatial distribution of wqi fig 7 indicates that the eastern region represented by gw8 has excellent water quality because it is not impacted by the agricultural activities of the region since it is located outside of the irrigated area hence this area may reflect the original quality of the r mel groundwater samples gw3 gw4 gw5 gw9 and gw10 representing both the southwestern and northeastern portions of the study area were classified as good water type despite this fact the water quality of this area tends to worsen over time as they are close to the irrigated fields however a large central zone of the study area contains groundwater of poor quality and poses a serious risk to the health of the rural population as it is directly subjected to the intensive agricultural activities 5 conclusions the large expansion of agricultural lands in the r mel region constitutes a serious threat to the groundwater quality and therefore to its rural inhabitants this study focuses on the assessment of selected pollutants that could affect the quality of drinking water in the r mel area the physicochemical characterization revealed that the r mel aquifer was strongly affected by agricultural fertilizers and in some locations also showed the presence of as at concentrations exceeding the who standard in the other hand the chromatographic analyses of pesticides revealed the detection of nine pesticides in the groundwater samples distributed between four wells gw1 gw2 gw6 and gw9 despite their detection in the study area those pesticides do not exceed the moroccan and european commission recommended limits and therefore do not pose any danger to the health of consumers in this study pca has helped to identify the principal sources of pollution in the r mel aquifer the extracted components demonstrate that the r mel groundwater was generally dominated by two types of pollution the first one was minor and controlled by water sediment interaction and leaching of as under reducing conditions pc1 and pc4 while the second report on a dominant pollution from anthropogenic origin mainly related to the intensive agricultural activities pc3 hca allowed the classification of groundwater samples into four clusters referring to aquifer mineralization the results of the wqi in the study area were specifically dependent on no3 ca2 as and th and led to the following classification gw8 excellent water gw3 gw4 gw5 gw9 good water and gw1 gw2 gw6 gw7 poor water by comparing the results of wqi and hca it was noticed that the two methods were consistent and have common points in their classification this study has shown that merging and combining wqi and hca can lead to a better understanding of the groundwater classification in future works the spatial distribution map of nitrate indicates that almost the entire study area is affected by no3 concentrations exceeding the who level of 50 mg l which can pose serious health problems for the local inhabitants whereas the spatial distribution of wqi revealed that the central area of the r mel aquifer characterized by intensive irrigation farms was heavily polluted by agricultural practices in conclusion the r mel aquifer located in the loukkos region suffers from a wide variety of pollutants mainly resulting from agricultural practices another point is that an excess of nitrate together with high toc concentration and low dissolved oxygen may lead to enhance anaerobic bacterial activities leading to release of as and mn from sediment to groundwater which increase the health risk of the consumers in this sense it is recommended to monitor the use of this groundwater at the same time a depollution technique should be implemented in the study area to reduce the negative effects of intensive farming and ensure drinking water safety for the rural population of this region declaration of competing interest the authors

11904,this study evaluates the effect of anthropogenic activities on the quality of groundwater beneath a rural area r mel area located in the perimeter of loukkos northwest morocco ten public wells for drinking water were sampled and characterized for physicochemical parameters heavy metals and pesticides occurrence multivariate statistical analysis msa water quality index wqi and geographic information system gis were employed to identify the sources of groundwater pollution the suitability for drinking purposes and the groundwater quality distribution within the r mel aquifer the results showed that almost all the samples had concentrations of no3 and ca2 exceeding the who limits set at 50 mg l and 75 mg l respectively the heavy metal content was very low in the groundwater except for arsenic which exceeded the who threshold of 10 μg l in four locations nine pesticides including atrazine trietazine terbutryn chlorpyriphos ethyl endosulfan sulphate endosulfan alpha endosulfan beta metribuzin and metolachlor were detected in four sites however no pesticides exceeded the standard of 0 1 μg l set by the european union the principal component analysis pca demonstrated that the r mel groundwater was exposed to two types of pollution that depend on groundwater redox conditions the first being defined as the release of geogenic anthropogenic as under reducing conditions minor pollution while the second represents the nonpoint source pollution from agriculture major pollution the hierarchical cluster analysis hca has classified the samples into four clusters reflecting the rate of groundwater mineralization in the study area differently to hca the wqi has generated three groups the comparison between wqi and hca showed that the combined use of the two methods may lead to a better classification of groundwater samples the spatial distribution of no3 and wqi indicated the areas affected by irrigated agriculture and the impact of anthropogenic activities on the r mel groundwater has been assessed graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water heavy metals hydrochemistry pesticides multivariate statistical analysis water quality index 1 introduction groundwater is the most valuable fresh water resource in the earth at the present time there are areas where groundwater is considered one of the main sources of water supply for drinking industrial and irrigation purposes liu et al 2015 li et al 2016 chen et al 2018 notably in arid and semi arid regions where the groundwater plays a crucial role as the main source of water supply chen et al 2017 groundwater is generally of adequate quality for both drinking and agricultural activities rivett et al 2018 however potential sources of groundwater pollution have increased in recent years danielopol et al 2003 in fact throughout the world groundwater is heavily polluted by chemicals and the situation is even more alarming in developing countries where groundwater shows traces of nitrates nitrites chlorides ammonium heavy metals pesticides fecal coliforms and other pollutants consequently understanding the quality of the groundwater to ensure a reliable supply for various purposes is an essential step in maintaining the sustainability of these resources chen et al 2019 the agricultural operations in high vulnerability areas can have an impact on the environment economy and human health pacheco et al 2018 fertilizers and organic domestic waste might generate high levels of nitrates in the soil kumar et al 2009 since their high mobility nitrates easily pass through the soil and reach the groundwater gutiérrez et al 2018 thus although the groundwater contamination by nitrate in shallow aquifers in areas characterized by agriculture well drained soils and oxic geochemical conditions is a growing concern threatening the groundwater quality chen et al 2016 2017 the importance of no3 in evaluating groundwater pollution is likely to be crucial due to its widespread occurrence in most agricultural systems qian et al 2020 the dispersion of metals in the groundwater may originate from anthropogenic sources agriculture industry mining activities etc but can also occur naturally driving from materials of the aquifer rocks and sediments chowdhury et al 2016 the differentiation process between natural background level and contamination values of metals in groundwater could in fact carry the statue of threshold marandi and karro 2008 gao et al 2020 reported that the knowledge of natural background level nbl plays a key role in indentifying and controlling pollution in groundwater the consumption of drinking water can pose a risk if the concentration of metals exceeds standards chaturvedi et al 2018 due to the toxicity of heavy metals and their ability to accumulate in the human body herojeet et al 2015 pesticides are considered emerging contaminants that can affect groundwater quality because they are bioactive and therefore influence human health their extended usage in agricultural areas imply a risk of leakage of these compounds into the groundwater through soil leaching rojas et al 2015 akay demir et al 2019 the soil in turn plays a very important role in the control of groundwater quality it stands as a barrier that depending on its nature prevents or allows the intrusion of undesirable substances the comprehension of the processes that control groundwater quality is still an intricate operation that challenges researchers given the huge amount of data collected during a given study recently a better understanding has been achieved using multivariate statistical analysis notably principal component analysis pca factor analysis fa cluster analysis ca and discriminate analysis da barakat et al 2016 multivariate statistical techniques have become an effective tool for many hydro geochemical studies cloutier et al 2008 they can be used as unbiased methods to find natural associations between samples and or variables wenning and erickson 1994 vega et al 1998 helena et al 2000 pca was used in several studies to identify anthropogenic and natural factors influencing the groundwater quality omo irabor et al 2008 güler et al 2012 bodrud doza et al 2016 meng et al 2018 whereas hca was employed for the arrangement of groundwater samples into clusters based on the similarities of hydrochemical data this technique is one of the most widely used clustering techniques in the field of earth science cloutier et al 2008 ghesquière et al 2015 the use of a technique such as gis could indeed solve these problems to a certain degree especially when combined with a mathematical model that would reflect a clear image of the quality of this groundwater in morocco the estimated volume of useful groundwater is around 4 billion m3 extracted annually mostly allocated to agriculture 86 industry 5 5 and human consumption 8 5 laamari et al 2011 the country is adopting irrigated agriculture as a base for human development in order to meet the needs of its growing population and to increase its agricultural exports ait kadi and ziyad 2018 the deterioration of soil and water quality in irrigated areas is one of the highest ranked concerns for the moroccan ministry of agriculture the agricultural operations in rural areas are mainly linked to the exploitation of groundwater resources which require monitoring to maintain sustainability masoud et al 2018 the loukkos region is one of the major irrigated areas in morocco indeed it concentrates nearly 80 of the national production of red fruits strawberries raspberries and blueberries of which 65 are exported to the european union harbouze et al 2019 despite this interesting development the loukkos area is still suffering from a lack of data concerning the groundwater quality especially since the irrigated area is surrounded by villages which supply directly from this groundwater in fact the loukkos area has recently undergone intensive agricultural activity el bakouri et al 2007 2008 as a result a great number of fertilizers and pesticides have been recently introduced in order to intensify agricultural production and to improve crop yields moreover the characteristics of the r mel aquifer which are manifested by shallow groundwater and sandy soils make the situation more complex the main objectives of this study are to 1 conduct an exhaustive analysis of potential pollutants affecting the r mel aquifer 2 assess the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes 3 investigate the main activities leading to the deterioration of groundwater in the study area and lastly 4 generate water quality maps indicating the level of pollution in the r mel aquifer this study is envisaged to be very helpful for the scientific community and local authorities who are in charge of the safety and security of the local inhabitants of the r mel region 2 study site 2 1 description of the study area located in northwest morocco between tangier and rabat the loukkos region covers an area of 2560 km2 this region has a mediterranean climate with a wet and cool season from november to april and a hot and dry season from may to october the average annual temperature ranges between 11 c in winter and 25 c in summer and the average annual rainfall is approximately 700 mm between october and april el bakouri et al 2008 a large part of the loukkos region is dedicated to agriculture due to its topographic and edaphological characteristics the region has a useful agricultural area of 147 500 ha 45 000 ha of which are irrigated the mountainous part of the loukkos area belongs to the rif domain which has a complex geology distinct from other moroccan geological domains in these ancient formations recent units of tertiary and quaternary are deposited agricultural land is made up of the crumbling material of these geological formations the r mel region with an average altitude of 50 m 80 m is essentially made up of sandy formations of the plio quaternary which provides soil with a light texture that is easy to work and very favorable for agriculture 2 2 land cover and agriculture the main types of soil crops and agriculture in the loukkos region are shown in table 1 and presented on the cover map fig 1 the r mel area corresponding to the studied aquifer is characterized by a large irrigated zone portions 3 and 4 in fig 1 which has sandy soil with coarse to very coarse texture and cultivated for tea watermelon sugar cane horticulture cereal groundnuts fodder and citrus fruits ballouche 2013 being the main crops that require pesticides in the study area strawberries potatoes tomatoes citrus fruits groundnuts and sugar cane bakouri et al 2007 the use of chemicals has an undeniable role in the development of intensive agriculture in the loukkos region the poor fertility of the r mel soil requires an intensive intake of organic matter and fertilization ayadi hajji 2014 the main fertilizers used in the loukkos land are npk with a ratio of 14 n 28 p2o5 14 k2o urea 46 ammonium nitrate 33 5 and ammonium sulphate 21 with an average use of 3000 t y mourabit et al 2002 phytosanitary products have also helped to make this region one of the most important agricultural areas of morocco due to the quality and quantity of its harvests el bakouri 2006 2 3 the r mel groundwater the exploitable groundwater in the loukkos region is divided into four aquifers the r mel aquifer 129 mm3 the drader souir aquifer 65 mm3 the alluvial aquifer of loukkos 54 mm3 and the ouled ogbane aquifer 33 mm3 the r mel aquifer is situated in the southern part of larache city bordered by the atlantic ocean on the west and the loukkos river on the east it covers an area of approximately 245 km2 the aquifer is mainly fed by the adjacent rivers precipitations and by the return of irrigation water from groundwater and or surface sources the r mel groundwater circulates trough sandy sandstone formations and fine sand dunes from plio quaternary deposited on a substratum made up of miopliocene blue marl the soil characteristics in the r mel aquifer slight thickness with a sandy texture makes it very vulnerable to the pollution by several types of contaminants especially those derived from agriculture the studied zone has likely been exposed to effects caused by inorganic fertilizers pesticides livestock and some domestic activities 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis in this study sampling and analysis of groundwater at ten sites were conducted to investigate the quality of the r mel aquifer fig 2 the sampled public supply wells were destined specifically for domestic uses and a representative population relies principally on these resources all the samples were collected from the region of r mel r mel aquifer provided from the loukkos hydrological basin agency abhl the piezometric level of the r mel indicates that the water table varies 1 5 30 m representing a very low to relatively low depth in the southern 1 5 4 m central 4 9 m and northern 9 15 m sectors of this aquifer respectively while near the coastal area and northwestern sector the depth below the land surface was 15 30 m the analysis of the piezometric level of the r mel aquifer shows that the general flow occurs in two directions one from the south to the north east and the other toward the north west coastal zone the piezometric level of the r mel aquifer reaches its maximum in the southern part of the aquifer 65 m however while the r mel aquifer has good hydrodynamic characteristics in the south eastern sector resulting in a low hydraulic gradient the south western sector shows strong hydraulic gradient in the coastal zone and to the north of the aquifer the level drops to reach 10 m which could explain the inversion of the flow direction due to the intense groundwater abstraction in this region fig 2 a considerable volume of groundwater was pumped just before sampling to avoid taking stagnating groundwater before their filling the bottles were rinsed three times with the sampling waters the temperature ph and conductivity of the sampled groundwater were measured on the field using a cyberscan pc10 multi parameter analyzer while dissolved oxygen was determined using dissolved oxygen meter model 9500 analyzer the sampling transport and preservation were performed in accordance with standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2017 for the rest of water characterization all samples were filtered using a filter with a pore diameter of 0 45 μm whatman cellulose nitrate ion concentrations in groundwater such as nitrate nitrite phosphate and ammonium were determined in accordance with standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2017 using perkinelmer lambda 2 uv vis spectrophotometer chlorides were determined by the argentometric method apha 2017 whereas dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed using a shimadzu toc vcsh analyzer according to the manufacturer instructions with a 5 0 coefficient of variation metals such ca2 mg2 and trace elements were analyzed by the direct injection of groundwater samples into an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp eos agilent 5100 five linear curves were prepared and relative standard deviation was calculated for each element these analyses were carried out in duplicate or triplicate from which the average was calculated the analysis of pesticides in groundwater included 80 active ingredients of which 23 were organophosphorus 34 were organochlorine and 23 were organonitrogen table 2 for this reason two methodologies were used for the analysis of pesticides the first was used for the determination of semi volatile organic compounds by dispersive liquid liquid micro extraction dllme and subsequent measurement was taken by the gas chromatograph triple quadrupole mass detector bruker scion gc 436 msd tq this method is based on epa method 8270d revised july 5 2014 the second method was used for the determination of organic pesticide residues by on line solid phase extraction liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry on line spe lc ms ms using evoq triple quadrupole for liquid chromatography lc tq this procedure allows the calibration of the liquid chromatograph mass mass for the subsequent identification quantification and confirmation of the different pesticides by direct injection with the on line solid phase extraction system on line spe methodology based on epa method 543 revised march 2015 extraction and analysis methods for each pesticide analyzed in the groundwater samples are listed in table 2 all the solutions were prepared using ultrapure water milli q all the analyses were performed at least in duplicate from which the average was calculated 3 2 methods 3 2 1 multivariate statistical

with the euclidian distance was applied as a measure of similarity in order to perform the cluster analysis ca each cluster is based on a set of physicochemical parameters to find similarities between sampled locations 3 2 2 water quality index nowadays wqi has become a reliable tool for estimating the overall quality of groundwater adimalla et al 2018 adimalla and qian 2019 in most cases among a group of physicochemical parameters analyzed in groundwater some are within the allowed limits but others are not so the overall quality of groundwater is generally unknown the wqi can summarize the set of physicochemical parameters into one single number easy to interpret zaidi et al 2016 rawat et al 2019 badeenezhad et al 2020 in this study the wqi was calculated using standards recommended by who 2011 table 3 to apply this methodology 10 parameters including total hardness th ec ph cl po4 2 no3 no2 ca2 mg2 and as were chosen for the calculation of wqi being the th calculated using eq 1 suggested by todd 1980 1 t h 2 5 ca 2 4 1 mg 2 the calculation of wqi was achieved according to the classical method yidana and yidana 2010 dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 first a value ranging from 1 to 5 was assigned for each parameter according to the impact on health that this parameter could generate khanoranga and khalid 2019 table 3 a weight of 5 was assigned to no3 and as because of their high impact on water quality while a weight of 4 was assigned to ph th and ec for the other parameters a minimum weight 2 3 was attributed due to the low or indirect impact on the quality of drinking water the relative weight w i of each parameter was calculated by eq 2 2 w i w i i 1 n w i while w i represents the weight of the parameter i and n is the total number of parameters the quality rating was subsequently calculated by dividing the concentration of the variable by the standard of the parameter determined by who 2011 being the result multiplied by 100 with the use of eq 3 3 q i c i s i x 100 whereas q i is the quality rating c i is the concentration and s i is the standard regarding the ph the standard ranges from 6 5 to 8 5 who 2011 therefore the rating scale was determined by eq 4 4 q i cph 8 5 6 5 8 5 the sub index si for each parameter is calculated by eq 5 5 s i w i x q i where w i is the relative weight and q i is the scale rating of the parameter the wqi score for each well sample was defined as the sum of the sub indexes calculated for all the variables eq 6 6 w q i i 1 n w i x q i s i wqi results of all groundwater samples were subsequently classified according to the five classes of water quality as indicated in table 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 physicochemical characterization the results of physicochemical parameters of the groundwater evaluated in the study area are shown in table 5 the temperature of the sampled groundwater varied between 17 2 and 20 5 c the ph ranged from 8 3 to 9 2 thus showing that the groundwater is alkaline in nature and exceeded in seven wells the interval fixed by the standards who 2011 ec that is controlled by the concentration of dissolved solids in water is used as an important parameter for classifying drinking and irrigation waters erguvanli and yuzer 1987 the ec analysis in samples gw 6 and gw 7 showed a high level of water mineralization exceeding the who standard fixed at 1000 μs cm while a minimum value of 730 μs cm was recorded in gw 5 the average ec in the study area was 942 μs cm the doc represents the carbon related to the organic matter and gives an idea about biological activities and organic contamination in groundwater samples the concentrations of doc in groundwater were very low in all locations they ranged from 0 34 to 2 26 mg l with an average value of 1 12 mg l the do content ranged between 5 28 mg l and 7 02 mg l all groundwater samples were above the who standard for do set at 2 mg l which indicates a good level of groundwater oxygenation due to the shallow groundwater and aerated soil nitrogen forms such as no2 and nh4 have shown concentrations that are much too low in the sampled groundwater regarding no3 only two samples gw9 3 2 mg l and gw8 14 87 mg l were below the standard of 50 mg l recommended by the who for drinking water standard who 2011 and concentrations ranged up to an abnormally high concentration of 350 mg l recorded in gw 7 located in the central sector characterized by shallow depth the average no3 concentration being 140 7 mg l these values are quietly expected since nitrate contamination is closely related to the intensive agriculture particularly in sandy aquifers with shallow groundwater and irrigated systems indeed mourabit et al 2002 reported that the problem of nitrate contamination in the r mel area is mainly related to the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers certainly another study carried out in the r mel region showed that most farmers use fertilizers in a random way and without supervision tanji et al 2011 these higher concentrations may present a serious health threat for the local inhabitants in fact consumption of high concentrations of nitrate via drinking water can be associated with the increased risk of diseases like infant methemoglobine thyroid disease neural tube defects ward et al 2018 abdominal pains diarrhea vomiting hypertension and can also increase infant mortality vulpasu and racoviteanu 2016 at high concentrations the chlorides are distinguishable by their salty taste the cl content showed values ranging from 29 1 mg l to 181 7 mg l which are below the standard for drinking water fixed at 250 mg l who 2011 because of its ability to be adsorbed into soil particles po4 3 ions is rarely detected in the groundwater weaver et al 2007 the phosphate po4 3 concentrations were low in groundwater samples ranging from 0 01 to 0 11 mg l and not exceeded the standard value of 5 mg l the hardness of water is related to the water s calcium and magnesium mineralization the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ranged between 36 91 and 236 mg l and 1 91 and 11 25 mg l respectively these results show that ca2 ions were largely dominant in groundwater this dominance may be explained by the dissolution of calcite minerals or the leakage of lime applied as a soil additive among all samples only gw8 was below the ca2 standard of 75 mg l set by who 2011 in contrast none of the samples exceeded the mg2 standard of 50 mg l severe hardness in water such as ca2 and mg2 can cause diseases like alzheimer s diabetes and cardiovascular disease sengupta 2013 the dominance of ca2 over mg2 in groundwater might be ascribed to the external inputs of lime resulted from agriculture to increase the alkalinity of the soil there are many chemical processes leading to the mobilization of trace elements in the groundwater including the dissolution of carbonate and minerals especially iron oxy hydroxide bhattacharya et al 2006 kharaka et al 2006 the results presented in table 5 shows that the concentrations of heavy metals were very low in all the sampled groundwater and decreased in sequence of zn as mn co cr cu fe cd respectively while pb and hg were below the detection limit in all groundwater samples these values of dissolved metals in the r mel groundwater were in compliance with the who standard limits with the exception of arsenic which exceeds the permissible level of 10 μg l defined by who 2011 in four samples gw1 gw3 gw6 and gw9 the maximum as concentration in groundwater reached 16 9 μg l recorded in gw9 the average concentration of as was 9 76 μg l and was therefore close to the who standard given the alkaline conditions of the r mel aquifer it could be suggested that the ph has probably influenced the concentrations of trace element in this aquifer indeed kjøller et al 2004 reported that the higher concentrations of trace elements in groundwater are mainly due to the decrease of the ph in the aquifer among the processes leading to the groundwater acidification there is the formation of carbonic acid resulting from the dissolution of co2 kharaka et al 2006 as well as the influence of acidic rain and or humic acids resulting from surface water infiltrations wijngaard et al 2017 however arsenic is probably considered as the unique among heavy metalloids and oxyanions that could be mobilized under ph values between 6 5 and 8 5 and also under reducing and oxidizing conditions smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2006 reported that the mobility of arsenic increases in higher ph conditions due to the dissolution of carbonate cation exchange and silicate dissolution while the low concentrations of fe and mn in the r mel groundwater could reflect the low mineral solubility of fe and mn oxides due to the alkaline conditions those elements tend to have similar geochemical behavior in the groundwater zhang et al 2020 in addition several studies have reported that fe and mn oxides were responsible for the adsorption desorption phenomenon of heavy metals in groundwater smedley et al 2002 bhattacharya et al 2006 gomez et al 2009 these lower dissolved values of trace element could reflect the natural background level of those metals in the r mel aquifer arsenic is defined as an ubiquitous element ahoulé et al 2015 shahid et al 2018 which is available in all parts of the earth its occurrence in groundwater is closely related to the redox conditions the geology of the area and aquifer sediment climate and anthropogenic activities nriagu et al 2007 ahoulé et al 2015 arsenic is considered as one of the most toxic substances on the earth its presence in groundwater could cause both acute toxicities and chronic effects such as cancer who 2001 barbiero et al 2007 4 2 pesticide analyses in spite of the economic importance of the loukkos region it still suffers from a lack of data regarding the presence of pesticides in groundwater analyses of organochlorine organophosphorus and organonitrogen pesticides are shown in tables 6 8 respectively four drinking wells out of ten gw1 gw2 gw6 and gw9 showed the presence of pesticides out of the 80 analyzed pesticides only 9 active substances were found in concentrations that exceed the quantification limit of the test method four organochlorine pesticides were detected being three of them metabolites of endosulfan insecticide endosulfan alpha endosulfan beta and endosulfan sulphate with a total concentration of 60 5 ng l found at gw6 metholachlor was also detected but only at gw1 at a concentration of 8 3 ng l the results of organophosphorus pesticides in groundwater revealed the presence of a single active ingredient chlorpyriphos ethyl which was detected twice in gw2 and gw6 at concentrations of 8 5 ng l and 3 3 ng l respectively regarding organonitrogen pesticides all that were detected in the study area belong to the family of s triazine pesticides metribuzin was detected only once in gw6 at a concentration of 41 1 ng l while atrazine terbutryn and trietazine were detected at gw9 with a total concentration of 30 3 ng l table 9 represents the characteristics of the pesticides detected in the r mel groundwater compared to the other samples gw6 showed the highest degree of contamination with the presence of five pesticides belonging to the three analyzed chemical groups with a total concentration of 105 ng l in spite of this it did not exceed the standard fixed by the moroccan standardization of pesticides in drinking water moroccan official bulletin 2002 which coincide with those established in the european union directive 98 83 ec 1998 both regulations establish that the maximum allowable level is 0 1 μg l for each pesticide and 0 5 μg l for the sum of all pesticide concentrations in previous studies of the same study area in which less pesticides were analyzed el bakouri et al 2007 very similar results were reported in a sampling point close to gw6 of the r mel aquifer in which the sum of pesticides concentration was slightly lower 91 ng l than in this study 105 ng l as was mentioned before however previous results clearly showed the pollution the of r mel groundwater by atrazine in two sample points close to sample gw7 of this study the concentrations were 0 11 0 12 μg l which were higher than the safe level recommended for drinking water el bakouri et al 2007 in a subsequent work el bakouri et al 2008 the presence of 23 pesticides in the r mel groundwater was investigated and traces of endosulfan and their degradation products were found in the study area they found that endosulfan ether exceeds the moroccan and eu standards in certain time of the year and they concluded that alpha and beta isomers of endosulfan were degraded to endosulfan ether and endosulfan sulphate once in nature however in this work more than 10 years later the usage of endosulfan related pesticides in this area may have changed since only gw6 sample showed the presence of endosulfan related pesticides with a sum of 60 5 ng l which is below the moroccan and eu standard limit however and in another sense these results confirm the continued use of pesticides use in this rural area 4 3 multivariate statistical analysis 4 3 1 correlation matrix correlation between physicochemical parameters serve to explain the relationship between parameters in a water sample and identify the origin of dissolved compounds in water hamzaoui azaza et al 2011 table 10 shows the pearson correlation coefficients between the physicochemical parameters a significant correlation was observed between electrical conductivity ec and no3 cl and ca2 providing information about the principal parameters controlling the salinity of groundwater in the r mel aquifer a high positive correlation r 0 8 was also observed between cl and the major cations ca2 and mg2 this significant relationship informs about chemical weathering and leaching of secondary salts in the groundwater prasanna et al 2010 the reasonably good correlation between doc and as mn r 0 7 also suggests that the occurrence of as and mn might be influenced at least partially by the concentration of doc in the r mel aquifer arsenic exhibits significant positive correlation with mn r 0 62 which may indicates their common source in groundwater consequently it is supposed that trace elements which are significantly correlated could be attributed to the same source of pollution mansouri et al 2012 towfiqul islam et al 2017 despite the significant relationship between ca2 and no3 a low correlation was noted between no3 and mg2 po3 4 shows high negative correlation with ca2 and moderate correlation with mg2 and indicates that po4 3 ions might decrease with the increase of hardness in the r mel groundwater the strong relationship r 0 86 between nh4 and no2 could explain their weak concentrations in groundwater other significant correlations were also found between po3 4 ph tss doc tss as and cl doc 4 3 2 principal component analysis the output of the pca allows the extraction of four rotated factors characterized by an eigenvalue greater than 1 and constitutes approximately 88 8 of the total explained variance the results of pca loading for the 15 physicochemical parameters are shown in table 11 the first component explains 28 31 of the total variance with high positive loading of doc tss mn and as and a moderate loading of cl this component reports on the hydrogeochemical process leading to the release of as and mn in groundwater indeed several studies have attributed the release of as in groundwater to the presence of doc anawar et al 2002a halim et al 2014 anawar et al 2002b and liu et al 2003 reported that the high concentration of as in groundwater is mainly due to the high concentration of nh4 doc and po4 3 and inversely related to the concentrations of no3 do and so4 which reflects a reduced environment consequently the mobilization of as and mn in the r mel groundwater could be due to the microbial reductive dissolution of mn oxide mno hydroxide mn oh 2 which could use the high level of dissolved organic matter anawar et al 2002a 2003 liu et al 2003 halim et al 2014 this reductive dissolution of mno mn oh 2 stimulates the release of as since it is adsorbed on mno and mn oh 2 surfaces sediment zhang et al 2020 the release of arsenic in the groundwater might be ascribed to two sources the first being natural and mainly linked to rocks weathering and volcanic emissions while the second represents the anthropogenic contribution and specifically linked to some industrial and agricultural activities vithanage et al 2007 grutzmacher et al 2013 reported that in shallows aquifers the samples are commonly contaminated by both geogenic and anthropogenic sources however the geogenic contamination is defined as the exceeding of certain thresholds without the intervention of any human activity grutzmacher et al 2013 this definition complicates the assertion of the source of as in the r mel aquifer due to the large expansion of irrigated fields and the intensive use of fertilizers and agrochemicals in addition bhattacharya et al 2007 reported that despite the fact that as is often attributed to the geological setting the contribution of anthropogenic activities should not be ignored the second component pc2 explains 23 49 of variability and has a strong negative loading to po4 3 and ph and moderate loading to ca2 and mg2 this component represents the natural processes leading to the precipitation of calcium and magnesium carbonate under alkaline conditions and suggests also that low po3 4 concentrations could be due to the alkaline nature of groundwater samples pc 3 represents 21 96 of the total variability and is characterized by strong positive loading of ec no 3 and moderate loading of ca2 indicating the principal ions controlling the mineralization of groundwater in the study area the high negative loading of do toward this component could be an evidence for the stability of nitrates in the groundwater since all others inorganic nitrogenous forms were oxidized thus causing an excess of nitrates in the groundwater it has been reported that in the oxic groundwater nitrate is the most stable form ma et al 2016 hansen et al 2017 on the contrary nitrite can occur at concentrations comparable to those of nitrate under reducing conditions rivett et al 2008 the moderate loading of ca2 in this component could explain the dominance of ca2 over mg2 in the groundwater samples and suggest that ca2 might have identical source such nitrate in the groundwater generally this component relates to the anthropogenic pollution caused by the intensive farming activities in the study area lastly pc4 describes 15 03 of variability and has strong positive loadings to nh4 and no2 followed by a moderate loading of zn this last component illustrates the tendency of these compounds to be reduced under oxic groundwater conditions this hypothesis is supported since the aquifer experiences high levels of no3 ions 4 3 3 hierarchical cluster analysis the dendrogram generated from hca shows four clusters fig 3 cluster 1 contains a single sample gw7 located in the central portion of the r mel aquifer which is characterized by shallows depth and delineated by intensive farming activities this sample characterized by elevated concentrations of no3 cl and ca2 reflects the highest dissolved values of these compounds in the study area cluster 2 encompasses two sub clusters gw6 and gw1 and gw2 representing the central and northwestern portions of the r mel aquifer respectively the water quality analysis in this area reveals higher dissolved values of ca2 no3 and as and displays pesticides traces the cluster 2 tends to follow the same characteristics of cluster 1 but with less sharpness cluster 3 also consists of two sub clusters the first is composed of gw4 and gw9 while the second contains only gw8 this cluster represents both northwestern and southwestern parts of the r mel aquifer displays the lowest nitrate concentrations and provides information on the region unaffected by agricultural practices the placement of gw4 and gw9 in this cluster separately from gw8 was due to their high concentration of ca2 which likely occurs from the dissolution of bicarbonate rocks gw8 was placed alone in cluster 3 as the cleanest sample since all physicochemical parameters trace elements and pesticides were present at minor concentrations and none exceedance of who standard was recorded this sample was located away from agricultural fields and could reflect the natural background level of metals in the study area cluster 4 is formed by gw5 gw10 and gw3 these three sites have a low ec when compared to the other samples however high nitrate values 100 mg l were noted demonstrating also agricultural pollution in general the clustering results were based on the rate of groundwater mineralization and flow direction resulted in four classes in the following mineralization order cluster 1 cluster 2 cluster 4 cluster 3 4 3 4 water quality index the calculated wqi score at each of the sampled sites are described in fig 4 the results show that the wqi range between 23 76 and 174 99 the sample gw8 contained water of an excellent quality and is therefore classified as suitable for consumption by the rural population samples gw3 gw4 gw5 gw9 and gw10 have scores ranging between 50 and 100 and were classified as good water for consumption however samples gw1 gw2 gw6 and gw7 were classified as poor water type as they exceed the score of 100 with a maximum value of 174 recorded at gw7 the highest values of wqi have been found to be specifically related to the highs concentrations of nitrates calcium and to the arsenic values surpassing the standards in some locations 4 3 5 hierarchical cluster analysis and wqi fig 5 illustrates a comparison between hca and wqi classifications this comparison allows the evaluation of the similarity between the two methods it has been noticed that the samples with the closest wqi scores were classified in the same cluster and then sub cluster by comparing the clusters 1 with 2 that include gw1 gw2 gw6 and gw7 it appears that the samples were classified according to their wqi results for e g sample gw7 which is characterized by the highest wqi 174 was placed alone in cluster 1 while gw1 gw2 and gw6 which scored 102 108 and 117 respectively were classed in cluster 2 within cluster 2 gw1 and gw2 have closest wqi and were grouped in the same sub cluster separately from gw6 the samples gw4 gw9 and gw8 were characterized by the lowest wqi values 65 63 and 26 respectively and in agreement they were arranged within cluster 3 sub clustering of gw4 and gw9 separately from gw8 was also in agreement with their wqi values similarly cluster 4 comprised gw3 gw5 and gw10 which had similar wqi scores 86 85 and 80 respectively although in this case hca could not group gw3 and gw5 in the same sub cluster different from that of gw10 because of the highly similar wqi values on the other hand the hca analysis yielded four classes instead of three in the wqi classification which is normal since it depends on how the categories of water according to the wqi are established the wqi of sample gw7 is clearly higher than the ones of gw1 gw2 and gw6 fig 4 however they are all within the same category blue all waters have a wqi above 100 in the same poor quality water category probably if there were another categories of water quality for those having a wqi 150 for instance gw7 would be in the very poor quality water category however hca is able to distinguish and separate them in two clusters because it establishes more categories despite this both methods yielded similar results and their merging may lead to a better interpretation of the groundwater quality rating 4 3 6 spatial distribution the spatial distribution of nitrate in the r mel aquifer showed that almost the entire area is affected by higher levels of no3 that exceed the standard value of who 2011 fig 6 the contamination of the r mel aquifer by nitrate is mainly due to the large expansion of irrigated fields surrounding the study area the spatial distribution of wqi fig 7 indicates that the eastern region represented by gw8 has excellent water quality because it is not impacted by the agricultural activities of the region since it is located outside of the irrigated area hence this area may reflect the original quality of the r mel groundwater samples gw3 gw4 gw5 gw9 and gw10 representing both the southwestern and northeastern portions of the study area were classified as good water type despite this fact the water quality of this area tends to worsen over time as they are close to the irrigated fields however a large central zone of the study area contains groundwater of poor quality and poses a serious risk to the health of the rural population as it is directly subjected to the intensive agricultural activities 5 conclusions the large expansion of agricultural lands in the r mel region constitutes a serious threat to the groundwater quality and therefore to its rural inhabitants this study focuses on the assessment of selected pollutants that could affect the quality of drinking water in the r mel area the physicochemical characterization revealed that the r mel aquifer was strongly affected by agricultural fertilizers and in some locations also showed the presence of as at concentrations exceeding the who standard in the other hand the chromatographic analyses of pesticides revealed the detection of nine pesticides in the groundwater samples distributed between four wells gw1 gw2 gw6 and gw9 despite their detection in the study area those pesticides do not exceed the moroccan and european commission recommended limits and therefore do not pose any danger to the health of consumers in this study pca has helped to identify the principal sources of pollution in the r mel aquifer the extracted components demonstrate that the r mel groundwater was generally dominated by two types of pollution the first one was minor and controlled by water sediment interaction and leaching of as under reducing conditions pc1 and pc4 while the second report on a dominant pollution from anthropogenic origin mainly related to the intensive agricultural activities pc3 hca allowed the classification of groundwater samples into four clusters referring to aquifer mineralization the results of the wqi in the study area were specifically dependent on no3 ca2 as and th and led to the following classification gw8 excellent water gw3 gw4 gw5 gw9 good water and gw1 gw2 gw6 gw7 poor water by comparing the results of wqi and hca it was noticed that the two methods were consistent and have common points in their classification this study has shown that merging and combining wqi and hca can lead to a better understanding of the groundwater classification in future works the spatial distribution map of nitrate indicates that almost the entire study area is affected by no3 concentrations exceeding the who level of 50 mg l which can pose serious health problems for the local inhabitants whereas the spatial distribution of wqi revealed that the central area of the r mel aquifer characterized by intensive irrigation farms was heavily polluted by agricultural practices in conclusion the r mel aquifer located in the loukkos region suffers from a wide variety of pollutants mainly resulting from agricultural practices another point is that an excess of nitrate together with high toc concentration and low dissolved oxygen may lead to enhance anaerobic bacterial activities leading to release of as and mn from sediment to groundwater which increase the health risk of the consumers in this sense it is recommended to monitor the use of this groundwater at the same time a depollution technique should be implemented in the study area to reduce the negative effects of intensive farming and ensure drinking water safety for the rural population of this region declaration of competing interest the authors
