12455,the aim of this study was to investigate nitrogen removal in the microbial fuel cell mfc related to spatial stratification of bacterial community in cathodic biofilm under different carbon nitrogen ratios single chamber air cathode mfc was tested under different ratio of cod n i e 40 16 and 10 respectively with the freezing microtome method matured cathodic biofilms after 13 operation cycles were sliced into 5 layers layer 1 close to anolyte and layer 5 close to cathode with a thickness of 20 30 μm each layer results showed that high removals of ammonia and total nitrogen were achieved with stratification of bacterial communities in the cathodic biofilms of mfc the relative abundance of sm1a02 was in a range of 14 7 26 5 in all the layers under cod n of 40 but only 0 5 in layers of 1 and 2 under cod n of 10 paracoccus had the relative abundance higher than 30 and lower than 1 5 in all the layers under cod n of 10 and 40 respectively the functional genes including amo nxra nxrb narg nirs and norc were upregulated under low cod n ratio indicating that the nitrification and denitrification were enhanced in the cathodic biofilms the freezing microtome combined with high throughput sequencing of biofilms provided a useful way to characterize the spatial stratification of bacterial community in the nitrogen removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial fuel cell nitrogen removal stratification cathodic biofilm freezing microtome method data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a large amount of nitrogenous wastewater is produced in industrial and agricultural production 1 4 therefore nitrogen removal is essential in wastewater treatment and can be realized using the conventional biological processes 5 9 however the intensive aeration consumes high electricity 4 6 kwh kg n with excess sludge production 10 12 microbial fuel cell mfc is a typical bioelectrochemical system bes which uses electrochemically active bacteria eab to catalyze the organic compounds oxidation in wastewater and produce electricity 13 16 in the single chamber air cathode mfc the aeration energy is saved by the gas diffusion cathode with low sludge production and high nitrogen removal 17 24 the maximum removal of total nitrogen reached 93 9 in the single chamber mfc which had a nitrifying biofilm pre enriched on the air cathode 14 moreover 30 50 of the operational costs can be saved in the mfc compared with the conventional waste activated sludge process 25 26 therefore the mfc has shown great potential in nitrogen removal from wastewater nutrient gradients such as dissolved oxygen do can exist in the cathodic biofilms because of the thickness of cathodic biofilm in the mfc 27 do concentration greatly decreased from 200 to 0 μm within a distance of 3 mm from the cathodic interface to the solution in an air cathode mfc which affected the composition of bacterial community in the cathodic biofilm 28 in a dual chamber aerated cathode mfc the community stratification in the cathodic biofilm was observed by the results of fluorescent in situ hybridization fish 27 because of the limitation of fish probes only two types of probes were used to detect db i e par1457 and pae997 probes and b proteobacterial ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob i e nso190 and nso1225 probes which the detailed stratification of bacterial community was still unknown 27 the inner structure and composition of the bacterial community in the biofilm can be determined via the freezing microtome method 29 30 in a single chamber air cathode mfc fed by maltodextrin as substrate the composition of bacterial community varied in different portions in the cathodic biofilm 29 enterococcus had the relative abundance of 3 7 in the top layer 100 150 μm and increased to 10 5 in the middle 50 100 μm layer of the cathodic biofilm 29 an anoxic zone close to the anolyte may exist with low oxygen and high substrate concentrations while an aerobic zone close to the air cathode exist with high oxygen and low substrate concentrations in the cathodic biofilm 29 moreover the stratification of bacteria community in the cathodic biofilm may be affected by many factors including do substrate concentration and so on 13 27 28 31 32 carbon nitrogen c n ratio is taken as one of key factors to affect the nitrogen removal in the mfc 33 34 for example high c n ratio could be useful for enhancing nitrate removal and inhibit nitrite accumulation 33 34 therefore different c n ratio in the mfc may result in the change of community composition in the cathodic biofilm however the effect of c n ratio on the spatial structure of bacteria community is still unclear in the cathodic biofilm of mfc during the nitrogen removal the objective of this study was to investigate the spatial stratification of cathodic biofilm in a single chamber air chamber mfc in the nitrogen removal under different c n ratios with the freezing microtome method different layers of cathodic biofilms were sampled and analyzed by high throughput sequencing and functional gene techniques the mechanism of spatial stratification of community was discussed in the cathodic biofilm during the nitrogen removal in the mfc 2 materials and methods 2 1 mfc construction and operation single chamber air cathode mfc with the effective volume of 28 ml was made by a cube perspex with drilling a hole length diameter 4 cm 3 cm fig s1 19 carbon brush length diameter 3 cm 3 cm was used as the anode the cathode with the effective surface area of 7 cm2 was made by the rolling method with activated carbon as the catalyst 35 the gas diffusion layer of the cathode was prepared by carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe with the rolling method 35 in brief the mixture of carbon black and ptfe was rolled on the stainless steel mesh as the supporting layer then it was heated at 340 c for 30 min to melt ptfe and form the gas diffusion layer 35 a external resistance of 1000 ω was used to connect the anode and cathode electrodes of mfc the mfcs were inoculated with mixed aerobic and anaerobic sludge and startup as described by 36 then mfcs were tested in series by feeding solutions containing 1 g l acetate ammonia nh4 n concentration and 50 mm phosphate buffer and trace elements 36 typical municipal wastewater has the c n ratio of 10 5 12 5 and high c n ratio may be useful for nitrogen removal in the conventional wastewater treatment 37 38 therefore three c n i e cod n ratios of 40 16 and 10 was tested respectively using different nh4 n concentration i e 20 50 and 80 mg l the solutions were refreshed when the voltage on the external resistance of 1000 ω in the mfc was 50 mv all experiments were carried out in duplicate at 30 1 c 2 2 analysis and calculations the cell voltage was obtained using a data acquisition unit model 2700 keithley instruments inc usa every 15 min 19 the cell current was calculated by

electrodes respectively 13 41 in the cv measurement the scan rate was 10 mv s with the potential in a range of 0 9 to 0 7 v 13 in the eis measurement the amplitude was 5 mv with the frequency in a range of 10 khz to 0 1 hz 41 2 4 freezing microtome on the cathodic biofilm matured cathodic biofilms were sampled using the freezing microtome method after a stable nitrogen removal was achieved at least 13 cycles 26 d in the mfc 19 29 30 the whole cathode 7 cm2 was taken from the mfc and embedded in an oct optimal cutting temperature compound sakura 4583 usa each sample of cathodic biofilm was sliced in five layers at 15 c using freezing microtome leica cm1950 germany the thickness of each layer was 20 30 μm layers 1 2 3 4 and 5 were located from the top close to the anolyte to the bottom of the cathodic biofilm close to the cathode sequentially the slices were stored in vials at a 80 c for dna extraction 2 5 bacterial community analysis samples from the cathodic biofilm slices were extracted to the total dna using the dna kit 12888 50 mobio usa the universal primers of 338f actcc tacgggaggcagca and 806r ggactacvsgggtatctaat were used to amplify the v3 v4 region of the 16s rdna gene 19 the pcr products were purified and then sequenced on the miseq platform biomaker technologies co ltd beijing china taxonomic assignments were made at the confidence threshold of 90 using the greengene database the raw sequencing reads were submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive sra database the accession number srp157016 alpha diversity indices including shannon simpson and chao1 were calculated as previously described 42 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was carried out to visualize differences in the compositions of bacterial communities 43 the redundancy analysis rda was conducted to ascertain the relationship between the microbial community with the selected environmental variables including cod n ratio ammonia concentration internal resistance and power density using canoco 5 0 software faprotax and picrust2 was used to compare the difference of microbial community function and genes related to nitrogen removal in the cathodic biofilm under different cod n ratio respectively based on the results of 16s dna sequences 44 45 the functional pathways involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolisms were analyzed according to the database of farprotax 1 2 1 44 45 the key genes involved in the nitrogen removal were determined by picrust2 46 47 one way analysis of variance anova was performed with the ibm spss 22 spss inc usa to compare the predicted results by picrust2 2 6 rna extraction and quantitative real time pcr assay rna extraction from the samples in the whole cathodic biofilms under the different cod n ratios was conducted using the rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa the primers of 1114f cggcaacgagcgcaaccc and 1275r ccattgtagcacgtgtgtagcc were used to amplify the samples in the quantitative real time pcr qpcr 48 the genes of ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and nitrous oxide nosz reductases in the whole cathodic biofilms under the different cod n ratios were also determined by qpcr the primers of amo hao and nosz were used based on the literature 49 51 table 1 the sybr green detection method was taken with the pcr conditions as previously reported 42 50 the target gene sequences of the positive control pcr product were diluted 10 fold to setup standard curves a negative control no template added into the qpcr amplification reaction was used to exclude the false positives based on the standard curve and normalized by the abundance of 16s rrna the copy number of each gene was calculated 42 50 51 3 results and discussions 3 1 electricity generation in the mfc almost the same maximum voltages were generated in the mfcs with the different cod n ratios fig 1a the average maximum voltage was 537 10 mv the operational time was 32 3 h in the cell with the different cod n ratios the maximum power density in the mfc under cod n of 10 1018 110 mw m2 was slightly higher than those under cod n ratios of 16 936 90 mw m2 and 40 928 95 mw m2 respectively p 0 05 coulombic efficiency values was kept in a range of 12 8 17 0 in the mfc with the different cod n ratios no significantly change of maximum power density in the mfc under different cod n ratios indicated that nitrogen removal may mainly take place in the cathodic biofilm 13 14 the maximum power density in our mfc were comparable to previously reported in the literature 13 14 47 with the nitrogen doped graphene oxide cathodic catalyst the air cathode mfc could have the maximum power density of 112 5 mw m2 1800 mw m3 using the synthetic wastewater which contained 879 mg l sodium acetate as substrate 47 the air cathode mfc fed by 1640 mg l sodium acetate i e 1280 mg l cod and 200 mg l no3 n had the maximum power density of 977 and 637 mw m2 with the external resistance of 20 and 1000 ω respectively 13 in the single chamber air cathode mfc with diethylamine functionalized polymer as the pt catalyst binder on the cathode the maximum power density reached 900 25 mw m2 with 1000 mg l acetate and 100 mg l nh4 n 14 nevertheless the electricity generation in the mfc varied with different cod concentrations mfc configuration and cathodic catalyst etc the cathodes under the cod n ratios after 13 cycles of operation were taken for the lsv eis and cv measurements the electro catalytic ability of all the used cathodes was lower than that of the fresh one possibly attributable to formation of matured cathodic biofilms fig 1b the cv measurements showed that the used cathodes had the reduction peak similar to that of the fresh cathode at 260 30 mv but had slightly lower peak current than the fresh cathode fig s2 the total internal resistance of the mfc under cod n ratio of 10 was the lowest 59 2 6 0 ω compared with those under the cod n ratios of 16 66 4 7 ω and 40 84 2 9 ω according to the eis results fig 1c the ohm resistances rω in the mfc under the cod n ratios of 10 and 16 were almost the same 29 5 3 0 vs 29 3 3 0 ω which were lower than that with cod n of 40 43 6 5 0 ω p 0 01 the charge transfer resistance rct in the mfc under cod n ratio of 40 was the highest 40 6 5 0 ω among the different cod n ratios 3 2 nitrogen removal in the mfc efficient nh4 n removal was realized in the cell under the different cod n ratios fig 2a the nh4 n removal reached 95 in the cell under the different cod n ratios within 48 h however nh4 n removal rate in the cell under cod n of 40 0 83 0 10 mg l h was lower than those with the cod n ratios of 16 1 90 0 20 mg l h and 10 2 94 0 30 mg l h within 24 h respectively low cod n ratio may enhance the activity of aob and improve the nh4 n removal similar results have been reported in other biological processes 52 53 in the subsurface flow constructed wetlands the nh4 n removal increased with the c n ratio decreasing from 15 to 3 53 in the moving bed batch reactor the maximum nh4 n removal of 99 1 was achieved at the lowest c n ratio of 2 among the c n ratios shifting from 2 to 10 52 the total nitrogen tn removal reached 90 in the mfc under the different cod n ratios within 48 h fig 2b apparent no2 n accumulations were detected in the mfcs under the different cod n ratios within 24 h fig 2c the maximum no2 n concentration of 4 7 0 5 mg l was obtained in the mfc under cod n of 10 within 24 h the final no2 n concentrations was decreased to 1 2 mg l in all the mfcs within 48 h the no3 n concentrations gradually increased in the mfcs under the different cod n ratios within 48 h fig 2d the final no3 n concentration in the mfc under cod n of 10 3 6 0 4 mg l was much higher than those under the cod n ratios of 16 1 3 0 1 mg l and 40 1 3 0 1 mg l respectively p 0 05 the no3 n reduction consumes carbon source with a theoretical cod n ratio of 2 86 32 high cod n ratio can enhance heterotrophic denitrification and improve the no3 n removal 32 correspondingly the cod removal reached 97 in all the cells under the different cod n ratios within 48 h data not shown 3 3 microbial communities in the cathode biofilms of mfc at the phylum level the compositions of bacterial communities were determined in the different layers of cathodic biofilms under the different cod n ratios by illumina high throughput sequencing fig 3 under cod n of 40 proteobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia were dominant of bacterial communities in layers 1 5 fig 3a the relative abundance of these dominant bacteria varied in the layers 1 5 of the cathodic biofilms among the layers proteobacteria had the highest relative abundance of 58 5 in layer 2 the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia increased from 1 4 in layer 1 to 16 in layer 4 under cod n of 16 the relative abundance of proteobacteria was in a range of 59 6 63 9 in layers 1 to 5 fig 3b the abundance of bacteroidetes increased from 13 1 in layer 1 to 21 5 in layer 5 under cod n of 10 the abundance of proteobacteria was almost the same 87 0 in layers 3 4 and 5 which was higher than that in layer 1 72 0 and layer 2 75 9 respectively fig 3c at the genus level various bacteria were identified in the layers 1 5 of the cathodic biofilms in the mfcs fig 4 under cod n of 40 luteimonas alicycliphilus sm1a02 and azoarcus were the dominant bacteria in the communities in the layers luteimonas had the highest relative abundance of 17 5 in layer 3 while alicycliphilus was the highest one 11 2 in layer 2 high abundance of sm1a02 14 7 26 5 was found in all the layers the relative abundance of azoarcus greatly changed from 2 9 layer 1 to 17 3 layer 5 paracoccus had low abundance of 1 5 in all the layers under cod n of 16 luteimonas alicycliphilus paracoccus and sm1a02 dominated the communities of the cathodic biofilms in the layers abundance of alicycliphilus decreased from 18 2 in layer 1 to 4 4 in layer 5 paracoccus reached the highest abundance of 20 1 in layer 5 which was much higher than that under cod n of 40 1 3 under cod n of 10 luteimonas alicycliphilus and paracoccus were the dominant bacteria in the layers relative abundance of paracoccus was 30 0 in the layers the highest abundance of luteimonas and alicycliphilus was 15 2 and 17 0 in layers 3 and 4 respectively abundance of sm1a02 was 0 5 in layers 1 and 2 the diversity of bacterial communities in the layers of 1 5 of the cathodic biofilms was characterized with the different indices table 2 under cod n of 40 the indices of shannon simpson chao 1 and ace decreased from layer 1 to layer 5 that is the community in the cathodic biofilm closer to the cathode had lower indices under cod n of 16 the shannon and simpson indices reached the highest values of 4 971 and 0 939 in layer 5 respectively while the chao 1 and ace indices reached the lowest values of 191 and 192 in layer 5 respectively under cod n of 10 the indices fluctuated within the layers but all the indices had the lowest values in layer 5 the lowest indices in layer 5 indicated that the highest richness and evenness of the bacterial community took place in the cathodic biofilms close to the cathode various identified bacteria in the cathodic biofilms in this study have been found in other mfcs paracoccus had been found in the single chamber mfc for high salinity wastewater treatment and was considered to have the ability of heterotrophic nitrification or denitrification 54 55 sm1a02 belonged to the phylum planctomycetes and was considered to be capable of denitrification 46 56 in a dual chamber mfc sm1a02 could dominate the community of cathodic biofilm with the relative abundance of 21 8 during the denitrification 56 the relative abundance of sm1a02 increased from 1 7 to 8 3 in the cathodic biofilm with the cathodic potential increasing from 400 to 400 mv in a dual chamber mfc fed by 400 mg l nano3 and 234 mg l cod 46 moreover sm1a02 had the relative abundance of 7 9 in the cathodic biofilm in the self buffered biocathode mfc for high salinity mustard tuber wastewater treatment which was considered as a nitrifying bacterium 57 nevertheless sm1a02 should play an important role in the nitrogen removal of the cathodic biofilm in the mfc thauera was able to denitrify under aerobic conditions in the mfc 58 59 moreover burkholderiaceae 60 dokdonella 61 thauera 62 and paracoccus 62 are also reported as eab in the bes indicating that the extracellular electron transfer may be important in the nitrogen removal farprotax functional annotation showed that the metabolic function of the cathodic biofilm varied with the cod n ratios in the mfc fig 5 63 layer 5 of the cathodic biofilm under cod n of 40 had higher functional abundances in the respiration of nitrate and nitrogen compared to other layers indicating that high cod n ratio may drive the nitrifying process taking place close to the cathode high functional abundances in the denitrification of nitrate nitrate and nitrous oxide were observed at layers 3 5 of the cathodic biofilm under cod n 10 indicating that low cod n ratio may enhance the denitrification process to explore the nitrification and denitrification processes in the cathodic biofilms the identified bacteria were roughly classified into aob nob and db according to the bacterial functions at the genus level 54 55 under the cod n ratio of 40 the sum of relative abundances of aob and nob could reach 48 3 of the total genus at the layer 5 of the cathodic biofilm and was much higher than that of aob and nob at other layers i e 1 4 indicating that the nitrification could be more active at layer 5 than others p 0 01 under the cod n ratio of 10 db dominated the communities with the relative abundance higher than 40 0 at layers 3 4 and 5 respectively indicating that denitrification could be enhanced at layers 3 5 i e close to the cathode of the cathodic biofilms nevertheless our classification of aob nob and db at different layers was consistent with the predicted results of the functional abundances moreover 40 of the total identified genus in the communities of cathodic biofilms could not be clearly classified into any aob nob or db indicating that the cathodic biofilms may have various functions including nitrogen removal the effect of cod n ratios on the bacterial communities in the cathodic biofilms was analyzed with the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds fig 6a compositions of the bacterial communities under different cod n ratios were distinctly different from each other indicating that different cod n ratios promoted the formation of different bacterial communities on the cathodic biofilms the rda results demonstrated that the variables of cod n ratio and nh4 n concentration could account for 78 8 of the total effect on the microbial communities while only 5 2 of the total effect could be attributed to the internal resistance and power density of mfc fig 6 b both the nmds and rda results indicated that the spatial composition of bacterial community in the cathodic biofilm was greatly affected by different cod n ratios 3 4 quantification of function genes in the cathodic biofilm the expressive abundances of amo hao and nosz genes varied in the cathodic biofilms under the different cod n ratios according to the results of qpcr fig 7a the genes were in a range of 0 62 000 copies μg rna comparable to that in the hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor 51 amo which can catalyze ammonia oxidation into nh2oh 49 64 had the highest average copies under cod n of 10 62 000 copies μg rna among the different ratios large amount of amo may be useful in the removal of high ammonia concentration i e low cod n ratio such as 10 hao can catalyze nh2oh into no2 or n2o in the nitritation nosz can convert n2o to n2 in the denitrification 65 66 the lowest average copies of hao 1050 copies μg rna and nosz 1020 copies μg rna was obtained under cod n of 40 and 10 among different cod n ratios respectively indicating that cod n ratio may have different effect on hao and nosz because many genes can be involved in the nitrogen removal only 1 2 genes such as hao and nosz upregulation or downregulation may not cause significantly effect on the nitrification and denitrification in the cathodic biofilm to further explore the genes related to nitrogen removal the relative expressions of nitrification nxra and nxrb and denitrification genes narg nirs and norc were predicted as shown in fig 7 bf the relative expressions of all the predicted genes was upregulated with the cod n ratio decreasing combing with the measured and predicted results most of genes related to nitrogen metabolism should be upregulated under low cod n ratio for enhancing the nitrogen removal which was consistent with the characterization of bacterial communities in the cathodic biofilms of mfc 49 67 under low cod n ratio db preferred to occupy more portions so as to compete with other bacteria for more carbon sources high relative abundance of db 40 0 was consistent with high abundance expression of narg nirs and norc under high cod n ratio such as 40 aob and nob were more abundant in the portions close to the cathode without lacking of carbon sources oxygen diffusion from cathode may be the key to control the location of aob and nob with closer to the cathode i e layer 5 of the cathodic biofilm aob and nob could utilize more oxygen and efficiently nitrify yan et al 17 showed that nh4 n removal efficiency decreased by 19 with cod n ratio decrease from 13 to 3 in the single chamber air cathode mfc under low cod n ratio aob and nob could not efficiently remove nh4 n with carbon deficiency and high nh4 n concentration to enhance the nitrogen removal in the mfc a suitable cod n ratio should be optimized in the real wastewater treatment a cost benefit assessment of mfc is also needed to carry out and compare with other biological treatment processes 38 different environmental treatments could be solved in an economical way which includes nitrogen and carbon rich wastewaters by similar strains such as anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob in the mfc because of limited probes and hybridization fish cannot detect all the functional bacteria with 100 hybridization 27 33 probably resulting in the difficulty to know the whole stratification of biofilm the result of the deduction from microbial ecology is not only depended on the high throughput sequencing of biofilms but also affected by the skills of researchers 10 the freezing microtome method can be performed easily and fast in practice 19 29 30 with the slices and high throughput sequencing method the stratification of bacterial community can be determined accurately therefore results from this study provided a useful way to study characteristics of bacterial community in the mfc 4 conclusions the spatial stratification of bacterial communities existed in different layers of the cathodic biofilm in the mfc during the nitrogen removal the relative abundance of sm1a02 was in a range of 14 7 26 5 in all the layers under cod n of 40 but only 0 5 in layers of 1 and 2 under cod n of 10 paracoccus had the relative abundance higher than 30 and lower than 1 5 in all the layers under cod n of 10 and 40 respectively the functional genes including amo nxra nxrb narg nirs and norc were upregulated under low cod n ratio indicating that the nitrification and denitrification were enhanced in the cathodic biofilms in the layer close to the cathode aob and nob were abundant under high cod n but db was enriched under low cod n results from this study could be useful for understanding the mechanism of nitrogen removal in the cathodic biofilm of mfc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

12455,the aim of this study was to investigate nitrogen removal in the microbial fuel cell mfc related to spatial stratification of bacterial community in cathodic biofilm under different carbon nitrogen ratios single chamber air cathode mfc was tested under different ratio of cod n i e 40 16 and 10 respectively with the freezing microtome method matured cathodic biofilms after 13 operation cycles were sliced into 5 layers layer 1 close to anolyte and layer 5 close to cathode with a thickness of 20 30 μm each layer results showed that high removals of ammonia and total nitrogen were achieved with stratification of bacterial communities in the cathodic biofilms of mfc the relative abundance of sm1a02 was in a range of 14 7 26 5 in all the layers under cod n of 40 but only 0 5 in

potential in nitrogen removal from wastewater nutrient gradients such as dissolved oxygen do can exist in the cathodic biofilms because of the thickness of cathodic biofilm in the mfc 27 do concentration greatly decreased from 200 to 0 μm within a distance of 3 mm from the cathodic interface to the solution in an air cathode mfc which affected the composition of bacterial community in the cathodic biofilm 28 in a dual chamber aerated cathode mfc the community stratification in the cathodic biofilm was observed by the results of fluorescent in situ hybridization fish 27 because of the limitation of fish probes only two types of probes were used to detect db i e par1457 and pae997 probes and b proteobacterial ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob i e nso190 and nso1225 probes which the detailed stratification of bacterial community was still unknown 27 the inner structure and composition of the bacterial community in the biofilm can be determined via the freezing microtome method 29 30 in a single chamber air cathode mfc fed by maltodextrin as substrate the composition of bacterial community varied in different portions in the cathodic biofilm 29 enterococcus had the relative abundance of 3 7 in the top layer 100 150 μm and increased to 10 5 in the middle 50 100 μm layer of the cathodic biofilm 29 an anoxic zone close to the anolyte may exist with low oxygen and

range of 10 khz to 0 1 hz 41 2 4 freezing microtome on the cathodic biofilm matured cathodic biofilms were sampled using the freezing microtome method after a stable nitrogen removal was achieved at least 13 cycles 26 d in the mfc 19 29 30 the whole cathode 7 cm2 was taken from the mfc and embedded in an oct optimal cutting temperature compound sakura 4583 usa each sample of cathodic biofilm was sliced in five layers at 15 c using freezing microtome leica cm1950 germany the thickness of each layer was 20 30 μm layers 1 2 3 4 and 5 were located from the top close to the anolyte to the bottom of the cathodic biofilm close to the cathode sequentially the slices were stored in vials at a 80 c for dna extraction 2 5 bacterial community analysis samples from the cathodic biofilm slices were extracted to the total dna using the dna kit 12888 50 mobio usa the universal primers of 338f actcc tacgggaggcagca and 806r ggactacvsgggtatctaat were used to amplify the v3 v4 region of the 16s rdna

greengene database the raw sequencing reads were submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive sra database the accession number srp157016 alpha diversity indices including shannon simpson and chao1 were calculated as previously described 42 nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was carried out to visualize differences in the compositions of bacterial communities 43 the redundancy analysis rda was conducted to ascertain the relationship between the microbial community with the selected environmental variables including cod n ratio ammonia concentration internal resistance and power density using canoco 5 0 software faprotax and picrust2 was used to compare the difference of microbial community function and genes related to nitrogen removal in the cathodic biofilm under different cod n ratio respectively based on the results of 16s dna sequences 44 45 the functional pathways involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolisms were analyzed according to the database of farprotax 1 2 1 44 45 the key genes involved in the nitrogen removal were determined by picrust2 46 47 one way analysis of variance anova was performed with the ibm spss 22 spss inc usa to compare the predicted results by picrust2 2 6 rna extraction and quantitative real time pcr assay rna extraction from the samples in the whole cathodic biofilms under the different cod n ratios was conducted using the rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa the primers of 1114f cggcaacgagcgcaaccc and 1275r ccattgtagcacgtgtgtagcc were used to amplify the samples in the quantitative real time pcr qpcr 48 the genes of ammonia monooxygenase amo hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and nitrous oxide nosz reductases in the whole cathodic biofilms under the different cod n ratios were also determined by qpcr the primers of amo hao and nosz were used based on the literature 49 51 table 1 the sybr green detection method was taken with the pcr conditions as previously reported 42 50 the target gene sequences of the positive control pcr product were diluted 10 fold to setup standard curves a negative control no template added into the qpcr amplification reaction was used to exclude the false positives based on the standard curve and normalized by the abundance of 16s rrna the copy number of each gene was calculated 42 50 51 3 results and discussions 3 1 electricity generation in the mfc almost the same maximum voltages were generated in the mfcs with the different cod n ratios fig 1a the average maximum voltage was 537 10 mv the operational time was 32 3 h in the cell with the different cod n ratios the maximum power density in the mfc under cod n of 10 1018 110 mw m2 was slightly higher than those under cod n ratios of 16 936 90 mw m2 and 40 928 95 mw m2 respectively p 0 05 coulombic efficiency values was kept in a range of 12 8 17 0 in the mfc with the different cod n ratios no significantly change of maximum power density in the mfc under different cod n ratios indicated that nitrogen removal may mainly take place in the cathodic biofilm 13 14 the maximum power density in our mfc were comparable to previously reported in the literature 13 14 47 with the nitrogen doped graphene oxide cathodic catalyst the air cathode mfc could have the maximum power density of 112 5 mw m2 1800 mw m3 using the synthetic wastewater which contained 879 mg l sodium acetate as substrate 47 the air cathode mfc fed by 1640 mg l sodium acetate i e 1280 mg l cod and 200 mg l no3 n had the maximum power density of 977 and 637 mw m2 with the external resistance of 20 and 1000 ω respectively 13 in the single chamber air cathode mfc with diethylamine functionalized polymer as the pt catalyst binder on the cathode the maximum power density reached 900 25 mw m2 with 1000 mg l acetate and 100 mg l nh4 n 14 nevertheless the electricity generation in the mfc varied with different cod concentrations mfc configuration and cathodic catalyst etc the cathodes under the cod n ratios after 13 cycles of operation were taken for the lsv eis and cv measurements the electro catalytic ability of all the used cathodes was lower than that of the fresh one possibly attributable to formation of matured cathodic biofilms fig 1b the cv measurements showed that the used cathodes had the reduction peak similar to that of the fresh cathode at 260 30 mv but had slightly lower peak current than the fresh cathode fig s2 the total internal resistance of the mfc under cod n ratio of 10 was the lowest 59 2 6 0 ω compared with those under the cod n ratios of 16 66 4 7 ω and 40 84 2 9 ω according to the eis results fig 1c the ohm resistances rω in the mfc under the cod n ratios of 10 and 16 were almost the same 29 5 3 0 vs 29 3 3 0 ω which were lower than that with cod n of 40 43 6 5 0 ω p 0 01 the charge transfer resistance rct in the mfc under cod n ratio of 40 was the highest 40 6 5 0 ω among the different cod n ratios 3 2 nitrogen removal in the mfc efficient nh4 n removal was realized in the cell under the different cod n ratios fig 2a the nh4 n removal reached 95 in the cell under the different cod n ratios within 48 h however nh4 n removal rate in the cell under cod n of 40 0 83 0 10 mg l h was lower than those with the cod n ratios of 16 1 90 0 20 mg l h and 10 2 94 0 30 mg l h within 24 h respectively low cod n ratio may enhance the activity of aob and improve the nh4 n removal similar results have been reported in other biological processes 52 53 in the subsurface flow constructed wetlands the nh4 n removal increased with the c n ratio decreasing from 15 to 3 53 in the moving bed batch reactor the maximum nh4 n removal of 99 1 was achieved at the lowest c n ratio of 2 among the c n ratios shifting from 2 to 10 52 the total nitrogen tn removal reached 90 in the mfc under the different cod n ratios within 48 h fig 2b apparent no2 n accumulations were detected in the mfcs under the different cod n ratios within 24 h fig 2c the maximum no2 n concentration of 4 7 0 5 mg l was obtained in the mfc under cod n of 10 within 24 h the final no2 n concentrations was decreased to 1 2 mg l in all the mfcs within 48 h the no3 n concentrations gradually increased in the mfcs under the different cod n ratios within 48 h fig 2d the final no3 n concentration in the mfc under cod n of 10 3 6 0 4 mg l was much higher than those under the cod n ratios of 16 1 3 0 1 mg l and 40 1 3 0 1 mg l respectively p 0 05 the no3 n reduction consumes carbon source with a theoretical cod n ratio of 2 86 32 high cod n ratio can enhance heterotrophic denitrification and improve the no3 n removal 32 correspondingly the cod removal reached 97 in all the cells under the different cod n ratios within 48 h data not shown 3 3 microbial communities in the cathode biofilms of mfc at the phylum level the compositions of bacterial communities were determined in the different layers of cathodic biofilms under the different cod n ratios by illumina high throughput sequencing fig 3 under cod n of 40 proteobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes and verrucomicrobia were dominant of bacterial communities in layers 1 5 fig 3a the relative abundance of these dominant bacteria varied in the layers 1 5 of the cathodic biofilms among the layers proteobacteria had the highest relative abundance of 58 5 in layer 2 the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia increased from 1 4 in layer 1 to 16 in layer 4 under cod n of 16 the relative abundance of proteobacteria was in a range of 59 6 63 9 in layers 1 to 5 fig 3b the abundance of bacteroidetes increased from 13 1 in layer 1 to 21 5 in layer 5 under cod n of 10 the abundance of proteobacteria was almost the same 87 0 in layers 3 4 and 5 which was higher than that in layer 1 72 0 and layer 2 75 9 respectively fig 3c at the genus level various bacteria were identified in the layers 1 5 of the cathodic biofilms in the mfcs fig 4 under cod n of 40 luteimonas alicycliphilus sm1a02 and azoarcus were the dominant bacteria in the communities in the layers luteimonas had the highest relative abundance of 17 5 in layer 3 while alicycliphilus was the highest one 11 2 in layer 2 high abundance of sm1a02 14 7 26 5 was found in all the layers the relative abundance of azoarcus greatly changed from 2 9 layer 1 to 17 3 layer 5 paracoccus had low abundance of 1 5 in all the layers under cod n of 16 luteimonas alicycliphilus paracoccus and sm1a02 dominated the communities of the cathodic biofilms in the layers abundance of alicycliphilus decreased from 18 2 in layer 1 to 4 4 in layer 5 paracoccus reached the highest abundance of 20 1 in layer 5 which was much higher than that under cod n of 40 1 3 under cod n of 10 luteimonas alicycliphilus and paracoccus were the dominant bacteria in the layers relative abundance of paracoccus was 30 0 in the layers the highest abundance of luteimonas and alicycliphilus was 15 2 and 17 0 in layers 3 and 4 respectively abundance of sm1a02 was 0 5 in layers 1 and 2 the diversity of bacterial communities in the layers of 1 5 of the cathodic biofilms was characterized with the different indices table 2 under cod n of 40 the indices of shannon simpson chao 1 and ace decreased from layer 1 to layer 5 that is the community in the cathodic biofilm closer to the cathode had lower indices under cod n of 16 the shannon and simpson indices reached the highest values of 4 971 and 0 939 in layer 5 respectively while the chao 1 and ace indices reached the lowest values of 191 and 192 in layer 5 respectively under cod n of 10 the indices fluctuated within the layers but all the indices had the lowest values in layer 5 the lowest indices in layer 5 indicated that the highest richness and evenness of the bacterial community took place in the cathodic biofilms close to the cathode various identified bacteria in the cathodic biofilms in this study have been found in other mfcs paracoccus had been found in the single chamber mfc for high salinity wastewater treatment and was considered to have the ability of heterotrophic nitrification or denitrification 54 55 sm1a02 belonged to the phylum planctomycetes and was considered to be capable of denitrification 46 56 in a dual chamber mfc sm1a02 could dominate the community of cathodic biofilm with the relative abundance of 21 8 during the denitrification 56 the relative abundance of sm1a02 increased from 1 7 to 8 3 in the cathodic biofilm with the cathodic potential increasing from 400 to 400 mv in a dual chamber mfc fed by 400 mg l nano3 and 234 mg l cod 46 moreover sm1a02 had the relative abundance of 7 9 in the cathodic biofilm in the self buffered biocathode mfc for high salinity mustard tuber wastewater treatment which was considered as a nitrifying bacterium 57 nevertheless sm1a02 should play an important role in the nitrogen removal of the cathodic biofilm in the mfc thauera was able to denitrify under aerobic conditions in the mfc 58 59 moreover burkholderiaceae 60 dokdonella 61 thauera 62 and paracoccus 62 are also reported as eab in the bes indicating that the extracellular electron transfer may be important in the nitrogen removal farprotax functional annotation showed that the metabolic function of the cathodic biofilm varied with the cod n ratios in the mfc fig 5 63 layer 5 of the cathodic biofilm under cod n of 40 had higher functional abundances in the respiration of nitrate and nitrogen compared to other layers indicating that high cod n ratio may drive the nitrifying process taking place close to the cathode high functional abundances in the denitrification of nitrate nitrate and nitrous oxide were observed at layers 3 5 of the cathodic biofilm under cod n 10 indicating that low cod n ratio may enhance the denitrification process to explore the nitrification and denitrification processes in the cathodic biofilms the identified bacteria were roughly classified into aob nob and db according to the bacterial functions at the genus level 54 55 under the cod n ratio of 40 the sum of relative abundances of aob and nob could reach 48 3 of the total genus at the layer 5 of the cathodic biofilm and was much higher than that of aob and nob at other layers i e 1 4 indicating that the nitrification could be more active at layer 5 than others p 0 01 under the cod n ratio of 10 db dominated the communities with the relative abundance higher than 40 0 at layers 3 4 and 5 respectively indicating that denitrification could be enhanced at layers 3 5 i e close to the cathode of the cathodic biofilms nevertheless our classification of aob nob and db at different layers was consistent with the predicted results of the functional abundances moreover 40 of the total identified genus in the communities of cathodic biofilms could not be clearly classified into any aob nob or db indicating that the cathodic biofilms may have various functions including nitrogen removal the effect of cod n ratios on the bacterial communities in the cathodic biofilms was analyzed with the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds fig 6a compositions of the bacterial communities under different cod n ratios were distinctly different from each other indicating that different cod n ratios promoted the formation of different bacterial communities on the cathodic biofilms the rda results demonstrated that the variables of cod n ratio and nh4 n concentration could account for 78 8 of the total effect on the microbial communities while only 5 2 of the total effect could be attributed to the internal resistance and power density of mfc fig 6 b both the nmds and rda results indicated that the spatial composition of bacterial community in the cathodic biofilm was greatly affected by different cod n ratios 3 4 quantification of function genes in the cathodic biofilm the expressive abundances of amo hao and nosz genes varied in the cathodic biofilms under the different cod n ratios according to the results of qpcr fig 7a the genes were in a range of 0 62 000 copies μg rna comparable to that in the hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor 51 amo which can catalyze ammonia oxidation into nh2oh 49 64 had the highest average copies under cod n of 10 62 000 copies μg rna among the different ratios large amount of amo may be useful in the removal of high ammonia concentration i e low cod n ratio such as 10 hao can catalyze nh2oh into no2 or n2o in the nitritation nosz can convert n2o to n2 in the denitrification 65 66 the lowest average copies of hao 1050 copies μg rna and nosz 1020 copies μg rna was obtained under cod n of 40 and 10 among different cod n ratios respectively indicating that cod n ratio may have different effect on hao and nosz because many genes can be involved in the nitrogen removal only 1 2 genes such as hao and nosz upregulation or downregulation may not cause significantly effect on the nitrification and denitrification in the cathodic biofilm to further explore the genes related to nitrogen removal the relative expressions of nitrification nxra and nxrb and denitrification genes narg nirs and norc were predicted as shown in fig 7 bf the relative expressions of all the predicted genes was upregulated with the cod n ratio decreasing combing with the measured and predicted results most of genes related to nitrogen metabolism should be upregulated under low cod n ratio for enhancing the nitrogen removal which was consistent with the characterization of bacterial communities in the cathodic biofilms of mfc 49 67 under low cod n ratio db preferred to occupy more portions so as to compete with other bacteria for more carbon sources high relative abundance of db 40 0 was consistent with high abundance expression of narg nirs and norc under high cod n ratio such as 40 aob and nob were more abundant in the portions close to the cathode without lacking of carbon sources oxygen diffusion from cathode may be the key to control the location of aob and nob with closer to the cathode i e layer 5 of the cathodic biofilm aob and nob could utilize more oxygen and efficiently nitrify yan et al 17 showed that nh4 n removal efficiency decreased by 19 with cod n ratio decrease from 13 to 3 in the single chamber air cathode mfc under low cod n ratio aob and nob could not efficiently remove nh4 n with carbon deficiency and high nh4 n concentration to enhance the nitrogen removal in the mfc a suitable cod n ratio should be optimized in the real wastewater treatment a cost benefit assessment of mfc is also needed to carry out and compare with other biological treatment processes 38 different environmental treatments could be solved in an economical way which includes nitrogen and carbon rich wastewaters by similar strains such as anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob in the mfc because of limited probes and hybridization fish cannot detect all the functional bacteria with 100 hybridization 27 33 probably resulting in the difficulty to know the whole stratification of biofilm the result of the deduction from microbial ecology is not only depended on the high throughput sequencing of biofilms but also affected by the skills of researchers 10 the freezing microtome method can be performed easily and fast in practice 19 29 30 with the slices and high throughput sequencing method the stratification of bacterial community can be determined accurately therefore results from this study provided a useful way to study characteristics of bacterial community in the mfc 4 conclusions the spatial stratification of bacterial communities existed in different layers of the cathodic biofilm in the mfc during the nitrogen removal the relative abundance of sm1a02 was in a range of 14 7 26 5 in all the layers under cod n of 40 but only 0 5 in layers of 1 and 2 under cod n of 10 paracoccus had the relative abundance higher than 30 and lower than 1 5 in all the layers under cod n of 10 and 40 respectively the functional genes including amo nxra nxrb narg nirs and norc were upregulated under low cod n ratio indicating that the nitrification and denitrification were enhanced in the cathodic biofilms in the layer close to the cathode aob and nob were abundant under high cod n but db was enriched under low cod n results from this study could be useful for understanding the mechanism of nitrogen removal in the cathodic biofilm of mfc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

12456,using high substrate concentrations in mixed culture fermentation increases the products concentration achieved making more cost effective and sustainable its subsequent extraction however elevated levels of organic acids also result in inhibition by undissociated acids this study investigates the concentration limits of undissociated acids that inhibit a lab scale mixed culture carbohydrate fermenter operated under constant conditions ph 5 4 hrt 20 h 30 c under these conditions the conversion capacity was consistently inhibited at undissociated acids concentrations above 24 9 mm and substrate concentrations over 18 5 gcod lfeed 1 this is attributed to the high maintenance costs incurred to maintain cell homeostasis at neutral intracellular ph in the presence of acids this inhibition leads to lower yields and net biomass loss from the system resulting in incomplete glucose conversion operating at a higher ph of 6 and utilizing granules proved to be effective

hydraulic retention time mcf mixed culture fermentation olr organic loading rate ri refractive index tss total suspended solids vss volatile suspended solids keywords inhibition organic acids resource recovery substrate concentration undissociated acids data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction open mixed culture fermentation mcf is regarded as a promising resource recovery process for obtaining valuable chemicals from biowastes such as food waste sewage sludge manure dairy wastewater lignocellulosic biomass and agricultural residues among others 1 2 in mcf organic substrates are converted into a mixture of co2 h2 solvents and organic acids 3 the organic acids produced could find use in a wide variety of industrial applications including biological nitrogen removal in sewage treatment chain elongation processes biofuel production and biodegradable polymer synthesis as well as in the pharmaceutical food textile and plastics industries among others 4 8 to improve the cost effectiveness and efficiency of downstream recovery and purification processes for organic acids it is advantageous to attain high concentrations of the product therefore the use of highly concentrated organic waste streams is preferred 1 at the same time high levels of organic acids can also cause inhibition which is currently a major limitation in using mcf systems at an industrial scale 9 hence determining the limits of substrate concentrations that can be fully converted to safely maximize product yield is crucial the suspected mechanism for inhibition by organic acids appears to be caused mainly by their undissociated form undissociated acids can freely permeate the cell membrane and dissociate intracellularly at the higher cytosolic ph which is maintained close to neutral this intake of protons lowers the cytosolic ph increasing the maintenance energy required by the cell to create the transmembrane proton gradient to generate atp 10 most research on the inhibition of mcf systems by organic acids has relied on batch assays however to fully understand the mechanism behind this process investigations conducted under continuous mode are required the consistent environment of reactors operated continuously offers a more precise understanding of microbial kinetics compared to batch tests batch tests due to the transient conditions do not reflect accurately the continuous processes as they will be implemented at large scale to convert in addition continuous systems provide information on the long term impact of higher substrate concentrations on the product spectra in a previous study our aim was to determine the concentration limits of undissociated acids that inhibit open mixed culture carbohydrate fermentation in a lab scale fermenter 1 5 l operated in continuous mode 11 to achieve this the substrate concentration was incrementally raised until the point of inhibition by undissociated acids concentration is identified in that research the glucose fermentation capacity was found to be limited at 33 gcod lfeed 1 with 32 mm of undissociated acids however the accumulation of granular biomass significantly enhanced the substrate fermentation capacity enabling full glucose conversions even at undissociated acid concentrations of up to 52 mm which is equivalent to 38 gcod lfeed 1 upper tolerance limits for undissociated acids concentration have not been assessed it is worth noting that granular biomass exhibits lower sensitivity to variations in environmental factors such as ph temperature substrate composition and toxicity when compared to suspended biomass 12 granules create protective internal micro environments that allow normal metabolic processes to continue even in bulk environments with high acidity or toxicity in line with our previous study the objective of the current study is also to investigate the concentration limits of carbohydrate conversion in a lab scale mcf operated in continuous mode and under constant operating conditions ph 5 4 hrt 20 h 30 c but this time with presence of solely suspended biomass to prevent the accumulation of the protective granular biomass modifications have been implemented to the fermenter setup additionally the effectiveness of ph adjustment as a strategy to mitigate the inhibition caused by undissociated acids is also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operation in this experiment a lab scale continuously stirred tank reactor fermac 360 electrolab was employed fig 1 the reactor had a working volume of 1 5 l and a headspace volume of 0 5 l throughout the study the operating parameters were maintained constant which included a temperature of 30 c ph of 5 4 and hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 h in mcf studies it is a common practice to set the temperature at 30 c as it facilitates effective substrate conversion 13 14 from an economic perspective opting for lower ph values in mcf proves more cost effective due to the reduced need for base additions moreover maintaining a ph below 6 inhibits the growth of methanogenic archaea 15 the selected hrt in this experiment was sufficient to support biomass growth and ensure complete glucose conversion simultaneously the hrt was set to a short duration to prevent the growth of methanogenic archaea and avoid prolonged generation times which would require a longer experimental period in this study the inoculum utilized was obtained from the effluent of a previous mcf research conducted by allegue et al 16 that fermenter was operated using the same experimental conditions hrt ph and temperature and substrate glucose as in this research the nutrients macro and micro composition in feed table s1 was similar to the one proposed by temudo et al 14 however due to the difficulties in dissolving edta its concentration was reduced by 25 fold as suggested by rafay et al 11 the control and monitoring of ph levels in the system involved the utilization of a fermac 360 controller along with a ph probe hamilton easyferm plus phi k8 225 a peristaltic pump was employed to introduce the base solution with a concentration ranging between 2 and 7 m of naoh the system was mechanically stirred at 200 rpm to ensure a permanent homogeneous mixture the synthetic feeding was added semi continuously using a peristaltic pump 0 100 rpm l s pump masterflex the feeding sequence followed a pattern of 0 5 min on and 3 min off with a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 the effluent pump was controlled by using a level probe monitoring of biogas production was facilitated by a volumetric gas flow meter 9 ml flow cell μflow bioprocess control initially between days 0 and 76 the effluent was collected through a vertical pipeline allowing for the accumulation of granular biomass to promote the removal of granular biomass and maintain only suspended biomass the position of the effluent line was later shifted and placed at the bottom of the reactor fig s1 2 2 substrate feeding regime glucose was the only carbon source utilized throughout the study to determine the limits of the substrate conversion capacity the feed glucose concentration was gradually increased until inhibition by undissociated acids was observed the feed glucose concentration ranging from 3 9 to 33 8 gcod lfeed 1 corresponded to various operating periods periods i xiv as specified in table 1 the organic loading rates olr s employed varied from 4 5 to 43 9 gcod l 1 d 1 to prevent glucose consumption the collapsible silicone feeding bags were consistently kept refrigerated cleaning of the feeding bag was conducted at least once a week to prevent the accumulation of microbial growth on the surface of the bag 2 3 analytical methods the quantification of glucose organic acids and ethanol was conducted using high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a thermo fischer science ultimate 3000 series instrument the hplc system was equipped with a 4 channel multiwavelength ultraviolet visible detector and a refractive index ri detector organic acids were quantified at a wavelength of 210 nm the ri detector which determines ethanol and glucose was set to a temperature of 35 c separation was achieved using an aminex hpx 87h column bio rad laboratories life science group with an eluent flow rate of 0 6 ml min 1 5 mm h2so4 and a column compartment temperature of 60 c the quantification of total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss was performed following standard methods 17 the methane content in the produced gas was analyzed using a shimadzu gc 2014 equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column agilent19095p s25pt 50 m 0 535 mm 15 μm the injector and detector temperatures were kept at 200 c and 250 c respectively helium was used as the carrier gas 2 4 data analysis cod balances were established by comparing the glucose concentration consumed in the feed with the concentrations of fermentation products measured in the outlet as determined through hplc analysis additionally the cod content of newly formed biomass was also considered in the balance calculation to estimate the cod as biomass the measured vss concentrations were utilized assuming a cod to biomass ratio of 1 36 gcod gvss 1 18 the difference in cod between the influent and the sum of the identified components in the outlet stream was considered as unidentified products the concentrations of dissociated a and undissociated ha organic acids were estimated based on the operating ph and their pkas adjusted for the operating temperature as detailed in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion the mcf was run for 310 days with a constant feed flow rate of 1 81 0 09 l 1 d 1 which corresponds to an hrt of 20 0 1 1 h the concentration of glucose in the feed was gradually increased from 3 9 to 33 8 gcod lfeed 1 fig 2 until inhibition caused by undissociated acids was observed throughout the different experimental periods the errors in the chemical oxygen demand cod balances were below 6 5 fig 3 and table 2 except for period xiii where the error reached 10 3 this suggests that the major fermentation products were effectively identified although h2 measurement was not possible in this study even if assumed that all the gas produced during the entire study 1 01 0 84 l d 1 was made up of 100 h2 it would only account for a maximum of 3 3 of the total cod consumed the relatively small amount of hydrogen h2 produced can be attributed to the presence of acetogenic activity in the suspended biomass furthermore it is important to mention that throughout the entire operating period no methane ch4 production was detected in the mcf 3 1 granular biomass accumulation at high product concentration glucose was not detected in the mcf with suspended biomass at feed glucose concentrations between 4 and 16 3 gcod lfeed 1 periods i iii at 24 8 gcod lfeed 1 period iv glucose was also fully converted in the system with 31 3 2 0 mm of undissociated acids however this period was different from the previous ones as granular biomass was observed to have accumulated in the fermenter the biomass concentration inside the fermenter reached up to 10 gvss l 1 compared to values in the effluent stream never exceeding 4 gvss l 1 fig 2 the two main factors that seem to contribute to this microbial aggregation are the high product concentrations and the hydrodynamic conditions applied in a previous study under similar reactor configuration and conditions hrt 20 h 30 c ph 5 4 the formation of granular biomass inside the fermenter was also observed using high feed glucose concentrations 23 to eliminate any physical protection by granules and determine the undissociated acids concentration that inhibits glucose conversion with only suspended biomass a modification to the fermenter setup was made in the present study on day 76 the vertically positioned effluent tube connected to the effluent pump had originally acted as an in situ settler the effluent line was connected to the bottom of the reactor to promote the complete washout of granular biomass and avoid its build up indeed after the shift the biomass concentration inside the fermenter began to decrease significantly as shown in fig 2 and from day 82 onwards the concentration of biomass in the effluent stream and inside the fermenter was almost the same indicating a successful strategy to avoid granular biomass accumulation inside the system 3 2 concentration limits of undissociated acids inhibiting glucose conversion for the first time on day 84 lactate began to build up in the fermenter alongside the granular biomass washout which could be a sign of saturation in mcf s fermentation capacity as previously reported rafay et al 11 the build up of lactate observed later during the stable operations periods with suspended biomass only can be attributed to resource allocation due to saturation of coa dependent pathways or other proteins 19 as a result glucose can still be fermented via glycolysis and a shorter coa independent fermentation pathway towards lactate this allows the cell to still obtain the energy from glycolysis with only a partial loss of energy efficiency 20 21 this hypothesis of coa resource allocation was consistent with a simple analysis of fluxes in terms of coa products during the suspended biomass operation periods lactate production raises only when a threshold of circa 5 2 mol gvss 1 h 1 of coa dependent products was reached this direct association of coa products and their use of coa resources has limitations in that the pathway length and use of coa is not equal for all coa products but it provides some basis furthermore a few days later a high accumulation of glucose was observed fig 2 implying that the tolerance of the suspended biomass to undissociated acids had been exceeded apparently this inhibition could be attributed to the absence of granular biomass that previously protected the microbes from the high concentration of undissociated acids encountered between days 23 and 82 31 3 2 0 mm fig 2 thus the concentration limit for undissociated acids inhibiting the carbohydrate conversion in this study appears to be found between 19 8 period iii and 31 3 mm period iv for suspended biomass corresponding to glucose concentration between 16 3 and 24 8 gcod lfeed 1 respectively once high glucose concentrations were measured inside the fermenter the feed concentration was drastically reduced from 24 8 to 3 8 gcod lfeed 1 as a strategy to quickly recover the fermentation capacity later to provide a more accurate threshold inhibition value the feed glucose concentration was raised again but with a smaller increment this time following the complete consumption of 16 7 gcod lfeed 1 period viii the feed glucose concentration was subsequently raised to 22 8 g cod lfeed 1 period ix at the beginning of this period ix glucose was completely consumed but prolonged accumulation of lactate was detected and eventually from day 177 an important biomass washout and accumulation of glucose in the mcf was observed with a concentration of undissociated acids of 28 5 1 9 mm this value represents the average undissociated acids concentration observed in the fermenter between days 155 and 176 fig 2 the accumulation of glucose can be attributed to the fact that when the concentration of undissociated acids reaches the limit of inhibition the suspended biomass is lost and washed out this is primarily attributed to elevated maintenance requirements to maintain the intracellular ph close to neutral values consequently there is a decrease in glucose conversion and therefore in the production of organic acids between periods vi viii with full glucose consumption the biomass yields remained always higher than 19 codbiomass codglucose table 2 however at the beginning of period ix days 155 and 176 the biomass yields fell to 13 8 1 9 this is attributed to an increased maintenance as the modest changes in the product spectrum alone cannot cause the large yield decrease at the end of period ix days 177 187 the glucose accumulation reached 10 6 2 3 gcod lfeed 1 and the concentrations of products and undissociated acids stayed much lower 13 4 mm compared to the beginning of the period 28 5 1 9 mm under these milder conditions the biomass yield recovered back to 18 9 2 7 cod in support with the maintenance hypothesis together with some additional adaptations such as changes in product spectrum with significant ethanol production although the system was previously able to work at these levels of acids period viii the glucose conversion was not immediately recovered a proposed explanation is the loss of biomass due to the preceding high maintenance and washout conditions as well as the time needed for biomass to regrow and recover however this may not provide a complete explanation and other biomass adaptation mechanisms such as a change back to the previous product spectrum could also be at play in order to fully recover the fermentation capacity of the system the feed glucose concentration was decreased maintaining the high glucose feed concentration may have led to an eventual recovery of the microbial activity nevertheless this would involve a very different operational condition without substrate limitation favoring different types of organisms with lower substrate affinity and higher maximum growth rates this could be a condition of scientific interest but of less relevance for process development with large amounts of unconverted glucose in the effluent influent glucose was decreased to remove the excess glucose but this time to 15 7 rather than the 4 gcod lfeed 1 previously applied this decrease was less pronounced to evaluate whether the glucose conversion capacity could be recovered quicker and indeed full glucose conversion was immediately observed at the beginning of period x in the subsequent period xi with 18 5 gcod lfeed 1 and 24 9 1 7 mm of undissociated acids average value for period xi full glucose conversion was also achieved however a prolonged lactate accumulation and a one time glucose presence in the fermenter measured on day 245 suggested that the mcf was again close to being inhibited in fact the system collapsed during the following period xiia specifically at 21 gcod lfeed 1 with a concentration of undissociated acids of 28 mm although the specific mechanisms involving differences in chain length and properties between the different organic acids as well as the inhibition by ph alone do possibly play a role the total concentration of undissociated acids appear to be the major descriptor of the system inhibition 3 3 ph control to extend the carbohydrate conversion the inhibition was quickly reversed by raising the ph in the fermenter from 5 4 to 6 day 145 such ph shift drastically reduced the concentration of undissociated forms of the acids ha in the fermentation broth and increases their dissociated form a fig 2 at a ph of 6 up to 34 gcod lfeed 1 was processed without any buildup of the substrate these results indicate that controlling the ph could be critical in ensuring the full conversion of carbohydrates in mixed culture fermenters that have high levels of undissociated acids butyrate and acetate were the main fermentation products obtained throughout the present study fig 3 this suggests that the concentration of the substrate and hence the concentration of undissociated acids did not significantly impact the products obtained except for lactate when the capacity for glucose conversion is nearing saturation the same products remained dominant even when the ph increased to 6 the products achieved in this study were different compared to those previously achieved by rafay et al 11 valerate and propionate using the same glucose feeding concentration around 34 gcod lfeed 1 fig 3 in both studies similar operating conditions were applied 20 h hrt 30 c however the previous study had a lower operating ph of 5 4 much higher concentration of undissociated acids 52 mm and presence of granules in similar chemostat studies with a ph ranging between 5 and 5 5 and using glucose as the only organic substrate 4 3 16 gcod lfeed 1 butyrate and acetate were also the main products 22 25 in one of the studies 23 the impact of increasing glucose feed concentration 4 26 gcod lfeed 1 on the product spectrum was also evaluated but at a higher ph of 8 in contrast to this study a notable change in the range of products was observed at different feed glucose concentrations butyrate and acetate were mainly produced with 4 gcod lfeed 1 while acetate and ethanol were mainly produced at a higher concentration of 26 gcod lfeed 1 the higher operating ph used in that study 23 prevented the excessive accumulation of undissociated acids and likely permitted the complete conversion of 26 gcod lfeed 1 of glucose in another study 26 using a continuous stirred tank hrt 8 h 37 c with biomass retention evaluating the impact of increasing glucose concentrations 2 1 68 2 gcod lfeed 1 on the mcf capacity the increasing glucose feed concentration did not significantly affect the product spectra butyrate and acetate were also the main products across the entire experimental range full glucose conversions were achieved with 17 gcod lfeed 1 and high conversion efficiencies of 94 8 were attained with 34 1 gcod lfeed 1 glucose conversion capacity of 56 1 and 40 5 for 51 2 and 68 2 gcod lfeed 1 were observed in 26 respectively which corresponds to maximum glucose removal capacities of circa 29 35 gcod lfeed 1 these values however cannot be compared to those in our study 18 25 gcod lfeed 1 in 26 ph was reported only as a within a broad range 5 5 6 5 and the concentration of undissociated acids could not be therefore calculated the use of biomass retention in 26 led to the very high biomass concentration reached 15 7 gvss l 1 with washed out organisms kept in the system finally the operation under non limiting substrate conditions favours different groups of fast growing organisms versus high yield and high affinity organisms and leaves an effluent with large amounts of unconverted substrate keeping slow growing organisms in the system as in 26 can be achieved also by operating at higher hrts this could or not lead to the eventual emergence of more resistant organisms however the high hrt would bring the process away from economic feasibility the economic viability of producing high value mcf products depends on the ability to achieve high product concentrations it is essential to operate under complete substrate conversion to promote the formation of higher value products that are associated with longer pathways and higher biomass yields in the context of mcf where biomass retention systems like membranes or sedimentation and recycle are employed instead of granules understanding the limits of product inhibition for suspended biomass as explored in this study becomes particularly significant 4 conclusions the operation results of a continuous glucose fermentation system in the presence of only suspended biomass and under the specific conditions ph 5 4 hrt 20 h 30 c indicate that the glucose conversion capacity of the mcf is significantly hindered at concentrations of undissociated acids above 24 9 mm this observation was consistent throughout the study at different feed glucose concentrations the inhibition limits observed are attributed to a large extent to the significant maintenance energy costs required to maintain the intracellular ph homeostasis in the presence of acids leading to decreased biomass yields and biomass loss to improve conversions at high glucose concentrations the formation of granular biomass and ph control of undissociated acids concentration appear as key strategies additional experimental study is needed

12456,using high substrate concentrations in mixed culture fermentation increases the products concentration achieved making more cost effective and sustainable its subsequent extraction however elevated levels of organic acids also result in inhibition by undissociated acids this study investigates the concentration limits of undissociated acids that inhibit a lab scale mixed culture carbohydrate fermenter operated under constant conditions ph 5 4 hrt 20 h 30 c under these conditions the conversion capacity was consistently inhibited at undissociated acids concentrations above 24 9 mm and substrate concentrations over 18 5 gcod lfeed 1 this is attributed to the high maintenance costs incurred to maintain cell homeostasis at neutral intracellular ph in the presence of acids this inhibition leads to lower yields and net biomass loss from the system resulting in incomplete glucose conversion operating at a higher ph of 6 and utilizing granules proved to be effective

recovery substrate concentration undissociated acids data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction open mixed culture fermentation mcf is regarded as a promising resource recovery process for obtaining valuable chemicals from biowastes such as food waste sewage sludge manure dairy wastewater lignocellulosic biomass and agricultural residues among others 1 2 in mcf organic substrates are converted into a mixture of co2 h2 solvents and organic acids 3 the organic acids produced could find use in a wide variety of industrial applications including biological nitrogen removal in sewage treatment chain elongation processes biofuel production and biodegradable polymer synthesis as well as in the pharmaceutical food textile and plastics industries among others 4 8 to improve the cost effectiveness and efficiency of downstream recovery and purification processes for organic acids it is advantageous to attain high concentrations of the product therefore the use of highly concentrated organic waste streams is preferred 1 at the same time high levels of organic acids can also cause inhibition which is currently a major limitation in using mcf systems at an industrial scale 9 hence determining the limits of substrate concentrations that can be fully converted to safely maximize product yield is crucial the suspected mechanism for inhibition by organic acids appears to be caused mainly by their undissociated form undissociated acids can freely permeate the cell membrane and dissociate intracellularly at the higher cytosolic ph which is maintained close to neutral this intake of protons lowers the cytosolic ph increasing the maintenance energy required by the cell to create the transmembrane proton gradient to generate atp 10 most research on the inhibition of mcf systems by organic acids has relied on batch assays however to fully understand the mechanism behind this process investigations conducted under continuous mode are required the consistent environment of reactors operated continuously offers a more precise understanding of microbial kinetics compared to batch tests batch tests due to the transient conditions do not reflect accurately the continuous processes as they will be implemented at large scale to convert in addition continuous systems provide information on the long term impact of higher substrate concentrations on the product spectra in a previous study our aim was to determine the concentration limits of undissociated acids that inhibit open mixed culture carbohydrate fermentation in a lab scale fermenter 1 5 l operated in continuous mode 11 to achieve this the substrate concentration was incrementally raised until the point of inhibition by undissociated acids concentration is identified in that research the glucose fermentation capacity was found to be limited at 33 gcod lfeed 1 with 32 mm of undissociated acids however the accumulation of granular biomass significantly enhanced the substrate fermentation capacity enabling full glucose conversions even at undissociated acid concentrations of up to 52 mm which is equivalent to 38 gcod lfeed 1 upper tolerance limits for undissociated acids concentration have not been assessed it is worth noting that granular biomass exhibits lower sensitivity to variations in environmental factors such as ph temperature substrate composition and toxicity when compared to suspended biomass 12 granules create protective internal micro environments that allow normal metabolic processes to continue even in bulk environments with high acidity or toxicity in line with our previous study the objective of the current study is also to investigate the concentration limits of carbohydrate conversion in a lab scale mcf operated in continuous mode and under constant operating conditions ph 5 4 hrt 20 h 30 c but this time with presence of solely suspended biomass to prevent the accumulation of the protective granular biomass modifications have been implemented to the fermenter setup additionally the effectiveness of ph adjustment as a strategy to mitigate the inhibition caused by undissociated acids is also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and operation in this experiment a lab scale continuously stirred tank reactor fermac 360 electrolab was employed fig 1 the reactor had a working volume of 1 5 l and a headspace volume of 0 5 l throughout the study the operating parameters were maintained constant which included a temperature of 30 c ph of 5 4 and hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 h in mcf studies it is a common practice to set the temperature at 30 c as it facilitates effective substrate conversion 13 14 from an economic perspective opting for lower ph values in mcf proves more cost effective due to the reduced need for base additions moreover maintaining a ph below 6 inhibits the growth of methanogenic archaea 15 the selected hrt in this experiment was sufficient to support biomass growth and ensure complete glucose conversion simultaneously the hrt was set to a short duration to prevent the growth of methanogenic archaea and avoid prolonged generation times which would require a longer experimental period in this study the inoculum utilized was obtained from the effluent of a previous mcf research conducted by allegue et al 16 that fermenter was operated using the same experimental conditions hrt ph and temperature and substrate glucose as in this research the nutrients macro and micro composition in feed table s1 was similar to the one proposed by temudo et al 14 however due to the difficulties in dissolving edta its concentration was reduced by 25 fold as suggested by rafay et al 11 the control and monitoring of ph levels in the system involved the utilization of a fermac 360 controller along with a ph probe hamilton easyferm plus phi k8 225 a peristaltic pump was employed to introduce the base solution with a concentration ranging between 2 and 7 m of naoh the system was mechanically stirred at 200 rpm to ensure a permanent homogeneous mixture the synthetic feeding was added semi continuously using a peristaltic pump 0 100 rpm l s pump masterflex the feeding sequence followed a pattern of 0 5 min on and 3 min off with a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 the effluent pump was controlled by using a level probe monitoring of biogas production was facilitated by a volumetric gas flow meter 9 ml flow cell μflow bioprocess control initially between days 0 and 76 the effluent was collected through a vertical pipeline allowing for the accumulation of granular biomass to promote the removal of granular biomass and maintain only suspended biomass the position of the effluent line was later shifted and placed at the bottom of the reactor fig s1 2 2 substrate feeding regime glucose was the only carbon source utilized throughout the study to determine the limits of the substrate conversion capacity the feed glucose concentration was gradually increased until inhibition by undissociated acids was observed the feed glucose concentration ranging from 3 9 to 33 8 gcod lfeed 1 corresponded to various operating periods periods i xiv as specified in table 1 the organic loading rates olr s employed varied from 4 5 to 43 9 gcod l 1 d 1 to prevent glucose consumption the collapsible silicone feeding bags were consistently kept refrigerated cleaning of the feeding bag was conducted at least once a week to prevent the accumulation of microbial growth on the surface of the bag 2 3 analytical methods the quantification of glucose organic acids and ethanol was conducted using high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a thermo fischer science ultimate 3000 series instrument the hplc system was equipped with a 4 channel multiwavelength ultraviolet visible detector and a refractive index ri detector organic acids were quantified at a wavelength of 210 nm the ri detector which determines ethanol and glucose was set to a temperature of 35 c separation was achieved using an aminex hpx 87h column bio rad laboratories life science group with an eluent flow rate of 0 6 ml min 1 5 mm h2so4 and a column compartment temperature of 60 c the quantification of total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss was performed following standard methods 17 the methane content in the produced gas was analyzed using a shimadzu gc 2014 equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column agilent19095p s25pt 50 m 0 535 mm 15 μm the injector and detector temperatures were kept at 200 c and 250 c respectively helium was used as the carrier gas 2 4 data analysis cod balances were established by comparing the glucose concentration consumed in the feed with the concentrations of fermentation products measured in the outlet as determined through hplc analysis additionally the cod content of newly formed biomass was also considered in the balance calculation to estimate the cod as biomass the measured vss concentrations were utilized assuming a cod to biomass ratio of 1 36 gcod gvss 1 18 the difference in cod between the influent and the sum of the identified components in the outlet stream was considered as unidentified products the concentrations of dissociated a and undissociated ha organic acids were estimated based on the operating ph and their pkas adjusted for the operating temperature as detailed in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion the mcf was run for 310 days with a constant feed flow rate of 1 81 0 09 l 1 d 1 which corresponds to an hrt of 20 0 1 1 h the concentration of glucose in the feed was gradually increased from 3 9 to 33 8 gcod lfeed 1 fig 2 until inhibition caused by undissociated acids was observed throughout the different experimental periods the errors in the chemical oxygen demand cod balances were below 6 5 fig 3 and table 2 except for period xiii where the error reached 10 3 this suggests that the major fermentation products were effectively identified although h2 measurement was not possible in this study even if assumed that all the gas produced during the entire study 1 01 0 84 l d 1 was made up of 100 h2 it would only account for a maximum of 3 3 of the total cod consumed the relatively small amount of hydrogen h2 produced can be attributed to the presence of acetogenic activity in the suspended biomass furthermore it is important to mention that throughout the entire operating period no methane ch4 production was detected in the mcf 3 1 granular biomass accumulation at high product concentration glucose was not detected in the mcf with suspended biomass at feed glucose concentrations between 4 and 16 3 gcod lfeed 1 periods i iii at 24 8 gcod lfeed 1 period iv glucose was also fully converted in the system with 31 3 2 0 mm of undissociated acids however this period was different from the previous ones as granular biomass was observed to have accumulated in the fermenter the biomass concentration inside the fermenter reached up to 10 gvss l 1 compared to values in the effluent stream never exceeding 4 gvss l 1 fig 2 the two main factors that seem to contribute to this microbial aggregation are the high product concentrations and the hydrodynamic conditions applied in a previous study under similar reactor configuration and conditions hrt 20 h 30 c ph 5 4 the formation of granular biomass inside the fermenter was also observed using high feed glucose concentrations 23 to eliminate any physical protection by granules and determine the undissociated acids concentration that inhibits glucose conversion with only suspended biomass a modification to the fermenter setup was made in the present study on day 76 the vertically positioned effluent tube connected to the effluent pump had originally acted as an in situ settler the effluent line was connected to the bottom of the reactor to promote the complete washout of granular biomass and avoid its build up indeed after the shift the biomass concentration inside the fermenter began to decrease significantly as shown in fig 2 and from day 82 onwards the concentration of biomass in the effluent stream and inside the fermenter was almost the same indicating a successful strategy to avoid granular biomass accumulation inside the system 3 2 concentration limits of undissociated acids inhibiting glucose conversion for the first time on day 84 lactate began to build up in the fermenter alongside the granular biomass washout which could be a sign of saturation in mcf s fermentation capacity as previously reported rafay et al 11 the build up of lactate observed later during the stable operations periods with suspended biomass only can be attributed to resource allocation due to saturation of coa dependent pathways or other proteins 19 as a result glucose can still be fermented via glycolysis and a shorter coa independent fermentation pathway towards lactate this allows the cell to still obtain the energy from glycolysis with only a partial loss of energy efficiency 20 21 this hypothesis of coa resource allocation was consistent with a simple analysis of fluxes in terms of coa products during the suspended biomass operation periods lactate production raises only when a threshold of circa 5 2 mol gvss 1 h 1 of coa dependent products was reached this direct association of coa products and their use of coa resources has limitations in that the pathway length and use of coa is not equal for all coa products but it provides some basis furthermore a few days later a high accumulation of glucose was observed fig 2 implying that the tolerance of the suspended biomass to undissociated acids had been exceeded apparently this inhibition could be attributed to the absence of granular biomass that previously protected the microbes from the high concentration of undissociated acids encountered between days 23 and 82 31 3 2 0 mm fig 2 thus the concentration limit for undissociated acids inhibiting the carbohydrate conversion in this study appears to be found between 19 8 period iii and 31 3 mm period iv for suspended biomass corresponding to glucose concentration between 16 3 and 24 8 gcod lfeed 1 respectively once high glucose concentrations were measured inside the fermenter the feed concentration was drastically reduced from 24 8 to 3 8 gcod lfeed 1 as a strategy to quickly recover the fermentation capacity later to provide a more accurate threshold inhibition value the feed glucose concentration was raised again but with a smaller increment this time following the complete consumption of 16 7 gcod lfeed 1 period viii the feed glucose concentration was subsequently raised to 22 8 g cod lfeed 1 period ix at the beginning of this period ix glucose was completely consumed but prolonged accumulation of lactate was detected and eventually from day 177 an important biomass washout and accumulation of glucose in the mcf was observed with a concentration of undissociated acids of 28 5 1 9 mm this value represents the average undissociated acids concentration observed in the fermenter between days 155 and 176 fig 2 the accumulation of glucose can be attributed to the fact that when the concentration of undissociated acids reaches the limit of inhibition the suspended biomass is lost and washed out this is primarily attributed to elevated maintenance requirements to maintain the intracellular ph close to neutral values consequently there is a decrease in glucose conversion and therefore in the production of organic acids between periods vi viii with full glucose consumption the biomass yields remained always higher than 19 codbiomass codglucose table 2 however at the beginning of period ix days 155 and 176 the biomass yields fell to 13 8 1 9 this is attributed to an increased maintenance as the modest changes in the product spectrum alone cannot cause the large yield decrease at the end of period ix days 177 187 the glucose accumulation reached 10 6 2 3 gcod lfeed 1 and the concentrations of products and undissociated acids stayed much lower 13 4 mm compared to the beginning of the period 28 5 1 9 mm under these milder conditions the biomass yield recovered back to 18 9 2 7 cod in support with the maintenance hypothesis together with some additional adaptations such as changes in product spectrum with significant ethanol production although the system was previously able to work at these levels of acids period viii the glucose conversion was not immediately recovered a proposed explanation is the loss of biomass due to the preceding high maintenance and washout conditions as well as the time needed for biomass to regrow and recover however this may not provide a complete explanation and other biomass adaptation mechanisms such as a change back to the previous product spectrum could also be at play in order to fully recover the fermentation capacity of the system the feed glucose concentration was decreased maintaining the high glucose feed concentration may have led to an eventual recovery of the microbial activity nevertheless this would involve a very different operational

prolonged lactate accumulation and a one time glucose presence in the fermenter measured on day 245 suggested that the mcf was again close to being inhibited in fact the system collapsed during the following period xiia specifically at 21 gcod lfeed 1 with a concentration of undissociated acids of 28 mm although the specific mechanisms involving differences in chain length and properties between the different organic acids as well as the inhibition by ph alone do possibly play a role the total concentration of undissociated acids appear to be the major descriptor of the system inhibition 3 3 ph control to extend the carbohydrate conversion the inhibition was quickly reversed by raising the ph in the fermenter from 5 4 to 6 day 145 such ph shift drastically reduced the concentration of undissociated forms of the acids ha in the fermentation broth and increases their dissociated form a fig 2 at a ph of 6 up to 34 gcod lfeed 1 was processed without any buildup of the substrate these

in one of the studies 23 the impact of increasing glucose feed concentration 4 26 gcod lfeed 1 on the product spectrum was also evaluated but at a higher ph of 8 in contrast to this study a notable change in the range of products was observed at different feed glucose concentrations butyrate and acetate were mainly produced with 4 gcod lfeed 1 while acetate and ethanol were mainly produced at a higher concentration of 26 gcod lfeed 1 the higher operating ph used in that study 23 prevented the excessive accumulation of undissociated acids and likely permitted the complete conversion of 26 gcod lfeed 1 of glucose in another study 26 using a continuous stirred tank hrt 8 h 37 c with biomass retention evaluating the impact of increasing glucose concentrations 2 1 68 2 gcod lfeed 1 on the mcf capacity the increasing glucose feed concentration did not significantly affect the product spectra butyrate and acetate were also the main products across the entire experimental range full glucose conversions were achieved with 17 gcod lfeed 1 and high conversion efficiencies of 94 8 were attained with 34 1 gcod lfeed 1 glucose conversion capacity of 56 1 and 40 5 for 51 2 and 68 2 gcod lfeed 1 were observed in 26 respectively which corresponds to maximum glucose removal capacities of circa 29 35 gcod lfeed 1 these values however cannot be compared to those in our study 18 25 gcod lfeed 1 in 26 ph was reported only as a within a broad range 5 5 6 5 and the concentration of undissociated acids could not be therefore calculated the use of biomass retention in 26 led to the very high biomass concentration reached 15 7 gvss l 1 with washed out organisms kept in the system finally the operation under non limiting substrate conditions favours different groups of fast growing organisms versus high yield and high affinity organisms and leaves an effluent with large amounts of unconverted substrate keeping slow growing organisms in the system as in 26 can be achieved also by operating at higher hrts this could or not lead to the eventual emergence of more resistant organisms however the high hrt would bring the process away from economic feasibility the economic viability

fermentation system in the presence of only suspended biomass and under the specific conditions ph 5 4 hrt 20 h 30 c indicate that the glucose conversion capacity of the mcf is significantly hindered at concentrations of undissociated acids above 24 9 mm this observation was consistent throughout the study at different feed glucose concentrations the inhibition limits observed are attributed to a large extent to the significant maintenance energy costs required to maintain the intracellular ph homeostasis in the presence of acids leading to decreased biomass yields and biomass loss to improve conversions at high glucose concentrations the formation of granular biomass and ph control of undissociated acids concentration appear as key strategies additional experimental study is needed

12457,sulfide precipitation is an efficient method for separation however its application is limited due to the significant h2s pollution caused by conventional reagents the utilization of amorphous fes lead to a substantial reduction in h2s escape while concurrently enhancing the crystallization and settling characteristics of as precipitates under the conditions of an initial arsenic and h2so4 concentration in the solution of 2 g l and 50 g l respectively and a fes dosage of 1 5 times the molar amount of s as the arsenic removal exhibited a significant decrease from 89 8 to 40 8 over a fes aging period of 0 to 84 days notably no h2s emissions were detected during the entire reaction process xrd analysis revealed a transformation of fes from its amorphous form to a crystalline state as it undergoes aging this transition is primarily characterized by a reduction in interlayer spacing and fes bond length within the fes lattice the lattice energy experienced a decrease from 3071 to 3688 kj mol indicating the progressive stabilization of the fes structure ftir and tg dsc analyses have demonstrated the infiltration of water molecules into both the interlamellar spaces and the lattice of fes during the process of crystallization additionally as3 ions were observed to initially adsorb onto the surface of aged fes through the hydroxyl group followed by their diffusion into the lattice the products of arsenic removal undergone a transformation from as2s3 to predominantly feass like complexes as the mechanism of arsenic removal shifted from precipitate transformation to adsorption and co precipitation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords amorphous fes arsenic removal slow release sulfide precipitation structure transformation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic is a highly toxic element that poses significant health risks to humans it has been classified as a class 1 carcinogen by the world health organization 1 arsenic in nature mainly comes from minerals such as arsenopyrite feass realgar ass orpiment as2s3 and pyrite which are associated with valuable metallic minerals 2 most arsenic volatilizes and oxidizes into flue gas rich in as2o3 as2o5 during the smelting of arsenic associated non ferrous minerals that contain significant amounts of sulfur oxides sox heavy metals and dust 3 the highly acidic wastewater produced by the metallurgical industry contains high concentrations of arsenic range from 0 5 to 30 g l and h2so4 range from 10 to 200 g l which are produced by the flue gas washing of raw ore during fluidized bed roasting 4 sulfide precipitation is widely used for metal removal due to several advantages these include the low solubility of metal sulfide precipitates the potential for selective metal removal rapid reaction rates high product grades and the possibility of sulfide precipitation reuse through smelting processes 5 7 however the commonly utilized reagents in the industry such as ammonium sulfide nh4 2s sodium sulfide na2s and sodium hydrosulfide nahs exhibit a rapid release of h2s under strongly acidic conditions through a spontaneous hydrolysis process 4 8 these aqueous type agents usually need to be added in excess resulting in more severe h2s pollution hence the hard in overcoming the obstacles when using na2s lies in how we control or slow down the s2 release rate of sulfurizing reagent currently the approaches for modifying the release rate of s2 can be roughly divided into two categories one approach involves utilizing macromolecules or polymers to encapsulate readily soluble sulfides drawing inspiration from the concept of synthesizing medical capsules 9 10 the other is to use insoluble sulfide directly to slow its dissolution in a strongly acidic solution 11 12 zhu et al pioneered s2 sustained release using organo silicon complex to encapsulate calcium sulfide to obtain an excellent sustained release material and achieved superb separation efficiency 4 however the complex synthesis steps and the high cost of raw materials may pose significant obstacles that restrict its industrial application in contrast using insoluble sulfides an alternative approach seems more economically feasible and achievable due to the slight solubility of metal sulfides and the minimal formation of h2s overfeeding can occur without significant odor problems it is well known that the difficulty of sulfide formation is closely related to their solubility product value ksp 13 the higher the solubility product constant the more soluble the compound and it can theoretically convert into compounds with lower solubility product values therefore iron sulfides fes which have a relatively high solubility product ksp 1 59 10 19 are excellent materials for slow release of s2 the affinity of iron based materials to arsenic has attracted extensive attention 14 15 and fes has been widely used in various wastewater treatments due to its large solubility product and exceptional electrochemical performance including adsorption of heavy metals catalytic degradation of organic matter and other research fields 16 19 however all the aforementioned studies have been conducted based on the excellent surface properties of fes and few researchers have investigated its slow release behavior for removing heavy metals arsenic in high acid wastewater the solid fes has been used for heavy metal removal however the dosage of fes was more than twice the theoretical value required for heavy metal removal which would significantly decrease the grade and increase the volume of precipitate products 11 a smelting company in china has long used nickel sulfide concentrate as the cu removal reagent and faced the same problem 13 this suggested that in addition to the influence of solubility product the solubility or the structures of sulfide material itself also plays an essential role in the sustained release process 20 it should be noted that sulfide precipitate transformation rates only correspond to the value of solubility products for fresh amorphous metal sulfides 21 previous studies on fes have mainly focused on arsenic adsorption and transformation behavior on its surface in low concentration moderately acidic wastewater 22 and few researchers have systematically studied in wastewater containing high arsenic and strong acid furthermore it is unclear how fes with different structures contribute to the arsenic removal process and it is essential to establish a correlation between the structural evolution of fes and its arsenic removal performance to explain its underlying transformation mechanism this can establish the foundation for developing fes variants that are suitable for use under strong acidic conditions thereby reducing the amount of h2s released during the reaction process in this paper the amorphous fes was prepared to investigate the effects of factors such as acidity temperature and reaction time on the removal of high arsenic concentrations by fes in highly acidic solutions furthermore a comparative analysis was performed to assess the arsenic removal efficiency the release of h2s during the arsenic removal process and the filtration performance of the product when employing fes and na2s as the respective agents subsequently the structural changes of fes were investigated by extending the aging time and the influence of these changes on the arsenic removal efficiency was explored thereby establishing a structure performance relationship between the them finally the binding mode and reaction mechanism of fes and arsenic with different aging time were proposed this study explored the feasibility of removing arsenic from high activity insoluble sulfide in strong acidic wastewater and explained the influence of structural evolution on its activity it lays a theoretical foundation for the development of new sulfide agents and potentially overcomes the limitations of traditional sulfide reagents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials iron sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o and sodium sulfide nonahydrate na2s 9h2o were utilized as iron and sulfur sources respectively for the synthesis of amorphous fes these chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china sodium arsenite naaso2 and sulfuric acid 98 h2so4 were used to prepare an arsenic containing simulated solution for treatment and were obtained from fengyu chemical glass instrument co ltd changsha china the chemical composition of the copper smelting wastewater is shown in table s1 all reagents were of analytical grade and all solutions were prepared using deionized water 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 synthesized and aged procedures of amorphous fes the synthesis of fes was conducted in an anaerobic three neck flask using a chemical precipitation synthesis method to summarize a fes suspension was obtained by mixing 0 1 l of 1 mol l 1 s ii solution with 0 1 l of 1 2 mol l 1 fe ii solution an excess amount of fe ii was added to ensure sufficient reaction with s ii the entire synthesis process was carried out under n2 stream and the synthesis time was controlled to be within 10 min specifically the na2s solution was slowly added to the feso4 solution with vigorous stirring resulting in a dense amorphous fes suspension the synthesis process can be described in eq 1 in the comparative test the preparation of na2s solution followed the same procedure as described above the only difference was that the feso4 solution was replaced with an equal volume of deionized water this ensured that the s concentration in both sulfide solutions was maintained at 0 5 mol l 1 after the synthesis experiment the fes suspension was transferred to 250 ml glass bottles for static aging the aging environment was kept cool and dark with an indoor temperature of 25 c and the aging time was controlled as 0 1 3 7 30 and 84 days respectively the samples were labeled as fes 0 to fes 84 the solid fes samples used for characterization were obtained by vacuum freeze drying of the underlying precipitates which were gained by centrifuging the suspension at 8000 rpm for 10 min the wet fes suspension has higher antioxidant properties and is easier to disperse in solution compared to dry powders therefore the fes suspension was used in the following arsenic removal experiments 1 na 2 s feso 4 fes na 2 so 4 2 2 2 batch test of arsenic removal with amorphous fes the arsenic concentration in the arsenic containing as iii simulation solution was fixed at 2 g l to prepare the solution 3 44 g sodium arsenite naaso2 was dissolved in 500 ml of deionized water and then transferred to a 1 l volumetric flask after stirring evenly the simulated solution with an arsenic content of 2 g l was obtained the sulfuric acid 98 h2so4 was added as needed to control the acidity level of the simulated solution based on a sulfide solution concentration of 0 5 mol l the necessary volume of sulfide 8 1 ml was calculated according to a s as molar ratio of 1 5 the pipette gun was used to add the corresponding volume of fes suspension and sodium sulfide solution to the simulated solution and wastewater to start the reaction the reaction was performed in a three neck flask with 100 ml solution the flask was placed in a water bath and a mechanical stirrer was inserted into one of the necks while another contained a condenser tube the third neck was connected to an h2s detector to monitor the release of h2s during the reaction the tests were studied at reaction temperatures ranging from 25 to 80 c initial acid concentration from 50 to 200 g l and reaction time from 0 to 60 min the liquid solid mixture was filtered through a 0 2 μm microfiltration membrane upon the reaction completed a pipette took 1 ml of the reaction solution at the desired time during the experiment the filtrates were obtained by passing the sample through 0 2 μm ptfe membranes the solids obtained were freeze dried and further analyzed for phase change and chemical composition using vacuum drying if necessary the elemental concentrations of the filtrate diluted 100 times were determined using icp oes 2 2 3 arsenic removal test by fes at different aging time the 100 ml of arsenic containing simulated solution was transferred into a three neck flask for the reaction the initial acidity of the reaction solution was adjusted to 50 g l the aged fes suspension was uniformly dispersed using magnetic stirring before sampling then the predetermined volume 8 1 ml with a s to as molar ratio of 1 5 of fes suspension with different aging time was withdrawn using a pipette and added to the simulated solution for the reaction the reaction was conducted at a temperature of 25 c for 1 h after the reaction the mixture was filtered and the same procedure described above was followed for analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 characterization method the details are shown in supplementary information text s1 2 3 2 h2s escape measurement h2s escape during the arsenic removal reactions by fes and na2s was monitored by a portable hydrogen sulfide gas detector with a range of 1 100 ppm hd5s edkors china the hydrogen sulfide gas detector utilizes an abe type electrochemical sensor consisting of three electrodes immersed in the electrolyte the gas enters the sensor through the induction film where the electrochemical redox reaction takes place the output current intensity of the sensor is directly proportional to hydrogen sulfide concentration the detection method was built in pump suction measurement with a flow rate of 500 ml min the h2s gas concentration unit was configured to store concentration values as the average over a 2 s storage time with units expressed in parts per million ppm if h2s gas escapes during a chemical reaction a sampling pump directs the gas to the intake of a detector where it is measured by an h2s gas sensor and the concentration value is stored the gas was then expelled through the exhaust port of the detector the stored data of the h2s concentration values can be exported to pocket gas detector 5 0 software for further analysis and can also be plotted for visualization and interpretation 2 3 3 calculation of lattice parameters and energy the change in gibbs free energy δg of the reaction was calculated by hsc chemistry 6 0 the lattice parameters and symmetry of fes samples at different aging time were obtained after smoothing and rietveld fitting of their xrd patterns by mdi jade 6 based on the calculated lattice parameters and symmetry a crystal cell model for fes at different aging time was constructed in materials studio 2020 it should be pointed out that the amorphous fes fes 0 was also modeled in the form of a crystal to calculate its lattice parameters and lattice energy to facilitate comparison the lattice energy ul calculations for fes were calculated by the morphology module 23 the calculation task was set as growth morphology and the energy method was selected as forcite the compass iii force field was employed which is an advanced ab initio force field designed to facilitate atomistic simulations of materials in condensed phases 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermodynamic analysis the variations of arsenic and ferrous species at different ph were investigated by constructing species distribution diagrams using medusa hydra chemical equilibrium software for windows 25 the results are demonstrated in fig 1 precipitate as2s3 is the predominant species in the ph range of 0 10 particularly the solid phase as2s3 accounts for nearly 100 of the arsenic distribution at ph 0 6 2 however the fraction of as2s3 starts to decrease gradually with increasing ph at ph 9 the precipitated as2s3 dissolves significantly and h2aso3 replaces as2s3 as the dominant species at ph values above 10 fig 1 b illustrates that as2s3 is not stable under alkaline conditions when the ph exceeds 10 fes precipitates become the dominant species in the fe component therefore to achieve high arsenic removal in the as fe s h2o system the ph value should be maintained below 6 2 however the above analysis results were based on the assumption that all elements exist in the solution as ions in actual situations the solubility of fes under acidic conditions should be considered the dissolution equilibrium diagram of fes and as2s3 and the eh ph diagram of as fe s h2o are shown in fig s1 the dissolution balance of insoluble sulfide and the dominant area of each species were also further discussed in text s2 3 2 slow release properties of amorphous fes 3 2 1 influential factors on arsenic removal by fes and na2s the effect of solution acidity h2so4 concentration and reaction time on the slow release properties of amorphous fes in arsenic removal were investigated and compared with na2s the results are shown in fig 2 acidity was a primary factor that affects arsenic removal efficiency using fes the arsenic removal efficiency depicted in fig 2 a exhibited a gradual increase from approximately 86 to 93 within the h2so4 concentration range of 10 100 g l when the acidity exceeded 100 and reached 200 g l the arsenic removal efficiency did not continue to increase but slightly decreased interestingly the trends were opposite when na2s was used for arsenic removal under different acidity conditions fig 2 b about 95 of the initial as iii was removed at an h2so4 concentration of 10 g l however as the solution acidity increased the removal efficiency significantly decreased stabilizing at around 90 until the acidity exceeded 100 g l these results indicate that increasing solution acidity in a particular range favors arsenic removal with fes but negatively influences arsenic removal with na2s in an acidic system most of the s2 reacts with arsenic to form precipitates however a portion of the s2 also reacts with h to produce h2s when the concentration of h2s exceeds the saturation limit of the solution it escapes from the system as the acidity of the solution increased 10 50 g l the concentration of h also increased leading to a decrease in the utilization of s2 in na2s and a reduction in arsenic removal efficiency when the h concentration reached a certain level 100 200 g l the arsenic removal efficiency gently declined indicating a relatively stable emission of h2s further increasing the h concentration did not significantly enhance its competition with s2 however in the fes as iii system s2 was fixed through the formation of insoluble fes compounds which avoided the simultaneous distribution of a large amount of s2 in acidic solution and weakened the competitive effect of h in fig 2 a the magnified section within 1 min of the reaction shaded part shows a relatively slow increased in arsenic removal at the low h concentrations 10 g l this indicates that there was a fixation effect of s2 through fes compounds although this effect was weak due to the high reactivity of fes in contrast the arsenic removal efficiency reached equilibrium immediately after adding na2s and did not change anymore fig 2 b comparing fes with na2s fes exhibited a slow release capability of s2 under specific acidity conditions and s2 was less prone to react with h to produce h2s this characteristic improved the utilization efficiency of s2 in fes for arsenic removal furthermore in the acidity range of 10 100 g l the arsenic removal efficiency continued to increase due to the decomposition of fes it was proved from fig 2 c that the arsenic grade in the precipitate product reached to about 40 meanwhile the fe grades steadily decreased throughout the entire acidity range reaching 1 47 this indicates that the increase in acidity facilitated the decomposition of fes however at high acidity levels 200 g l the arsenic removal efficiency was negatively affected the effect of temperature shown in fig 2 d depicted that temperature did not obviously promote the decomposition of fes or enhance the arsenic removal efficiency at this acidity level compared to na2s fes demonstrated superior slow release performance in arsenic removal when used in strongly acidic solutions the amorphous fes has a particular acid and temperature resistance suitable for arsenic removal over a wide acidity range 3 2 2 the comparison of h2s escape and products performance the priority of a reaction can be determined by calculating the change in gibbs free energy of the reaction the relevant reaction equations for the arsenic process are shown in table s2 the calculated result is shown in fig 3 a in the h2s generation reaction the δg of fes is only 23 16 kj mol indicating that the binding ability of s to h in fes is much weaker than in na2s in addition the decrease in δg for the generation of as2s3 to as2s3 h2s under fes is not significant while in na2s it decreases significantly to 1048 7 kj mol thus from a thermodynamic standpoint fes can mitigate h2s escape during the arsenic removal process by diminishing its affinity to h the escape of h2s from fes compared with na2s was also measured and depicted in fig 3 b a hand held hydrogen sulfide gas detector max 100 ppm measured the h2s escape during the reaction the reaction conditions were set as s as molar ratio of 1 5 h2so4 concentration of 50 g l initial as concentration of 2 g l the h2s escape concentration was found to immediately exceed the maximum range of 100 ppm upon addition of na2s it remained stable for nearly 2 min before gradually decreasing eventually reaching undetectable levels after 7 min after introducing amorphous fes the amount of h2s escaping increased to 62 ppm and rapidly declined the h2s could not be detected 200 s later indicating that the amorphous fes slowly released s2 in a highly acidic environment thereby weakening the competitive reaction of h and effectively reducing the escape of h2s the xrd pattern and settling curve of arsenic removal products by amorphous fes and na2s are shown in fig 3 c and d respectively the xrd patterns of both as2s3 precipitates exhibited a predominantly broad peak surface indicating an amorphous crystal structure however the diffraction peak intensity of as2s3 obtained using the amorphous fes was stronger compared to that of na2s suggesting better crystallinity of the particles in fes as2s3 additionally the sedimentation rate of fes as2s3 was significantly faster than that of na2s as2s3 the amorphous fes can improve filtration performance by enhancing the crystallization of the product which is conducive to the subsequent solid liquid separation operation 3 3 effect of fes structure evolution on arsenic removal 3 3 1 effect of fes aging time on arsenic removal the effect of aging time on the arsenic removal efficiency of amorphous fes and the escape of h2s during the reaction process were investigated fig 4 a demonstrates that the reactivity of fes gradually decreased with increasing aging time the reactivity decay rate of fes accelerated after the aging time exceeded one day and then gradually slowed down after the aging time exceeded three days after 84 days of aging the arsenic removal efficiency of fes declined to only 40 8 which was less than half of the 89 8 achieved by the amorphous fes the arsenic content in the precipitated products decreased from 36 to 14 whereas the iron content increased from 3 to 27 this indicates that with aging most of the iron sulfides did not undergo complete decomposition fig 4 b shows that the amount of h2s escaping also decreased with fes aging even after 84 days of aging no h2s escape was detected 3 3 2 crystallization behavior and mechanism a series of characterization methods were conducted to analyze the changes in the structure and properties of fes with aging fig 5 shows the xrd pattern a and particle size distribution b of fes with different aging time the peak intensity of the initial precipitate was extremely weak which indicates the amorphous fes was poorly ordered this was further supported by the presence of a broadband in the xrd pattern at d 5 37 å as the aging time prolonged fes gradually became crystallized from the amorphous state as evidenced by the increasing intensity of the four peaks d 5 03 å 2 97 å 2 31 å 1 808 å corresponding to mackinawite as shown in table 1 the calculated results revealed that with the prolongation of aging time the lattice parameter a axis increased continuously while the c axis interlayer spacing decreased from 6 36 å to 5 04 å which is nearly equivalent to the interlayer spacing observed crystalline fes 26 the shortening fes bond length also suggested a progressive stabilization of the structure the lattice energy is a measure of the energy released during the dissociation of a stable crystal to form ions and it is closely related to the solubility and phase transition behavior of the crystal the lattice energy of fes decreased from 3071 to 3678 kj mol with prolonged aging time indicating an enhanced stability of its crystal 27 28 according to the calculated and analyzed results mentioned above the schematic diagram of the structural changes of fes is shown in fig 5 c the fes structure transitioned from a state of disorder to order state resulting in an increase in stability this increase in stability was the main reason for the decrease in its reactivity it is worth noting that after three days of aging a new phase of greigite appeared characterized by the presence of three distinct peaks at d 2 98 å 2 47 å and 1 746 å in the xrd pattern the diffraction peak at about d 2 98 å can be confirmed as the coincident peak of mackinawite and greigite and the sudden increase of the diffraction peak here also proved the formation of greigite 26 29 the magnetism of fes was significantly enhanced after aging attributed to the ferromagnetism of greigite previous studies have indicated that unstable intermediates of greigite can form under conditions of weak oxygen reduction 30 32 fig 5 b shows that the particle size also increased with aging time and the d50 of the newly synthesized fes increased from 16 883 μm to 48 706 μm while the particle size of amorphous fes was a few nanometers the synthesized fes tended to form flake like and curved complex aggregates making it challenging to determine the particle size of a single fes particle within the aggregates 33 34 the microstructure and morphological changes of fes precipitate as a function of aging time are shown in fig 6 the related eds results are displayed in table s3 as presented in fig 6 a in the initial stage the amorphous fes mainly existed in the form of aggregates 35 and the dark area can be identified as fes with a fe s ratio of 1 1 with the help of eds spectrum 1 many flocculent aggregates shaped like needles or short columns appeared on the surface of fes and the oxygen content of these tiny particles reached 8 28 wt spectrum 2 indicating the presence of surface oxidation products of fes the amorphous fes exhibited inevitable oxidation behavior due to its high chemical reactivity after one day of aging the surface of fes spectrum 4 was covered with an abundance of mesh interwoven sheet particles eds results spectrum 3 revealed that the oxygen content of these fine sheet particles was as high as 34 43 wt confirming them as goethite a surface oxidation product of fes 36 as the aging time prolonged the exterior of fes underwent inevitable oxidation spectrum 5 8 resulting in a smooth and dense surface fig 6 c the fes particles began to form regular massive structures with well defined edges and distinct boundaries fig 6 d and e and finally coalesced to form large lumpy particles fig 6 f 37 the observed morphological changes indicate that the newly synthesized fes gradually accumulated and crystallized during aging transitioning from an amorphous state to sheet like structures and eventually to large particles with a specific regular shape ft ir and tg dsc analysis were also performed to reveal the crystallization mechanism of fes with aging time the detailed findings and discussion are provided in text s3 and the corresponding results are presented in fig s2 the results confirmed the enhanced stability of fes during the crystallization process and found that water molecules migrated from the surface to the interlayer and inside the lattice of fes with the extension of aging time and formed stable chemical bonds on the surface of fes 3 4 arsenic removal behavior by fes with various aging time the arsenic removal products of fes with different aging time were analyzed by xrd to clarify the phase transformation behavior during the reaction as shown in fig 7 a the product of unaged fes was found to be amorphous arsenic sulfide as2s3 indicating the nearly complete decomposition of the highly reactive fes as the aging time was extended the characteristic peak of fes pdf 15 0037 appeared and its corresponding peak intensity gradually increased indicating a decrease in fes reactivity interestingly the peak at about d 1 82 å was confirmed as the coincidence peak of feass pdf 42 1320 and fes the intensity of this peak increased with the aging of fes suggesting that as was predominantly present in the form of feass in the removal products as the reactivity of fes weakened xps was employed to investigate the transformation of chemical valence state changes at the surface of the products the xps survey spectra of all the products are shown in fig 7 b and the corresponding parameters are summarized in table s4 the spectra exhibited characteristic peaks of as 43 4 ev with varying intensities indicating different arsenic concentrations in the different products the intensity of the characteristic peak of oxygen in the product increased with the aging of fes which can be attributed to the surface oxidation of fes during aging and the presence of reaction products during storage the spectra of as3d s2p and fe2p of various as precipitates are displayed in fig 8 and the corresponding parameters are summarized in table s5 8 for further study in the as bearing precipitate 0 d two main strong characteristic peaks of as 3d were observed illustrating the presence of as2s3 compound in the precipitate 43 35 ev and 44 05 ev 38 the presence of as2s3 was further supported by the presence of s ii as peaks at 162 54 ev and 163 70 ev observed in the convoluted s 2p spectrum 39 the fe in the residue still existed as partially oxidized fes as confirmed by the peaks at binding energies of 162 04 ev and 163 20 ev s ii fe as well as 707 67 ev fe ii s and 710 21 ev fe iii o after fes aging characteristic peaks of as v o were observed which may be caused by the oxidation of adsorbed arsenite or the formation of arsenic sulfide compounds that were easy to be oxidized on the surface of the product 37 40 41 the content of as v o increased while that of as iii s decreased with the progression of aging time 1d 7d indicating an alternative binding behavior of as to aging fes as suggested above additionally the binding energies of as iii s shifted to a lower energy position 0 35 ev in the as 3d spectrum after fes aging suggesting a change in the composition of as iii s beyond the presence of as2s3 similarly the characteristic peaks of the high resolution s 2p in the precipitates after fes aging 3d 7d also showed distinct differences compared to those without aging 0d the peaks at 161 61 ev and 162 77 ev were attributed to s ii fe as species which are believed to correspond to the fes as complex feass based on the xrd results 40 42 as the aging time progressed the levels of s ii as decreased from 95 52 in the product without aging 0d to 31 72 in the precipitate 7d while the levels of s ii fe as attributed to the fes as complex increased from 0 to 49 23 this confirms that the reactivity of fes decreased as the aging time prolonged and the removal and immobilization of as primarily occurred in the form of arsenopyrite feass through adsorption precipitation the characteristic peaks of polysulfide were found in the as products of aged fes 3d 7d the formation of feass like complexes has been confirmed to be accompanied by polysulfide transformation 43 44 other characteristic peaks such as s iv o and s iv ii o which were considered intermediate sulfoxide anionic species indicated that the oxidation of fes or feass proceeded through a series of elementary single electron steps the major peaks of fe 2p located at 707 15 ev and 708 08 ev in the precipitates 1d were attributed to species similar to iron sulfides and feass like phases 45 meanwhile the fe ii s and fe iii s bonds were also observed at a similar binding energy position in the precipitates 3d and 7d which corresponded to the presence of feass in s 2p spectrum it is worth noting that the content of fe ii s decreased but fe iii s increased as aging time progressed indicating effective oxidation of fe ii to fe iii besides the characteristic peaks at approximately 709 ev to 711 ev in precipitates after fes aging 3d and 7d were ascribed to fe iii as o oxidation products which corresponded to the presence of as v o bonds in as 3d spectrum 39 the characteristic morphology and elemental compositions of as bearing precipitates at various fes aging times were analyzed by sem eds as shown in fig 9 many loose and irregular spot like particles were distributed in the arsenic removal products of amorphous fes fig 9 a the eds results show that these particles were mainly composed of s and as accompanied by trace amounts of o and fe after stoichiometric calculation the composition was determined to be as2s3 indicating that the highly active amorphous fes was completely transformed into as2s3 precipitation fig 9 b shows that after aging for 1d the as2s3 spot like aggregates still dominated the precipitate but a small number of massive particles appeared below the spot like particles eds results show that the main components were s as o and fe with a significant increase in fe content compared to before it indicates that the reactivity of fes began to deteriorate with aging after fes aging 1d the loose point like particles in the product disappeared and were replaced by massive aggregates with a dense and void free structure on the surface fig 9 c when the fes aging time reached seven days fig 9 d the particles in the product appeared as angular relatively ordinary flake objects and the amorphous flocculent objects covering on the surface were considered oxidation products combined with eds analysis the content of fe in the product increased from 1 2 in the unaged product to 31 66 after seven days the content of arsenic decreased from 57 18 to 27 04 and the content of s slightly reduced due to oxidation given the product composition the extension of aging time gradually transformed the arsenic removal products from as2s3 to feass like complex and adsorbed arsenite compound which is consistent with the analysis results of xrd and xps 3 5 proposed mechanisms based on the above analysis it can be concluded that the extension of aging time leads to significant changes in the internal structure and external morphology of fes through the crystallization process the structure of fes tends to become stable and its surface tends to become dense after aging which primarily contributes to the reduction in its reactivity the removal pathways of arsenic in solution by fes can be divided into two parts 1 based on the solubility product theory unaged fes with high reactivity tends to decompose and transform into as2s3 which is less soluble under strongly acidic conditions the process is represented by eq 2 2 after aging the reactivity of fes gradually weakens and as3 is susceptible to enter into fes through lattice substitution and diffusing forming a feass like complex eqs 3 4 44 the two possible functional groups have been proven to exist on iron sulfide surfaces an iron ii hydroxyl functional group fe oh and a sulfide functional group fe sh 31 the aqueous fesh complex is superior to the feoh complex at acid conditions 46 as3 in the solution can adsorb and form complexes with these active groups leading to the formation of monodentate surface complexes fe s as2 47 and bidentate surface complexes fe o 2 as 48 50 respectively eqs 5 6 the arsenic removal mechanism of unaged fes is dominated by the first one the second part gradually rules that of aged fes as graphically described in fig 10 although this change in the arsenic removal mechanism results in a reduction in removal efficiency it also reduces the occurrence of violent reactions and the subsequent release of a large amount of h2s gas by slowing down the reactivity of s2 during the reaction process 2 3 fes 2 as iii as 2 s 3 3 fe 2 3 fes x as iii fe 1 x as x s x fe 3 4 3 fes h 3 aso 3

on arsenic removal efficiency and deep purification in actual wastewater it should be noted that in the pilot test where the reagent added is in the form wet sludge suspension the centrifuged sludge can be stored and transportation in sealed containers peristaltic pump feeding can be utilized during the reaction process the appropriate dosage can be determined through pilot scale testing or by following established guidelines for the specific application as depicted in fig 11 a the arsenic removal efficiency demonstrates an increasing trend with higher fes dosages when the dosage reached 2 5 times the arsenic removal efficiency exceeded 99 and the residual concentration of arsenic in the wastewater decreased to 0 3 mg l when the dosage reached three times the dosage of fes used for arsenic removal was larger than the theoretical molar dosage 1 5 due to the influence of other heavy metal ions in the actual wastewater such as copper bismuth etc this can be proved by analyzing the content of each element in the precipitates fig 11 b the arsenic content in the precipitates reached 27 13 when the dosage was 2 5 times and then decreased to 26 06 as the dosage increased to 3 times indicating the excessive addition of the reagent in short the amorphous fes exhibited excellent adaptability in treating actual wastewater characterized by high acidity and arsenic content it achieved deep purification of arsenic and produces high quality arsenic products the economic benefit and environmental value of the proposed method for the treatment of copper smelting wastewater using amorphous fes was evaluated the production of smelting wastewater was set as 700 m3 d with an arsenic concentration of around 11 g l and a sulfuric acid concentration of 67 g l 39 after conducting a preliminary cost calculation it can be concluded that the cost per cubic meter of wastewater treatment using amorphous fes was 14 96 table s9 this method proved to be more cost effective and environmentally friendly compared to traditional lime iron salt treatment and sulfide precipitation this was attributed to the reduction in slag production and the elimination of costs associated with neutralizing slag treatment table s10 4 conclusions the amorphous fes as a novel sulfurizing reagent exhibited a more controlled release of s2 compared to the traditional sulfide reagent na2s however the reactivity of fes gradually diminished with prolonged aging leading to significant changes in the mode and mechanism of arsenic removal increasing the concentration of h2so4 in the solution 10 100 g l accelerated the decomposition of amorphous fes thereby enhancing the arsenic removal efficiency to 93 3 compared to fes while reducing the efficiency of na2s to approximately 90 the slow release performance of amorphous fes was manifested by effectively minimizing the escape of h2s gas during the reaction process thereby improving the purification efficiency and enhancing the crystallinity of the product to enhance its filtration performance the amorphous fes exhibited the highest arsenic removal performance initially which gradually decreased with aging the arsenic removal efficiency decreased from 89 8 to 40 8 after fes aging for 84 days maintaining a theoretical s as ratio of 1 5 particularly the efficiency reduction became significant after one day of aging the decrease in fes reactivity can be attributed to the enhancement of fes crystallinity and the development of a denser surface morphology as fes aged the mechanism of arsenic removal shifted mainly from precipitation transformation as2s3 to adsorption transformation feass the deep purification of arsenic from strongly acidic wastewater can be achieved with a low dosage of amorphous fes the arsenic content in the purified solution was reduced to 0 3 mg l the practicality affordability and industrial potential of amorphous fes as a slow release s2 reagent are evident understanding the relationship between fes structure and its performance in arsenic removal can provide valuable insights for the targeted development of fes materials for the efficient removal of hazardous metals from strongly acidic

12457,sulfide precipitation is an efficient method for separation however its application is limited due to the significant h2s pollution caused by conventional reagents the utilization of amorphous fes lead to a substantial reduction in h2s escape while concurrently enhancing the crystallization and settling characteristics of as precipitates under the conditions of an initial arsenic and h2so4 concentration in the solution of 2 g l and 50 g l respectively and a fes dosage of 1 5 times the molar amount of s as the arsenic removal exhibited a significant decrease from 89 8 to 40 8 over a fes aging period of 0 to 84 days notably no h2s emissions were detected during the entire reaction process xrd analysis revealed a transformation of fes from its amorphous form to a crystalline state as it undergoes aging this transition is primarily characterized by a reduction in interlayer spacing and fes bond length within the fes lattice the lattice energy experienced a decrease from 3071 to 3688 kj mol indicating the progressive stabilization of the fes structure ftir and tg dsc analyses have demonstrated the infiltration of water molecules into both the interlamellar spaces and the lattice of fes during the process of crystallization additionally as3 ions were observed to initially adsorb onto the surface of aged fes through the hydroxyl group followed by their diffusion into the lattice the products of arsenic removal undergone a transformation from as2s3 to predominantly feass like complexes as the mechanism of arsenic removal shifted from precipitate transformation to adsorption and co precipitation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords amorphous fes arsenic removal slow release sulfide precipitation structure transformation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic is a highly toxic element that poses significant health risks to humans it has been classified as a class 1 carcinogen by the world health organization 1 arsenic in nature mainly comes from minerals such as arsenopyrite feass realgar ass orpiment as2s3 and pyrite which are associated with valuable metallic minerals 2 most arsenic volatilizes and oxidizes into flue gas rich in as2o3 as2o5 during the smelting of arsenic associated non ferrous minerals that contain significant amounts of sulfur oxides sox heavy metals and dust 3 the highly acidic wastewater produced by the metallurgical industry contains high concentrations of arsenic range from 0 5 to 30 g l and h2so4 range from 10 to 200 g l which are produced by the flue gas washing of raw ore during fluidized bed roasting 4 sulfide precipitation is widely used for metal removal due to several advantages these include the low solubility of metal sulfide precipitates the potential for selective metal removal rapid reaction rates high product grades and the possibility of sulfide precipitation reuse through smelting processes 5 7 however the commonly utilized reagents in the industry such as ammonium sulfide nh4 2s sodium sulfide na2s and sodium hydrosulfide nahs exhibit a rapid release of h2s under strongly acidic conditions through a spontaneous hydrolysis process 4 8 these aqueous type agents usually need to be added in excess resulting in more severe h2s pollution hence the hard in overcoming the obstacles when using na2s lies in how we control or slow down the s2 release rate of sulfurizing reagent currently the approaches for modifying the release rate of s2 can be roughly divided into two categories one approach involves utilizing macromolecules or polymers to encapsulate readily soluble sulfides drawing inspiration from the concept of synthesizing medical capsules 9 10 the other is to use insoluble sulfide directly to slow its dissolution in a strongly acidic solution 11 12 zhu et al pioneered s2 sustained release using organo silicon complex to encapsulate calcium sulfide to obtain an excellent sustained release material and achieved superb separation efficiency 4 however the complex synthesis steps and the high cost of raw materials may pose significant obstacles that restrict its industrial application in contrast using insoluble sulfides an alternative approach seems more economically feasible and achievable due to the slight solubility of metal sulfides and the minimal formation of h2s overfeeding can occur without significant odor problems it is well known that the difficulty of sulfide formation is closely related to their solubility product value ksp 13 the higher the solubility product constant the more soluble the compound and it can theoretically convert into compounds with lower solubility product values therefore iron sulfides fes which have a relatively high solubility product ksp 1 59 10 19 are excellent materials for slow release of s2 the affinity of iron based materials to arsenic has attracted extensive attention 14 15 and fes has been widely used in various wastewater treatments due to its large solubility product and exceptional electrochemical performance including adsorption of heavy metals catalytic degradation of organic matter and other research fields 16 19 however all the aforementioned studies have been conducted based on the excellent surface properties of fes and few researchers have investigated its slow release behavior for removing heavy metals arsenic in high acid wastewater the solid fes has been used for heavy metal removal however the dosage of fes was more than twice the theoretical value required for heavy metal removal which would significantly decrease the grade and increase the volume of precipitate products 11 a smelting company in china has long used nickel sulfide concentrate as the cu removal reagent and faced the same problem 13 this suggested that in addition to the influence of solubility product the solubility or the structures of sulfide material itself also plays an essential role in the sustained release process 20 it should be noted that sulfide precipitate transformation rates only correspond to the value of solubility products for fresh amorphous metal sulfides 21 previous studies on fes have mainly focused on arsenic adsorption and transformation behavior on its surface in low concentration moderately acidic wastewater 22 and few researchers have systematically studied in wastewater containing high arsenic and strong acid furthermore it is unclear how fes with different structures contribute to the arsenic removal process and it is essential to establish a correlation between the structural evolution of fes and its arsenic removal performance to explain its underlying transformation mechanism this can establish the foundation for developing fes variants that are suitable for use under strong acidic conditions thereby reducing the amount of h2s released during the reaction process in this paper the amorphous fes was prepared to investigate the effects of factors such as acidity temperature and reaction time on the removal of high arsenic concentrations by fes in highly acidic solutions furthermore a comparative analysis was performed to assess the arsenic removal efficiency the release of h2s during the arsenic removal process and the filtration performance of the product when employing fes and na2s as the respective agents subsequently the structural changes of fes were investigated by extending the aging time and the influence of these changes on the arsenic removal efficiency was explored thereby establishing a structure performance relationship between the them finally the binding mode and reaction mechanism of fes and arsenic with different aging time were proposed this study explored the feasibility of removing arsenic from high activity insoluble sulfide in strong acidic wastewater and explained the influence of structural evolution on its activity it lays a theoretical foundation for the development of new sulfide agents and potentially overcomes the limitations of traditional sulfide reagents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials iron sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o and sodium sulfide nonahydrate na2s 9h2o were utilized as iron and sulfur sources respectively for the synthesis of amorphous fes these chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china sodium arsenite naaso2 and sulfuric acid 98 h2so4 were used to prepare an arsenic containing simulated solution for treatment and were obtained from fengyu chemical glass instrument co ltd changsha china the chemical composition of the copper smelting wastewater is shown in table s1 all reagents were of analytical grade and all solutions were prepared using deionized water 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 synthesized and aged procedures of amorphous fes the synthesis of fes was conducted in an anaerobic three neck flask using a chemical precipitation synthesis method to summarize a fes suspension was obtained by mixing 0 1 l of 1 mol l 1 s ii solution with 0 1 l of 1 2 mol l 1 fe ii solution an excess amount of fe ii was added to ensure sufficient reaction with s ii the entire synthesis process was carried out under n2 stream and the synthesis time was controlled to be within 10 min specifically the na2s solution was slowly added to the feso4 solution with vigorous stirring resulting in a dense amorphous fes suspension the synthesis process can be described in eq 1 in the comparative test the preparation of na2s solution followed the same procedure as described above the only difference was that the feso4 solution was replaced with an equal volume of deionized water this ensured that the s concentration in both sulfide solutions was maintained at 0 5 mol l 1 after the synthesis experiment the fes suspension was transferred to 250 ml glass bottles for static aging the aging environment was kept cool and dark with an indoor temperature of 25 c and the aging time was controlled as 0 1 3 7 30 and 84 days respectively the samples were labeled as fes 0 to fes 84 the solid fes samples used for characterization were obtained by vacuum freeze drying of the underlying precipitates which were gained by centrifuging the suspension at 8000 rpm for 10 min the wet fes suspension has higher antioxidant properties and is easier to disperse in solution compared to dry powders therefore the fes suspension was used in the following arsenic removal experiments 1 na 2 s feso 4 fes na 2 so 4 2 2 2 batch test of arsenic removal with amorphous fes the arsenic concentration in the arsenic containing as iii simulation solution was fixed at 2 g l to prepare the solution 3 44 g sodium arsenite naaso2 was dissolved in 500 ml of deionized water and then transferred to a 1 l volumetric flask after stirring evenly the simulated solution with an arsenic content of 2 g l was obtained the sulfuric acid 98 h2so4 was added as needed to control the acidity level of the simulated solution based on a sulfide solution concentration of 0 5 mol l the necessary volume of sulfide 8 1 ml was calculated according to a s as molar ratio of 1 5 the pipette gun was used to add the corresponding volume of fes suspension and sodium sulfide solution to the simulated solution and wastewater to start the reaction the reaction was performed in a three neck flask with 100 ml solution the flask was placed in a water bath and a mechanical stirrer was inserted into one of the necks while another contained a condenser tube the third neck was connected to an h2s detector to monitor the release of h2s during the reaction the tests were studied at reaction temperatures ranging from 25 to 80 c initial acid concentration from 50 to 200 g l and reaction time from 0 to 60 min the liquid solid mixture was filtered through a 0 2 μm microfiltration membrane upon the reaction completed a pipette took 1 ml of the reaction solution at the desired time during the experiment the filtrates were obtained by passing the sample through 0 2 μm ptfe membranes the solids obtained were freeze dried and further analyzed for phase change and chemical composition using vacuum drying if necessary the elemental concentrations of the filtrate diluted 100 times were determined using icp oes 2 2 3 arsenic removal test by fes at different aging time the 100 ml of arsenic containing simulated solution was transferred into a three neck flask for the reaction the initial acidity of the reaction solution was adjusted to 50 g l the aged fes suspension was uniformly dispersed using magnetic stirring before sampling then the predetermined volume 8 1 ml with a s to as molar ratio of 1 5 of fes suspension with different aging time was withdrawn using a pipette and added to the simulated solution for the reaction the reaction was conducted at a temperature of 25 c for 1 h after the reaction the mixture was filtered and the same procedure described above was followed for analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 characterization method the details are shown in supplementary information text s1 2 3 2 h2s escape measurement h2s escape during the arsenic removal reactions by fes and na2s was monitored by a portable hydrogen sulfide gas detector with a range of 1 100 ppm hd5s edkors china the hydrogen sulfide gas detector utilizes an abe type electrochemical sensor consisting of three electrodes immersed in the electrolyte the gas enters the sensor through the induction film where the electrochemical redox reaction takes place the output current intensity of the sensor is directly proportional to hydrogen sulfide concentration the detection method was built in pump suction measurement with a flow rate of 500 ml min the h2s gas concentration unit was configured to store concentration values as the average over a 2 s storage time with units expressed in parts per million ppm if h2s gas escapes during a chemical reaction a sampling pump directs the gas to the intake of a detector where it is measured by an h2s gas sensor and the concentration value is stored the gas was then expelled through the exhaust port of the detector the stored data of the h2s concentration values can be exported to pocket gas detector 5 0 software for further analysis and can also be plotted for visualization and interpretation 2 3 3 calculation of lattice parameters and energy the change in gibbs free energy δg of the reaction was calculated by hsc chemistry 6 0 the lattice parameters and symmetry of fes samples at different aging time were obtained after smoothing and rietveld fitting of their xrd patterns by mdi jade 6 based on the calculated lattice parameters and symmetry a crystal cell model for fes at different aging time was constructed in materials studio 2020 it should be pointed out that the amorphous fes fes 0 was also modeled in the form of a crystal to calculate its lattice parameters and lattice energy to facilitate comparison the lattice energy ul calculations for fes were calculated by the morphology module 23 the calculation task was set as growth morphology and the energy method was selected as forcite the compass iii force field was employed which is an advanced ab initio force field designed to facilitate atomistic simulations of materials in condensed phases 24 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermodynamic analysis the variations of arsenic and ferrous species at different ph were investigated by constructing species distribution diagrams using medusa hydra chemical equilibrium software for windows 25 the results are demonstrated in fig 1 precipitate as2s3 is the predominant species in the ph range of 0 10 particularly the solid phase as2s3 accounts for nearly 100 of the arsenic distribution at ph 0 6 2 however the fraction of as2s3 starts to decrease gradually with increasing ph at ph 9 the precipitated as2s3 dissolves significantly and h2aso3 replaces as2s3 as the dominant species at ph values above 10 fig 1 b illustrates that as2s3 is not stable under alkaline conditions when the ph exceeds 10 fes precipitates become the dominant species in the fe component therefore to achieve high arsenic removal in the as fe s h2o system the ph value should be maintained below 6 2 however the above analysis results were based on the assumption that all elements exist in the solution as ions in actual situations the solubility of fes under acidic conditions should be considered the dissolution equilibrium diagram of fes and as2s3 and the eh ph diagram of as fe s h2o are shown in fig s1 the dissolution balance of insoluble sulfide and the dominant area of each species were also further discussed in text s2 3 2 slow release properties of amorphous fes 3 2 1 influential factors on arsenic removal by fes and na2s the effect of solution acidity h2so4 concentration and reaction time on the slow release properties of amorphous fes in arsenic removal were investigated and compared with na2s the results are shown in fig 2 acidity was a primary factor that affects arsenic removal efficiency using fes the arsenic removal efficiency depicted in fig 2 a exhibited a gradual increase from approximately 86 to 93 within the h2so4 concentration range of 10 100 g l when the acidity exceeded 100 and reached 200 g l the arsenic removal efficiency did not continue to increase but slightly decreased interestingly the trends were opposite when na2s was used for arsenic removal under different acidity conditions fig 2 b about 95 of the initial as iii was removed at an h2so4 concentration of 10 g l however as the solution acidity increased the removal efficiency significantly decreased stabilizing at around 90 until the acidity exceeded 100 g l these results indicate that increasing solution acidity in a particular range favors arsenic removal with fes but negatively influences arsenic removal with na2s in an acidic system most of the s2 reacts with arsenic to form precipitates however a portion of the s2 also reacts with h to produce h2s when the concentration of h2s exceeds the saturation limit of the solution it escapes from the system as the acidity of the solution increased 10 50 g l the concentration of h also increased leading to a decrease in the utilization of s2 in na2s and a reduction in arsenic removal efficiency when the h concentration reached a certain level 100 200 g l the arsenic removal efficiency gently declined indicating a relatively stable emission of h2s further increasing the h concentration did not significantly enhance its competition with s2 however in the fes as iii system s2 was fixed through the formation of insoluble fes compounds which avoided the simultaneous distribution of a large amount of s2 in acidic solution and weakened the competitive effect of h in fig 2 a the magnified section within 1 min of the reaction shaded part shows a relatively slow increased in arsenic removal at the low h concentrations 10 g l this indicates that there was a fixation effect of s2 through fes compounds although this effect was weak due to the high reactivity of fes in contrast the arsenic removal efficiency reached equilibrium immediately after adding na2s and did not change anymore fig 2 b comparing fes with na2s fes exhibited a slow release capability of s2 under specific acidity conditions and s2 was less prone to react with h to produce h2s this characteristic improved the utilization efficiency of s2 in fes for arsenic removal furthermore in the acidity range of 10 100 g l the arsenic removal efficiency continued to increase due to the decomposition of fes it was proved from fig 2 c that the arsenic grade in the precipitate product reached to about 40 meanwhile the fe grades steadily decreased throughout the entire acidity range reaching 1 47 this indicates that the increase in acidity facilitated the decomposition of fes however at high acidity levels 200 g l the arsenic removal efficiency was negatively affected the effect of temperature shown in fig 2 d depicted that temperature did not obviously promote the decomposition of fes or enhance the arsenic removal efficiency at this acidity level compared to na2s fes demonstrated superior slow release performance in arsenic removal when used in strongly acidic solutions the amorphous fes has a particular acid and temperature resistance suitable for arsenic removal over a wide acidity range 3 2 2 the comparison of h2s escape and products performance the priority of a reaction can be determined by calculating the change in gibbs free energy of the reaction the relevant reaction equations for the arsenic process are shown in table s2 the calculated result is shown in fig 3 a in the h2s generation reaction the δg of fes is only 23 16 kj mol indicating that the binding ability of s to h in fes is much weaker than in na2s in addition the decrease in δg for the generation of as2s3 to as2s3 h2s under fes is not significant while in na2s it decreases significantly to 1048 7 kj mol thus from a thermodynamic standpoint fes can mitigate h2s escape during the arsenic removal process by diminishing its affinity to h the escape of h2s from fes compared with na2s was also measured and depicted in fig 3 b a hand held hydrogen sulfide gas detector max 100 ppm measured the h2s escape during the reaction the reaction conditions were set as s as molar ratio of 1 5 h2so4 concentration of 50 g l initial as concentration of 2 g l the h2s escape concentration was found to immediately exceed the maximum range of 100 ppm upon addition of na2s it remained stable for nearly 2 min before gradually decreasing eventually reaching undetectable levels after 7 min after introducing amorphous fes the amount of h2s escaping increased to 62 ppm and rapidly declined the h2s could not be detected 200 s later indicating that the amorphous fes slowly released s2 in a highly acidic environment thereby weakening the competitive reaction of h and effectively reducing the escape of h2s the xrd pattern and settling curve of arsenic removal products by amorphous fes and na2s are shown in fig 3 c and d respectively the xrd patterns of both as2s3 precipitates exhibited a predominantly broad peak surface indicating an amorphous crystal structure however the diffraction peak intensity of as2s3 obtained using the amorphous fes was stronger compared to that of na2s suggesting better crystallinity of the particles in fes as2s3 additionally the sedimentation rate of fes as2s3 was significantly faster than that of na2s as2s3 the amorphous fes can improve filtration performance by enhancing the crystallization of the product which is conducive to the subsequent solid liquid separation operation 3 3 effect of fes structure evolution on arsenic removal 3 3 1 effect of fes aging time on arsenic removal the effect of aging time on the arsenic removal efficiency of amorphous fes and the escape of h2s during the reaction process were investigated fig 4 a demonstrates that the reactivity of fes gradually decreased with increasing aging time the reactivity decay rate of fes accelerated after the aging time exceeded one day and then gradually slowed down after the aging time exceeded three days after 84 days of aging the arsenic removal efficiency of fes declined to only 40 8 which was less than half of the 89 8 achieved by the amorphous fes the arsenic content in the precipitated products decreased from 36 to 14 whereas the iron content increased from 3 to 27 this indicates that with aging most of the iron sulfides did not undergo complete decomposition fig 4 b shows that the amount of h2s escaping also decreased with fes aging even after 84 days of aging no h2s escape was detected 3 3 2 crystallization behavior and mechanism a series of characterization methods were conducted to analyze the changes in the structure and properties of fes with aging fig 5 shows the xrd pattern a and particle size distribution b of fes with different aging time the peak intensity of the initial precipitate was extremely weak which indicates the amorphous fes was poorly ordered this was further supported by the presence of a broadband in the xrd pattern at d 5 37 å as the aging time prolonged fes gradually became crystallized from the amorphous state as evidenced by the increasing intensity of the four peaks d 5 03 å 2 97 å 2 31 å 1 808 å corresponding to mackinawite as shown in table 1 the calculated results revealed that with the prolongation of aging time the lattice parameter a axis increased continuously while the c axis interlayer spacing decreased from 6 36 å to 5 04 å which is nearly equivalent to the interlayer spacing observed crystalline fes 26 the shortening fes bond length also suggested a progressive stabilization of the structure the lattice energy is a measure of the energy released during the dissociation of a stable crystal to form ions and it is closely related to the solubility and phase transition behavior of the crystal the lattice energy of fes decreased from 3071 to 3678 kj mol with prolonged aging time indicating an enhanced stability of its crystal 27 28 according to the calculated and analyzed results mentioned above the schematic diagram of the structural changes of fes is shown in fig 5 c the fes structure transitioned from a state of disorder to order state resulting in an increase in stability this increase in stability was the main reason for the decrease in its reactivity it is worth noting that after three days of aging a new phase of greigite appeared characterized by the presence of three distinct peaks at d 2 98 å 2 47 å and 1 746 å in the xrd pattern the diffraction peak at about d 2 98 å can be confirmed as the coincident peak of mackinawite and greigite and the sudden increase of the diffraction peak here also proved the formation of greigite 26 29 the magnetism of fes was significantly enhanced after aging attributed to the ferromagnetism of greigite previous studies have indicated that unstable intermediates of greigite can form under conditions of weak oxygen reduction 30 32 fig 5 b shows that the particle size also increased with aging time and the d50 of the newly synthesized fes increased from 16 883 μm to 48 706 μm while the particle size of amorphous fes was a few nanometers the synthesized fes tended to form flake like and curved complex aggregates making it challenging to determine the particle size of a single fes particle within the aggregates 33 34 the microstructure and morphological changes of fes precipitate as a function of aging time are shown in fig 6 the related eds results are displayed in table s3 as presented in fig 6 a in the initial stage the amorphous fes mainly existed in the form of aggregates 35 and the dark area can be identified as fes with a fe s ratio of 1 1 with the help of eds spectrum 1 many flocculent aggregates shaped like needles or short columns appeared on the surface of fes and the oxygen content of these tiny particles reached 8 28 wt spectrum 2 indicating the presence of surface oxidation products of fes the amorphous fes exhibited inevitable oxidation behavior due to its high chemical reactivity after one day of aging the surface of fes spectrum 4 was covered with an abundance of mesh interwoven sheet particles eds results spectrum 3 revealed that the oxygen content of these fine sheet particles was as high as 34 43 wt confirming them as goethite a surface oxidation product of fes 36 as the aging time prolonged the exterior of fes underwent inevitable oxidation spectrum 5 8 resulting in a smooth and dense surface fig 6 c the fes particles began to form regular massive structures with well defined edges and distinct boundaries fig 6 d and e and finally coalesced to form large lumpy particles fig 6 f 37 the observed morphological changes indicate that the newly synthesized fes gradually accumulated and crystallized during aging transitioning from an amorphous state to sheet like structures and eventually to large particles with a specific regular shape ft ir and tg dsc analysis were also performed to reveal the crystallization mechanism of fes with aging time the detailed findings and discussion are provided in text s3 and the corresponding results are presented in fig s2 the results confirmed the enhanced stability of fes during the crystallization process and found that water molecules migrated from the surface to the interlayer and inside the lattice of fes with the extension of aging time and formed stable chemical bonds on the surface of fes 3 4 arsenic removal behavior by fes with various aging time the arsenic removal products of fes with different aging time were analyzed by xrd to clarify the phase transformation behavior during the reaction as shown in fig 7 a the product of unaged fes was found to be amorphous arsenic sulfide as2s3 indicating the nearly complete decomposition of the highly reactive fes as the aging time was extended the characteristic peak of fes pdf 15 0037 appeared and its corresponding peak intensity gradually increased indicating a decrease in fes reactivity interestingly the peak at about d 1 82 å was confirmed as the coincidence peak of feass pdf 42 1320 and fes the intensity of this peak increased with the aging of fes suggesting that as was predominantly present in the form of feass in the removal products as the reactivity of fes weakened xps was employed to investigate the transformation of chemical valence state changes at the surface of the products the xps survey spectra of all the products are shown in fig 7 b and the corresponding parameters are summarized in table s4 the spectra exhibited characteristic peaks of as 43 4 ev with varying intensities indicating different arsenic concentrations in the different products the intensity of the characteristic peak of oxygen in the product increased with the aging of fes which can be attributed to the surface oxidation of fes during aging and the presence of reaction products during storage the spectra of as3d s2p and fe2p of various as precipitates are displayed in fig 8 and the corresponding parameters are summarized in table s5 8 for further study in the as bearing precipitate 0 d two main strong characteristic peaks of as 3d were observed illustrating the presence of as2s3 compound in the precipitate 43 35 ev and 44 05 ev 38 the presence of as2s3 was further supported by the presence of s ii as peaks at 162 54 ev and 163 70 ev observed in the convoluted s 2p spectrum 39 the fe in the residue still existed as partially oxidized fes as confirmed by the peaks at binding energies of 162 04 ev and 163 20 ev s ii fe as well as 707 67 ev fe ii s and 710 21 ev fe iii o after fes aging characteristic peaks of as v o were observed which may be caused by the oxidation of adsorbed arsenite or the formation of arsenic sulfide compounds that were easy to be oxidized on the surface of the product 37 40 41 the content of as v o increased while that of as iii s decreased with the progression of aging time 1d 7d indicating an alternative binding behavior of as to aging fes as suggested above additionally the binding energies of as iii s shifted to a lower energy position 0 35 ev in the as 3d spectrum after fes aging suggesting a change in the composition of as iii s beyond the presence of as2s3 similarly the characteristic peaks of the high resolution s 2p in the precipitates after fes aging 3d 7d also showed distinct differences compared to those without aging 0d the peaks at 161 61 ev and 162 77 ev were attributed to s ii fe as species which are believed to correspond to the fes as complex feass based on the xrd results 40 42 as the aging time progressed the levels of s ii as decreased from 95 52 in the product without aging 0d to 31 72 in the precipitate 7d while the levels of s ii fe as attributed to the fes as complex increased from 0 to 49 23 this confirms that the reactivity of fes decreased as the aging time prolonged and the removal and immobilization of as primarily occurred in the form of arsenopyrite feass through adsorption precipitation the characteristic peaks of polysulfide were found in the as products of aged fes 3d 7d the formation of feass like complexes has been confirmed to be accompanied by polysulfide transformation 43 44 other characteristic peaks such as s iv o and s iv ii o which were considered intermediate sulfoxide anionic species indicated that the oxidation of fes or feass proceeded through a series of elementary single electron steps the major peaks of fe 2p located at 707 15 ev and 708 08 ev in the precipitates 1d were attributed to species similar to iron sulfides and feass like phases 45 meanwhile the fe ii s and fe iii s bonds were also observed at a similar binding energy position in the precipitates 3d and 7d which corresponded to the presence of feass in s 2p spectrum it is worth noting that the content of fe ii s decreased but fe iii s increased as aging time progressed indicating effective oxidation of fe ii to fe iii besides the characteristic peaks at approximately 709 ev to 711 ev in precipitates after fes aging 3d and 7d were ascribed to fe iii as o oxidation products which corresponded to the presence of as v o bonds in as 3d spectrum 39 the characteristic morphology and elemental compositions of as bearing precipitates at various fes aging times were analyzed by sem eds as shown in fig 9 many loose and irregular spot like particles were distributed in the arsenic removal products of amorphous fes fig 9 a the eds results show that these particles were mainly composed of s and as accompanied by trace amounts of o and fe after stoichiometric calculation the composition was determined to be as2s3 indicating that the highly active amorphous fes was completely transformed into as2s3 precipitation fig 9 b shows that after aging for 1d the as2s3 spot like aggregates still dominated the precipitate but a small number of massive particles appeared below the spot like particles eds results show that the main components were s as o and fe with a significant increase in fe content compared to before it indicates that the reactivity of fes began to deteriorate with aging after fes aging 1d the loose point like particles in the product disappeared and were replaced by massive aggregates with a dense and void free structure on the surface fig 9 c when the fes aging time reached seven days fig 9 d the particles in the product appeared as angular relatively ordinary flake objects and the amorphous flocculent objects covering on the surface were considered oxidation products combined with eds analysis the content of fe in the product increased from 1 2 in the unaged product to 31 66 after seven days the content of arsenic decreased from 57 18 to 27 04 and the content of s slightly reduced due to oxidation given the product composition the extension of aging time gradually transformed the arsenic removal products from as2s3 to feass like complex and adsorbed arsenite compound which is consistent with the analysis results of xrd and xps 3 5 proposed mechanisms based on the above analysis it can be concluded that the extension of aging time leads to significant changes in the internal structure and external morphology of fes through the crystallization process the structure of fes tends to become stable and its surface tends to become dense after aging which primarily contributes to the reduction in its reactivity the removal pathways of arsenic in solution by fes can be divided into two parts 1 based on the solubility product theory unaged fes with high reactivity tends to decompose and transform into as2s3 which is less soluble under strongly acidic conditions the process is represented by eq 2 2 after aging the reactivity of fes gradually weakens and as3 is susceptible to enter into fes through lattice substitution and diffusing forming a feass like complex eqs 3 4 44 the two possible functional groups have been proven to exist on iron sulfide surfaces an iron ii hydroxyl functional group fe oh and a sulfide functional group fe sh 31 the aqueous fesh complex is superior to the feoh complex at acid conditions 46 as3 in the solution can adsorb and form complexes with these active groups leading to the formation of monodentate surface complexes fe s as2 47 and bidentate surface complexes fe o 2 as 48 50 respectively eqs 5 6 the arsenic removal mechanism of unaged fes is dominated by the first one the second part gradually rules that of aged fes as graphically described in fig 10 although this change in the arsenic removal mechanism results in a reduction in removal efficiency it also reduces the occurrence of violent reactions and the subsequent release of a large amount of h2s gas by slowing down the reactivity of s2 during the reaction process 2 3 fes 2 as iii as 2 s 3 3 fe 2 3 fes x as iii fe 1 x as x s x fe 3 4 3 fes h 3 aso 3 3 h fes 2 feass fe 3 3 h 2 o 5 fe sh as iii fe s as iii 2 h 6 2 fe sh as iii fe o 2 as iii 2 h 3 6 application potential the amorphous fes was added into wastewater to explore the influence of dosage on arsenic removal efficiency and deep purification in actual wastewater it should be noted that in the pilot test where the reagent added is in the form wet sludge suspension the centrifuged sludge can be stored and transportation in sealed containers peristaltic pump feeding can be utilized during the reaction process the appropriate dosage can be determined through pilot scale testing or by following established guidelines for the specific application as depicted in fig 11 a the arsenic removal efficiency demonstrates an increasing trend with higher fes dosages when the dosage reached 2 5 times the arsenic removal efficiency exceeded 99 and the residual concentration of arsenic in the wastewater decreased to 0 3 mg l when the dosage reached three times the dosage of fes used for arsenic removal was larger than the theoretical molar dosage 1 5 due to the influence of other heavy metal ions in the actual wastewater such as copper bismuth etc this can be proved by analyzing the content of each element in the precipitates fig 11 b the arsenic content in the precipitates reached 27 13 when the dosage was 2 5 times and then decreased to 26 06 as the dosage increased to 3 times indicating the excessive addition of the reagent in short the amorphous fes exhibited excellent adaptability in treating actual wastewater characterized by high acidity and arsenic content it achieved deep purification of arsenic and produces high quality arsenic products the economic benefit and environmental value of the proposed method for the treatment of copper smelting wastewater using amorphous fes was evaluated the production of smelting wastewater was set as 700 m3 d with an arsenic concentration of around 11 g l and a sulfuric acid concentration of 67 g l 39 after conducting a preliminary cost calculation it can be concluded that the cost per cubic meter of wastewater treatment using amorphous fes was 14 96 table s9 this method proved to be more cost effective and environmentally friendly compared to traditional lime iron salt treatment and sulfide precipitation this was attributed to the reduction in slag production and the elimination of costs associated with neutralizing slag treatment table s10 4 conclusions the amorphous fes as a novel sulfurizing reagent exhibited a more controlled release of s2 compared to the traditional sulfide reagent na2s however the reactivity of fes gradually diminished with prolonged aging leading to significant changes in the mode and mechanism of arsenic removal increasing the concentration of h2so4 in the solution 10 100 g l accelerated the decomposition of amorphous fes thereby enhancing the arsenic removal efficiency to 93 3 compared to fes while reducing the efficiency of na2s to approximately 90 the slow release performance of amorphous fes was manifested by effectively minimizing the escape of h2s gas during the reaction process thereby improving the purification efficiency and enhancing the crystallinity of the product to enhance its filtration performance the amorphous fes exhibited the highest arsenic removal performance initially which gradually decreased with aging the arsenic removal efficiency decreased from 89 8 to 40 8 after fes aging for 84 days maintaining a theoretical s as ratio of 1 5 particularly the efficiency reduction became significant after one day of aging the decrease in fes reactivity can be attributed to the enhancement of fes crystallinity and the development of a denser surface morphology as fes aged the mechanism of arsenic removal shifted mainly from precipitation transformation as2s3 to adsorption transformation feass the deep purification of arsenic from strongly acidic wastewater can be achieved with a low dosage of amorphous fes the arsenic content in the purified solution was reduced to 0 3 mg l the practicality affordability and industrial potential of amorphous fes as a slow release s2 reagent are evident understanding the relationship between fes structure and its performance in arsenic removal can provide valuable insights for the targeted development of fes materials for the efficient removal of hazardous metals from strongly acidic

12458,during the zinc electrolysis the concentration of cl i impurity in the zinc sulfate electrolyte needs to be controlled below 100 mg l in the promising approach for cl i removal from the zinc sulfate electrolyte by bismuth oxide bi2o3 the low efficiency and high reagent dosage arising from the limited solubility of bi2o3 are the major technical bottleneck to be solved in this study an improved approach for the removal of cl i from zinc sulfate electrolyte by the porous bi2o3 rich in oxygen vacancies ovs was explored for the common zinc sulfate electrolyte a high efficiency above 90 was always obtained under the stoichiometric mole ratio of reagent to cl i under room temperature when the bi2o3 being irradiated for 300 min under ultraviolet uv was utilized 98 9 of the employed bi2o3 was regenerated after the treatment using sodium hydroxide naoh solution and thus cl i was finally transferred from the zinc sulfate electrolyte to the concentrate thanks to the improved bi2o3 dissolution caused by the porous surface and the adsorption of cl i on ovs the transformation process of inner bi2o3 to biocl can be effectively improved leading to the significant enhancement in cl i removal efficiency and decrease in reagent dosage graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chloride ion bismuth oxide oxygen vacancies porous surface ultraviolet data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction zinc a kind of raw material of aluminum copper and lead alloys can be widely applied in the die casting machinery manufacturing printing and battery industries 1 4 nowadays approximately 80 of zinc is produced by the hydrometallurgy technology all over the world for the high purity of the obtained zinc electrolysis is a necessary step in the zinc hydrometallurgy where zinc sulfate containing high concentration zn2 and so4 2 is a kind of common electrolyte 5 9 during the electrolysis of zinc sulfate electrolyte zinc will be deposited from zn2 on the cathode eq 1 and at the same time oh will be oxidized to produce o2 on the anode as shown in eq 2 finally leading to the purification of zinc 10 1 zn 2 2 e zn on the cathode 2 2 oh 4 e o 2 2 h on the anode in recent years owing to the promotion of the direct smelting technology using zinc oxide ore in low grade the concentration of the leachable cl i impurity was obviously enhanced in the zinc sulfate electrolyte the accumulation of cl i in the electrolyte will bring serious problems to the electrolysis process 11 13 for instance cl i can destroy the aluminum oxide film on the surface of cathode which can weakly bind with zinc leading to the difficulty in the zinc stripping 14 17 in addition cl i can cause pitting on the lead silver anode further resulting in the reduction and deposition of corrosion products on the cathode as well as the decline in the quality of the produced zinc 18 20 under the condition that cl i concentration exceeds 800 mg l cl2 will be generated on the anode and thus the operating conditions will be deteriorated and the energy consumption will be greatly increased 21 in view of this the concentration of cl i in the zinc sulfate electrolyte needs to be controlled below 100 mg l among the various removal methods of cl i under the acidic conditions copper slag precipitation approach is the most widely used one in this method the major components of copper slag cu0 and cu2 react with cl i to produce cuprous chloride cucl solid 22 24 for the enterprises which can produce the copper slag byproducts this method is effective and economic however for the enterprises lacking copper slag this method seems no longer suitable because of the high cost of reagent under these circumstances bismuth oxide bi2o3 which can be regenerated becomes the alternative reagent during the cl i removal using bi2o3 dissolved bi3 forms from bi2o3 under the function of h and combines with cl i to generate bismuth chloride bicl3 as shown in eqs 3 and 4 after the hydrolysis process bicl3 continues to be converted to bismuth oxychloride biocl eq 5 leading to the final removal of cl i 25 27 3 bi 2 o 3 6 h 2 bi 3 3 h 2 o 4 bi 3 3 cl i bicl 3 5 bicl 3 h 2 o biocl 2 hcl thanks to the renewability of reagent bi2o3 precipitation approach has attracted considerable attention despite this this method seems to be far from application because of the low efficiency and the high reagent dosage in our previous work ultraviolet uv was adopted for the improvement on the bi2o3 precipitation method with the participation of uv the cl i removal efficiency was significantly enhanced under the premise of the dosage of bi2o3 being at the stoichiometric value 28 however the continuous output of uv brings certain difficulties to the upgrading and management of the existing cl i removal processes making the above uv improved approach not applicable in actual production fortunately it was found that the structural and chemical properties of bi2o3 will change under the irradiation of uv 29 30 which may enhance the cl i removal effects in view of this we took uv as the modification means on bi2o3 and explored the cl i removal method by this new reagent without the addition of uv in this work a method of precipitation adsorption by the porous bi2o3 rich in oxygen vacancies ovs was developed for the removal of cl i from the zinc sulfate electrolyte firstly preparation parameters solubility and surface morphology of the porous bi2o3 reagent rich in ovs were explored then the removal efficiency of cl i and the residual concentration of bi3 under different temperature reagent dosage reaction time h2so4 concentration and zn2 concentration were determined successively further this method for the removal of cl i from the zinc sulfate electrolyte was applied in the expanding experiments to test the practicality finally characterizations on the solid products and masking experiments for the ovs were conducted to explore the mechanisms for the removal of cl i 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents and materials the bi2o3 sodium chloride nacl sodium hydroxide naoh potassium chloride kcl potassium nitrate kno3 potassium iodide

were all obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china the deionized di water produced from a milli q water purification system millipore usa was employed for the preparation of all samples the actual zinc sulfate electrolyte containing 115 g l of h2so4 57 3 g l of zn2 and 619 mg l of cl i was obtained from a zinc electrolysis plant in jiangsu province china 2 2 experimental system synthesis experiments of bi2o3 were conducted in a photochemical reactor shanghai bilang instrument manufacturing co ltd china equipped with the hg lamp 1000 w dissolution and regeneration experiments for bi2o3 were conducted in a cylindrical glass reactor 500 ml containing 500 ml of h2so4 solution and naoh solution respectively on the magnetic stirring apparatus zhengzhou hengyan instrument co ltd china removal and adsorption experiments for cl i were conducted in a cylindrical glass reactor 1 l containing 1 l of the prepared zinc sulfate electrolyte and the nacl solution under the magnetic stirring respectively 2 3 synthesis of the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs as shown in fig s1 the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs was prepared in the following steps 1 5 00 g of bi2o3 was added in the quartz tube containing 200 ml of the di water 2 the mixed solution was placed in the photochemical reactor with the lamp and the magnetic stirring on 3 then the solid products were obtained after filtration by vacuum filtration drying 12 h 70 c grinding and sieving 2 4 removal and adsorption experiments for cl i during the removal and adsorption experiments for cl i under different temperature reagent dosage reaction time h2so4 and zn2 concentrations 2 00 ml of sample was taken at certain time interval and was filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membrane for the next determination of cl i and bi3 concentrations additionally the solid products at different time interval were filtrated and dried for the next characterizations on the chemical composition and the surface morphology 2 5 dissolution and regeneration experiments of bi2o3 in the dissolution experiments of bi2o3 2 00 ml of sample was taken at certain time interval and was filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membrane for the next determination of bi3 concentration in addition after the regeneration experiments of bi2o3 by the naoh solution conducted under the certain concentration of naoh solution temperature reaction time and reagent dosage the regenerated bi2o3 was filtrated dried and weighed for the determination of the regeneration efficiency as well as the next characterizations on the chemical composition and the surface morphology 2 6 analytical methods for the determination of cl i concentration in the samples using the ion selective electrode ise method the electrode slope and the linearity range of the employed chloride ion selective electrode were determined first 25 ml of the standard cl i solution 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 and 10 5 m respectively was added with 5 00 ml of the total ion strength adjustment buffer tisab 256 g l ph 4 prepared by c6h5na3o7 2h2o and hno3 and was then diluted with the di water to a final volume of 50 ml next the electric potential values of these mixed solutions detected by the chloride ion selective electrode were recorded as a function of p cl i fig s2 shows that the electrode slope was 42 75 and the linearity range was 10 4 10 1 m the quantification procedures of cl i in the samples are as follows 1 1 00 ml of the sample was added with 5 00 ml of tisab in a 50 ml beaker 2 the mixed solution was diluted with the di water to a final volume of 50 ml 3 electrode was immersed in the diluted solution and the electric potential value was recorded as e1 after 1 min of stirring 4 1 00 ml of the standard cl i solution 0 05 m was added into the diluted solution and the final electric potential value was recorded as e2 after 1 min of stirring thus concentration of cl i in the final diluted solution was calculated according to eq 6 6 cl i 35 46 mg l 10 e 1 e 2 42 75 1 bi3 concentration was determined by an uv vis spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa the standard curve of bi3 was determined as follows and the results are shown in fig s3 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 ml of the standard bi3 solution 1000 μg ml was added with 5 ml of h2so4 50 10 ml of ki solution 200 g l and 10 ml of ch4n2s solution 100 g l in a 50 ml beaker respectively 2 the above mixed solution was diluted with the di water to a final volume of 50 ml 3 the absorbance was determined under 465 nm and recorded as a for the next determination of bi3 concentration of the samples the above procedures were also applicable under the premise that the standard bi3 solution was replaced with 0 5 ml of sample thus concentration of bi3 in the final diluted solution can be calculated according to eq 7 7 bi 3 a mg l 0 0496 crystal texture element composition and surface morphology of the reagents and the solid products were recorded by x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro mpd panalytical holland x ray photoelectron spectra xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa and scanning electron microscopy sem su 8020 hitachi japan respectively the specific surface area of the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs was detected by bet physical adsorption instrument autosorb iq quantachrome usa ovs and surface chemical bonds in bi2o3 were respectively determined by electron spin resonance esr e500 bruker elexsys germany fourier infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is 10 thermo fisher usa and raman spectroscopy dxr2xi thermo fisher usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs we prepared the bi2o3 reagent for cl i removal under different time of uv irradiation first as shown in fig s4 xrd peak shapes for the fresh bi2o3 and uv bi2o3 under irradiation time of 300 min are rather similar signifying that the crystal composition of bi2o3 was not obviously affected by uv the narrow broadening of the peaks implies that uv bi2o3 still possessed a well crystallized structure fig 1 shows the appearance and the surface morphology of bi2o3 reagent being irradiated by uv it can be clearly seen that with the increase in the irradiation time the color of bi2o3 shows a change from faint yellow to light gray at 180 min and finally to brown at 360 min further under the irradiation of uv the rather smooth surface of bi2o3 turned to be square lamellar with quite smooth edges after 120 min with the irradiation proceeding a paper scrap structure with holes and rough edges appeared at 240 min and finally a kind of irregular porous surface formed at 360 min in view of this it is speculated that the color change in appearance may fundamentally result from changes in the surface structure next we explored the effect of porous surface on the dissolubility of bi2o3 theoretically the surface roughening will lead to an increase in the specific surface area however from table s1 it can be seen that the specific surface area of bi2o3 being irradiated for 0 30 60 120 180 240 300 and 360 min is 0 6757 0 6778 0 5921 0 7077 0 7037 0 8029 0 5721 and 0 7029 m2 g respectively indicating that there is no obvious change in the specific surface area of bi2o3 under the irradiation of uv combined with the sem morphology results detected at 2000 times of magnification shown in fig s5 it can be determined that the rough surface helped the agglomeration phenomenon occur in the uv treated bi2o3 which can lead to the increase in the particle size of bi2o3 and the decrease in the specific surface area what is more it can also be seen that the particle size of fresh bi2o3 was heterogeneous in view of this the random specific surface area of uv bi2o3 was probably induced by the agglomeration and the heterogeneous particle size of bi2o3 fig 2 shows the results for bi2o3 dissolution experiments in the acidic solution containing the bi2o3 being irradiated for 0 30 60 120 180 240 300 and 360 min bi3 concentration reached 502 0 746 9 777 0 834 5 860 7 1027 2 1131 3 and 1137 4 mg l at 60 min respectively additionally for the bi2o3 being irradiated for 300 and 360 min bi3 concentration reached 1060 5 and 1067 6 mg l at merely 10 min thus it can be concluded that the modification on bi2o3 using uv significantly enhanced the dissolution rate and limit thanks to the formation of porous surface actually the dissolution rate of bi2o3 is always limited by the chemical equilibrium constant and the reaction kinetics during cl i removal the newborn biocl nanosheets constantly accumulate on the surface of the undissolved bi2o3 preventing the dissolution of the inner bi2o3 and leading to the low efficiency and the high reagent dosage for the synthesized porous bi2o3 the enhanced dissolution rate is very likely to have positive effects on the removal process of cl i 3 2 removal of cl i from the zinc sulfate electrolyte after the structural feature and the solubility of uv bi2o3 being determined the effect of temperature reagent dosage reaction time h2so4 concentration and zn2 concentration on the removal efficiency of cl i and the residual concentration of bi3 was explored successively fig 3 shows the results for the cl i removal experiments under different temperature and reagent dosage it can be seen from fig 3a that no matter how long the uv irradiation time on bi2o3 was adopted cl i removal efficiency was always improved in small degree with the increase in temperature besides under the same temperature during cl i removal the bi2o3 being treated under uv for a longer time always shows higher efficiency signifying that the modification on bi2o3 using uv effectively improved the effect of cl i removal for the bi2o3 being treated under uv for 300 and 360 min the removal efficiency of cl i was above 90 at 20 to 80 c fig 3b shows that under the same temperature the residual concentration of bi3 exhibited no obvious variety rule with the change in uv irradiation time on bi2o3 the difference is that under the temperature of 20 40 60 and 80 c the average residual concentration of bi3 was respectively 0 55 0 98 1 57 and 2 24 mg l which indicates that with the increase in temperature the residual quantity of dissolved bi3 was also enhanced we speculated that this phenomenon was induced by the improved dissolution of biocl under higher temperature to verify this speculation the dissolution experiments of biocl in acidic conditions under different temperature were conducted and the results are shown in fig s6 it can be clearly seen that with the increase in the temperature from 20 to 80 c the concentration of bi3 dissolved from biocl was enhanced from 13 1 to 63 8 mg l with approximately 0 8 of biocl was dissolved ultimately at 120 min thus it can be determined that during the removal of cl i the enhancement in the bi3 concentration with the increase of temperature resulted from the improved dissolution of biocl considering that the temperature has rather little function in enhancing the removal efficiency of cl i to lower the energy consumption the possibility of secondary pollution by bi3 and the complexity of operation as far as possible the temperature for cl i removal was determined to be the room temperature as shown in fig 3c for the bi2o3 being irradiated for 0 30 60 120 180 and 240 min the increase in the mole ratio of dosed bi2o3 to cl i significantly helps the removal of cl i and under the mole ratio of dosed bi2o3 to cl i of 1 0 twice the stoichiometric value approximately 80 of cl i can be removed yet for the bi2o3 being irradiated for 300 and 360 min cl i removal efficiency was always above 90 even at the stoichiometric dosage of bi2o3 additionally it can be seen from fig 3d that with the mole ratio of dosed bi2o3 to cl i being increased from 0 5 to 1 0 the residual concentration of bi3 exhibited an extremely sharp rise from below 0 8 mg l to approximately 500 mg l to achieve the high removal efficiency of cl i under a low energy consumption of uv a low residual concentration of bi3 and a low cost of reagent the uv irradiation time on bi2o3 and the mole ratio of dosed bi2o3 to cl i were determined to be 300 min and 0 5 respectively the next experiments to explore the effect of reaction time h2so4 concentration and zn2 concentration on the removal of cl i were conducted under room temperature and the mole ratio of reagent to cl i of 0 5 as shown in fig 4a the removal efficiency of cl i was rapidly increased with the lapse of time and reached 90 1 at 60 min with the reaction time extended to 120 min the removal efficiency of cl i continued to be improved to 90 8 slowly along with the removal of cl i the residual concentration of bi3 shows a trend of rising first and then declining when the porous bi2o3 was added into the solution the concentration of bi3 rose fast to 923 mg l at 20 min because of the dissolution of bi2o3 under the acidic conditions after 20 min the reaction rate between cl i and bi3 began to exceed the dissolution rate of bi2o3 leading to the decline in the concentration of dissolved bi3 finally at 60 min the residual concentration of bi3 reached a rather value of 1 6 mg l considering the high removal efficiency of cl i and the low residual concentration of bi3 the reaction time for cl i removal from the prepared zinc sulfate electrolyte was determined to be 60 min for the removal of cl i from the prepared solution both the cl i removal efficiency and the residual concentration of bi3 rose slightly with the h2so4 concentration being increased from 100 to 150 g l the common h2so4 concentration of the zinc sulfate electrolyte fig 4b despite this the cl i removal efficiency and the residual concentration of bi3 were always above 90 and below 7 02 mg l respectively from fig 4c it can be seen that under the common zn2 concentration of 40 to 60 g l the cl i removal efficiency and the residual concentration of bi3 were above 90 and below 0 50 mg l respectively to explore the applicability of the synthesized reagent cl i removal experiments were also conducted in the actual zinc sulfate electrolyte under the parameters listed in table s2 as shown in fig 4d after 180 min of treatment 93 5 of cl i was effectively removed with the residual concentration of cl i and bi3 at 40 24 and 8 30 mg l respectively these results signify that the porous bi2o3 reagent is applicable to the removal of cl i from the common zinc sulfate electrolyte 3 3 characterizations on the products and regeneration of the reagent the characterization results in fig 5 show the crystal composition the element valence state and the surface morphology of the solid products for cl i removal using the fresh or uv treated bi2o3 as shown in the xrd spectra fig 5a obvious diffraction peaks appear at the characteristic 2 theta values for biocl of 11 98 24 10 25 86 33 45 and 36 54 no matter for the fresh or the uv treated bi2o3 further the unignored peak height at the 2 theta values of 27 54 27 90 and 32 79 the characteristic peaks for bi2o3 implies that a significant portion of fresh bi2o3 was residual after cl i removal in contrast the characteristic peak height of bi2o3 seems insignificant in the spectrum for the products generated from uv bi2o3 the sum xps spectra in fig 5b clearly show that no obvious differences between the diffraction peaks for the products generated from the fresh bi2o3 and those from uv bi2o3 demonstrating that the composition of the solid products for cl i removal was not affected by the treatment of uv on bi2o3 from the atomic percentage results table s3 it can be seen that the atomic percentage of cl element in the products for cl i removal using the fresh or uv treated bi2o3 was 29 58 and 35 24 respectively these xrd and xps data signify that the formation of biocl were effectively improved by means of uv irradiation on bi2o3 to observe the formation process of biocl sem characterization was employed and the results are shown in figs s5 and 5c no obvious difference can be seen in the particle size and shape between the products for the fresh bi2o3 and that for the uv bi2o3 fig s7 yet for the uv bi2o3 the biocl nanosheet products seem to be looser during the reaction where the fresh bi2o3 was employed as the reagent the lamellar biocl gradually accumulated to form the compact stratified structure first and then a kind of loose flower like surface was obtained according to fig 5c however for the reaction utilizing uv bi2o3 the loose flower like surface formed faster and the compact stratified state of the surface was not captured from these results it can be further verified that the transformation of bi2o3 to biocl was indeed accelerated by the modification of uv irradiation on bi2o3 additionally during the reaction utilizing uv bi2o3 the looser distribution of biocl nanosheets on the surface makes it simpler for cl i to contact with the inner undissolved bi2o3 which may help the removal of cl i to a certain extent after the removal of cl i the bi2o3 reagent was regenerated from biocl through the simple treatment by naoh solution according to our previous studies 28 the parameters shown in table s4 were applied to the regeneration experiments for bi2o3 where the regeneration efficiency reached 98 9 from the xrd spectrum fig s8 and the sem image fig s9 for the regenerated bi2o3 it can be inferred that the reagent possessed high purity as a result the cl i impurity in the zinc sulfate electrolyte was transferred into the concentrate containing high concentration of naoh and nacl to explore the effect of this regenerated bi2o3 on the removal of cl i we determined the removal efficiency of cl i using the regenerated bi2o3 to be 89 7 the slight decrease in the removal efficiency probably resulted from the mass loss of the reagent during filtration drying and grinding to ensure the effect for cl i removal in actual production it is necessary to add bi2o3 in moderation after several batches of treatment 3 4 mechanisms for cl i removal by the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs according to the above results uv introduced the rough surface in bi2o3 which helped the dissolution of bi2o3 and the formation of biocl in addition it has been found in our previous work that under uv a quantity of ovs will form in the crystal lattice of bi2o3 29 30 to confirm the formation of ovs in this study raman spectra for the fresh bi2o3 and uv bi2o3 were obtained and shown in fig s10 it is known that the raman characteristic peaks for bi2o3 exist at the range of 50 600 cm 1 31 33 consistent with the results shown in fig s10 the peaks at above 150 below 120 and 120 150 cm 1 were induced by the displacement of o element oo bi element bibi and bi o element bio respectively after the irradiation on bi2o3 peaks at 122 8 155 6 187 0 212 9 282 6 and 450 7 cm 1 respectively moved to 120 0 150 1 184 2 210 2 286 7 and 447 9 cm 1 considering that the existence of ovs will lead to the shifting of the peaks in raman spectra it was preliminarily proved that ovs were generated in the uv bi2o3 to further determine the quantity of ovs generated under uv o xps spectrum was also detected and the results are shown in fig s11 the sum spectrum of o for the uv bi2o3 was divided into two peaks at the binding energy b e of 531 3 and 529 6 ev which represented ovs and o element in the bi2o3 crystal lattice o bi2o3 respectively signifying the formation of ovs under uv additionally according to the xps results for the mole ratio of bi and o element and the peak splitting results the quantity of atomic percentage of bi o bi2o3 and ovs was calculated to be 63 6 15 1 and 21 3 respectively the special electrophilicity and adsorption characteristics of ovs may have some impact on the traditional reaction routes during cl i removal 34 35 in view of which the adsorption experiments of cl i by ovs were next conducted and the results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a in the reaction system containing merely cl i and uv bi2o3 there was a 33 6 reduction in the concentration of cl i however for the reaction system with the addition of fresh bi2o3 no obvious change in the cl i concentration was observed these results illustrate that some unclear function between bi2o3 and cl i arose because of the irradiation on bi2o3 by uv in fig 6b signals for ovs can be clearly seen in the esr spectrum for uv bi2o3 with a g value of 2 004 and yet the peaks for ovs disappear after cl i adsorption experiments additionally in the ftir spectra fig 6c peaks at the bi2o3 characteristic wavelength value of 428 43 508 00 and 1358 41 cm 1 36 were detected whether or not the modification and the adsorption experiments were conducted what is different new peaks at 2342 61 and 3547 32 cm 1 which were caused by the adsorption of a certain substance on bi2o3 37 appeared in the spectrum for the uv bi2o3 after cl i adsorption experiments in view of the results that the concentration of cl i was decreased and ovs were consumed it was inferred that the new peaks in the ftir spectra most likely resulted from the adsorption of cl i on ovs thus it was determined that the adsorption of cl i on ovs happened in the above experiments leading to the decrease in the cl i concentration of the solution and the disappearance of ovs in uv bi2o3 after it being determined that the adsorption of cl i on ovs indeed exists we explored the contribution of ovs adsorption to the removal of cl i in the aqueous conditions ovs can combine with o2 fast and disappear 34 35 therefore we utilized this property to mask ovs in uv bi2o3 and verify the masking effect through cl i adsorption experiments fig s12 shows that in the solution with the addition of uv bi2o3 after treatment in the di water no obvious decrease in the cl i concentration can be observed additionally no obvious signal was captured in the esr characterization after uv bi2o3 being treated using the di water fig s13 indicating that ovs were masked further it can be seen in fig 6d that with the masking of ovs the removal rate of cl i slightly declined with the removal efficiency of 81 6 at 60 min nevertheless as time went on a high efficiency exceeding 90 was still obtained at 120 min in the traditional method for cl i removal using the fresh bi2o3 the dissolution of bi2o3 the rate limiting step is much slower than the accumulation of biocl on the surface of bi2o3 as a result the inner bi2o3 cannot meet cl i and will be residual inducing the low conversion rate of biocl from bi2o3 however with the existing of ovs in uv bi2o3 cl i will enter the interior through the channels by the adsorption function and react with bi3 dissolved from the inner bi2o3 in other words thanks to the adsorption function of ovs on cl i it becomes simpler for the inner bi2o3 to react with cl i resulting in a measure of enhancement in the cl i removal rate the formation mechanism of porous surface and ovs can be described according to the photo corrosion phenomenon as follows 29 firstly bi2o3 was excited to produce holes h and electrons e under uv then the generated h diffused through the crystal the majority of which recombined with e the h reaching the surface of the semiconductors can be regarded as a monatomic oxygen ion os weakly bonded to the crystal lattice which is able to change its position next os combined with another one to produce oo 2 ionic group and the generated oo 2 will continue to combine with h leading to the release of o2 and the formation of ovs finally due to the oxidation of o2 by h the original chemical bonds between bi3 and o2 are destroyed leading to the release of bi3 and the dissolution of bi2o3 according to the above analysis on the experiment and characterization results the basic reasons for the enhancement of cl i removal efficiency by uv bi2o3 can be described to be the minor adsorption function of ovs on cl i and the major promotion function of the porous surface on bi2o3 dissolution according to fig 7 the removal mechanisms for cl i by the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs are as follows 1 the added uv bi2o3 with the porous surface is rapidly dissolved under acidic conditions first 2 then the massive dissolved bi3 continues to combine with cl i in the solution to generate biocl 3 simultaneously a portion of cl i enters the channels to be adsorbed on the surface of uv bi2o3 by ovs 4 the adsorbed cl i meets the newborn bi3 produced from the inner uv bi2o3 leading to the formation of biocl in general thanks to the formation of porous surface and ovs in bi2o3 under uv the transformation process of inner bi2o3 to biocl is improved leading to the significant enhancement in cl i removal efficiency 4 conclusion in this study an improved approach for the removal of cl i from the zinc sulfate electrolyte by the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs through adsorption and precipitation function was proposed for the common zinc sulfate electrolyte containing znso4 h2so4 and cl i a high efficiency above 90 was always obtained under the stoichiometric mole ratio of reagent to cl i under room temperature when the bi2o3 being irradiated for 300 min under uv was utilized 98 9 of the employed bi2o3 reagent was regenerated after the treatment using naoh solution and thus cl i was finally transferred from the zinc sulfate electrolyte to the nacl naoh concentrate with a rather small volume thanks to the improved bi2o3 dissolution caused by the porous surface and the adsorption of cl i on ovs the transformation process of inner bi2o3 to biocl is effectively improved leading to the significant enhancement in cl i removal efficiency and decrease in reagent dosage declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12458,during the zinc electrolysis the concentration of cl i impurity in the zinc sulfate electrolyte needs to be controlled below 100 mg l in the promising approach for cl i removal from the zinc sulfate electrolyte by bismuth oxide bi2o3 the low efficiency and high reagent dosage arising from the limited solubility of bi2o3 are the major technical bottleneck to be solved in this study an improved approach for the removal of cl i from zinc sulfate electrolyte by the porous bi2o3 rich in oxygen vacancies ovs was explored for the common zinc sulfate electrolyte a high efficiency above 90 was always obtained under the stoichiometric mole ratio of reagent to cl i under room temperature when the bi2o3 being irradiated for 300 min under ultraviolet uv was utilized 98 9 of the employed bi2o3 was regenerated after the treatment using sodium hydroxide naoh solution and thus cl i was finally transferred from the zinc sulfate electrolyte to the concentrate thanks to the improved bi2o3 dissolution caused by the porous surface and the adsorption of cl i on ovs the transformation process of inner bi2o3 to biocl can be effectively improved leading to the significant enhancement in cl i removal efficiency and decrease in reagent dosage graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chloride ion bismuth oxide oxygen vacancies porous surface ultraviolet data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction zinc a kind of raw material of aluminum copper and lead alloys can be widely applied in the die casting machinery manufacturing printing and battery industries 1 4 nowadays approximately 80 of zinc is produced by the hydrometallurgy technology all over the world for the high purity of the obtained zinc electrolysis is a necessary step in the zinc hydrometallurgy where zinc sulfate containing high concentration zn2 and so4 2 is a kind of common electrolyte 5 9 during the electrolysis of zinc sulfate electrolyte zinc will be deposited from zn2 on the cathode eq 1 and at the same time oh will be oxidized to produce o2 on the anode as shown in eq 2 finally leading to the purification of zinc 10 1 zn 2 2 e zn on the cathode 2 2 oh 4 e o 2 2 h on the anode in recent years owing to the promotion of the direct smelting technology using zinc oxide ore in low grade the concentration of the leachable cl i impurity was obviously enhanced in the zinc sulfate electrolyte the accumulation of cl i in the electrolyte will bring serious problems to the electrolysis process 11 13 for instance cl i can destroy the aluminum oxide film on the surface of cathode which can weakly bind with zinc leading to the difficulty in the zinc stripping 14 17 in addition cl i can cause pitting on the lead silver anode further resulting in the reduction and deposition of corrosion products on the cathode as well as the decline in the quality of the produced zinc 18 20 under the condition that cl i concentration exceeds 800 mg l cl2 will be generated on the anode and thus the operating conditions will be deteriorated and the energy consumption will be greatly increased 21 in view of this the concentration of cl i in the zinc sulfate electrolyte needs to be controlled below 100 mg l among the various removal methods of cl i under the acidic conditions copper slag precipitation approach is the most widely used one in this method the major components of copper slag cu0 and cu2 react with cl i to produce cuprous chloride cucl solid 22 24 for the enterprises which can produce the copper slag byproducts this method is effective and economic however for the enterprises lacking copper slag this method seems no longer suitable because of the high cost of reagent under these circumstances bismuth oxide bi2o3 which can be regenerated becomes the alternative reagent during the cl i removal using bi2o3 dissolved bi3 forms from bi2o3 under the function of h and combines with cl i to generate bismuth chloride bicl3 as shown in eqs 3 and 4 after the hydrolysis process bicl3 continues to be converted to bismuth oxychloride biocl eq 5 leading to the final removal of cl i 25 27 3 bi 2 o 3 6 h 2 bi 3 3 h 2 o 4 bi 3 3 cl i bicl 3 5 bicl 3 h 2 o biocl 2 hcl thanks to the renewability of reagent bi2o3 precipitation approach has attracted considerable attention despite this this method seems to be far from application because of the low efficiency and the high reagent dosage in our previous work ultraviolet uv was adopted for the improvement on the bi2o3 precipitation method with the participation of uv the cl i removal efficiency was significantly enhanced under the premise of the dosage of bi2o3 being at the stoichiometric value 28 however the continuous output of uv brings certain difficulties to the upgrading and management of the existing cl i removal processes making the above uv improved approach not applicable in actual production fortunately it was found that the structural and chemical properties of bi2o3 will change under the irradiation of uv 29 30 which may enhance the cl i removal effects in view of this we took uv as the modification means on bi2o3 and explored the cl i removal method by this new reagent without the addition of uv in this work a method of precipitation adsorption by the porous bi2o3 rich in oxygen vacancies ovs was developed for the removal of cl i from the zinc sulfate electrolyte firstly preparation parameters solubility and surface morphology of the porous bi2o3 reagent rich in ovs were explored then the removal efficiency of cl i and the residual concentration of bi3 under different temperature reagent dosage reaction time h2so4 concentration and zn2 concentration were determined successively further this method for the removal of cl i from the zinc sulfate electrolyte was applied in the expanding experiments to test the practicality finally characterizations on the solid products and masking experiments for the ovs were conducted to explore the mechanisms for the removal of cl i 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents and materials the bi2o3 sodium chloride nacl sodium hydroxide naoh potassium chloride kcl potassium nitrate kno3 potassium iodide

were all obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china the deionized di water produced from a milli q water purification system millipore usa was employed for the preparation of all samples the actual zinc sulfate electrolyte containing 115 g l of h2so4 57 3 g l of zn2 and 619 mg l of cl i was obtained from a zinc electrolysis plant in jiangsu province china 2 2 experimental system synthesis experiments of bi2o3 were conducted in a photochemical reactor shanghai bilang instrument manufacturing co ltd china equipped with the hg lamp 1000 w dissolution and regeneration experiments for bi2o3 were conducted in a cylindrical glass reactor 500 ml containing 500 ml of h2so4 solution and naoh solution respectively on the magnetic stirring apparatus zhengzhou hengyan instrument co ltd china removal and adsorption experiments for cl i were conducted in a cylindrical glass reactor 1 l containing 1 l of the prepared zinc sulfate electrolyte and the nacl solution under the magnetic stirring respectively 2 3 synthesis of the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs as shown in fig s1 the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs was prepared in the following steps 1 5 00 g of bi2o3 was added in the quartz tube containing 200 ml of the di water 2 the mixed solution was placed in the photochemical reactor with the lamp and the magnetic stirring on 3 then the solid products were obtained after filtration by vacuum filtration drying 12 h 70 c grinding and sieving 2 4 removal and adsorption experiments for cl i during the removal and adsorption experiments for cl i under different temperature reagent dosage reaction time h2so4 and zn2 concentrations 2 00 ml of sample was taken at certain time interval and was filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membrane for the next determination of cl i and bi3 concentrations additionally the solid products at different time interval were filtrated and dried for the next characterizations on the chemical composition and the surface morphology 2 5 dissolution and regeneration experiments of bi2o3 in the dissolution experiments of bi2o3 2 00 ml of sample was taken at certain time interval and was filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membrane for the next determination of bi3 concentration in addition after the regeneration experiments of bi2o3 by the naoh solution conducted under the certain concentration of naoh solution temperature reaction time and reagent dosage the regenerated bi2o3 was filtrated dried and weighed for the determination of the regeneration efficiency as well as the next characterizations on the chemical composition and the surface morphology 2 6 analytical methods for the determination of cl i concentration in the samples using the ion selective electrode ise method the electrode slope and the linearity range of the employed chloride ion selective electrode were determined first 25 ml of the standard cl i solution 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 and 10 5 m respectively was added with 5 00 ml of the total ion strength adjustment buffer tisab 256 g l ph 4 prepared by c6h5na3o7 2h2o and hno3 and was then diluted with the di water to a final volume of 50 ml next the electric potential values of these mixed solutions detected by the chloride ion selective electrode were recorded as a function of p cl i fig s2 shows that the electrode slope was 42 75 and the linearity range was 10 4 10 1 m the quantification procedures of cl i in the samples are as follows 1 1 00 ml of the sample was added with 5 00 ml of tisab in a 50 ml beaker 2 the mixed solution was diluted with the di water to a final volume of 50 ml 3 electrode was immersed in the diluted solution and the electric potential value was recorded as e1 after 1 min of stirring 4 1 00 ml of the standard cl i solution 0 05 m was added into the diluted solution and the final electric potential value was recorded as e2 after 1 min of stirring thus concentration of cl i in the final diluted solution was calculated according to eq 6 6 cl i 35 46 mg l 10 e 1 e 2 42 75 1 bi3 concentration was determined by an uv vis spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa the standard curve of bi3 was determined as follows and the results are shown in fig s3 1 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 ml of the standard bi3 solution 1000 μg ml was added with 5 ml of h2so4 50 10 ml of ki solution 200 g l and 10 ml of ch4n2s solution 100 g l in a 50 ml beaker respectively 2 the above mixed solution was diluted with the di water to a final volume of 50 ml 3 the absorbance was determined under 465 nm and recorded as a for the next determination of bi3 concentration of the samples the above procedures were also applicable under the premise that the standard bi3 solution was replaced with 0 5 ml of sample thus concentration of bi3 in the final diluted solution can be calculated according to eq 7 7 bi 3 a mg l 0 0496 crystal texture element composition and surface morphology of the reagents and the solid products were recorded by x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro mpd panalytical holland x ray photoelectron spectra xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa and scanning electron microscopy sem su 8020 hitachi japan respectively the specific surface area of the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs was detected by bet physical adsorption instrument autosorb iq quantachrome usa ovs and surface chemical bonds in bi2o3 were respectively determined by electron spin resonance esr e500 bruker elexsys germany fourier infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is 10 thermo fisher usa and raman spectroscopy dxr2xi thermo fisher usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs we prepared the bi2o3 reagent for cl i removal under different time of uv irradiation first as shown in fig s4 xrd peak shapes for the fresh bi2o3 and uv bi2o3 under irradiation time of 300 min are rather similar signifying that the crystal composition of bi2o3 was not obviously affected by uv the narrow broadening of the peaks implies that uv bi2o3 still possessed a well crystallized structure fig 1 shows the appearance and the surface morphology of bi2o3 reagent being irradiated by uv it can be clearly seen that with the increase in the irradiation time the color of bi2o3 shows a change from faint yellow to light gray at 180 min and finally to brown at 360 min further under the irradiation of uv the rather smooth surface of bi2o3 turned to be square lamellar with quite smooth edges after 120 min with the irradiation proceeding a paper scrap structure with holes and rough edges appeared at 240 min and finally a kind of irregular porous surface formed at 360 min in view of this it is speculated that the color change in appearance may fundamentally result from changes in the surface structure next we explored the effect of porous surface on the dissolubility of bi2o3 theoretically the surface roughening will lead to an increase in the specific surface area however from table s1 it can be seen that the specific surface area of bi2o3 being irradiated for 0 30 60 120 180 240 300 and 360 min is 0 6757 0 6778 0 5921 0 7077 0 7037 0 8029 0 5721 and 0 7029 m2 g respectively indicating that there is no obvious change in the specific surface area of bi2o3 under the irradiation of uv combined with the sem morphology results detected at 2000 times of magnification shown in fig s5 it can be determined that the rough surface helped the agglomeration phenomenon occur in the uv treated bi2o3 which can lead to the increase in the particle size of bi2o3 and the decrease in the specific surface area what is more it can also be seen that the particle size of fresh bi2o3 was heterogeneous in view of this the random specific surface area of uv bi2o3 was probably induced by the agglomeration and the heterogeneous particle size of bi2o3 fig 2 shows the results for bi2o3 dissolution experiments in the acidic solution containing the bi2o3 being irradiated for 0 30 60 120 180 240 300 and 360 min bi3 concentration reached 502 0 746 9 777 0 834 5 860 7 1027 2 1131 3 and 1137 4 mg l at 60 min respectively additionally for the bi2o3 being irradiated for 300 and 360 min bi3 concentration reached 1060 5 and 1067 6 mg l at merely 10 min thus it can be concluded that the modification on bi2o3 using uv significantly enhanced the dissolution rate and limit thanks to the formation of porous surface actually the dissolution rate of bi2o3 is always limited by the chemical equilibrium constant and the reaction kinetics during cl i removal the newborn biocl nanosheets constantly accumulate on the surface of the undissolved bi2o3 preventing the dissolution of the inner bi2o3 and leading to the low efficiency and the high reagent dosage for the synthesized porous bi2o3 the enhanced dissolution rate is very likely to have positive effects on the removal process of cl i 3 2 removal of cl i from the zinc sulfate electrolyte after the structural feature and the solubility of uv bi2o3 being determined the effect of temperature reagent dosage reaction time h2so4 concentration and zn2 concentration on the removal efficiency of cl i and the residual concentration of bi3 was explored successively fig 3 shows the results for the cl i removal experiments under different temperature and reagent dosage it can be seen from fig 3a that no matter how long the uv irradiation time on bi2o3 was adopted cl i removal efficiency was always improved in small degree with the increase in temperature besides under the same temperature during cl i removal the bi2o3 being treated under uv for a longer time always shows higher efficiency signifying that the modification on bi2o3 using uv effectively improved the effect of cl i removal for the bi2o3 being treated under uv for 300 and 360 min the removal efficiency of cl i was above 90 at 20 to 80 c fig 3b shows that under the same temperature the residual concentration of bi3 exhibited no obvious variety rule with the change in uv irradiation time on bi2o3 the difference is that under the temperature of 20 40 60 and 80 c the average residual concentration of bi3 was respectively 0 55 0 98 1 57 and 2 24 mg l which indicates that with the increase in temperature the residual quantity of dissolved bi3 was also enhanced we speculated that this phenomenon was induced by the improved dissolution of biocl under higher temperature to verify this speculation the dissolution experiments of biocl in acidic conditions under different temperature were conducted and the results are shown in fig s6 it can be clearly seen that with the increase in the temperature from 20 to 80 c the concentration of bi3 dissolved from biocl was enhanced from 13 1 to 63 8 mg l with approximately 0 8 of biocl was dissolved ultimately at 120 min thus it can be determined that during the removal of cl i the enhancement in the bi3 concentration with the increase of temperature resulted from the improved dissolution of biocl considering that the temperature has rather little function in enhancing the removal efficiency of cl i to lower the energy consumption the possibility of secondary pollution by bi3 and the complexity of operation as far as possible the temperature for cl i removal was determined to be the room temperature as shown in fig 3c for the bi2o3 being irradiated for 0 30 60 120 180 and 240 min the increase in the mole ratio of dosed bi2o3 to cl i significantly helps the removal of cl i and under the mole ratio of dosed bi2o3 to cl i of 1 0 twice the stoichiometric value approximately 80 of cl i can be removed yet for the bi2o3 being irradiated for 300 and 360 min cl i removal efficiency was always above 90 even at the stoichiometric dosage of bi2o3 additionally it can be seen from fig 3d that with the mole ratio of dosed bi2o3 to cl i being increased from 0 5 to 1 0 the residual concentration of bi3 exhibited an extremely sharp rise from below 0 8 mg l to approximately 500 mg l to achieve the high removal efficiency of cl i under a low energy consumption of uv a low residual concentration of bi3 and a low cost of reagent the uv irradiation time on bi2o3 and the mole ratio of dosed bi2o3 to cl i were determined to be 300 min and 0 5 respectively the next experiments to explore the effect of reaction time h2so4 concentration and zn2 concentration on the removal of cl i were conducted under room temperature and the mole ratio of reagent to cl i of 0 5 as shown in fig 4a the removal efficiency of cl i was rapidly increased with the lapse of time and reached 90 1 at 60 min with the reaction time extended to 120 min the removal efficiency of cl i continued to be improved to 90 8 slowly along with the removal of cl i the residual concentration of bi3 shows a trend of rising first and then declining when the porous bi2o3 was added into the solution the concentration of bi3 rose fast to 923 mg l at 20 min because of the dissolution of bi2o3 under the acidic conditions after 20 min the reaction rate between cl i and bi3 began to exceed the dissolution rate of bi2o3 leading to the decline in the concentration of dissolved bi3 finally at 60 min the residual concentration of bi3 reached a rather value of 1 6 mg l considering the high removal efficiency of cl i and the low residual concentration of bi3 the reaction time for cl i removal from the prepared zinc sulfate electrolyte was determined to be 60 min for the removal of cl i from the prepared solution both the cl i removal efficiency and the residual concentration of bi3 rose slightly with the h2so4 concentration being increased from 100 to 150 g l the common h2so4 concentration of the zinc sulfate electrolyte fig 4b despite this the cl i removal efficiency and the residual concentration of bi3 were always above 90 and below 7 02 mg l respectively from fig 4c it can be seen that under the common zn2 concentration of 40 to 60 g l the cl i removal efficiency and the residual concentration of bi3 were above 90 and below 0 50 mg l respectively to explore the applicability of the synthesized reagent cl i removal experiments were also conducted in the actual zinc sulfate electrolyte under the parameters listed in table s2 as shown in fig 4d after 180 min of treatment 93 5 of cl i was effectively removed with the residual concentration of cl i and bi3 at 40 24 and 8 30 mg l respectively these results signify that the porous bi2o3 reagent is applicable to the removal of cl i from the common zinc sulfate electrolyte 3 3 characterizations on the products and regeneration of the reagent the characterization results in fig 5 show the crystal composition the element valence state and the surface morphology of the solid products for cl i removal using the fresh or uv treated bi2o3 as shown in the xrd spectra fig 5a obvious diffraction peaks appear at the characteristic 2 theta values for biocl of 11 98 24 10 25 86 33 45 and 36 54 no matter for the fresh or the uv treated bi2o3 further the unignored peak height at the 2 theta values of 27 54 27 90 and 32 79 the characteristic peaks for bi2o3 implies that a significant portion of fresh bi2o3 was residual after cl i removal in contrast the characteristic peak height of bi2o3 seems insignificant in the spectrum for the products generated from uv bi2o3 the sum xps spectra in fig 5b clearly show that no obvious differences between the diffraction peaks for the products generated from the fresh bi2o3 and those from uv bi2o3 demonstrating that the composition of the solid products for cl i removal was not affected by the treatment of uv on bi2o3 from the atomic percentage results table s3 it can be seen that the atomic percentage of cl element in the products for cl i removal using the fresh or uv treated bi2o3 was 29 58 and 35 24 respectively these xrd and xps data signify that the formation of biocl were effectively improved by means of uv irradiation on bi2o3 to observe the formation process of biocl sem characterization was employed and the results are shown in figs s5 and 5c no obvious difference can be seen in the particle size and shape between the products for the fresh bi2o3 and that for the uv bi2o3 fig s7 yet for the uv bi2o3 the biocl nanosheet products seem to be looser during the reaction where the fresh bi2o3 was employed as the reagent the lamellar biocl gradually accumulated to form the compact stratified structure first and then a kind of loose flower like surface was obtained according to fig 5c however for the reaction utilizing uv bi2o3 the loose flower like surface formed faster and the compact stratified state of the surface was not captured from these results it can be further verified that the transformation of bi2o3 to biocl was indeed accelerated by the modification of uv irradiation on bi2o3 additionally during the reaction utilizing uv bi2o3 the looser distribution of biocl nanosheets on the surface makes it simpler for cl i to contact with the inner undissolved bi2o3 which may help the removal of cl i to a certain extent after the removal of cl i the bi2o3 reagent was regenerated from biocl through the simple treatment by naoh solution according to our previous studies 28 the parameters shown in table s4 were applied to the regeneration experiments for bi2o3 where the regeneration efficiency reached 98 9 from the xrd spectrum fig s8 and the sem image fig s9 for the regenerated bi2o3 it can be inferred that the reagent possessed high purity as a result the cl i impurity in the zinc sulfate electrolyte was transferred into the concentrate containing high concentration of naoh and nacl to explore the effect of this regenerated bi2o3 on the removal of cl i we determined the removal efficiency of cl i using the regenerated bi2o3 to be 89 7 the slight decrease in the removal efficiency probably resulted from the mass loss of the reagent during filtration drying and grinding to ensure the effect for cl i removal in actual production it is necessary to add bi2o3 in moderation after several batches of treatment 3 4 mechanisms for cl i removal by the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs according to the above results uv introduced the rough surface in bi2o3 which helped the dissolution of bi2o3 and the formation of biocl in addition it has been found in our previous work that under uv a quantity of ovs will form in the crystal lattice of bi2o3 29 30 to confirm the formation of ovs in this study raman spectra for the fresh bi2o3 and uv bi2o3 were obtained and shown in fig s10 it is known that the raman characteristic peaks for bi2o3 exist at the range of 50 600 cm 1 31 33 consistent with the results shown in fig s10 the peaks at above 150 below 120 and 120 150 cm 1 were induced by the displacement of o element oo bi element bibi and bi o element bio respectively after the irradiation on bi2o3 peaks at 122 8 155 6 187 0 212 9 282 6 and 450 7 cm 1 respectively moved to 120 0 150 1 184 2 210 2 286 7 and 447 9 cm 1 considering that the existence of ovs will lead to the shifting of the peaks in raman spectra it was preliminarily proved that ovs were generated in the uv bi2o3 to further determine the quantity of ovs generated under uv o xps spectrum was also detected and the results are shown in fig s11 the sum spectrum of o for the uv bi2o3 was divided into two peaks at the binding energy b e of 531 3 and 529 6 ev which represented ovs and o element in the bi2o3 crystal lattice o bi2o3 respectively signifying the formation of ovs under uv additionally according to the xps results for the mole ratio of bi and o element and the peak splitting results the quantity of atomic percentage of bi o bi2o3 and ovs was calculated to be 63 6 15 1 and 21 3 respectively the special electrophilicity and adsorption characteristics of ovs may have some impact on the traditional reaction routes during cl i removal 34 35 in view of which the adsorption experiments of cl i by ovs were next conducted and the results are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a in the reaction system containing merely cl i and uv bi2o3 there was a 33 6 reduction in the concentration of cl i however for the reaction system with the addition of fresh bi2o3 no obvious change in the cl i concentration was observed these results illustrate that some unclear function between bi2o3 and cl i arose because of the irradiation on bi2o3 by uv in fig 6b signals for ovs can be clearly seen in the esr spectrum for uv bi2o3 with a g value of 2 004 and yet the peaks for ovs disappear after cl i adsorption experiments additionally in the ftir spectra fig 6c peaks at the bi2o3 characteristic wavelength value of 428 43 508 00 and 1358 41 cm 1 36 were detected whether or not the modification and the adsorption experiments were conducted what is different new peaks at 2342 61 and 3547 32 cm 1 which were caused by the adsorption of a certain substance on bi2o3 37 appeared in the spectrum for the uv bi2o3 after cl i adsorption experiments in view of the results that the concentration of cl i was decreased and ovs were consumed it was inferred that the new peaks in the ftir spectra most likely resulted from the adsorption of cl i on ovs thus it was determined that the adsorption of cl i on ovs happened in the above experiments leading to the decrease in the cl i concentration of the solution and the disappearance of ovs in uv bi2o3 after it being determined that the adsorption of cl i on ovs indeed exists we explored the contribution of ovs adsorption to the removal of cl i in the aqueous conditions ovs can combine with o2 fast and disappear 34 35 therefore we utilized this property to mask ovs in uv bi2o3 and verify the masking effect through cl i adsorption experiments fig s12 shows that in the solution with the addition of uv bi2o3 after treatment in the di water no obvious decrease in the cl i concentration can be observed additionally no obvious signal was captured in the esr characterization after uv bi2o3 being treated using the di water fig s13 indicating that ovs were masked further it can be seen in fig 6d that with the masking of ovs the removal rate of cl i slightly declined with the removal efficiency of 81 6 at 60 min nevertheless as time went on a high efficiency exceeding 90 was still obtained at 120 min in the traditional method for cl i removal using the fresh bi2o3 the dissolution of bi2o3 the rate limiting step is much slower than the accumulation of biocl on the surface of bi2o3 as a result the inner bi2o3 cannot meet cl i and will be residual inducing the low conversion rate of biocl from bi2o3 however with the existing of ovs in uv bi2o3 cl i will enter the interior through the channels by the adsorption function and react with bi3 dissolved from the inner bi2o3 in other words thanks to the adsorption function of ovs on cl i it becomes simpler for the inner bi2o3 to react with cl i resulting in a measure of enhancement in the cl i removal rate the formation mechanism of porous surface and ovs can be described according to the photo corrosion phenomenon as follows 29 firstly bi2o3 was excited to produce holes h and electrons e under uv then the generated h diffused through the crystal the majority of which recombined with e the h reaching the surface of the semiconductors can be regarded as a monatomic oxygen ion os weakly bonded to the crystal lattice which is able to change its position next os combined with another one to produce oo 2 ionic group and the generated oo 2 will continue to combine with h leading to the release of o2 and the formation of ovs finally due to the oxidation of o2 by h the original chemical bonds between bi3 and o2 are destroyed leading to the release of bi3 and the dissolution of bi2o3 according to the above analysis on the experiment and characterization results the basic reasons for the enhancement of cl i removal efficiency by uv bi2o3 can be described to be the minor adsorption function of ovs on cl i and the major promotion function of the porous surface on bi2o3 dissolution according to fig 7 the removal mechanisms for cl i by the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs are as follows 1 the added uv bi2o3 with the porous surface is rapidly dissolved under acidic conditions first 2 then the massive dissolved bi3 continues to combine with cl i in the solution to generate biocl 3 simultaneously a portion of cl i enters the channels to be adsorbed on the surface of uv bi2o3 by ovs 4 the adsorbed cl i meets the newborn bi3 produced from the inner uv bi2o3 leading to the formation of biocl in general thanks to the formation of porous surface and ovs in bi2o3 under uv the transformation process of inner bi2o3 to biocl is improved leading to the significant enhancement in cl i removal efficiency 4 conclusion in this study an improved approach for the removal of cl i from the zinc sulfate electrolyte by the porous bi2o3 rich in ovs through adsorption and precipitation function was proposed for the common zinc sulfate electrolyte containing znso4 h2so4 and cl i a high efficiency above 90 was always obtained under the stoichiometric mole ratio of reagent to cl i under room temperature when the bi2o3 being irradiated for 300 min under uv was utilized 98 9 of the employed bi2o3 reagent was regenerated after the treatment using naoh solution and thus cl i was finally transferred from the zinc sulfate electrolyte to the nacl naoh concentrate with a rather small volume thanks to the improved bi2o3 dissolution caused by the porous surface and the adsorption of cl i on ovs the transformation process of inner bi2o3 to biocl is effectively improved leading to the significant enhancement in cl i removal efficiency and decrease in reagent dosage declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12459,a lab scale horizontal baffled subsurface flow constructed wetland hbsfcw packed with plant litter reed straws rs was built as a sustained release carbon source after which it was fed with synthetic wastewater that simulated the low c n ratios in tailwater from wastewater treatment plants wwtps the purpose of its operation was to explore the relationship between the nitrogen removal performance and variations in microbial community composition and propose an enhanced nitrogen removal strategy for constructed wetlands cws the results showed that plant carbon resources and influent sulphate can induce changes in redox conditions and organic matter concentrations at cws thereby influencing the microbial community composition and denitrification performance high throughput sequencing revealed the formation of richer microbial communities in additional rs units conventional heterotrophic denitrifying genera dechloromonas thauera and ignavibacterium sulphate reducing genera desulfobacter desulfobulbus and a sulphur based denitrification genus sulfurimonas were directly or indirectly affected by the addition of rs and became dominant in additional rs units this study suggests that plant litter in hbsfcws and sulphate from wwtp tailwater provide an opportunity to utilize sulphate as an electron acceptor and reduced sulphur as an electron donor for nitrate reduction thus driving mixotrophic denitrification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wwtp tailwater plant litter sulphate mixotrophic denitrification constructed wetland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction municipal wwtp tailwater refers to a secondary effluent with distinguishing features in water quality including a low carbon nitrogen c n ratios and high proportion of no3 n in the total nitrogen tn 1 advanced treatment of wwtp tailwater is essential for improving the quality of receiving water bodies and protecting the ecological environment 2 5 the main purpose of treating tailwater is to reduce the nitrogen including no3 and nh4 content and cod 6 in order to comply with the requirements for surface water quality chinese standard no gb3838 2002 the use of cws which are environmentally friendly economical and efficient 7 8 in the treatment of bulky but low contamination wwtp tailwater 9 11 for the purpose of protecting surface water has been widely popularized 12 however the tn removal performance mainly no3 n from municipal tailwater is poor in conventional cws owing to insufficient biodegradable carbon sources resulting in inadequate denitrification 13 15 hence research on how to enhance the efficiency of cws for nitrogen removal has been the focus of attention carbon sources as electron donors are important limiting factors in the conventional heterotrophic denitrification hd process of cws a reasonable carbon regulation strategy is considered effective for improving the nitrogen removal performance of cws traditional carbon sources acetate ethanol glucose etc 16 17 can improve the denitrification performance of wastewater with low c n ratios 18 19 however the hd process has limitations such as high operation costs risk of secondary pollution n2o emissions and excessive sludge production 3 4 20 21 moreover vegetation in cws multiply and wither after maturity 22 huge quantities of decaying plants or plant litter may cause considerable environmental damage in the absence of proper disposal methods 23 wetland plant litter was reported to be a promising carbon source for enhancing denitrification for no3 n removal from wastewater 24 with the advantages of low costs and being easily obtainable 25 27 reeds are one of the most common aquatic plants in cws 28 29 therefore rs have become the focus of research on carbon sources since their use as cw substrates may achieve sustainable utilization researchers have developed unconventional denitrification strategies e g autotrophic denitrification among them the sulphur autotrophic denitrification sad process is considered an efficient method to remove nitrogen containing pollutants 30 31 sad is often performed using autotrophic sulphur denitrifiers 32 33 and involves the use of sulphide s2 elemental sulphur s0 or thiosulfate s2o3 2 as elector donors to complete the reduction of nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 34 35 this technology was recently developed and is being progressively used in cws ma et al 36 reviewed the mechanisms of nitrogen removal in cws by using s0 s2 and s2o3 2 as electron donors wang et al 1 added s0 to the horizontal vertical horizontal and integrated vertical inflow in cws obtaining excellent nitrate removal efficiency 96 1 s0 which is reductive contributed significantly as an electron donor sun et al 37 used s2o3 2 which can also be reduced and obtained a denitrification efficiency of almost 100 pyrite has been reported to play an important role in promoting denitrification in cws 38 although the sad process is efficient it has some disadvantages such as so4 2 production generation of h and consumption of alkalinity therefore extensive studies have attempted to combine the sad and hd processes i e heterotrophic sulphur autotrophic denitrification hsad in cws to enhance nitrogen removal li et al 39 established a combined heterotrophic sulphur autotrophic denitrification system and achieved high performance no3 removal 98 9 as well as low concentration so4 2 accumulation 113 2 mg l huang et al 40 also attained complete removal 100 removal efficiency of cod nitrate and sulphide with 30 mg l no3 being present in the influent of a mixotrophic denitrification system sulphate a normal constituent of tap water systems 41 42 is always present in municipal wwtp tailwater when sulphate entered cw wastewater treatment systems it was notably impacted by the redox states of these systems 43 44 which led to the formation of reduced sulphur compounds furthermore the reduced sulphur may be re oxidized to sulphate under anoxic anaerobic conditions with nitrate being an electron acceptor 45 wang et al 46 used electrochemically integrated horizontal flow cws to achieve nitrogen removal from the wwtp effluent they found that sulphate could be reduced under higher current conditions and would resupply electrons for denitrification when electrons were deficient hence the dual reactions of sulphate reduction and re oxidation should be considered as control factors that may affect the nitrogen removal performance in wetland systems furthermore when sulphate in a system is reduced to sulphur containing electron donors it may also play a role in promoting the sad process sulphate reduction often requires sulphate reducing bacteria srb 47 48 which usually use organic matter as an electron donor 49 50 therefore researchers have supplied both sulphate and carbon to wetlands in order to construct hsad systems and successfully obtained excellent denitrification efficiency 45 plant litter which is a carbon resource packed in cws and sulphate in wwtp tailwater synergistically support the construction of hsad systems however knowledge regarding the microbial metabolism associated with sulphate transformation in cws remains limited and the resulting effect on the removal performance of nitrogen is still unknown the objectives of this study were to i investigate the relationships among c n and s bioconversion in a lab scale hbsfcw treatment system ii explore the relationship between nitrogen removal performance and microbial community composition variation using the high throughput 16s rrna sequencing method and functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax function prediction and iii verify the feasibility of hsad systems cooperatively driven by plant litter carbon sources and influent sulphate for the treatment of wwtp tailwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of lab scale hbsfcw systems a lab scale hbsfcw system was established in a rectangular plexiglass length 600 mm width 500 mm height 600 mm and then divided into two parallel units with one vertical baffle along the width one of them was used as the experimental unit in which substrates packed with rs w were used as a slow release carbon source and the other was used as the control unit n for both units three vertical baffles were placed along the length to form four parts with upward or downward flow conditions sequentially named zone1 zone4 along the direction of water flow in addition wzone1 wzone4 nzone1 nzone4 represent the zones in the w unit n unit the lengths of wzone2 and nzone2 were expanded 300 mm and the others were 100 mm with upward flow to create an enhanced anaerobic environment inside the units that promoted bacterial denitrification perforated tubes were used as inlets and outlets to ensure a uniform distribution of wastewater both the inlet and outlet were located at the top of the cw systems the outlets were placed lower than the inlets to create enhanced hydraulic conditions the arrangement of the cw systems is shown in fig 1 zeolite z quartz sand qs and volcanic rock vr were selected as mixed substrates ms with a volume of 6 3 1 for the treatment systems pebbles large to ensure uniform water distribution filled the inlet and outlet of each zone after cleaning the media with tap water they were first analysed for basic properties before cw system establishment as shown in table s1 pebbles 70 mm filled the bottom of nzone1 nzone4 and ms were packed in the middle of nzone1 nzone4 with heights of 380 430 380 and 430 mm respectively the top of nzone1 nzone2 was also filled pebbles heights of 100 50 100 and 100 mm respectively except wzone2 which had 200 mm rs replacing ms in the middle the other zones had the same filling as the n unit the two zone2 of both units were planted with reeds at a density of 20 plants m2 rs were purchased from a horticultural farm nanjing city jiangsu province china cut into 2 3 cm pieces soaked in a 1 naoh solution for approximately 1 day to break down the lignocellulose and improve biodegradability 25 51 rinsed with tap water until neutral dried and then stored in a dry vessel until they were used the chemical composition of rs in this study was 90 c 7 6 h 0 4 n and possibly 2 of other elements 2 2 synthetic wastewater in this study the quality of synthetic wastewater was simulated to that of secondary effluent from urban chinese wwtps the municipal tailwater comprised an organic matter that was difficult to degrade and exhibited low c n ratios while no3 n accounted for a relative high amount of tn synthetic wastewater was prepared using ch3coona kno3 nh4cl and kh2po4 to obtain the cod no3 n nh4 n and tp of the target pollutant table 1 and dechlorinated tap water containing so4 2 approximately 96 39 9 43 mg l was used as a solvent in all cases a trace element solution was added to the synthetic wastewater to allow microorganisms to grow faster it contained the

of the hbsfcw the experiments were conducted over 78 days from october 2021 to january 2022 at taiyuan university of technology the total operation period was segregated into five stages based on various c n ratios stage i was characterized by artificial sludge inoculation enrichment cultivation and the domestication of denitrifying bacteria the inoculated sludge obtained from an anaerobic tank in a neighbouring wwtp in shanxi china was first fed into the system and placed into contact with the media for seven days to trap as many microorganisms as possible from the sludge synthetic wastewater c n 3 5 was then pumped in the system until the end of stage i to promote microorganism growth and ensure biofilm formation the biofilm formation period lasted 32 days stage i the synthetic wastewater was introduced continuously into the units from a 50 l plastic feeding tank using peristaltic pumps bt300m yz1515x baoding chuang rui precision pump co ltd china at flow rates that ensured a hydraulic retention time of approximately 3 days throughout the experimental period the formal experiments stage ii began after one month of stable system growth during which time the dissimilatory bacterial communities adapted to the wetland micro environment during stage iii and stage iv the c n ratios of the influent synthetic wastewater were gradually decreased until they were similar to that of actual wwtp tailwater the inflow concentrations of organic matter were decreased to almost zero at stage v to initiate and enhance rs used as electron donors and as a slow release carbon source the controlling conditions and operating parameters of both hbsfcw units are presented in table 1 after the effluent tn had basically stabilized the next stage was initiated the subsequent stages were required to obtain a stable effluent quality at least three times before moving to the next stage at the end of the experiment biofilm samples from the cw systems were collected for further analysis 2 4 sampling and analysis the influent and effluent were sampled every three days in triplicates and then measured immediately in the laboratory all samples were filtered through acetate membranes with a pore size of 0 45 μm before measuring their tn tp no3 n nh4 n and no2 n contents according to methods described in water quality monitoring standards 54 cod was measured using a cod digestion instrument lh 9a beijing lianhua yongxing science and technology development co ltd china with reference to specific standards hj t399 china two sampling points were located in the zone2 of each unit w3 w4 n3 n4 and one was located in zone3 w5 n5 to compare the differences in the internal environment due to the presence of rs between the w and n units as shown in fig 1 when the treatment performance was basically stable after approximately one month samples from the sampling points were measured every three days to determine their dissolved oxygen do ph and oxidation reduction potential orp using a do meter jpbj 608 shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china standard ph meter fe28 cn mettler toledo usa and orp meter orp 1 hangzhou qiwei instrument china respectively matrix samples were collected after stage v the sampling sites existed in all zones along the influent direction six sites of the same height were established in each unit named w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 and w6 n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 and n6 fig 1 several reed root samples of equal quantities were collected from each unit named zw and zn all samples substrates and plants were polymerase chain reaction pcr amplified and high throughput sequenced and their potential metabolic functions were predicted 2 5 static adsorption and release experiment to monitor the ability of substrates for pollutants adsorption and release unused z qs vr ms and rs in triplicates were placed in beakers and soaked with synthetic wastewater that was changed every three days samples of synthetic wastewater and the water samples in the beaker containing unused z qs vr ms and rs were collected after soaking for three days subsequently the tn tp no3 n nh4 n and no2 n were measured as described in section 2 4 the difference in each water quality index before and after soaking was calculated to evaluate the release or adsorption capacity of each substrate 2 6 data analysis the pollutant removal efficiency was determined using the event mean concentration statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics 26 the results of t tests were analysed for both units and differences between variables rs were considered significant at a p value below 0 05 the sequencing results obtained were first quality controlled for the microbial analysis of matrices and plants shannon and simpson indices were calculated as representatives of α diversity the taxonomic information of the samples matrices and plants was presented using a barplot according to the relative abundance of different taxonomic names from each sample β diversity was analysed using principal co ordinates analysis pcoa and the bray curtis distance in the r programming software potential metabolic functions were annotated from the obtained bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna gene otu representative sequences using the faprotax www zoology ubc ca louca faprotax pipeline to identify potential microbial ecological functions in the cw systems 55 56 3 results 3 1 pollutant removal performance in the hbsfcw system under various influent c n ratios the dynamics of cod no3 n tn tp no2 n and nh4 n in the w and n units of the hbsfcw with various influent c n ratios for all stages are presented in fig 2 the effect of rs on the treatment performance differed between the w and n units 3 1 1 cod treatment performance of cw system in the w unit the effluent cod concentrations were almost always higher than those in the influent throughout the operation as shown in fig 2 a this indicated that rs can efficiently release carbon sources and may lead to a higher effluent cod however as the experiment progressed the increment of cod showed a decreasing trend and the cod concentration in the effluent decreased fig s1 this may indicate that the ability of rs to release carbon decreases over time for the n unit without the addition of rs during the startup period of stage i with c n ratios of 3 5 the cod removal efficiency 32 70 91 87 varied greatly fig 2 b however with the adaption of microorganism to the micro environmental conditions in the hbsfcw the cod removal performance showed an overall increasing trend this indicates that an increasing number of microorganisms leads to decreased organic loading as the influent cod concentration decreased its removal efficiency varied during stage ii and stage iii a gradual decreasing cod removal efficiency 87 05 30 48 was observed the interpretations of this phenomenon might be the drop in microbial population mainly heterotrophic microorganisms including conventional denitrifier due to the reduction of carbon sources from synthetic wastewater which leads to a reduction in cod consumption moreover during stage iv and stage v microorganisms adapted to the cod deficient conditions almost depleting the insufficient cod in the influent leading to a modest increase in cod removal overall the cod concentrations of the effluent from both units differed substantially the effluent concentration being lower than the influent concentration in the n unit shows the expected cod removal capability of the cw system the elevated effluent cod concentration in the w unit can be mainly explained by the incorporation of rs 3 1 2 tn and no3 treatment performance of cw system the properties of tn and no3 removal were also measured in the hbsfcw system during all experimental phases significant decreases in the effluent no3 n concentrations were observed inside both units when the cod was sufficient fig 2 c and d although the removal efficiency of no3 n was high for both units during the stage i the fluctuations were also large the maximum no3 n concentrations in the effluent water were generally low in both units in a range smaller than 2 68 mg l these results indicated that the addition of a carbon source from the influent of the n and w unit and rs of the w unit caused an onset of denitrification thus promoting the reduction of no3 n in the hbsfcw at stage ii c n 3 4 the removal efficiency of no3 n in the w unit remained high due to the influent cod released from rs in addition in the n unit the no3 n removal efficiency remained stable 82 14 100 00 on the one hand the influent carbon sources were still relatively sufficient and on the other hand it may be because many denitrifying microorganisms that had grown during the previous stage had not yet been significantly extinguished and were still able to perform relatively extensive denitrification thus maintaining the high removal 57 58 under conditions of influent carbon deficiency during stage iii v in the w unit the no3 n removal efficiency remained high with a decrease in the influent c n ratios deficient carbon sources should be complemented by a supply of rs the no3 n removal efficiency decreased rapidly to a low level in the n unit and was significantly lower than in the stages with sufficient carbon sources in the influent stage i and ii these results suggested that the effluent no3 n concentrations barely decreased in the absence of sufficient carbon sources and under these conditions denitrification in the control unit was suppressed the removal efficiency of the effluent tn concentration in each unit was largely similar to that of no3 n throughout the experimental period fig 2 e and f regarding the difference in the no3 n and tn treatment performance between the w and n units particularly the results of the stages with insufficient carbon sources in the influent stage iii iv the w unit exhibited markedly superior nitrogen removal capacities than the n unit the largest disparity occurred nine times and the gap continued widening these variations tn nitrate and cod suggest that the involvement of rs indeed played a role in the supply of carbon sources for microbial denitrification 3 1 3 nh4 n treatment performance of cw systems cws purify nh4 n in wastewater principally via nitrification the carbon sources liberated from rs should affect this step slightly therefore the nh4 n removal performance fluctuated and always remained low in both the w and n units fig s1 whereas the nh4 n concentration in the effluent of the w unit was significantly higher than that in the n unit throughout the operation the nh4 n concentration increased due to the release from rs and the addition of rs carbon sources may have promoted several other processes of nitrate conversion e g nitrate ammonification 59 60 as discussed below these two factors may have contributed to the higher nh4 concentration in the effluent 3 1 4 no2 n treatment performance of cw systems the no2 n variation is also worth noting fig s1 there was no significant cumulativeness of no2 n in the effluent of the w unit throughout the operation however there was an apparent accumulation in the effluent of the n unit when the c n ratios were lower the concentration difference in the no2 n accumulation between the two units reached a maximum of 0 43 mg l 0 47 and 0 04 mg l in the n and w unit respectively which occurred at a c n ratios of 1 2 the more successful denitrification nitrate to gaseous nitrogen caused by the rs cod or carbon sources probably accounts for this observation 3 1 5 tp treatment performance of cw systems the removal of tp in cws mainly occurs through the adsorption of the substrate and is partly contributed by vegetation therefore variations in the c n ratios have no significant effect on tp removal furthermore the matrix in hbsfcw systems is barely capable of adsorbing tp see the results of the static adsorption experiment for the w unit the effluent tp concentrations appeared higher than those in the influent water at the beginning of operation but they gradually stabilized over time fig s1 this may have been due to the release of elemental phosphorus from rs of the w unit at the initial stage of operation 61 in contrast no significant difference in the tp concentration was expected in the inlet and outlet of the n unit 3 2 distributions of the environmental factors in cw under various influent c n ratios 3 2 1 do and orp distribution fig s2 summarizes the distribution of do in both the w and n units under various influent c n ratios the distribution of do can affect microbial activities community structures and diversity and further influence the removal efficiencies of pollutants in pore water significantly the do level inside the w unit was always lower than that in the n unit in sample sites 3 4 and 5 in the w unit despite the same influent c n ratios from stage ii to stage v compared with the control unit carbon sources were always released by rs which prompted and enhanced organic matter degradation and denitrification and the consumption of do was higher than that in the control unit a lower do may indicate the establishment of a better anoxic anaerobic environment in the w unit this promotes the growth of denitrifiers and therefore further facilitates the removal of nitrates 62 63 similarly the nitrogen removal efficiency in the w unit was higher than that in the n unit which validates this explanation the do levels in both units displayed an increasing trend as the c n ratios decreased in the w unit the do tended to increase in zone2 w3 during stage ii and stage iii during which the oxygen concentrations were in the range of 0 5 1 0 mg l the do content remained largely unchanged with mean values of 0 8 mg l in stage iv and stage v similarly a gradual increase of do was also found in the control unit n3 these results showed that the organic carbon load decreased with a decrease in the influent c n ratios and would lead to less oxygen depletion which may account for the increasing tendency of the do concentration along the water flow direction in the w unit w4 w3 w5 the do content gradually decreased to a low level under the condition of higher oxygen consumption during organic matter degradation than under the condition of oxygen supply this may have been caused by the intense denitrification and degradation of cod in the major reaction zone2 and do consumption was consequently higher while accommodating for the growth demand of denitrifiers orp represents the change of redox potentials in cws and is a crucial environmental factor that controls organic matter biodegradation and nitrogen removal 19 the distribution of orp inside both units is showed in fig s3 generally the spatial and temporal variation trends of orp in the w and n units were consistent with the do the w unit had a considerably lower orp than the control unit indicating better anaerobic conditions this facilitated stronger denitrification both conventional and unconventional denitrification 64 which also coincided with better denitrification in the w unit the orp values in the w unit w3 were maintained at stable but critically low levels ranging from 270 to 150 mv even with decreasing c n ratios throughout the experiment this also enabled the w unit to sustain a strong denitrification capacity guaranteeing nitrate removal 3 2 2 ph distribution the distribution of the ph value in both units under various influent c n ratios is shown in fig s4 variations in ph during wastewater treatment depends not only on the influent ph but also on the nature and conversion characteristics of carbon nitrogen and sulphur in cws in the w unit due to the role of rs as a carbon source and electron donor the actual ratios of c n and cod so4 2 at each stage were higher than those in the control unit and other types of denitrifications e g biological processes integrating sulphate reduction and subsequent sulphur driven autotrophic denitrification in anaerobic micro environments may have occurred under conditions that reached the critical threshold required for the biological process based on the lower do and orp values in theory the ph increased due to the alkalinity produced by heterotrophic denitrification and sulphur driven autotrophic denitrification simultaneously released hydrogen ions h 36 57 58 as a result the ph was always lower in the w unit than in the control unit n except for w3 in the w unit there was a downward trend in the ph values of the other sampling points in both units at each stage throughout the operating period of stage ii heterotrophic denitrification was the main nitrogen removal pathway which increased the ph gradually in comparison when the influent c n ratios decreased from stage iii to stage v heterotrophic denitrification weakened while sulphur driven denitrification was enhanced by the ability to utilize more nitrate therefore a decrease in the ph value was observed due to autotrophic denitrification the changes in the ph value in w3 also confirmed this observation fig s4 3 3 static adsorption and release results for so4 2 and cod as shown in fig 3 the substrates neither released cod nor removed it by adsorption and they were recorded stable in a range of 70 95 mg l throughout the experiment meanwhile rs showed a considerable release capacity for cod and the mean cod value exhibited a sharp decreasing trend from 320 to 162 mg l on day 4 then it slightly decreased to 80 mg l on day 25 and the initial higher cod release also corresponded to the results of the cw system operation section 3 1 1 the coexistence of so4 2 and cod may affect tn removal thus the adsorption and release capacities of substrates and rs were examined concurrently fig 4 so4 2 was an inherent component in the solvent tap water of the synthetic wastewater and its concentration was always 96 39 9 43 mg l during the experimental period rs had nearly no release of so4 2 while the substrates released more sulphate during the initial stage but the amount gradually decreases and the highest so4 2 release capability was found for z thus a large portion of the so4 2 during the operation of the system likely originated from the influent 3 4 analysis of microbial communities 3 4 1 microbial community diversity regarding the reads acquired by sequencing table s2 and fig s5 the reads obtained from w and n units were similar in distribution over their lengths base pair number nevertheless the amount of reads at different lengths was always higher in the w unit than in the n unit as α diversity table s3 the average shannon and simpson index values were 5 765 and 0 0120 respectively in w unit while they were 5 566 and 0 0891 respectively in n unit indicating that the microbial community diversity in the w unit was higher than that in the n unit 65 66 and based on t test results they differed significantly p 0 05 regarding β diversity the outcomes of pcoa at the genus level based on bray curtis calculations are shown in fig s6 the majority of samples in the w unit differed significantly from those in the n unit except w1 in addition the microbial community composition of the plant samples differed remarkably from that of the matrix samples the same matrix was largely used in all zones of the n unit with no interference from external factors rs there were no significant differences between the samples among all zones the points are close to each other in fig s6 in the w unit nearly all zones were affected by varying degrees due to the addition of rs which produced variations among the samples w3 exhibited a remarkable difference in its microbial community compared to the other zone samples because of the immediate location of rs w3 is far from all the other points of the w unit in fig s6 w1 was the inlet zone of the system which was almost consistent with the environmental conditions of n1 thus the microbial community composition of w1 was also generally similar to that of n1 w1 and n1 are close to each other in fig s6 these differences indicate that the addition of rs to a certain part of the system not only affected a single region but also further affected the microbial community of the entire unit possibly by altering the containment of flow the α diversity index of the two plant samples zw and zn indicated that there were no significant differences in the microbial community among the plant samples of the two units and the results were also highly consistent with those obtained from the β diversity analysis pcoa this suggests that the incorporation of rs did not considerably influence the microbial community diversity of the plant samples even though it modified the surrounding environment of the plants w2 and n2 however the result derived from the pcoa analysis showed that the microbial community composition of the plant samples differed remarkably from that of the matrix samples this difference may have been due to the differences between the plants and the matrices themselves 3 4 2 microbial community structures to compare the microbial community structures in both units qualified reads were allocated to phyla fig 5 and genera proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the w and n units as well as in the plant samples with zw and zn being grouped as the z unit accounting for 41 42 and 43 of the total community composition respectively the second highest proportion was found for bacteroidetes reaching 16 16 and 20 in the w n and z units respectively and there was no significant differences in the two microbial populations between the w and n units either as a whole or at counterparts p 0 05 moreover some phyla encompassing bacteria capable of performing denitrification namely firmicutes actinobacteria and nitrospirae related to nitrification were also observed in the w 3 6 1 2 and 7 5 and n 1 7 0 8 and 6 2 units however only actinobacteria displayed a significant difference p 0 05 analysis at the genus level allowed for further verification of the bacterial community structures and the relative abundance of the microbial communities are shown in fig 6 the primary goal of this system was to achieve tn mainly nitrate removal through denitrification hence during the observation of dominant genera relative abundance 1 comparisons of the proportions of dominant genera with a denitrification function in the w and n units were the focus dechloromonas thauera and ignavibacterium were dominant in both the w 2 22 2 40 and 2 12 and n 1 24 1 80 and 2 30 units additionally the genus nitrospira which can perform complete ammonia oxidation comammox became remarkably dominant in both the w 7 46 and n 6 16 units but with no significant difference between the two units moreover because of the coexistence of sufficient cod and sulphate in the w unit the genus with sulphate reduction function named desulfobacter 1 47 and desulfobulbus 1 16 became dominant only in the w unit notably sulfurimonas became dominant only in the w unit with a relative abundance of 1 27 among the plant samples hydrogenophaga saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis and gemmobacter were all capable of performing denitrification they exhibited high relative abundances in zw and zn 1 this may be explained by the secretion of substances from plant roots that boost the growth of denitrifiers pseudomonas associated with phosphorus removal polyphosphorus was abundant in both zw 3 66 and zn 9 95 however it had almost no influence on the removal of tp perhaps due to its insufficient absolute amount 3 4 3 microbial function prediction faprotax was used to predict annotated functions of the identified microorganisms in both units table s4 as seen in fig 7 most of the dominant annotated microbial metabolic functions were nitrification and denitrification noticeably nitrate denitrification nitrite denitrification and nitrous oxide denitrification are three microbial metabolic functions that were not identified significantly between the w and n units p 0 05 this suggests that the three microbial metabolic functions were not the main drivers of the differences in nitrogen tn and no3 n removal between the two units furthermore the inclusion of rs caused no noticeable change in these metabolic functions sampling points 2 3 5 and 6 between the w and n units however the denitrification metabolic function of microorganisms was greater in the w unit than in the n unit indicating that denitrification was enhanced in the w unit which is consistent with the above mentioned tn and no3 n removal results denitrification was a crucial contributor to the difference in the nitrogen removal performance between the two units a pronounced increase was observed in the w unit especially in w2 w3 and w5 with the addition of rs suggesting that it enhanced denitrification metabolism furthermore dark sulfide oxidation is a metabolic function related to sulphur based denitrification 64 this metabolic function was stronger in the w unit than in the n unit which may be another key reason for the difference in the nitrogen nitrate removal performance between the w and n units and the significant difference between w2 w3 w5 and w6 which were affected by rs and n2 n3 n5 and n6 p 0 05 the reason for this difference as mentioned above may be that the sufficient carbon sources released from rs facilitated the reduction of sulphate in the wetland treatment system by srb and then the reduced sulphur provided the conditions electron donors required for sulphur based denitrification microbial nitrite respiration metabolism can consume nitrite which was higher in the w unit than in the n unit the nitrite concentration difference between the effluent of the two units n w was probably associated with this anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox function of microorganisms between the w and n units did not differ significantly p 0 05 even after the stream passed through the rs addition site i e after w3 and n3 this indicates that anammox occurred in both units to some extent and was not influenced by the addition of rs nitrite ammonification metabolism may be another metabolic pathway through which nitrite is consumed to generate ammonia nitrogen this metabolic function occurred considerably more in the w unit than in the n unit p 0 05 and may have reduced the accumulation of nitrite in the w unit which was less than that in the n unit while simultaneously making the treatment efficiency of ammonia in the w unit inferior to that of the n unit the observed marked increase in w2 3 and 5 may indicate that the addition of rs promoted this metabolic function other metabolic functions such as respiration of sulphur compounds arsenate respiration knallga bacteria manganese oxidation manganese respiration hydrocarbon degradation dark iron oxidation iron respiration and chemoheterotrophy etc were notably present in both the w and n units but without significant differences presumably these metabolic functions are common to the maintenance of microbial life activities but the relationship between these metabolic functions and nitrogen removal was not clearly established 4 discussion 4 1 microbial nitrogen removal pathways cws are complicated ecosystems whose environmental parameters i e do orp and ph types and wastewater properties significantly impact microbial species and abundance thereby affecting pollutant removal efficiency in this study the hbsfcw type and continuous wastewater feeding mode created lower do w3 0 31 1 02 mg l and orp w3 262 143 mv conditions in the w unit thus creating a suitable habitat for anaerobic bacterial growth furthermore the influent wastewater was characterized by low c n ratios nitrogen entered the treatment units mainly in the form of nitrate which was a key factor affecting denitrification and making the abundance of conventional anaerobic heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria e g thauera ignavibacterium silanimonas and dechloromonas the highest in the cws this is consistent with the result of hong et al 67 who stated that anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification may occur under low do levels indicating that anaerobic denitrifiers perform no3 reduction and form conventional denitrification pathways with anaerobic denitrification the nitrous oxide denitrification results from the metabolism function prediction indicated that nitrate was mostly removed as nitrogenous gases as evidenced by the low nitrogenous compound concentration in the effluent this explanation was also confirmed by the high throughput 16s rrna sequencing results moreover average removal efficiencies of 67 5 tn and 71 1 no3 n were achieved in the n unit which was characterized by a deficiency of both organic carbon and elector donors that were insufficient to achieve a higher nitrogen removal efficiency through conventional heterotrophic denitrification in contrast higher removal efficiencies 87 0 of tn and no3 n were achieved in the w unit accordingly alternative nitrogen removal pathways such as autotrophic denitrification and anammox may have occurred in the w unit rs are plant litter and can be reused in cws during their decomposition lignocelluloses are hydrolysed and fermented into liable plant carbon sources 68 rs were not only organic carbon suppliers but also attachment sites for denitrifying bacteria in the hbsfcw system moreover sulphate reduction caused by srb occurred in the sewage treatment system and previous studies have revealed that bacterial sulphate reduction is important during high strength sulphate wastewater treatment in cws 69 in this study sulphate from the synthetic wastewater and small amounts released from substrates might have been reduced by srb under anoxic anaerobic conditions wherein organic carbon acted as an electron donor this conclusion is established based on the competition with other heterotrophic bacteria desulfobacter and desulfobulbus are two srb genera whose abundances were high in the w unit and their presence indicated that sulphate reduction occurred in the cws packed with rs additionally dark sulfide oxidation was a metabolic function associated with this process after sulphate reduction reduced sulphur was produced both nitrate and oxygen were present in the influent wastewater suggesting that reduced sulphur would be re oxidized by microbial or chemical pathways previous studies have revealed that both anoxic anaerobic and aerobic oxidation contributed to microbial sulphur oxidation however chemical oxidation was much slower than microbial sulphur oxidation 70 if oxygen content was limited in the pore water of the cws most of the reduced sulphur would be oxidized through anaerobic anoxic oxidation the do concentration was limited in the w unit 0 8 mg l in this study suggesting that anoxic anaerobic microbial oxidation of reduced sulphur to sulphate coupled with nitrate reduction could have been another nitrogen removal pathway in the wetland in this study sulphide oxidizing bacteria sob sulfurimonas sulfuricurvum and sulfurospirillum were abundant in the experimental unit indicating that re oxidation of reduced sulphur had occurred furthermore they could use no3 n to oxidize reduced sulphur and couple denitrification with sulphur oxidation in the litter added wetland treatment system indicating that the sob played important roles in both no3 n reduction and sulphur oxidation therefore adding plant litter rs greatly drove the influent sulphate reduction because of the continuous input of plant carbon sources and no3 n was the electron acceptor that stimulated reduced sulphur re oxidation to sulphate in the cws consequently the no3 n and tn removal rates exceeded 90 due to the synergistic effect of sulphur based autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification as well as other biological functions in the cw treatment unit meanwhile alternative routes such as the anammox pathway which promotes the removal of ammonia and nitrate seem to have had a low contribution to nitrogen removal in the treatment unit as evidenced by the relative low abundance contributions by aquatic plant root zone denitrifying bacteria saccharibacterua genera incertae sedis hydvogenophaga and gemmobacter as well as phosphorus polymerizing bacteria pesudomonus were also found but they did not constitute an important nitrogen removal mechanism there was relatively intense nitrite ammonification in the w unit causing some of the nitrite formed by nitrification to be converted to ammonia because of the low influent ammonia concentrations ammonia oxidizing bacteria archaea and nitrite oxidizing bacteria were not detected in the hbsfcw treatment unit and most of the ammonia oxidation likely occurred because of the detected nitrospira previous studies have reported that a higher abundance of comammox nitrospira may be found in relatively low strength ammonia environments such as tertiary wastewater treatment systems and drinking water treatment systems fig 8 shows the overall nitrogen removal pathways in the studied litter added hbsfcw treatment system plant litter rs was chosen and packed with the combined substrates in the hbsfcw treatment unit to allow different kinds of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to co exist such as anaerobic denitrifying bacteria anammox comammox srb and sob while enabling the synergistic utilization of microbial metabolisms thus a high removal efficiency of nitrogen pollutants was achieved however the synergistic effect of carbon and sulphate bioconversions on mixotrophic denitrification in the cws for the treatment of wwtp tailwater should be understood in more detail future research should therefore focus on investigating actual hd and sad proportions relative to those of nitrogen removal as well as sulphur related transformation processes 4 2 implications for wwtp wastewater treatment rs were reused as sustained release carbon sources and electron donors to facilitate sulphur based mixotrophic denitrification which further enhanced the nitrogen removal performance of wwtp tailwater in the hbsfcw according to the low influent c n ratios deficient carbon sources which are insufficient for complete hd the carbon sources released from the plant litter would drive the influent sulphate reduction process and transfer the electrons to sulphide or elemental sulphur furthermore sad occurred in the treatment unit meanwhile cooperative hsad was achieved in one hbsfcw therefore a promising efficient low cost treatment technology which would decrease the demand of external organic carbon and sulphur sources in cws and lower the construction and operation costs was proposed to enhance nitrogen removal in treating low c n ratios wwtp secondary effluent or tertiary wastewater treatment especially for the further purification condition in which nitrogen removal by wwtp followed by cws in the way of enhancing nitrogen removal therefore nitrogen in effluent can meet the designed water index requirements to improve the ecological environmental quality of water furthermore the litter added hbsfcw used in the ecological treatment process for wwtp tailwater could perform the dual functions of municipal sewage deep purification and ecological rehabilitation 5 conclusions this study has found that carbon sources released from plant litter rs and influent sulphate cooperatively drove hd and sad processes and that mixotrophic denitrification simultaneously occurred in one hbsfcw thereby enhancing the nitrogen removal performance of low c n ratios wwtp tailwater this result was based on a comparative analysis on the richness and diversity of the microbial community as well as functional prediction results the following results were obtained 1 a profitable anaerobic anoxic environment for the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria could be created under the condition that plant litter rs was packed with substrates in the hbsfcw system 2 the microbial community diversity and richness in the litter added hbsfcw system responded positively to the addition of plant litter rs and influent sulphate which are beneficial for enhancing nitrogen removal 3 cooperative hd and sad were important nitrogen removal pathways in the litter added hbsfcw system 4 sulphate reduction and reduced sulphur re oxidation processes could occur in the hbsfcw treatment unit sequentially which can use nitrate to oxidize reduced sulphur and couple the denitrification to sulphur oxidation 5 the nitrogen removal performance of the litter added hbsfcw system is preferable for treating wwtp tailwater and municipal tertiary wastewater which are characterized by low c n ratios credit authorship contribution statement chunhao

12459,a lab scale horizontal baffled subsurface flow constructed wetland hbsfcw packed with plant litter reed straws rs was built as a sustained release carbon source after which it was fed with synthetic wastewater that simulated the low c n ratios in tailwater from wastewater treatment plants wwtps the purpose of its operation was to explore the relationship between the nitrogen removal performance and variations in microbial community composition and propose an enhanced nitrogen removal strategy for constructed wetlands cws the results showed that plant carbon resources and influent sulphate can induce changes in redox conditions and organic matter concentrations at cws thereby influencing the microbial community composition and denitrification performance high throughput sequencing revealed the formation of richer microbial communities in additional rs units conventional heterotrophic denitrifying genera dechloromonas thauera and ignavibacterium sulphate reducing genera desulfobacter desulfobulbus and a sulphur based denitrification genus sulfurimonas were directly or indirectly affected by the addition of rs and became dominant in additional rs units this study suggests that plant litter in hbsfcws and sulphate from wwtp tailwater provide an opportunity to utilize sulphate as an electron acceptor and reduced sulphur as an electron donor for nitrate reduction thus driving mixotrophic denitrification graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wwtp tailwater plant litter sulphate mixotrophic denitrification constructed wetland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction municipal wwtp tailwater refers to a secondary effluent with distinguishing features in water quality including a low carbon nitrogen c n ratios and high proportion of no3 n in the total nitrogen tn 1 advanced treatment of wwtp tailwater is essential for improving the quality of receiving water bodies and protecting the ecological environment 2 5 the main purpose of treating tailwater is to reduce the nitrogen including no3 and nh4 content and cod 6 in order to comply with the requirements for surface water quality chinese standard no gb3838 2002 the use of cws which are environmentally friendly economical and efficient 7 8 in the treatment of bulky but low contamination wwtp tailwater 9 11 for the purpose of protecting surface water has been widely popularized 12 however the tn removal performance mainly no3 n from municipal tailwater is poor in conventional cws owing to insufficient biodegradable carbon sources resulting in inadequate denitrification 13 15 hence research on how to enhance the efficiency of cws for nitrogen removal has been the focus of attention carbon sources as electron donors are important limiting factors in the conventional heterotrophic denitrification hd process of cws a reasonable carbon regulation strategy is considered effective for improving the nitrogen removal performance of cws traditional carbon sources acetate ethanol glucose etc 16 17 can improve the denitrification performance of wastewater with low c n ratios 18 19 however the hd process has limitations such as high operation costs risk of secondary pollution n2o emissions and excessive sludge production 3 4 20 21 moreover vegetation in cws multiply and wither after maturity 22 huge quantities of decaying plants or plant litter may cause considerable environmental damage in the absence of proper disposal methods 23 wetland plant litter was reported to be a promising carbon source for enhancing denitrification for no3 n removal from wastewater 24 with the advantages of low costs and being easily obtainable 25 27 reeds are one of the most common aquatic plants in cws 28 29 therefore rs have become the focus of research on carbon sources since their use as cw substrates may achieve sustainable utilization researchers have developed unconventional denitrification strategies e g autotrophic denitrification among them the sulphur autotrophic denitrification sad process is considered an efficient method to remove nitrogen containing pollutants 30 31 sad is often performed using autotrophic sulphur denitrifiers 32 33 and involves the use of sulphide s2 elemental sulphur s0 or thiosulfate s2o3 2 as elector donors to complete the reduction of nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 34 35 this technology was recently developed and is being progressively used in cws ma et al 36 reviewed the mechanisms of nitrogen removal in cws by using s0 s2 and s2o3 2 as electron donors wang et al 1 added s0 to the horizontal vertical horizontal and integrated vertical inflow in cws obtaining excellent nitrate removal efficiency 96 1 s0 which is reductive contributed significantly as an electron donor sun et al 37 used s2o3 2 which can also be reduced and obtained a denitrification efficiency of almost 100 pyrite has been reported to play an important role in promoting denitrification in cws 38 although the sad process is efficient it has some disadvantages such as so4 2 production generation of h and consumption of alkalinity therefore extensive studies have attempted to combine the sad and hd processes i e heterotrophic sulphur autotrophic denitrification hsad in cws to enhance nitrogen removal li et al 39 established a combined heterotrophic sulphur autotrophic denitrification system and achieved high performance no3 removal 98 9 as well as low concentration so4 2 accumulation 113 2 mg l huang et al 40 also attained complete removal 100 removal efficiency of cod nitrate and sulphide with 30 mg l no3 being present in the influent of a mixotrophic denitrification system sulphate a normal constituent of tap water systems 41 42 is always present in municipal wwtp tailwater when sulphate entered cw wastewater treatment systems it was notably impacted by the redox states of these systems 43 44 which led to the formation of reduced sulphur compounds furthermore the reduced sulphur may be re oxidized to sulphate under anoxic anaerobic conditions with nitrate being an electron acceptor 45 wang et al 46 used electrochemically integrated horizontal flow cws to achieve nitrogen removal from the wwtp effluent they found that sulphate could be reduced under higher current conditions and would resupply electrons for denitrification when electrons were deficient hence the dual reactions of sulphate reduction and re oxidation should be considered as control factors that may affect the nitrogen removal performance in wetland systems furthermore when sulphate in a system is reduced to sulphur containing electron donors it may also play a role in promoting the sad process sulphate reduction often requires sulphate reducing bacteria srb 47 48 which usually use organic matter as an electron donor 49 50 therefore researchers have supplied both sulphate and carbon to wetlands in order to construct hsad systems and successfully obtained excellent denitrification efficiency 45 plant litter which is a carbon resource packed in cws and sulphate in wwtp tailwater synergistically support the construction of hsad systems however knowledge regarding the microbial metabolism associated with sulphate transformation in cws remains limited and the resulting effect on the removal performance of nitrogen is still unknown the objectives of this study were to i investigate the relationships among c n and s bioconversion in a lab scale hbsfcw treatment system ii explore the relationship between nitrogen removal performance and microbial community composition variation using the high throughput 16s rrna sequencing method and functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax function prediction and iii verify the feasibility of hsad systems cooperatively driven by plant litter carbon sources and influent sulphate for the treatment of wwtp tailwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 design of lab scale hbsfcw systems a lab scale hbsfcw system was established in a rectangular plexiglass length 600 mm width 500 mm height 600 mm and then divided into two parallel units with one vertical baffle along the width one of them was used as the experimental unit in which substrates packed with rs w were used as a slow release carbon source and the other was used as the control unit n for both units three vertical baffles were placed along the length to form four parts with upward or downward flow conditions sequentially named zone1 zone4 along the direction of water flow in addition wzone1 wzone4 nzone1 nzone4 represent the zones in the w unit n unit the lengths of wzone2 and nzone2 were expanded 300 mm and the others were 100 mm with upward flow to create an enhanced anaerobic environment inside the units that promoted bacterial denitrification perforated tubes were used as inlets and outlets to ensure a uniform distribution of wastewater both the inlet and outlet were located at the top of the cw systems the outlets were placed lower than the inlets to create enhanced hydraulic conditions the arrangement of the cw systems is shown in fig 1 zeolite z quartz sand qs and volcanic rock vr were selected as mixed substrates ms with a volume of 6 3 1 for the treatment systems pebbles large to ensure uniform water distribution filled the inlet and outlet of each zone after cleaning the media with tap water they were first analysed for basic properties before cw system establishment as shown in table s1 pebbles 70 mm filled the bottom of nzone1 nzone4 and ms were packed in the middle of nzone1 nzone4 with heights of 380 430 380 and 430 mm respectively the top of nzone1 nzone2 was also filled pebbles heights of 100 50 100 and 100 mm respectively except wzone2 which had 200 mm rs replacing ms in the middle the other zones had the same filling as the n unit the two zone2 of both units were planted with reeds at a density of 20 plants m2 rs were purchased from a horticultural farm nanjing city jiangsu province china cut into 2 3 cm pieces soaked in a 1 naoh solution for approximately 1 day to break down the lignocellulose and improve biodegradability 25 51 rinsed with tap water until neutral dried and then stored in a dry vessel until they were used the chemical composition of rs in this study was 90 c 7 6 h 0 4 n and possibly 2 of other elements 2 2 synthetic wastewater in this study the quality of synthetic wastewater was simulated to that of secondary effluent from urban chinese wwtps the municipal tailwater comprised an organic matter that was difficult to degrade and exhibited low c n ratios while no3 n accounted for a relative high amount of tn synthetic wastewater was prepared using ch3coona kno3 nh4cl and kh2po4 to obtain the cod no3 n nh4 n and tp of the target pollutant table 1 and dechlorinated tap water containing so4 2 approximately 96 39 9 43 mg l was used as a solvent in all cases a trace element solution was added to the synthetic wastewater to allow microorganisms to grow faster it contained the

of the hbsfcw the experiments were conducted over 78 days from october 2021 to january 2022 at taiyuan university of technology the total operation period was segregated into five stages based on various c n ratios stage i was characterized by artificial sludge inoculation enrichment cultivation and the domestication of denitrifying bacteria the inoculated sludge obtained from an anaerobic tank in a neighbouring wwtp in shanxi china was first fed into the system and placed into contact with the media for seven days to trap as many microorganisms as possible from the sludge synthetic wastewater c n 3 5 was then pumped in the system until the end of stage i to promote microorganism growth and ensure biofilm formation the biofilm formation period lasted 32 days stage i the synthetic wastewater was introduced continuously into the units from a 50 l plastic feeding tank using peristaltic pumps bt300m yz1515x baoding chuang rui precision pump co ltd china at flow rates that ensured a hydraulic retention time of approximately 3 days throughout the experimental period the formal experiments stage ii began after one month of stable system growth during which time the dissimilatory bacterial communities adapted to the wetland micro environment during stage iii and stage iv the c n ratios of the influent synthetic wastewater were gradually decreased until they were similar to that of actual wwtp tailwater the inflow concentrations of organic matter were decreased to almost zero at stage v to initiate and enhance rs used as electron donors and as a slow release carbon source the controlling conditions and operating parameters of both hbsfcw units are presented in table 1 after the effluent tn had basically stabilized the next stage was initiated the subsequent stages were required to obtain a stable effluent quality at least three times before moving to the next stage at the end of the experiment biofilm samples from the cw systems were collected for further analysis 2 4 sampling and analysis the influent and effluent were sampled every three days in triplicates and then measured immediately in the laboratory all samples were filtered through acetate membranes with a pore size of 0 45 μm before measuring their tn tp no3 n nh4 n and no2 n contents according to methods described in water quality monitoring standards 54 cod was measured using a cod digestion instrument lh 9a beijing lianhua yongxing science and technology development co ltd china with reference to specific standards hj t399 china two sampling points were located in the zone2 of each unit w3 w4 n3 n4 and one was located in zone3 w5 n5 to compare the differences in the internal environment due to the presence of rs between the w and n units as shown in fig 1 when the treatment performance was basically stable after approximately one month samples from the sampling points were measured every three days to determine their dissolved oxygen do ph and oxidation reduction potential orp using a do meter jpbj 608 shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china standard ph meter fe28 cn mettler toledo usa and orp meter orp 1 hangzhou qiwei instrument china respectively matrix samples were collected after stage v the sampling sites existed in all zones along the influent direction six sites of the same height were established in each unit named w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 and w6 n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 and n6 fig 1 several reed root samples of equal quantities were collected from each unit named zw and zn all samples substrates and plants were polymerase chain reaction pcr amplified and high throughput sequenced and their potential metabolic functions were predicted 2 5 static adsorption and release experiment to monitor the ability of substrates for pollutants adsorption and release unused z qs vr ms and rs in triplicates were placed in beakers and soaked with synthetic wastewater that was changed every three days samples of synthetic wastewater and the water samples in the beaker containing unused z qs vr ms and rs were collected after soaking for three days subsequently the tn tp no3 n nh4 n and no2 n were measured as described in section 2 4 the difference in each water quality index before and after soaking was calculated to evaluate the release or adsorption capacity of each substrate 2 6 data analysis the pollutant removal efficiency was determined using the event mean concentration statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics 26 the results of t tests were analysed for both units and differences between variables rs were considered significant at a p value below 0 05 the sequencing results obtained were first quality controlled for the microbial analysis of matrices and plants shannon and simpson indices were calculated as representatives of α diversity the taxonomic information of the samples matrices and plants was presented using a barplot according to the relative abundance of different taxonomic names from each sample β diversity was analysed using principal co ordinates analysis pcoa and the bray curtis distance in the r programming software potential metabolic functions were annotated from the obtained bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna gene otu representative sequences using the faprotax www zoology ubc ca louca faprotax pipeline to identify potential microbial ecological functions in the cw systems 55 56 3 results 3 1 pollutant removal performance in the hbsfcw system under various influent c n ratios the dynamics of cod no3 n tn tp no2 n and nh4 n in the w and n units of the hbsfcw with various influent c n ratios for all stages are presented in fig 2 the effect of rs on the treatment performance differed between the w and n units 3 1 1 cod treatment performance of cw system in the w unit the effluent cod concentrations were almost always higher than those in the influent throughout the operation as shown in fig 2 a this indicated that rs can efficiently release carbon sources and may lead to a higher effluent cod however as the experiment progressed the increment of cod showed a decreasing trend and the cod concentration in the effluent decreased fig s1 this may indicate that the ability of rs to release carbon decreases over time for the n unit without the addition of rs during the startup period of stage i with c n ratios of 3 5 the cod removal efficiency 32 70 91 87 varied greatly fig 2 b however with the adaption of microorganism to the micro environmental conditions in the hbsfcw the cod removal performance showed an overall increasing trend this indicates that an increasing number of microorganisms leads to decreased organic loading as the influent cod concentration decreased its removal efficiency varied during stage ii and stage iii a gradual decreasing cod removal efficiency 87 05 30 48 was observed the interpretations of this phenomenon might be the drop in microbial population mainly heterotrophic microorganisms including conventional denitrifier due to the reduction of carbon sources from synthetic wastewater which leads to a reduction in cod consumption moreover during stage iv and stage v microorganisms adapted to the cod deficient conditions almost depleting the insufficient cod in the influent leading to a modest increase in cod removal overall the cod concentrations of the effluent from both units differed substantially the effluent concentration being lower than the influent concentration in the n unit shows the expected cod removal capability of the cw system the elevated effluent cod concentration in the w unit can be mainly explained by the incorporation of rs 3 1 2 tn and no3 treatment performance of cw system the properties of tn and no3 removal were also measured in the hbsfcw system during all experimental phases significant decreases in the effluent no3 n concentrations were observed inside both units when the cod was sufficient fig 2 c and d although the removal efficiency of no3 n was high for both units during the stage i the fluctuations were also large the maximum no3 n concentrations in the effluent water were generally low in both units in a range smaller than 2 68 mg l these results indicated that the addition of a carbon source from the influent of the n and w unit and rs of the w unit caused an onset of denitrification thus promoting the reduction of no3 n in the hbsfcw at stage ii c n 3 4 the removal efficiency of no3 n in the w unit remained high due to the influent cod released from rs in addition in the n unit the no3 n removal efficiency remained stable 82 14 100 00 on the one hand the influent carbon sources were still relatively sufficient and on the other hand it may be because many denitrifying microorganisms that had grown during the previous stage had not yet been significantly extinguished and were still able to perform relatively extensive denitrification thus maintaining the high removal 57 58 under conditions of influent carbon deficiency during stage iii v in the w unit the no3 n removal efficiency remained high with a decrease in the influent c n ratios deficient carbon sources should be complemented by a supply of rs the no3 n removal efficiency decreased rapidly to a low level in the n unit and was significantly lower than in the stages with sufficient carbon sources in the influent stage i and ii these results suggested that the effluent no3 n concentrations barely decreased in the absence of sufficient carbon sources and under these conditions denitrification in the control unit was suppressed the removal efficiency of the effluent tn concentration in each unit was largely similar to that of no3 n throughout the experimental period fig 2 e and f regarding the difference in the no3 n and tn treatment performance between the w and n units particularly the results of the stages with insufficient carbon sources in the influent stage iii iv the w unit exhibited markedly superior nitrogen removal capacities than the n unit the largest disparity occurred nine times and the gap continued widening these variations tn nitrate and cod suggest that the involvement of rs indeed played a role in the supply of carbon sources for microbial denitrification 3 1 3 nh4 n treatment performance of cw systems cws purify nh4 n in wastewater principally via nitrification the carbon sources liberated from rs should affect this step slightly therefore the nh4 n removal performance fluctuated and always remained low in both the w and n units fig s1 whereas the nh4 n concentration in the effluent of the w unit was significantly higher than that in the n unit throughout the operation the nh4 n concentration increased due to the release from rs and the addition of rs carbon sources may have promoted several other processes of nitrate conversion e g nitrate ammonification 59 60 as discussed below these two factors may have contributed to the higher nh4 concentration in the effluent 3 1 4 no2 n treatment performance of cw systems the no2 n variation is also worth noting fig s1 there was no significant cumulativeness of no2 n in the effluent of the w unit throughout the operation however there was an apparent accumulation in the effluent of the n unit when the c n ratios were lower the concentration difference in the no2 n accumulation between the two units reached a maximum of 0 43 mg l 0 47 and 0 04 mg l in the n and w unit respectively which occurred at a c n ratios of 1 2 the more successful denitrification nitrate to gaseous nitrogen caused by the rs cod or carbon sources probably accounts for this observation 3 1 5 tp treatment performance of cw systems the removal of tp in cws mainly occurs through the adsorption of the substrate and is partly contributed by vegetation therefore variations in the c n ratios have no significant effect on tp removal furthermore the matrix in hbsfcw systems is barely capable of adsorbing tp see the results of the static adsorption experiment for the w unit the effluent tp concentrations appeared higher than those in the influent water at the beginning of operation but they gradually stabilized over time fig s1 this may have been due to the release of elemental phosphorus from rs of the w unit at the initial stage of operation 61 in contrast no significant difference in the tp concentration was expected in the inlet and outlet of the n unit 3 2 distributions of the environmental factors in cw under various influent c n ratios 3 2 1 do and orp distribution fig s2 summarizes the distribution of do in both the w and n units under various influent c n ratios the distribution of do can affect microbial activities community structures and diversity and further influence the removal efficiencies of pollutants in pore water significantly the do level inside the w unit was always lower than that in the n unit in sample sites 3 4 and 5 in the w unit despite the same influent c n ratios from stage ii to stage v compared with the control unit carbon sources were always released by rs which prompted and enhanced organic matter degradation and denitrification and the consumption of do was higher than that in the control unit a lower do may indicate the establishment of a better anoxic anaerobic environment in the w unit this promotes the growth of denitrifiers and therefore further facilitates the removal of nitrates 62 63 similarly the nitrogen removal efficiency in the w unit was higher than that in the n unit which validates this explanation the do levels in both units displayed an increasing trend as the c n ratios decreased in the w unit the do tended to increase in zone2 w3 during stage ii and stage iii during which the oxygen concentrations were in the range of 0 5 1 0 mg l the do content remained largely unchanged with mean values of 0 8 mg l in stage iv and stage v similarly a gradual increase of do was also found in the control unit n3 these results showed that the organic carbon load decreased with a decrease in the influent c n ratios and would lead to less oxygen depletion which may account for the increasing tendency of the do concentration along the water flow direction in the w unit w4 w3 w5 the do content gradually decreased to a low level under the condition of higher oxygen consumption during organic matter degradation than under the condition of oxygen supply this may have been caused by the intense denitrification and degradation of cod in the major reaction zone2 and do consumption was consequently higher while accommodating for the growth demand of denitrifiers orp represents the change of redox potentials in cws and is a crucial environmental factor that controls organic matter biodegradation and nitrogen removal 19 the distribution of orp inside both units is showed in fig s3 generally the spatial and temporal variation trends of orp in the w and n units were consistent with the do the w unit had a considerably lower orp than the control unit indicating better anaerobic conditions this facilitated stronger denitrification both conventional and unconventional denitrification 64 which also coincided with better denitrification in the w unit the orp values in the w unit w3 were maintained at stable but critically low levels ranging from 270 to 150 mv even with decreasing c n ratios throughout the experiment this also enabled the w unit to sustain a strong denitrification capacity guaranteeing nitrate removal 3 2 2 ph distribution the distribution of the ph value in both units under various influent c n ratios is shown in fig s4 variations in ph during wastewater treatment depends not only on the influent ph but also on the nature and conversion characteristics of carbon nitrogen and sulphur in cws in the w unit due to the role of rs as a carbon source and electron donor the actual ratios of c n and cod so4 2 at each stage were higher than those in the control unit and other types of denitrifications e g biological processes integrating sulphate reduction and subsequent sulphur driven autotrophic denitrification in anaerobic micro environments may have occurred under conditions that reached the critical threshold required for the biological process based on the lower do and orp values in theory the ph increased due to the alkalinity produced by heterotrophic denitrification and sulphur driven autotrophic denitrification simultaneously released hydrogen ions h 36 57 58 as a result the ph was always lower in the w unit than in the control unit n except for w3 in the w unit there was a downward trend in the ph values of the other sampling points in both units at each stage throughout the operating period of stage ii heterotrophic denitrification was the main nitrogen removal pathway which increased the ph gradually in comparison when the influent c n ratios decreased from stage iii to stage v heterotrophic denitrification weakened while sulphur driven denitrification was enhanced by the ability to utilize more nitrate therefore a decrease in the ph value was observed due to autotrophic denitrification the changes in the ph value in w3 also confirmed this observation fig s4 3 3 static adsorption and release results for so4 2 and cod as shown in fig 3 the substrates neither released cod nor removed it by adsorption and they were recorded stable in a range of 70 95 mg l throughout the experiment meanwhile rs showed a considerable release capacity for cod and the mean cod value exhibited a sharp decreasing trend from 320 to 162 mg l on day 4 then it slightly decreased to 80 mg l on day 25 and the initial higher cod release also corresponded to the results of the cw system operation section 3 1 1 the coexistence of so4 2 and cod may affect tn removal thus the adsorption and release capacities of substrates and rs were examined concurrently fig 4 so4 2 was an inherent component in the solvent tap water of the synthetic wastewater and its concentration was always 96 39 9 43 mg l during the experimental period rs had nearly no release of so4 2 while the substrates released more sulphate during the initial stage but the amount gradually decreases and the highest so4 2 release capability was found for z thus a large portion of the so4 2 during the operation of the system likely originated from the influent 3 4 analysis of microbial communities 3 4 1 microbial community diversity regarding the reads acquired by sequencing table s2 and fig s5 the reads obtained from w and n units were similar in distribution over their lengths base pair number nevertheless the amount of reads at different lengths was always higher in the w unit than in the n unit as α diversity table s3 the average shannon and simpson index values were 5 765 and 0 0120 respectively in w unit while they were 5 566 and 0 0891 respectively in n unit indicating that the microbial community diversity in the w unit was higher than that in the n unit 65 66 and based on t test results they differed significantly p 0 05 regarding β diversity the outcomes of pcoa at the genus level based on bray curtis calculations are shown in fig s6 the majority of samples in the w unit differed significantly from those in the n unit except w1 in addition the microbial community composition of the plant samples differed remarkably from that of the matrix samples the same matrix was largely used in all zones of the n unit with no interference from external factors rs there were no significant differences between the samples among all zones the points are close to each other in fig s6 in the w unit nearly all zones were affected by varying degrees due to the addition of rs which produced variations among the samples w3 exhibited a remarkable difference in its microbial community compared to the other zone samples because of the immediate location of rs w3 is far from all the other points of the w unit in fig s6 w1 was the inlet zone of the system which was almost consistent with the environmental conditions of n1 thus the microbial community composition of w1 was also generally similar to that of n1 w1 and n1 are close to each other in fig s6 these differences indicate that the addition of rs to a certain part of the system not only affected a single region but also further affected the microbial community of the entire unit possibly by altering the containment of flow the α diversity index of the two plant samples zw and zn indicated that there were no significant differences in the microbial community among the plant samples of the two units and the results were also highly consistent with those obtained from the β diversity analysis pcoa this suggests that the incorporation of rs did not considerably influence the microbial community diversity of the plant samples even though it modified the surrounding environment of the plants w2 and n2 however the result derived from the pcoa analysis showed that the microbial community composition of the plant samples differed remarkably from that of the matrix samples this difference may have been due to the differences between the plants and the matrices themselves 3 4 2 microbial community structures to compare the microbial community structures in both units qualified reads were allocated to phyla fig 5 and genera proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the w and n units as well as in the plant samples with zw and zn being grouped as the z unit accounting for 41 42 and 43 of the total community composition respectively the second highest proportion was found for bacteroidetes reaching 16 16 and 20 in the w n and z units respectively and there was no significant differences in the two microbial populations between the w and n units either as a whole or at counterparts p 0 05 moreover some phyla encompassing bacteria capable of performing denitrification namely firmicutes actinobacteria and nitrospirae related to nitrification were also observed in the w 3 6 1 2 and 7 5 and n 1 7 0 8 and 6 2 units however only actinobacteria displayed a significant difference p 0 05 analysis at the genus level allowed for further verification of the bacterial community structures and the relative abundance of the microbial communities are shown in fig 6 the primary goal of this system was to achieve tn mainly nitrate removal through denitrification hence during the observation of dominant genera relative abundance 1 comparisons of the proportions of dominant genera with a denitrification function in the w and n units were the focus dechloromonas thauera and ignavibacterium were dominant in both the w 2 22 2 40 and 2 12 and n 1 24 1 80 and 2 30 units additionally the genus nitrospira which can perform complete ammonia oxidation comammox became remarkably dominant in both the w 7 46 and n 6 16 units but with no significant difference between the two units moreover because of the coexistence of sufficient cod and sulphate in the w unit the genus with sulphate reduction function named desulfobacter 1 47 and desulfobulbus 1 16 became dominant only in the w unit notably sulfurimonas became dominant only in the w unit with a relative abundance of 1 27 among the plant samples hydrogenophaga saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis and gemmobacter were all capable of performing denitrification they exhibited high relative abundances in zw and zn 1 this may be explained by the secretion of substances from plant roots that boost the growth of denitrifiers pseudomonas associated with phosphorus removal polyphosphorus was abundant in both zw 3 66 and zn 9 95 however it had almost no influence on the removal of tp perhaps due to its insufficient absolute amount 3 4 3 microbial function prediction faprotax was used to predict annotated functions of the identified microorganisms in both units table s4 as seen in fig 7 most of the dominant annotated microbial metabolic functions were nitrification and denitrification noticeably nitrate denitrification nitrite denitrification and nitrous oxide denitrification are three microbial metabolic functions that were not identified significantly between the w and n units p 0 05 this suggests that the three microbial metabolic functions were not the main drivers of the differences in nitrogen tn and no3 n removal between the two units furthermore the inclusion of rs caused no noticeable change in these metabolic functions sampling points 2 3 5 and 6 between the w and n units however the denitrification metabolic function of microorganisms was greater in the w unit than in the n unit indicating that denitrification was enhanced in the w unit which is consistent with the above mentioned tn and no3 n removal results denitrification was a crucial contributor to the difference in the nitrogen removal performance between the two units a pronounced increase was observed in the w unit especially in w2 w3 and w5 with the addition of rs suggesting that it enhanced denitrification metabolism furthermore dark sulfide oxidation is a metabolic function related to sulphur based denitrification 64 this metabolic function was stronger in the w unit than in the n unit which may be another key reason for the difference in the nitrogen nitrate removal performance between the w and n units and the significant difference between w2 w3 w5 and w6 which were affected by rs and n2 n3 n5 and n6 p 0 05 the reason for this difference as mentioned above may be that the sufficient carbon sources released from rs facilitated the reduction of sulphate in the wetland treatment system by srb and then the reduced sulphur provided the conditions electron donors required for sulphur based denitrification microbial nitrite respiration metabolism can consume nitrite which was higher in the w unit than in the n unit the nitrite concentration difference between the effluent of the two units n w was probably associated with this anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox function of microorganisms between the w and n units did not differ significantly p 0 05 even after the stream passed through the rs addition site i e after w3 and n3 this indicates that anammox occurred in both units to some extent and was not influenced by the addition of rs nitrite ammonification metabolism may be another metabolic pathway through which nitrite is consumed to generate ammonia nitrogen this metabolic function occurred considerably more in the w unit than in the n unit p 0 05 and may have reduced the accumulation of nitrite in the w unit which was less than that in the n unit while simultaneously making the treatment efficiency of ammonia in the w unit inferior to that of the n unit the observed marked increase in w2 3 and 5 may indicate that the addition of rs promoted this metabolic function other metabolic functions such as respiration of sulphur compounds arsenate respiration knallga bacteria manganese oxidation manganese respiration hydrocarbon degradation dark iron oxidation iron respiration and chemoheterotrophy etc were notably present in both the w and n units but without significant differences presumably these metabolic functions are common to the maintenance of microbial life activities but the relationship between these metabolic functions and nitrogen removal was not clearly established 4 discussion 4 1 microbial nitrogen removal pathways cws are complicated ecosystems whose environmental parameters i e do orp and ph types and wastewater properties significantly impact microbial species and abundance thereby affecting pollutant removal efficiency in this study the hbsfcw type and continuous wastewater feeding mode created lower do w3 0 31 1 02 mg l and orp w3 262 143 mv conditions in the w unit thus creating a suitable habitat for anaerobic bacterial growth furthermore the influent wastewater was characterized by low c n ratios nitrogen entered the treatment units mainly in the form of nitrate which was a key factor affecting denitrification and making the abundance of conventional anaerobic heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria e g thauera ignavibacterium silanimonas and dechloromonas the highest in the cws this is consistent with the result of hong et al 67 who stated that anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification may occur under low do levels indicating that anaerobic denitrifiers perform no3 reduction and form conventional denitrification pathways with anaerobic denitrification the nitrous oxide denitrification results from the metabolism function prediction indicated that nitrate was mostly removed as nitrogenous gases as evidenced by the low nitrogenous compound concentration in the effluent this explanation was also confirmed by the high throughput 16s rrna sequencing results moreover average removal efficiencies of 67 5 tn and 71 1 no3 n were achieved in the n unit which was characterized by a deficiency of both organic carbon and elector donors that were insufficient to achieve a higher nitrogen removal efficiency through conventional heterotrophic denitrification in contrast higher removal efficiencies 87 0 of tn and no3 n were achieved in the w unit accordingly alternative nitrogen removal pathways such as autotrophic denitrification and anammox may have occurred in the w unit rs are plant litter and can be reused in cws during their decomposition lignocelluloses are hydrolysed and fermented into liable plant carbon sources 68 rs were not only organic carbon suppliers but also attachment sites for denitrifying bacteria in the hbsfcw system moreover sulphate reduction caused by srb occurred in the sewage treatment system and previous studies have revealed that bacterial sulphate reduction is important during high strength sulphate wastewater treatment in cws 69 in this study sulphate from the synthetic wastewater and small amounts released from substrates might have been reduced by srb under anoxic anaerobic conditions wherein organic carbon acted as an electron donor this conclusion is established based on the competition with other heterotrophic bacteria desulfobacter and desulfobulbus are two srb genera whose abundances were high in the w unit and their presence indicated that sulphate reduction occurred in the cws packed with rs additionally dark sulfide oxidation was a metabolic function associated with this process after sulphate reduction reduced sulphur was produced both nitrate and oxygen were present in the influent wastewater suggesting that reduced sulphur would be re oxidized by microbial or chemical pathways previous studies have revealed that both anoxic anaerobic and aerobic oxidation contributed to microbial sulphur oxidation however chemical oxidation was much slower than microbial sulphur oxidation 70 if oxygen content was limited in the pore water of the cws most of the reduced sulphur would be oxidized through anaerobic anoxic oxidation the do concentration was limited in the w unit 0 8 mg l in this study suggesting that anoxic anaerobic microbial oxidation of reduced sulphur to sulphate coupled with nitrate reduction could have been another nitrogen removal pathway in the wetland in this study sulphide oxidizing bacteria sob sulfurimonas sulfuricurvum and sulfurospirillum were abundant in the experimental unit indicating that re oxidation of reduced sulphur had occurred furthermore they could use no3 n to oxidize reduced sulphur and couple denitrification with sulphur oxidation in the litter added wetland treatment system indicating that the sob played important roles in both no3 n reduction and sulphur oxidation therefore adding plant litter rs greatly drove the influent sulphate reduction because of the continuous input of plant carbon sources and no3 n was the electron acceptor that stimulated reduced sulphur re oxidation to sulphate in the cws consequently the no3 n and tn removal rates exceeded 90 due to the synergistic effect of sulphur based autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification as well as other biological functions in the cw treatment unit meanwhile alternative routes such as the anammox pathway which promotes the removal of ammonia and nitrate seem to have had a low contribution to nitrogen removal in the treatment unit as evidenced by the relative low abundance contributions by aquatic plant root zone denitrifying bacteria saccharibacterua genera incertae sedis hydvogenophaga and gemmobacter as well as phosphorus polymerizing bacteria pesudomonus were also found but they did not constitute an important nitrogen removal mechanism there was relatively intense nitrite ammonification in the w unit causing some of the nitrite formed by nitrification to be converted to ammonia because of the low influent ammonia concentrations ammonia oxidizing bacteria archaea and nitrite oxidizing bacteria were not detected in the hbsfcw treatment unit and most of the ammonia oxidation likely occurred because of the detected nitrospira previous studies have reported that a higher abundance of comammox nitrospira may be found in relatively low strength ammonia environments such as tertiary wastewater treatment systems and drinking water treatment systems fig 8 shows the overall nitrogen removal pathways in the studied litter added hbsfcw treatment system plant litter rs was chosen and packed with the combined substrates in the hbsfcw treatment unit to allow different kinds of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to co exist such as anaerobic denitrifying bacteria anammox comammox srb and sob while enabling the synergistic utilization of microbial metabolisms thus a high removal efficiency of nitrogen pollutants was achieved however the synergistic effect of carbon and sulphate bioconversions on mixotrophic denitrification in the cws for the treatment of wwtp tailwater should be understood in more detail future research should therefore focus on investigating actual hd and sad proportions relative to those of nitrogen removal as well as sulphur related transformation processes 4 2 implications for wwtp wastewater treatment rs were reused as sustained release carbon sources and electron donors to facilitate sulphur based mixotrophic denitrification which further enhanced the nitrogen removal performance of wwtp tailwater in the hbsfcw according to the low influent c n ratios deficient carbon sources which are insufficient for complete hd the carbon sources released from the plant litter would drive the influent sulphate reduction process and transfer the electrons to sulphide or elemental sulphur furthermore sad occurred in the treatment unit meanwhile cooperative hsad was achieved in one hbsfcw therefore a promising efficient low cost treatment technology which would decrease the demand of external organic carbon and sulphur sources in cws and lower the construction and operation costs was proposed to enhance nitrogen removal in treating low c n ratios wwtp secondary effluent or tertiary wastewater treatment especially for the further purification condition in which nitrogen removal by wwtp followed by cws in the way of enhancing nitrogen removal therefore nitrogen in effluent can meet the designed water index requirements to improve the ecological environmental quality of water furthermore the litter added hbsfcw used in the ecological treatment process for wwtp tailwater could perform the dual functions of municipal sewage deep purification and ecological rehabilitation 5 conclusions this study has found that carbon sources released from plant litter rs and influent sulphate cooperatively drove hd and sad processes and that mixotrophic denitrification simultaneously occurred in one hbsfcw thereby enhancing the nitrogen removal performance of low c n ratios wwtp tailwater this result was based on a comparative analysis on the richness and diversity of the microbial community as well as functional prediction results the following results were obtained 1 a profitable anaerobic anoxic environment for the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria could be created under the condition that plant litter rs was packed with substrates in the hbsfcw system 2 the microbial community diversity and richness in the litter added hbsfcw system responded positively to the addition of plant litter rs and influent sulphate which are beneficial for enhancing nitrogen removal 3 cooperative hd and sad were important nitrogen removal pathways in the litter added hbsfcw system 4 sulphate reduction and reduced sulphur re oxidation processes could occur in the hbsfcw treatment unit sequentially which can use nitrate to oxidize reduced sulphur and couple the denitrification to sulphur oxidation 5 the nitrogen removal performance of the litter added hbsfcw system is preferable for treating wwtp tailwater and municipal tertiary wastewater which are characterized by low c n ratios credit authorship contribution statement chunhao
