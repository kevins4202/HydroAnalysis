7560,the magnitude and frequency of hydrometeorological extremes are expected to increase in the conterminous united states conus over the rest of this century and their increase will significantly impact water resource management in this study we evaluated the large scale climate change effects on extreme hydrological events and their implications for reservoir inflows in 138 headwater subbasins located upstream of reservoirs across conus using the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model the vic model was forced with a 10 member ensemble of global circulation models under the representative concentration pathway 8 5 that were dynamically downscaled using a regional climate model regcm4 and bias corrected to 1 24 grid cell resolution four commonly used indices including mean annual flow annual center timing 100 year daily high streamflow and 10 year 7 day average low streamflow were used for evaluation the results projected an increase in the high streamflow by 44 for a majority of subbasins upstream of flood control reservoirs in the central united states us and a decrease in the low streamflow by 11 for subbasins upstream of hydropower reservoirs across the western us in the eastern us frequencies of both high and low streamflow were projected to increase in the majority of subbasins upstream of both hydropower and flood control reservoirs increased frequencies of both high and low streamflow events can potentially make reservoirs across conus more vulnerable to future climate conditions this study estimates reservoir inflow changes over the next several decades which can be used to optimize water supply management downstream keywords vic regcm4 streamflow extremes reservoirs 1 introduction over the past few decades extreme hydrological events have been increasing across most of the conterminous us conus ahn and palmer 2015 peterson et al 2008 novotny and stefan 2007 burns et al 2007 kunkel et al 1999 karl and knight 1998 however these trends vary by region some areas such as the southwest have experienced prolonged droughts cook et al 2015 whereas regions in the central us have experienced an increase in the frequency of heavy precipitation pryor et al 2009 areas in the eastern us have also observed an increase in the frequency of heavy precipitation and streamflow events groisman et al 2001 with expected increase in the frequency and duration of both wet and dry extreme events singh et al 2013 touma et al 2015 pagán et al 2016 it will be more challenging to optimally manage reservoirs to meet all competing objectives for example in arid regions increased drought duration and severity may result in an inability to maintain minimum release rates for the reservoirs on the other hand increases in precipitation could cause reservoirs to store more water but they could also lead to uncontrolled water releases and cause downstream damage carlton and kandathil 2013 increases or decreases in mean annual precipitation and the resulting changes in runoff can affect downstream reservoir operations and impact recreational activities water quality and stream and shoreline ecosystems therefore a better understanding of streamflow variation in the upstream areas of reservoirs is necessary to improve future reservoir operations and watershed management recent studies have examined how the changes of historic and future hydrologic conditions may affect large and regulated river systems zhou et al 2016 haddeland et al 2014 biemans et al 2011 döll et al 2009 hanasaki et al 2006 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 hamlet et al 2010 using large scale hydrologic models with reservoir operation simulated at selected major dams these studies provided high level evaluation and suggested significant impacts in some major river basins however considering the complexity of existing water infrastructure systems the actual impacts can be far more complicated in the us alone there are over 88 000 dams ranging from a wide variety of sizes to support various objectives usace 2017 including flood control municipal water supply irrigation hydropower generation and aquatic wildlife protection their site specific impacts from a single project to an integrated system may not be fully depicted through large scale hydrologic models a refined modeling framework will eventually be required to provide more locally relevant information wood et al 2011 bierkens et al 2015 to gain an overall understanding of the possible site specific climate change impacts on various reservoirs across the conus we present a spatially consistent methodology for analyzing climate change impacts with a particular focus on hydrological extremes and their implications for reservoir inflows using a hydrologic model implemented at 1 24 4 km grid resolution over the conus oubeidillah et al 2014 this study aims to draw a comprehensive picture of conceivable changes in extreme flow events in multiple headwater subbasins across the conus where historic streamflow observation is available to support model validation although we did not account for water management effects on hydrological responses in downstream areas understanding future changes in reservoir inflow such as the magnitude and timing of extreme events in headwater basins is important for water resource management e g alexander et al 2007 therefore this work should enhance the scientific understanding of changes in local hydrological patterns nested within large river basins and offer baseline information for adaptive water resource management in a changing climate specifically this research addresses two questions 1 how will near term hydroclimate changes affect the volume and timing of both low and high flows in catchments upstream of reservoirs 2 what types of reservoirs and water resource regions across the conus will be more vulnerable to future climate conditions section 2 of this paper describes the downscaled climate change projections hydrologic simulations and the data used for the analyses section 3 focuses on the evaluation of the hydrologic modeling the effects of hydroclimate changes on the volume and timing of inflows hydrological extremes and the implications for reservoir inflows the conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 methods and data 2 1 selection of reservoirs and gauge stations to investigate the effects of climate change on reservoir inflows across the conus and to identify signals induced by climate change we selected multiple analyzable pairs of reservoirs and gauge stations that 1 are mostly unregulated and have minimum human influence 2 have sufficient historic streamflow observations i e at least 10 years of records between 1981 and 2012 for model validation and 3 possess an upstream drainage area greater than 100 km2 this selection criterion allowed us to identify signals that were mainly caused by climate change however we recognize that such an approach does not account for any hydrologic changes resulting from climate change driven land cover variations or other human activities e g land use dam regulation and flow diversion identification of unregulated gauge stations was based on the united states geological survey usgs geospatial attributes of gauges for evaluating streamflow gages ii database falcone et al 2010 falcone 2011 daily discharge data were obtained from the usgs national water information system nwis gauge stations in addition the complete list of reservoirs along with their main purposes was obtained from the global reservoir and dam database grand lehner et al 2011 using the listed criteria a total of 178 pairs of reservoirs and gauge stations were first identified fig 1 and supplementary table s1 the selected reservoirs were then categorized based on their main purposes which include flood control hydroelectricity irrigation water supply and others i e navigation recreation and fisheries although a majority of the reservoirs are in fact multi purpose to focus our discussion and analysis we only considered their main purpose as reported in the grand database see supplementary table s1 after model evaluation and validation described in sections 2 3 and 3 1 we further sub selected 138 of 178 subbasins that had better model performance to support the full analysis 2 2 climate projections in this study an ensemble of high resolution climate projections were generated from a hybrid framework that downscaled ten general circulation models gcms from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 to 4 km spatial resolution over the conus first each of the ten gcms was dynamically downscaled to 18 km resolution using regional climate model version 4 regcm4 giorgi et al 2012 the regcm4 downscaling consisted of 40 years in the baseline period 1966 2005 and 40 years in the near term future period 2011 2050 under representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 the 10 models were selected based on the availability of gcms with three dimensional atmospheric fields at a sub daily timescale which is necessary for dynamical downscaling these ensemble members are access1 0 bcc csm1 1 ccsm4 cmcc cm fgoals g2 ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 mpi esm mr mri cgcm3 and nor esm1 m although this study selected a ten member ensemble for climate projections projected changes in precipitation and temperature in the ensemble members do not exhibit obvious bias in any one direction compared with climate projections from 97 cmip5 gcms under four emission scenarios rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 brekke et al 2014 fig 2 the results from these regcm4 simulations were further spatially interpolated and statistically bias corrected to the targeted 1 24 4 km geographical grid using a quantile based bias correction method ashfaq et al 2010 2013 2016 the 1 24 4 km resolution 1966 2005 monthly precipitation and temperature values from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 were used as the historic observation for bias correction the results of these regcm4 simulations are detailed in ashfaq et al 2016 2 3 hydrologic model simulations the vic hydrologic model version 4 1 1 liang et al 1994 1996 cherkauer et al 2003 was used to simulate streamflow based on the observed and projected meteorological forcing we used a calibrated vic model implementation at a 1 24 4 km resolution for the entire conus with a 3 h time step oubeidillah et al 2014 and naz et al 2016 provide a detailed description of the vic model setup parameters and results for model calibration and validation oubeidillah et al 2014 used the simulated monthly vic total runoff i e surface runoff plus baseline by the usgs waterwatch runoff data set brakebill et al 2011 at each of the 2107 usgs eight digit hydrologic subbasins huc8 across the conus driven by the gridded 1980 2012 conus temperature and precipitation observations from daymet thornton et al 1997 and prism daly et al 2008 and the reanalyzed surface wind speeds from the north american regional reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 vic model version 4 1 1 was executed in the full energy mode in which the model iteratively solves the energy and water balances at a 3 h time step to manage the large amount of data i e around half a million grid points in the us all forcing soil vegetation global parameter and output flux files are organized according to the huc8 subbasins the calibrated vic model simulations are hereinafter referred to as control run simulation to simulate future hydrological response to climate change the daily bias corrected regcm4 outputs i e daily minimum and maximum temperature and daily precipitation were used to drive the calibrated vic model to run the model at a 3 hourly time step the daily precipitation data were temporally disaggregated by equally apportioning days to 3 hourly intervals temperature humidity downward short and long wave radiation data were derived at 3 hourly intervals from the daily temperature range and daily total precipitation using methods described in bohn et al 2013 however previous studies have found that this approach could result in relative humidity trends opposite to those in the driving gcms thus affecting the simulated runoff bohn et al 2013 pierce et al 2013 in order to ensure that the vic model did not significantly alter the projected trends by regcm4 we compared the regionally averaged projected changes future minus baseline in annual net shortwave radiation net longwave radiation relative humidity and specific humidity between the regcm4 and vic model not shown here for the four us mega regions the trends of humidity particularly relative humidity were generally consistent between the regcm4 and vic model however small differences between the vic and regcm4 simulated shortwave and longwave radiation changes were found i e up to 2 therefore we do not expect significant impact of these differences on the simulated hydrological response by the vic model to simulate the daily transport of runoff and drainage to the channels the simulated daily surface runoff and baseflow from each grid cell were routed to the 178 gauge locations through the river network using a linear reservoir model based on lohmann et al 1998 the most important routing parameter flow direction grid was developed using both national elevation dataset gesch et al 2002 and the national hydrography dataset plus epa 2010 while the flow directions can be derived through standard geographic information system software packages e g archydro maidment 2002 the process could result in river networks inconsistent with the observed ones i e from nhdplus in flat areas and in closed inland basins to avoid this issue we derived the flow direction grids separately for each huc8 using a river burn in technique before calculating flow directions through conventional methods we artificially lowered the elevations of grids that are overlapped with nhdplus rivers the derived flow direction grids were then inspected for inconsistencies between simulated and observed river networks as an example fig 3 shows comparison of delineated river network derived from 1 24 digital elevation model with nhdplus rivers for two selected usgs gauges red triangles upstream of northfork lake reservoirs while the computed flow direction grids could reasonably depict the relatively large river networks in the east they often failed to represent relatively small river networks upstream of the gauge stations in such cases the flow direction grids were manually adjusted to ensure agreement between simulated and observed river networks overall the mean absolute percentage difference and r2 value between the usgs reported drainage areas and the vic modeled drainage areas for the 178 subbasins were 9 and 0 99 respectively although the high resolution 1 24 vic model grid improved the delineation of the river networks compared with other commonly used 1 8 vic model applications the grid resolution may still be insufficient to model streamflow for small drainage areas therefore we opted to focus only on locations with upstream drainage areas greater than 100 km2 to further enhance the performance of runoff routing at a finer spatial scale a non grid based routing model such as the routing application for parallel computation of discharge david et al 2011 may be a promising alternative 2 4 analysis to investigate the projected change of reservoir inflows we used four indices 1 q the mean annual streamflow 2 ct the annual center timing of streamflow for a given water year october 1st september 30th ct stewart et al 2005 represents the date since october 1st at which 50 of the total streamflow mass occurred 3 q100 the 100 year return level of daily high streamflow which is used as a proxy for the likelihood of flooding 4 7q10 the 10 year return level of 7 day average low streamflow which is used as a proxy for droughts all analyses were conducted separately for each of the ten ensemble members in the baseline and future periods for all selected locations to estimate both q100 and 7q10 the annual maximum daily streamflow and annual minimum 7 day average streamflow were first summarized and fitted separately into the generalized extreme value gev distribution using the l moments method wang 1997 hosking and wallis 1993 the kolmogorov smirnov test chakravarti et al 1967 was then used to examine the goodness of fit of the gev the results of these analyses were used to calculate the percentage change future minus baseline baseline in projected annual flow q high streamflow q100 low streamflow 7q10 and change future minus baseline in streamflow timing ct for each ensemble member to evaluate the effects of hydrologic extremes on reservoir storage changes in the selected subbasins were also summarized by the reservoirs main usage additionally the multi model uncertainty for the simulated results was also examined to understand the robustness of simulated changes across all ensemble members 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrologic model validation for the period of 1981 2012 we evaluated the simulated streamflow at each selected gauge location using usgs streamflow observations the observed versus simulated annual average streamflow are illustrated in fig 4 a and b the monthly coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 values between observed and simulated streamflow are shown in fig 4 c and d the daily r2 and nse at 84 stations with complete historic records are shown in fig 4 e and f in general the vic annual streamflows closely matched the observed ones for many basins across the us monthly coefficient values ranged from 0 2 to 0 9 with 65 of subbasins 116 having a nse greater than 0 5 about 81 percent of the subbasins 145 had a r2 greater than 0 5 fig 4c and d at the daily time scale the vic model also indicated acceptable performance with nse and r2 values both ranged from 0 1 to 0 8 for the selected subbasins in the eastern us new england mid atlantic south atlantic gulf ohio valley and tennessee and across the western us colorado great basin pacific northwest and california the vic modeled streamflow results are in good agreement with the observed streamflow at both daily and monthly time scales however in the central us missouri arkansas white red and texas the vic model performance was relatively low for both monthly and daily streamflow with a r2 of approximately 0 4 and an nse between 0 2 and 0 4 previous studies that applied hydrologic modeling across the conus have also shown poor model performance in arid regions and generally better performance in the eastern and western us newman et al 2015 clark et al 2008 martinez and gupta 2010 the low performance of the model in the central us can be attributed to uncertainties from atmospheric forcing data static input data e g soil and land cover types or inherent model limitations for example naz et al 2016 showed improved runoff simulations after bias correction of forcing data with prism dataset and adjustment of vegetation and soil parameterizations furthermore it is challenging for the land surface models to correctly represent the saturation excess runoff in arid to semi arid regions in such areas low runoff observations may induce low values of the infiltration parameters during calibration which may prevent the accurate simulation of runoff peak flows resulting in lower nse values the density of precipitation and streamflow gauges is also relatively low in the central us which makes model calibration and validation more challenging in this region note that the calibration of vic model provided by oubeidillah et al 2014 was carried out at the huc8 scale using waterwatch monthly runoff data it was not evaluated for hydrologic extremes at daily time scale because of the unavailability of daily resolution conus runoff observations nevertheless earlier studies using vic model calibrated at monthly time scale have been shown to successfully reproduce the ratio of q100 to the mean annual flood for different climatic conditions in the western us e g hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 moreover this study mainly focuses on the percentage changes instead of absolute projections which is shown to be relatively less sensitive to model calibration and other possible sources of hydrologic model biases tohver et al 2014 salathé et al 2014 given the modeling limitations we analyzed only the results for 138 basins where monthly nse values were greater than 0 4 in the following sections 3 2 changes in inflow volume and timing fig 5 shows the projected changes in streamflow volume and timing for the selected 138 reservoir inflow locations across the conus the projected multi model median annual volume showed an average increase of 4 5 for the 2011 2050 future period relative to the 1966 2005 baseline period fig 5a however the change is spatially heterogeneous across the us at the annual timescale the most pronounced change was an increase 10 25 in q in the central us upper mississippi missouri arkansas white red and texas gulf and to a lesser degree in the great lakes ohio valley and south atlantic gulf regions 1 7 fig 5a and table 1 compared to the eastern and central us flows in the western us were mostly projected to decrease on average 17 of 29 basins exhibit a 3 decrease in q in the pacific northwest region and 7 of 8 locations exhibit a 5 decrease in q in the california region table 1 overall the majority of ensemble members agree on the direction of change in q fig 6 a analyses of ct showed that on average the center of mass of streamflow was projected to arrive earlier by 4 days for 73 of the basins 101 of 138 table 1 earlier streamflow was more pronounced in the western us i e 4 14 days earlier table 1 and fig 5b ct was also projected to arrive earlier by 1 4 days for basins in the missouri upper mississippi great lakes and new england regions in contrast ct in the southeastern us was projected to arrive later fig 5b particularly in the texas gulf region where a 2 6 day delay was projected however the degree of consensus among models is low therefore greater uncertainty exists in the direction of change in ct projections fig 6b the changes in streamflow volume and shifts in streamflow timing will likely affect water availability in the reservoirs fig 5c and d present the changes in q and ct for all basins grouped by main reservoir use the results showed that the streamflow increases are likely to influence the inflows to the flood control and water supply reservoirs for instance 85 of basins that are upstream of flood control and water supply reservoirs were projected to receive increased annual streamflow fig 5c and earlier ct fig 5d similarly q was also projected to increase in 52 of basins upstream of hydropower reservoirs fig 5c mostly located in the southern atlantic gulf tennessee and ohio valley regions in contrast to the eastern and central us q was projected to decrease in the western us basins where irrigation and hydropower are the main reservoir purposes in those regions 61 and 47 of basins that are upstream of irrigation and hydropower reservoirs respectively showed a decrease in q in addition to the decrease in streamflow volume the headwater basins in the western us showed pronounced earlier ct up to 14 days particularly for reservoirs that are used for irrigation fig 5d 3 3 changes in hydrological extremes fig 7 shows ensemble median changes in q100 and 7q10 for each selected location an increase in q100 implies a higher probability of flood whereas a decrease in 7q10 implies higher probability of drought our results indicate a robust increase in the magnitude of q100 for nearly all locations the strongest increases up to 70 are projected in subbasins across the central and eastern us fig 7a and relatively low uncertainty across the ensemble members as all models agree on the direction of change for all categories of reservoirs fig 6c among different reservoir types q100 was projected to increase by 44 on average for basins that are upstream of flood control reservoirs table 2 fig 7c similarly most basins upstream of hydropower reservoirs across the eastern us exhibit an increase in q100 35 table 2 fig 7a for 7q10 a strong reduction up to 40 was projected in most basins across the eastern us fig 7b in contrast most basins across the central us showed increases in low flows 5 to 50 with the exception of some basins located in the great lakes and ohio valley regions that projected decreases of up to 15 in 7q10 fig 7b increases in low streamflow in the central us were more likely to be caused by higher subsurface storage in the summer season driven by increases in projected precipitation throughout the year naz et al 2016 however 7q10 exhibited higher uncertainty as the degree of consensus among cmip5 models was low i e only half of the models projected decreases fig 6d examination of the changes in 7q10 with respect to reservoir use suggests that projected changes in 7q10 were more severe in the headwater basins upstream of the hydropower reservoirs i e 33 of 46 subbasins showed decreasing 7q10 by up to 11 table 2 and fig 7d however results were mixed for basins upstream of the flood control reservoirs with increasing 7q10 up to 27 in the central us and decreasing 7q10 in the western us and along the lower mississippi river table 2 and fig 7d for basins upstream of irrigation water supply and other reservoirs 7q10 was projected to decrease from 9 to 20 table 2 with more notable decreases across the california upper colorado mid atlantic tennessee and ohio valley regions 3 4 limitations and uncertainties there are multiple sources of uncertainty in high resolution future hydro climate projections including emission scenario gcms structure gcms initial condition downscaling approach and hydrologic model structure and parameters chen et al 2011 kay et al 2009 wu et al 2015 zhao et al 2016a in this study we utilized dynamically downscaled multi member regional hydro climate projections over the conus ashfaq et al 2016 which is helpful in resolving some of the challenges that are associated with the gcms however we acknowledge that a number of uncertainties still exist that may have an influence on the simulated hydrological response for instance use of a single regional climate model rcm underrepresents the uncertainty associated with the rcm s internal variability giorgi and gutowski 2015 similarly choice of a different downscaling approach e g using statistical downscaling and or a different hydrologic model may influence results at specific locations therefore results in this study are intended to provide overall and regional trends across a large number of subbasins in the conus rather than getting a precise prediction at a specific location within the scope of this study we further note that in the rain dominated regions the uncertainties in simulated hydrologic extremes are driven by the uncertainties in the mean and extreme precipitation projections across regcm4 ensemble members similarly uncertainties in the temperature projections across regcm4 ensemble members can potentially impact the simulated response in the snow dominated watersheds in the snow dominated watersheds additional uncertainties can be introduced by the selection of snow modeling approaches e g energy balance versus temperature based which may result in different sensitivities to increasing temperature and consequently influence extreme flows in the simulations therefore it is possible that a single hydrologic model based projections such as this study potentially underrepresent the uncertainty associated with the projected changes in cold regions as discussed earlier uncertainties in this study may also attributed to the fact that the vic model calibration was performed using monthly runoff data and no calibration was carried out for hydrologic extremes at a fine temporal scale additionally the vic model does not explicitly represent shallow groundwater which may impact the model s ability to estimates drought conditions e g groundwater effects can either cause the hydrologic droughts more persistent than meteorological drought or it may buffer the precipitation deficit this limitation can potentially enhance the uncertainty in our results for those basins where interactions between surface and groundwater processes are strong e g in the central us where the vic model performance is relatively lower than the eastern and western us given these limitations a detailed analysis is needed to investigate the uncertainties resulting from hydrologic modeling or climate model projections and their impact on the projected changes in hydrological extremes which is beyond the scope of this study finally this study analyzed only changes in the headwater basins located upstream of reservoirs and did not account for the total impact of upstream water supply to reservoirs and or contribution from upstream reservoirs similarly effects of human activities on hydrological cycle and thus on extremes are ignored that can also be significant for highly managed watersheds particular in the drier regions land use changes have the potential to enhance the overall hydrologic response in the drier regions if the climate becomes much drier in the future zhang et al 2016 therefore further studies should be conducted to incorporate combined effects of land use change and climate variability into the hydroclimate modeling framework for more reliable assessments of hydrological extremes and their impacts on reservoirs 4 summary and conclusions this paper analyzes potential changes in q ct 7q10 and q100 due to increases in radiative forcing and the implications of such changes for reservoir inflows these projections are based on an ensemble of high resolution simulations by the vic model naz et al 2016 forced with a ten member ensemble of dynamically and statistically downscaled near term regional climate projections ashfaq et al 2016 overall projected changes in reservoir inflows in the future period 2011 2050 relative to the baseline period 1966 2005 exhibit a number of robust features 1 for most of the headwater basins upstream of hydropower reservoirs across the western us decreases in 7q10 and earlier ct 4 14 days were found this suggests that hydroelectricity production may be reduced in the future particularly during the summer when it is needed the most in contrast changes in ensemble median q100 in subbasins across the western us were relatively small however increases in projected winter precipitation naz et al 2016 and earlier streamflow may increase the likelihood of floods in winter and drought like conditions in the summer bartos and chester 2015 also suggest that the vulnerability of hydropower plants to droughts is extremely high in the arid and semi arid southwestern us similar changes in the hydrological extremes over the western us are also reported in pagán et al 2016 2 in the central us q100 was projected to increase in most basins with more pronounced increases upstream of flood control 44 and hydropower 35 reservoirs the storage provided by the large flood control reservoirs in the central us might be able to help reduce the impacts of high streamflow however projected increases in the probability of floods can be an issue for dams that are built for purposes other than flood control on the other hand such streamflow changes do not necessarily translate into a proportional increase in hydropower production for hydropower plants in fact depending on the storage capacity of a dam a site that is projected to experience greater discharge volume could actually see lowered hydropower production as a result of more extreme high and low streamflow events lehner et al 2005 3 in the eastern us our analysis suggests that hydropower and flood control reservoirs are vulnerable to changes in both kinds of hydrologic extremes because most locations exhibited a decrease in 7q10 of up to 20 and an increase in q100 of up to 65 unlike those in the western us most of the reservoirs in the eastern us are within year reservoirs i e they refill and spill several times in a year with limited storage capacity singh et al 2014 projected increases in winter precipitation combined with earlier streamflow suggest there is a likelihood of future flood events in the winter and drought like conditions in the summer which could complicate water resource management decisions e g balance between flood control and hydropower generation additionally expected increases in both floods and droughts can lead to an increase in streamflow variability in these regions singh et al 2014 which could make reservoirs in the eastern us more vulnerable to projected climate conditions despite the limitations as discussed above the results showed in this paper should be beneficial for establishing future water management practices and strategies to adequately address climate change effect for example currently most dams in the western us control floods in winter store water from much of the spring snowmelt and release water to meet summer demand if the amount and timing of streamflow is altered as a result of climate change as shown in this study the existing reservoir operation rules will need to be revised brekke et al 2009 a future extension can potentially look at the storage capacity in relation to the impacts identified in this study the proposed modeling framework can be further refined by combining more predictive water resource management models zhao et al 2016b voisin et al 2013 into a high resolution large scale modeling system that can be used to investigate the combined effects of climate impacts and water management on downstream discharge

7560,the magnitude and frequency of hydrometeorological extremes are expected to increase in the conterminous united states conus over the rest of this century and their increase will significantly impact water resource management in this study we evaluated the large scale climate change effects on extreme hydrological events and their implications for reservoir inflows in 138 headwater subbasins located upstream of reservoirs across conus using the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model the vic model was forced with a 10 member ensemble of global circulation models under the representative concentration pathway 8 5 that were dynamically downscaled using a regional climate model regcm4 and bias corrected to 1 24 grid cell resolution four commonly used indices including mean annual flow annual center timing 100 year daily high streamflow and 10 year 7 day average low streamflow were used for evaluation the results projected an increase in the high streamflow by 44 for a majority of subbasins upstream of flood control reservoirs in the central united states us and a decrease in the low streamflow by 11 for subbasins upstream of hydropower reservoirs across the western us in the eastern us frequencies of both high and low streamflow were projected to increase in the majority of subbasins upstream of both hydropower and flood control reservoirs increased frequencies of both high and low streamflow events can potentially make reservoirs across conus more vulnerable to future climate conditions this study estimates reservoir inflow changes over the next several decades which can be used to optimize water supply management downstream keywords vic regcm4 streamflow extremes reservoirs 1 introduction over the past few decades extreme hydrological events have been increasing across most of the conterminous us conus ahn and palmer 2015 peterson et al 2008 novotny and stefan 2007 burns et al 2007 kunkel et al 1999 karl and knight 1998 however these trends vary by region some areas such as the southwest have experienced prolonged droughts cook et al 2015 whereas regions in the central us have experienced an increase in the frequency of heavy precipitation pryor et al 2009 areas in the eastern us have also observed an increase in the frequency of heavy precipitation and streamflow events groisman et al 2001 with expected increase in the frequency and duration of both wet and dry extreme events singh et al 2013 touma et al 2015 pagán et al 2016 it will be more challenging to optimally manage reservoirs to meet all competing objectives for example in arid regions increased drought duration and severity may result in an inability to maintain minimum release rates for the reservoirs on the other hand increases in precipitation could cause reservoirs to store more water but they could also lead to uncontrolled water releases and cause downstream damage carlton and kandathil 2013 increases or decreases in mean annual precipitation and the resulting changes in runoff can affect downstream reservoir operations and impact recreational activities water quality and stream and shoreline ecosystems therefore a better understanding of streamflow variation in the upstream areas of reservoirs is necessary to improve future reservoir operations and watershed management recent studies have examined how the changes of historic and future hydrologic conditions may affect large and regulated river systems zhou et al 2016 haddeland et al 2014 biemans et al 2011 döll et al 2009 hanasaki et al 2006 christensen and lettenmaier 2007 hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 hamlet et al 2010 using large scale hydrologic models with reservoir operation simulated at selected major dams these studies provided high level evaluation and suggested significant impacts in some major river basins however considering the complexity of existing water infrastructure systems the actual impacts can be far more complicated in the us alone there are over 88 000 dams ranging from a wide variety of sizes to support various objectives usace 2017 including flood control municipal water supply irrigation hydropower generation and aquatic wildlife protection their site specific impacts from a single project to an integrated system may not be fully depicted through large scale hydrologic models a refined modeling framework will eventually be required to provide more locally relevant information wood et al 2011 bierkens et al 2015 to gain an overall understanding of the possible site specific climate change impacts on various reservoirs across the conus we present a spatially consistent methodology for analyzing climate change impacts with a particular focus on hydrological extremes and their implications for reservoir inflows using a hydrologic model implemented at 1 24 4 km grid resolution over the conus oubeidillah et al 2014 this study aims to draw a comprehensive picture of conceivable changes in extreme flow events in multiple headwater subbasins across the conus where historic streamflow observation is available to support model validation although we did not account for water management effects on hydrological responses in downstream areas understanding future changes in reservoir inflow such as the magnitude and timing of extreme events in headwater basins is important for water resource management e g alexander et al 2007 therefore this work should enhance the scientific understanding of changes in local hydrological patterns nested within large river basins and offer baseline information for adaptive water resource management in a changing climate specifically this research addresses two questions 1 how will near term hydroclimate changes affect the volume and timing of both low and high flows in catchments upstream of reservoirs 2 what types of reservoirs and water resource regions across the conus will be more vulnerable to future climate conditions section 2 of this paper describes the downscaled climate change projections hydrologic simulations and the data used for the analyses section 3 focuses on the evaluation of the hydrologic modeling the effects of hydroclimate changes on the volume and timing of inflows hydrological extremes and the implications for reservoir inflows the conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 methods and data 2 1 selection of reservoirs and gauge stations to investigate the effects of climate change on reservoir inflows across the conus and to identify signals induced by climate change we selected multiple analyzable pairs of reservoirs and gauge stations that 1 are mostly unregulated and have minimum human influence 2 have sufficient historic streamflow observations i e at least 10 years of records between 1981 and 2012 for model validation and 3 possess an upstream drainage area greater than 100 km2 this selection criterion allowed us to identify signals that were mainly caused by climate change however we recognize that such an approach does not account for any hydrologic changes resulting from climate change driven land cover variations or other human activities e g land use dam regulation and flow diversion identification of unregulated gauge stations was based on the united states geological survey usgs geospatial attributes of gauges for evaluating streamflow gages ii database falcone et al 2010 falcone 2011 daily discharge data were obtained from the usgs national water information system nwis gauge stations in addition the complete list of reservoirs along with their main purposes was obtained from the global reservoir and dam database grand lehner et al 2011 using the listed criteria a total of 178 pairs of reservoirs and gauge stations were first identified fig 1 and supplementary table s1 the selected reservoirs were then categorized based on their main purposes which include flood control hydroelectricity irrigation water supply and others i e navigation recreation and fisheries although a majority of the reservoirs are in fact multi purpose to focus our discussion and analysis we only considered their main purpose as reported in the grand database see supplementary table s1 after model evaluation and validation described in sections 2 3 and 3 1 we further sub selected 138 of 178 subbasins that had better model performance to support the full analysis 2 2 climate projections in this study an ensemble of high resolution climate projections were generated from a hybrid framework that downscaled ten general circulation models gcms from coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 to 4 km spatial resolution over the conus first each of the ten gcms was dynamically downscaled to 18 km resolution using regional climate model version 4 regcm4 giorgi et al 2012 the regcm4 downscaling consisted of 40 years in the baseline period 1966 2005 and 40 years in the near term future period 2011 2050 under representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 the 10 models were selected based on the availability of gcms with three dimensional atmospheric fields at a sub daily timescale which is necessary for dynamical downscaling these ensemble members are access1 0 bcc csm1 1 ccsm4 cmcc cm fgoals g2 ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 mpi esm mr mri cgcm3 and nor esm1 m although this study selected a ten member ensemble for climate projections projected changes in precipitation and temperature in the ensemble members do not exhibit obvious bias in any one direction compared with climate projections from 97 cmip5 gcms under four emission scenarios rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 brekke et al 2014 fig 2 the results from these regcm4 simulations were further spatially interpolated and statistically bias corrected to the targeted 1 24 4 km geographical grid using a quantile based bias correction method ashfaq et al 2010 2013 2016 the 1 24 4 km resolution 1966 2005 monthly precipitation and temperature values from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 were used as the historic observation for bias correction the results of these regcm4 simulations are detailed in ashfaq et al 2016 2 3 hydrologic model simulations the vic hydrologic model version 4 1 1 liang et al 1994 1996 cherkauer et al 2003 was used to simulate streamflow based on the observed and projected meteorological forcing we used a calibrated vic model implementation at a 1 24 4 km resolution for the entire conus with a 3 h time step oubeidillah et al 2014 and naz et al 2016 provide a detailed description of the vic model setup parameters and results for model calibration and validation oubeidillah et al 2014 used the simulated monthly vic total runoff i e surface runoff plus baseline by the usgs waterwatch runoff data set brakebill et al 2011 at each of the 2107 usgs eight digit hydrologic subbasins huc8 across the conus driven by the gridded 1980 2012 conus temperature and precipitation observations from daymet thornton et al 1997 and prism daly et al 2008 and the reanalyzed surface wind speeds from the north american regional reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 vic model version 4 1 1 was executed in the full energy mode in which the model iteratively solves the energy and water balances at a 3 h time step to manage the large amount of data i e around half a million grid points in the us all forcing soil vegetation global parameter and output flux files are organized according to the huc8 subbasins the calibrated vic model simulations are hereinafter referred to as control run simulation to simulate future hydrological response to climate change the daily bias corrected regcm4 outputs i e daily minimum and maximum temperature and daily precipitation were used to drive the calibrated vic model to run the model at a 3 hourly time step the daily precipitation data were temporally disaggregated by equally apportioning days to 3 hourly intervals temperature humidity downward short and long wave radiation data were derived at 3 hourly intervals from the daily temperature range and daily total precipitation using methods described in bohn et al 2013 however previous studies have found that this approach could result in relative humidity trends opposite to those in the driving gcms thus affecting the simulated runoff bohn et al 2013 pierce et al 2013 in order to ensure that the vic model did not significantly alter the projected trends by regcm4 we compared the regionally averaged projected changes future minus baseline in annual net shortwave radiation net longwave radiation relative humidity and specific humidity between the regcm4 and vic model not shown here for the four us mega regions the trends of humidity particularly relative humidity were generally consistent between the regcm4 and vic model however small differences between the vic and regcm4 simulated shortwave and longwave radiation changes were found i e up to 2 therefore we do not expect significant impact of these differences on the simulated hydrological response by the vic model to simulate the daily transport of runoff and drainage to the channels the simulated daily surface runoff and baseflow from each grid cell were routed to the 178 gauge locations through the river network using a linear reservoir model based on lohmann et al 1998 the most important routing parameter flow direction grid was developed using both national elevation dataset gesch et al 2002 and the national hydrography dataset plus epa 2010 while the flow directions can be derived through standard geographic information system software packages e g archydro maidment 2002 the process could result in river networks inconsistent with the observed ones i e from nhdplus in flat areas and in closed inland basins to avoid this issue we derived the flow direction grids separately for each huc8 using a river burn in technique before calculating flow directions through conventional methods we artificially lowered the elevations of grids that are overlapped with nhdplus rivers the derived flow direction grids were then inspected for inconsistencies between simulated and observed river networks as an example fig 3 shows comparison of delineated river network derived from 1 24 digital elevation model with nhdplus rivers for two selected usgs gauges red triangles upstream of northfork lake reservoirs while the computed flow direction grids could reasonably depict the relatively large river networks in the east they often failed to represent relatively small river networks upstream of the gauge stations in such cases the flow direction grids were manually adjusted to ensure agreement between simulated and observed river networks overall the mean absolute percentage difference and r2 value between the usgs reported drainage areas and the vic modeled drainage areas for the 178 subbasins were 9 and 0 99 respectively although the high resolution 1 24 vic model grid improved the delineation of the river networks compared with other commonly used 1 8 vic model applications the grid resolution may still be insufficient to model streamflow for small drainage areas therefore we opted to focus only on locations with upstream drainage areas greater than 100 km2 to further enhance the performance of runoff routing at a finer spatial scale a non grid based routing model such as the routing application for parallel computation of discharge david et al 2011 may be a promising alternative 2 4 analysis to investigate the projected change of reservoir inflows we used four indices 1 q the mean annual streamflow 2 ct the annual center timing of streamflow for a given water year october 1st september 30th ct stewart et al 2005 represents the date since october 1st at which 50 of the total streamflow mass occurred 3 q100 the 100 year return level of daily high streamflow which is used as a proxy for the likelihood of flooding 4 7q10 the 10 year return level of 7 day average low streamflow which is used as a proxy for droughts all analyses were conducted separately for each of the ten ensemble members in the baseline and future periods for all selected locations to estimate both q100 and 7q10 the annual maximum daily streamflow and annual minimum 7 day average streamflow were first summarized and fitted separately into the generalized extreme value gev distribution using the l moments method wang 1997 hosking and wallis 1993 the kolmogorov smirnov test chakravarti et al 1967 was then used to examine the goodness of fit of the gev the results of these analyses were used to calculate the percentage change future minus baseline baseline in projected annual flow q high streamflow q100 low streamflow 7q10 and change future minus baseline in streamflow timing ct for each ensemble member to evaluate the effects of hydrologic extremes on reservoir storage changes in the selected subbasins were also summarized by the reservoirs main usage additionally the multi model uncertainty for the simulated results was also examined to understand the robustness of simulated changes across all ensemble members 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrologic model validation for the period of 1981 2012 we evaluated the simulated streamflow at each selected gauge location using usgs streamflow observations the observed versus simulated annual average streamflow are illustrated in fig 4 a and b the monthly coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 values between observed and simulated streamflow are shown in fig 4 c and d the daily r2 and nse at 84 stations with complete historic records are shown in fig 4 e and f in general the vic annual streamflows closely matched the observed ones for many basins across the us monthly coefficient values ranged from 0 2 to 0 9 with 65 of subbasins 116 having a nse greater than 0 5 about 81 percent of the subbasins 145 had a r2 greater than 0 5 fig 4c and d at the daily time scale the vic model also indicated acceptable performance with nse and r2 values both ranged from 0 1 to 0 8 for the selected subbasins in the eastern us new england mid atlantic south atlantic gulf ohio valley and tennessee and across the western us colorado great basin pacific northwest and california the vic modeled streamflow results are in good agreement with the observed streamflow at both daily and monthly time scales however in the central us missouri arkansas white red and texas the vic model performance was relatively low for both monthly and daily streamflow with a r2 of approximately 0 4 and an nse between 0 2 and 0 4 previous studies that applied hydrologic modeling across the conus have also shown poor model performance in arid regions and generally better performance in the eastern and western us newman et al 2015 clark et al 2008 martinez and gupta 2010 the low performance of the model in the central us can be attributed to uncertainties from atmospheric forcing data static input data e g soil and land cover types or inherent model limitations for example naz et al 2016 showed improved runoff simulations after bias correction of forcing data with prism dataset and adjustment of vegetation and soil parameterizations furthermore it is challenging for the land surface models to correctly represent the saturation excess runoff in arid to semi arid regions in such areas low runoff observations may induce low values of the infiltration parameters during calibration which may prevent the accurate simulation of runoff peak flows resulting in lower nse values the density of precipitation and streamflow gauges is also relatively low in the central us which makes model calibration and validation more challenging in this region note that the calibration of vic model provided by oubeidillah et al 2014 was carried out at the huc8 scale using waterwatch monthly runoff data it was not evaluated for hydrologic extremes at daily time scale because of the unavailability of daily resolution conus runoff observations nevertheless earlier studies using vic model calibrated at monthly time scale have been shown to successfully reproduce the ratio of q100 to the mean annual flood for different climatic conditions in the western us e g hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 moreover this study mainly focuses on the percentage changes instead of absolute projections which is shown to be relatively less sensitive to model calibration and other possible sources of hydrologic model biases tohver et al 2014 salathé et al 2014 given the modeling limitations we analyzed only the results for 138 basins where monthly nse values were greater than 0 4 in the following sections 3 2 changes in inflow volume and timing fig 5 shows the projected changes in streamflow volume and timing for the selected 138 reservoir inflow locations across the conus the projected multi model median annual volume showed an average increase of 4 5 for the 2011 2050 future period relative to the 1966 2005 baseline period fig 5a however the change is spatially heterogeneous across the us at the annual timescale the most pronounced change was an increase 10 25 in q in the central us upper mississippi missouri arkansas white red and texas gulf and to a lesser degree in the great lakes ohio valley and south atlantic gulf regions 1 7 fig 5a and table 1 compared to the eastern and central us flows in the western us were mostly projected to decrease on average 17 of 29 basins exhibit a 3 decrease in q in the pacific northwest region and 7 of 8 locations exhibit a 5 decrease in q in the california region table 1 overall the majority of ensemble members agree on the direction of change in q fig 6 a analyses of ct showed that on average the center of mass of streamflow was projected to arrive earlier by 4 days for 73 of the basins 101 of 138 table 1 earlier streamflow was more pronounced in the western us i e 4 14 days earlier table 1 and fig 5b ct was also projected to arrive earlier by 1 4 days for basins in the missouri upper mississippi great lakes and new england regions in contrast ct in the southeastern us was projected to arrive later fig 5b particularly in the texas gulf region where a 2 6 day delay was projected however the degree of consensus among models is low therefore greater uncertainty exists in the direction of change in ct projections fig 6b the changes in streamflow volume and shifts in streamflow timing will likely affect water availability in the reservoirs fig 5c and d present the changes in q and ct for all basins grouped by main reservoir use the results showed that the streamflow increases are likely to influence the inflows to the flood control and water supply reservoirs for instance 85 of basins that are upstream of flood control and water supply reservoirs were projected to receive increased annual streamflow fig 5c and earlier ct fig 5d similarly q was also projected to increase in 52 of basins upstream of hydropower reservoirs fig 5c mostly located in the southern atlantic gulf tennessee and ohio valley regions in contrast to the eastern and central us q was projected to decrease in the western us basins where irrigation and hydropower are the main reservoir purposes in those regions 61 and 47 of basins that are upstream of irrigation and hydropower reservoirs respectively showed a decrease in q in addition to the decrease in streamflow volume the headwater basins in the western us showed pronounced earlier ct up to 14 days particularly for reservoirs that are used for irrigation fig 5d 3 3 changes in hydrological extremes fig 7 shows ensemble median changes in q100 and 7q10 for each selected location an increase in q100 implies a higher probability of flood whereas a decrease in 7q10 implies higher probability of drought our results indicate a robust increase in the magnitude of q100 for nearly all locations the strongest increases up to 70 are projected in subbasins across the central and eastern us fig 7a and relatively low uncertainty across the ensemble members as all models agree on the direction of change for all categories of reservoirs fig 6c among different reservoir types q100 was projected to increase by 44 on average for basins that are upstream of flood control reservoirs table 2 fig 7c similarly most basins upstream of hydropower reservoirs across the eastern us exhibit an increase in q100 35 table 2 fig 7a for 7q10 a strong reduction up to 40 was projected in most basins across the eastern us fig 7b in contrast most basins across the central us showed increases in low flows 5 to 50 with the exception of some basins located in the great lakes and ohio valley regions that projected decreases of up to 15 in 7q10 fig 7b increases in low streamflow in the central us were more likely to be caused by higher subsurface storage in the summer season driven by increases in projected precipitation throughout the year naz et al 2016 however 7q10 exhibited higher uncertainty as the degree of consensus among cmip5 models was low i e only half of the models projected decreases fig 6d examination of the changes in 7q10 with respect to reservoir use suggests that projected changes in 7q10 were more severe in the headwater basins upstream of the hydropower reservoirs i e 33 of 46 subbasins showed decreasing 7q10 by up to 11 table 2 and fig 7d however results were mixed for basins upstream of the flood control reservoirs with increasing 7q10 up to 27 in the central us and decreasing 7q10 in the western us and along the lower mississippi river table 2 and fig 7d for basins upstream of irrigation water supply and other reservoirs 7q10 was projected to decrease from 9 to 20 table 2 with more notable decreases across the california upper colorado mid atlantic tennessee and ohio valley regions 3 4 limitations and uncertainties there are multiple sources of uncertainty in high resolution future hydro climate projections including emission scenario gcms structure gcms initial condition downscaling approach and hydrologic model structure and parameters chen et al 2011 kay et al 2009 wu et al 2015 zhao et al 2016a in this study we utilized dynamically downscaled multi member regional hydro climate projections over the conus ashfaq et al 2016 which is helpful in resolving some of the challenges that are associated with the gcms however we acknowledge that a number of uncertainties still exist that may have an influence on the simulated hydrological response for instance use of a single regional climate model rcm underrepresents the uncertainty associated with the rcm s internal variability giorgi and gutowski 2015 similarly choice of a different downscaling approach e g using statistical downscaling and or a different hydrologic model may influence results at specific locations therefore results in this study are intended to provide overall and regional trends across a large number of subbasins in the conus rather than getting a precise prediction at a specific location within the scope of this study we further note that in the rain dominated regions the uncertainties in simulated hydrologic extremes are driven by the uncertainties in the mean and extreme precipitation projections across regcm4 ensemble members similarly uncertainties in the temperature projections across regcm4 ensemble members can potentially impact the simulated response in the snow dominated watersheds in the snow dominated watersheds additional uncertainties can be introduced by the selection of snow modeling approaches e g energy balance versus temperature based which may result in different sensitivities to increasing temperature and consequently influence extreme flows in the simulations therefore it is possible that a single hydrologic model based projections such as this study potentially underrepresent the uncertainty associated with the projected changes in cold regions as discussed earlier uncertainties in this study may also attributed to the fact that the vic model calibration was performed using monthly runoff data and no calibration was carried out for hydrologic extremes at a fine temporal scale additionally the vic model does not explicitly represent shallow groundwater which may impact the model s ability to estimates drought conditions e g groundwater effects can either cause the hydrologic droughts more persistent than meteorological drought or it may buffer the precipitation deficit this limitation can potentially enhance the uncertainty in our results for those basins where interactions between surface and groundwater processes are strong e g in the central us where the vic model performance is relatively lower than the eastern and western us given these limitations a detailed analysis is needed to investigate the uncertainties resulting from hydrologic modeling or climate model projections and their impact on the projected changes in hydrological extremes which is beyond the scope of this study finally this study analyzed only changes in the headwater basins located upstream of reservoirs and did not account for the total impact of upstream water supply to reservoirs and or contribution from upstream reservoirs similarly effects of human activities on hydrological cycle and thus on extremes are ignored that can also be significant for highly managed watersheds particular in the drier regions land use changes have the potential to enhance the overall hydrologic response in the drier regions if the climate becomes much drier in the future zhang et al 2016 therefore further studies should be conducted to incorporate combined effects of land use change and climate variability into the hydroclimate modeling framework for more reliable assessments of hydrological extremes and their impacts on reservoirs 4 summary and conclusions this paper analyzes potential changes in q ct 7q10 and q100 due to increases in radiative forcing and the implications of such changes for reservoir inflows these projections are based on an ensemble of high resolution simulations by the vic model naz et al 2016 forced with a ten member ensemble of dynamically and statistically downscaled near term regional climate projections ashfaq et al 2016 overall projected changes in reservoir inflows in the future period 2011 2050 relative to the baseline period 1966 2005 exhibit a number of robust features 1 for most of the headwater basins upstream of hydropower reservoirs across the western us decreases in 7q10 and earlier ct 4 14 days were found this suggests that hydroelectricity production may be reduced in the future particularly during the summer when it is needed the most in contrast changes in ensemble median q100 in subbasins across the western us were relatively small however increases in projected winter precipitation naz et al 2016 and earlier streamflow may increase the likelihood of floods in winter and drought like conditions in the summer bartos and chester 2015 also suggest that the vulnerability of hydropower plants to droughts is extremely high in the arid and semi arid southwestern us similar changes in the hydrological extremes over the western us are also reported in pagán et al 2016 2 in the central us q100 was projected to increase in most basins with more pronounced increases upstream of flood control 44 and hydropower 35 reservoirs the storage provided by the large flood control reservoirs in the central us might be able to help reduce the impacts of high streamflow however projected increases in the probability of floods can be an issue for dams that are built for purposes other than flood control on the other hand such streamflow changes do not necessarily translate into a proportional increase in hydropower production for hydropower plants in fact depending on the storage capacity of a dam a site that is projected to experience greater discharge volume could actually see lowered hydropower production as a result of more extreme high and low streamflow events lehner et al 2005 3 in the eastern us our analysis suggests that hydropower and flood control reservoirs are vulnerable to changes in both kinds of hydrologic extremes because most locations exhibited a decrease in 7q10 of up to 20 and an increase in q100 of up to 65 unlike those in the western us most of the reservoirs in the eastern us are within year reservoirs i e they refill and spill several times in a year with limited storage capacity singh et al 2014 projected increases in winter precipitation combined with earlier streamflow suggest there is a likelihood of future flood events in the winter and drought like conditions in the summer which could complicate water resource management decisions e g balance between flood control and hydropower generation additionally expected increases in both floods and droughts can lead to an increase in streamflow variability in these regions singh et al 2014 which could make reservoirs in the eastern us more vulnerable to projected climate conditions despite the limitations as discussed above the results showed in this paper should be beneficial for establishing future water management practices and strategies to adequately address climate change effect for example currently most dams in the western us control floods in winter store water from much of the spring snowmelt and release water to meet summer demand if the amount and timing of streamflow is altered as a result of climate change as shown in this study the existing reservoir operation rules will need to be revised brekke et al 2009 a future extension can potentially look at the storage capacity in relation to the impacts identified in this study the proposed modeling framework can be further refined by combining more predictive water resource management models zhao et al 2016b voisin et al 2013 into a high resolution large scale modeling system that can be used to investigate the combined effects of climate impacts and water management on downstream discharge

assessing the effects of remedial measures i e in which time period and to what extent an improvement in groundwater status can be expected generally groundwater within a river basin aquifer is a mixture of two main sources a precipitation which infiltrates through a soil layer into an aquifer and b river water in some cases the third important groundwater source might also be very old

determine fractions of the sava river water in groundwater samples using isotopes δ 18o and δ 2h in relation to low and high precipitation levels in 2010 and 2011 2 to estimate groundwater mrts using 3h and 3h 3he methods 3 to check the groundwater vulnerability to pollution using 3h and no3 concentrations these new hydrological data would serve as a base for an improvement of the hydrogeological conceptual models of the ljubljansko polje aquifer system and especially 3h 3he data which are to our knowledge obtained for the first time in this area they might be even used as calibration targets

ljubljana and its surroundings groundwater is exploited from four pumping stations šentvid kleče hrastje and jarški prod natural conditions are characterized by fast groundwater flow strong interconnection between surface and groundwater and elevated vulnerability to pollution bračič železnik and jamnik 2005 the ljubljansko polje is located at the eastern part of the ljubljanska kotlina fig 1 this tectonic depression formulated in the early pleistocene along the main neotectonic fault system running in the east west direction premru 2005 occasional seismic activities indicate that the basin formation is still in progress its elevations vary from 324 m in stanežiče to the 270 m in zalog which are located in the eastern and western sides of the ljubljansko polje respectively geographical boundaries of the basin are defined by surrounded hills with elevations up to 669 m at the šmarna gora which are composed of permian and carboniferous slate claystone and sandstone these layers form a bedrock with variable depths over the ljubljansko polje žlebnik 1971 premru 1983 remainders of paleozoic rocks were also detected at the western and south western areas at depths ranging from 0 to 30 m they represent so called perched aquifers šram 2011 and have an influence on chemical properties of groundwater and transport of pollutants šram et al 2012 a graphical presentation of the perched aquifer is shown in fig 2 the sava river accumulated pleistocene and holocene silty sandy gravels and sandy gravel with lenses of conglomerate in the ljubljansko polje basin fig 2 these

the aquifer is 80 m at kleče 65 m at jarški prod and 58 m at hrastje bračič železnik 2002 the aquifer is protected from polluted subsurface water by layers of clay or clay with gravel only at isolated areas in the central part of the ljubljansko polje and at its western south western and southern marginals bračič železnik et al 2005 in general the direction of the groundwater flow is toward the southeast fig 1 in relation to the ljubljansko polje aquifer system the sava river might be considered as a losing river from medno to šentjakob and as a gaining river downstream of šentjakob fig 1 however the interaction highly depends on the water level and the river bed geology the sava river water do not interact with groundwater where it flows directly over the bedrock the ljubljanica river is a gaining river starting at fužine and continues to gain as it traverses the ljubljansko polje petauer and hiti 2013 another important source of groundwater is local precipitation since the area exhibits a large quantity of precipitation due to its geographic position and subalpine climate the mean annual rainfall of 1400 mm and the mean air temperature between 8 c and 10 c were observed arso url http meteo arso gov si met en archive however in the 60 years long time period the maximum and minimum precipitation amount of 1798 mm and 998 mm were observed in the years 2010 and 2011 respectively arso url http meteo arso gov si met en archive in addition underground groundwater recharge from the neighbouring groundwater bodies should be mentioned but it occurs only at edges segments of the ljubljansko polje aquifer system where the bedrock is deep therefore the ljubljansko polje aquifer system is also recharged by groundwater from the ljubljansko barje aquifer ljubljana moors in the south as well as from the kamniško bistriško polje and the kranjsko sorško polje in the north jamnik et al 2000 high groundwater table may also change this interaction from recharging to discharging although the underground recharge is still not well known its fraction in the aquifer was estimated to be negligible in relation to other groundwater sources cerar and urbanc 2013 the hydrodynamic in the ljubljansko polje aquifer is also influenced by groundwater pumping for water supply and industrial needs andjelov et al 2005 oscillations of the piezometric groundwater table shown in fig 3 occurred because of variations in pumping rates especially at the well kleče 11 the ljubljansko polje aquifer system has intergranular porosity and an unconfined groundwater table which is located on average around 20 25 m below the surface the main permeable formation is composed of gravels and sands with lenses of conglomerates and muddy gravels and has variable properties transmissivity ranges from 43 2 to 4752 m2 d 1 storage capacity from 0 01 to 0 1 and effective porosity from 5 to 15 bračič železnik et al 2005 vižintin et al 2009 2 2 sampling and analysis samples were collected monthly over one hydrological cycle from march 2010 to december 2011 from 1 the aquifer under ambient non pumping conditions at seven wells at three different water supplies kleče hrastje and jarški prod 2 the sava river at šentjakob and 3 precipitation at geological survey in ljubljana bežigrad the sampling locations with some descriptive parameters are summarized in table 1 and graphically presented in fig 1 perforated screens in the pumping wells range between 205 m and 278 m a s l fig 2 dissolved oxygen and water temperature were measured using a ysi model 58 meter and a ysi 5239 do probe with high sensitivity membranes electrical conductivity was measured using a corning 316 meter with a two point calibration of 0 and 1413 µs cm 1 dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity measurements had precision of 5 a corning 315 high sensitivity ph meter with an orion ross combination ph electrode calibrated with low ionic strength buffers of 4 1 and 6 97 corrected for temperature was used to measure ph in the field as close to the water temperature as possible the reproducibility of field ph determinations was 0 02 ph units stable isotope measurements of oxygen o and hydrogen h were performed in 260 samples results for o and h are reported using conventional delta δ notation δ 18o and δ 2h respectively in permil relative to vsmow the isotopic composition of oxygen δ 18o was measured after equilibration with reference co2 epstein and mayeda 1953 on a multiflow continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime gv instruments while reduction on cr at 800 c was used to determine the isotopic composition of hydrogen δ 2h in water gehre et al 1996 on a varian mat 250 mass spectrometer the accuracy of the measurements were 0 1 for δ 18o and 1 for δ 2h the 3h measurements were performed at hydrosys labor analytical laboratory ltd budapest hungary according to standard procedure fs 78 15 aku 1995 volumes of the water samples were reduced from 250 ml to 14 15 ml by electrolytic enrichment factor of tritium enrichment is about 15 16 the tritium activities of enriched water samples were counted by super low level liquid scintillation counter lsc the tritium 3h concentration in water is expressed in terms of the tritium unit tu with accuracy of 0 4 tu concentrations of no3 were determined in 109 samples previously filtered through 0 45 μm nylon filter on a dionex ics 2500 ic accuracy 2 seven samples taken at kleče hrastje and jarški prod wells in june 2010 were used for groundwater dating by the 3h 3he method helium isotope analyses were performed using a mass analyzers products model 215 50 magnetic sector field mass spectrometer 1 and ne ar kr and xe were measured using a standard research srs model rga 300 quadrupole mass spectrometer 2 at the university of utah usa in these samples also 3h measurements were performed by the 3he in growth method clarke et al 1976 with an accuracy of 3 the uncertainty in 3h 3he dating depends on measurement errors and upon the suitability of models used to determine the component of total 3he that comes from tritium decay 3hetrit the 3hetrit component is estimated by subtracting the atmospheric and terrigenic both crustal and mantle components from total 3he solomon and cook 2000 the atmospheric component of 3he was determined from ne ar kr and xe measurements using the closed equilibrium ce model aeschbach hertig et al 2000 the terrigenic component 3heterr depends on the 3he 4he ratio of mantle rocks mantle fluids and lithospheric crustal he production and can vary over several orders of magnitude the 3hetrit component for samples with large concentrations of total he more than an order of magnitude above atmospheric solubility or mantle derived fluids with high 3he 4he ratios are sensitive to the assumed terrigenic 3he 4he ratio making dating problematic solomon and cook 2000 we assumed a 3he 4he ratio of 2 10 8 for terrigenic he mamyrin and tolstikhin 1984 but let this value vary up to 1 10 7 when calculating the uncertainty of 3h 3he ages the measured 3he 4he ratio is presented as r ra where r is the 3he 4he ratio measured in the sample and ra is the 3he 4he ratio in the air 1 384 10 6 the sava river discharge and precipitation in ljubljana collected at daily intervals were obtained from environmental agency of the republic of slovenia arso www arso si 2 3 calculation methods data analysis normally distributed data were analysed by the one way anova for testing differences in measured parameters according to a season and a location in the statistical test probability p values of less than 05 were used to indicate a significance level if the significance was noted in a response factor the calculation was followed by post hoc testing using the tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test all statistical analyses were performed using statistica software package v 7 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa groundwater dating by the 3 h 3 he method the mean residence time mrt which is based on the 3 h 3 he method was computed using the following equation solomon and cook 2000 1 t λ 1 ln 3 he 3 h 1 where λ is the 3h decay constant of 0 0556 y 1 3h is the measured 3h activity and 3he is the tritiogenic 3he concentration defined as the amount of the total 3he produced by the 3h decay the total amount of 3he in groundwater can be expressed as 2 3 he tot 3 he atm 3 he 3 he nuc 3 he man where subscripts atm nuc and man refer to he of the atmospheric origin and he that is produced by nuclear reactions in the subsurface and he of the mantle origin respectively solomon and cook 2000 because it is difficult to separate 3henuc from 3heman they are often lumped together and simply referred to as 3heterr terrigenic 3he when a mixture of water with longer and shorter mrt is present the mrt estimated with the 3h 3he method is biased towards the shorter mrt małoszewski and zuber 1982 isotope mass balance a fraction of local precipitation versus the sava river water in groundwater was calculated by the two component mixing model the contribution of both sources could be estimated using the following equation 3 δ 18 o gw f rw δ 18 o rw f p δ 18 o p 4 1 f rw f p where frw and fp are respective river water and precipitation fractions while δ 18 ogw δ 18 orw and δ 18 op are the isotopic compositions of oxygen in groundwater river water and precipitation respectively lumped dispersion model transit time distribution was performed by the lumped dispersion model stichler et al 1986 which assumes a tracer transport controlled by advection and dispersion processes the g τ function is then defined as follows małoszewski and zuber 1982 5 g τ 1 τ 4 π p d τ τ m exp 1 τ τ m 2 4 p d τ τ m where τm is the mean transit time of water while pd is the dimensionless dispersion parameter which describes the variance of the distribution in the case of bank filtration it can in large approximation be defined as 6 p d α l x where αl is the dispersivity m and x is the mean flow distance between the input and output locations m pd of 0 2 was used in our calculation the relationship between input crw t and output cgw t concentrations in our case δ 18o values is given by the convolution integral which for non decaying tracers is defined as follows 7 c gw t f r w 0 t c rw t τ g τ d τ where τ is the transit time of a single tracer particle between input and output and fr w is the fraction of river water in the pumping well 3 results the entire data set of basic physical and isotopic parameters obtained over the two years period 2010 2011 are presented in the electronic supplement table s1 the main focus of the paper is related to δ 18o δ 2h 3h and no3 thus the means ranges and standard deviations in groundwater the sava river water and the weighted means ranges and standard deviations in precipitation are shown in table 2 while concentrations of the noble gases determined in june 2010 are presented in table 3 unusual high 3h activities up to 12 5 tu in the sava river water and groundwater were observed in november 2010 table s1 it is assumed that they are related to a systematic analytical error and thus excluded from the further analysis the decision was accepted according to the following reasons 1 as reported by vreča et al 2014 there was no high 3h activity in precipitation observed at that time 2 the event is not correlated with any other hydrological or isotopic parameters and 3 the rapid increase in 3h activity in the sava river water and in groundwater was observed at the same time period which would require unrealistic nearly zero transit time from the river to the wells 3 1 precipitation as already mentioned minimum and maximum annual precipitation over the 60 years period before 2011 were observed exactly over the sampling period 2010 2011 arso url http meteo arso gov si met en archive the total annual rainfall amount of 1798 mm and 998 mm were observed in 2010 and 2011 respectively the maximum monthly precipitation of 140 mm and the maximum discharge of the sava river at šentjakob of 1022 m3 s 1 were observed in september 2010 at the same time the signal of flooding was recorded and its influence on the piezometric groundwater table in the aquifer was observed fig 3 in precipitation only δ 18o values were determined values ranged from 13 9 to 4 9 with a weighted mean of 8 7 2 7 significant differences in δ 18o values in precipitation in different seasons were observed p 01 the marked seasonal variation is typical for the northern hemisphere vreča et al 2008 fig 3 shows that the mean δ 18o values in precipitation over periods from october 2010 to march 2011 and from april to september in 2010 and 2011 were different 10 6 and 7 0 respectively thus winter precipitation was more 18o enriched mainly due to the lower temperature the previous investigation indicated that the local meteoric water line in ljubljana so called ljubljana meteoric water line lmwl δ 2 h 8 06 0 08 δ 18 o 9 84 0 71 is close to the global meteoric water line and shows the predominant influence of atlantic air masses in ljubljana although the influence of mediterranean air masses could not be excluded this contribution was estimated to be in the range 15 26 vreča et al 2008 in addition a recent study of precipitation at the reactor centre in ljubljana over the period 2007 2010 was performed by vreča et al 2014 and the obtained data in 2010 are comparable to our δ 18o values in their study the local meteoric water line was calculated and the slope and the intercept was found to be similar to the lmwl calculated from the long term data from 1981 to 2006 thus the weighted mean δ 18o and δ 2h values together with 3h activities obtained in the study provided by vreča et al 2014 are included in table 2 in addition δ 2h values were calculated from the lmwl for each month in 2011 vreča et al 2014 and included in table s1 the measured 3h activities in precipitation are comparable to those from the past studies in slovenia and neighbouring countries the mean annual 3h activity is 9 1 tu for the period 1998 2010 in ljubljana while the mean values for zagreb croatia precipitation are 8 6 tu and 9 0 tu for periods 1998 2010 and 2007 2010 respectively vreča et al 2014 horvatinčič et al 2011 presented precipitation data observed in zagreb over the year 2010 that ranged from 4 to 14 tu with the highest values observed in summer 3 2 the sava river water temperature of the sava river varied from 4 9 c in march 2011 to 16 1 c in july 2010 table s1 electrical conductivity ec from 236 to 392 µs cm 1 and ph from 7 57 to 8 46 while no3 concentrations ranged from 3 47 mg l 1 to 6 82 mg l 1 with the mean value of 4 55 1 29 mg l 1 tables 2 and s1 temporal differences were not significant in the cases of all three parameters ec p 091 ph p 097 no3 p 142 the discharge and δ 18o values for the sava river over the sampling period 2010 2011 are presented in fig 3 over this period similar trend in δ 18o values in the sava river water and precipitation was observed fig 3 previous investigation indicated that the sava river responds quickly to precipitation which is further reflected in the isotopic composition of the sava river water ogrinc et al 2008 δ 18o values of the sava river water ranged from 9 7 to 8 5 and δ 2h values ranged from 66 4 to 57 6 with the mean δ 18o value of 9 2 0 4 and the mean δ 2h value of 62 0 2 9 table 2 marked seasonal variability was reflected in the isotopic composition of the sava river water p 04 with intra seasonal variations under average flow conditions the sava river water tends to be isotopically depleted in 18o relative to local precipitation the depletion in heavy isotopes in the sava river water likely reflects the dominance of precipitation infiltrating at higher altitude areas the alps rather than locally at the ljubljansko polje ogrinc et al 2008 the 3h activity of the sava river water ranged from 4 5 to 8 7 tu with the highest value observed in august 2010 fig 4 the mean 3h activity was 6 4 1 3 tu significant temporal differences were observed in 3h activity p 0 3 3 groundwater groundwater temperature ranged from 10 2 to 13 6 c the highest temperature was measured at hrastje 8 and the lowest at jarški prod 1 table s1 statistical analyses showed significant differences in temperatures between locations p 034 temperature observed at jarški prod 1 differed significantly from temperature at hrastje 3 and hrastje 8 on the other hand no significant temporal differences in groundwater temperatures were observed p 103 ph ranged from 6 98 to 8 44 with the mean value of 7 75 0 33 table s1 the lowest ph was observed at kleče 8 in august 2010 and the highest at hrastje 3 and kleče 8 in april 2011 spatial and temporal differences in ph were not statistically significant p 070 p 098 in the case of electrical conductivity ec and no3 concentrations significant differences between locations were observed for both parameters p 0001 while temporal differences were not significant p 098 p 477 this indicates different geological and anthropogenic influences on groundwater at different sampling locations due to changes of the aquifer properties and the land use at a local scale ec ranged from 203 to 640 µs cm 1 with the lowest values observed at kleče 12 in june 2010 and the highest at hrastje 8 in april 2010 table s1 ec in jarški prod differed significantly from the other locations in addition the difference in ec was also observed between kleče and hrastje and was found to be higher at hrastje then at kleče the no3 concentrations in groundwater ranged from 1 40 to 50 3 mg l 1 at kleče 8 and hrastje 3 respectively table s1 with the mean values ranging from 7 10 4 47 to 34 3 11 5 mg l 1 table 2 the lowest and the highest mean no3 concentrations were observed at jarški prod 1 and hrastje 8 respectively the δ 18o values of groundwater ranged from 9 4 at jarški prod 1 to 8 4 at kleče 8 with the mean δ 18o value of 8 8 0 2 the δ 2h values ranged from 63 8 at kleče 12 to 55 0 at hrastje 3 with the mean δ 2h value of 59 1 2 2 tables 1 and 2 the 3h activities of groundwater ranged from 3 6 to 7 0 tu at hrastje 3 and jarški prod 1 respectively with the mean values ranging from 5 4 0 8 tu to 6 0 0 6 tu table 2 and can be classified as modern waters no significant differences according to the location and the season were observed for any of the three environmental isotopes δ 18o p 207 p 062 δ 2h p 247 p 534 3h p 200 p 130 noble gases were also determined in groundwater table 3 values of r ra range from 0 153 at kleče 8 to 1 027 at jarški prod 3 measured 4he values range from 3 49 10 7 ccstp g 1 to 4 93 10 8 ccstp g 1 and are highly correlated with the helium isotope ratio as given by r ra calculated concentrations of terrigenic 4he 4he produced in the subsurface from the decay of u and th are significant in some samples with a maximum occurring at kleče 8 of 3 10 7 ccstp g 1 all samples have ne concentrations near equilibrium with the atmosphere with values ranging from only 2 10 10 7 to 2 48 10 7 ccstp g 1 mean residence time mrt calculated with the eq 1 ranged from 2 1 to 8 4 years with uncertainties ranging from 2 8 to 6 2 years table 3 uncertainties in the estimated mrts were evaluated using the monte carlo method in which the input parameters used to calculate the mrt were varied by plus minus one standard deviation from the mean measured value table 3 however it was not possible to estimate a 3h 3he age mrt for the wells at kleče due to significant levels of the terrigenic 4he and the uncertainty in the 3he 4he ratio of this he 4 discussion 4 1 stable isotope composition the mean δ 18o and δ 2h values of groundwater samples plot between the lmwl vreča et al 2008 and the sava river regression line ogrinc et al 2008 showing that groundwater is directly influenced by both sources the infiltration of local precipitation and the recharge from the sava river water fig 5 despite the fact that water supplies effect groundwater mrt groundwater flow dynamics fastest recharge of the sava river water over days without precipitation and consequently also isotopic composition of groundwater the environmental isotope fingerprints still detect infiltrated local precipitation thus it is assumed that production wells should not have significant influence on our data interpretation the groundwater samples scatter around the regression line characterised by the equation δ 2h 3 47 δ 18o 28 61 with r2 0 87 the mean d excess d δ 2h 8 δ 18o of 11 4 for the ljubljansko polje aquifer system is similar to d excess of 11 3 found in the sava river water at šentjakob table 2 thus the sava river water reflected the contribution of precipitation of the mixed atlantic mediterranean origin ogrinc et al 2008 based on the mean average δ 18o and δ 2h values two groups of wells can be clearly defined fig 5 group 1 jarški prod 1 jarški prod 3 kleče 8 and kleče 12 where the sava river water represents a significant or dominant contribution to groundwater group 2 hrastje 3 hrastje 8 and kleče 11 with higher δ 18o and δ 2h values than the group 1 indicating greater influence of local precipitation the δ 18o and δ 2h values show that isotopic composition of groundwater samples taken from individual wells is either more similar to that of local precipitation or to the isotopic composition of the sava river water urbanc and jamnik 1998 the enrichment with both heavy isotopes 18o and 2h along the regression line indicates mixing of water from a river with infiltrated local precipitation in an aquifer higher δ 18o and δ 2h values observed in groundwater in the group 2 could not be explained by evaporation of the sava river water since the sava river is a torrential river where the evaporation effect can be neglected ogrinc et al 2008 it is also known that the ljubljansko polje aquifer system is partly recharged with groundwater from the ljubljansko barje aquifer jamnik et al 2000 which could have an influence on the isotopic composition of groundwater at kleče however in the study provided by cerar and urbanc 2013 it was shown that the contribution of groundwater from the ljubljansko barje aquifer at kleče is of minor importance this estimation was performed based on molar ca mg ratios ranging between 2 5 and 3 0 and hco3 data ljubljansko polje has higher ca mg ratios and lower hco3 concentrations comparing to ljubljansko barje aquifer the two groups of groundwater determined in fig 5 could be further justified by geological properties of the aquifer and spatial distribution of the wells there are two main areas where the sava river recharges the aquifer 1 from tacen to the gameljščica tributary and 2 from tomačevo to šentjakob fig 1 the water inflow from the upstream river section reaches kleče while the water inflow from the downstream river section reaches jarški prod the sava river water needs more time to reach hrastje more likely due to the complicated bedrock geometry in this area therefore the signal of the sava river water is smaller there the wells in jarški prod especially the well jarški prod 1 are located close to the sava river bed on the permeable sava river floodplain which is mainly composed of gravel mixed with sand and silt thus it is expected that groundwater in jarški prod has higher fraction of the sava river water fig 6 the kleče and hrastje pumping stations are located on the higher terrace where the aquifer is deeper under the surface and where conglomerate and clay appear fig 1 the area around kleče pumping station may also be locally covered with thick lenses of poorly permeable sediments since perched aquifers are present near the kleče station šram 2011 for this reason leaching of the subsurface water is stymied the geological composition of the aquifer at kleče might be one of the reasons why the groundwater mixture at the well kleče 11 differs from the groundwater mixtures at the wells kleče 8 and kleče 12 although they are located close to each other fig 1 in fact perforated screens in the wells at kleče are located at different depths fig 2 it can be seen that the wells kleče 8 and kleče 12 pump groundwater from deeper layers of the aquifer than the well kleče 11 thus different isotopic composition between shallow and deep groundwater might be also an effect of smaller hydraulic conductivity in vertical direction than in horizontal direction statistically significant differences between δ 18o values in the sava river water and local precipitation p 0315 were observed thus a simple isotope mass balance calculation was performed to estimate fractions of each recharge water types in the aquifer first a time constant mixing calculation was performed using eqs 3 and 4 in this calculation for δ 18orw a mean δ 18o value of 9 2 for the sava river was applied table 2 while for δ 18op the mean annual weighted value of 8 6 reported by vreča et al 2014 was used the results of this calculation are presented in fig 6 it was found that local precipitation dominates in the groundwater samples taken from the wells kleče 11 hrastje 3 and hrastje 8 where their fractions are even higher than 85 groundwater pumped from the well kleče 12 has also higher fraction of precipitation 59 while both sources equally contribute to groundwater at the wells kleče 8 and jarški prod 3 the main source of groundwater pumped from the well jarški prod 1 is the sava river it should be mentioned that an influence of both end members are changing during time therefore a possibility of using a time dependent mixing ratios was also investigated the transport of 18o from the sava river towards a production well e g jarški prod 1 was performed with the transit analysis eqs 5 7 a one dimensional solution to the advection dispersion equation with the observed δ 18o in the sava river during the sampling period from march 2010 to october 2011 as input was used fig 7 shows the simulated value of δ 18o at the well with the assumption that the virtual well pumps groundwater which has only one source the sava river water f rw 1 in eq 7 if the groundwater mrt between the sava river and the well is only 10 days then as shown in the dark brown curve in fig 7 the δ 18o value in the well jarški prod 1 should have dropped down to 8 5 shortly after the δ 18o value of the sava river did in september 2010 as it can be seen in fig 7 the longer the mrt is the greater is a delay of the δ 18o peak in the sava river which is also getting more attenuated in time for example if the mrt is 500 days 1 36 years the δ 18o in the well would only change to a value about 9 2 and this change would occur in 500 days after it occurs in the sava river the δ 18o values at the well jarški prod 1 do not show this change the time constant mixing model shows that groundwater from the well jarški prod 1 has the highest fraction of the sava river water thus if this change is not observed in the well jarški prod 1 it is not likely to occur in any of the other wells if the mrt between the sava river and the well jarški prod 1 is about 200 days or longer the expected change would only be about 0 4 or less the data showed that the δ 18o variation in the well jarški prod 1 were only slightly larger than the measurement uncertainty of 0 1 and much smaller than the variation observed in the sava river about 1 0 thus the only plausible explanation why in the well jarški prod 1 where the sava river water is the dominant groundwater source the observed δ 18o variations of the sava river water could not be seen is the mrt longer than one year in this case the dispersion would smooth out variations observed during a year which indicate that the mrt is longer than the period of the oscillation therefore a time constant analysis using mean values is appropriate for this study 4 2 3h and 3h 3he values and mean residence time according to vreča et al 2014 the highest mean weighted 3h activity of 9 9 4 9 tu was observed in precipitation the mean 3h activity in the sava river water was estimated to be 6 4 1 3 tu the mean 3h activities in groundwater were 5 6 0 5 tu and 5 8 0 6 tu in the groups 1 and 2 respectively table 2 the lowest 3h activity of 3 6 tu was observed at hrastje 3 in february 2011 based on the decay of 3h and measurements of 3h activities in groundwater it was estimated that the mean residence times mrts 2 5 years best fit the data of groundwater samples indicating that mostly modern water is present in the ljubljansko polje aquifer system table 3 a similarity in 3h activities between groundwater and the sava river water indicates that the sava river water reaches the wells in less than 10 years al charideh and hasan 2013 more accurate information about the groundwater mrt could be obtained by the 3h 3he method which results are given in table 3 and are summarized as follows kleče 8 and 12 significant amounts of terrigenic 4he and low r ra suggest a mixture of mostly very young water probably from the sava river with some very old water this old water must come from deeper parts of the aquifer with a long but unknown mrt since it has accumulated such a large amount of terrigenic 4he however the 3h data suggest that groundwater contain no more than 10 of this old water otherwise the 3h value would be much lower than the measured ones the presence of very old water in kleče could be a consequence of tectonic factors probably of still active ljubljanski fault at these locations the 3h 3he method could not be used to determine the age or mrt of the groundwater since the presence of very old water can influence this estimation kleče 11 low r ra suggests a mixture of mostly very young water with some very old water but with a lesser amount than in wells kleče 8 and kleče 12 in this well the calculated tritiogenic 3he was slightly negative but our uncertainty analysis showed that the mrt could be of 4 years hrastje 3 and 8 modest amounts of terrigenic 4he and low r ra suggest a water mixture of young and a small amount of old water with a long mrt the mrts are between 3 and 8 years with differences possibly related to the difference in the screened intervals jarški prod 1 and 3 samples do not have component of old water this is young groundwater with the variable mrts of 2 and 7 years 4 3 nitrate concentrations in terms of the groundwater resources management with respect to the high no3 levels the mean residence time mrt of groundwater is an important parameter higher values of 3h and no3 concentrations should demonstrate shorter mrts and thus higher vulnerability of the aquifer system to pollution al charideh and hasan 2013 positive correlations were observed between 3h and no3 concentrations for the wells located on the south side of the sava river which receive more water from local precipitation as well as for the wells located on the north side of the sava river that receive more water from the sava river fig 8 the correlation r2 between 3h and no3 in the wells on the south side of the sava river is 0 54 however the slopes of both correlations are different probably due to greater dilution by the sava river water and or different concentrations of no3 near the wells in jarški prod graphical position of the wells in figs 1 and 6show that greater fractions of the sava river water are present in groundwater pumped from the wells located closer to the sava river and thus the sava river water dilutes the no3 signal in groundwater the highest no3 concentrations were observed in the group 2 hrastje 3 hrastje 8 kleče 11 where local precipitation was the main source of groundwater this indicates that precipitation leaches no3 from soil in these agriculturally active areas kladnik et al 2005 the atmospheric deposition of no3 at these locations as estimated using stable isotopes in n and o tamše per com contributes only about 10 of the total no3 thus hrastje is the most endangered pumping station in the ljubljansko polje in terms of pollution from agricultural sources in addition the positive correlation between 3h and no3 might be also a consequence of the damaged pipeline since these processes modify the water quality no3 concentrations and have an influence on 3h activities the damaged and old pipeline is a well known problem it was estimated that up to 37 of pumped groundwater was lost in 2003 in the ljubljansko polje andjelov et al 2005 further investigation based on the stable isotope composition of nitrate should give us better understanding of the no3 sources in the selected study area 5 conclusions an isotopic investigation of precipitation river water and groundwater shows spatial variability of groundwater composition in the ljubljansko polje aquifer system in the central part of slovenia over the period 2010 2011 the sava river and local precipitation are the main sources of groundwater in this alluvial aquifer a binary mixing model indicates that groundwater pumped from the wells kleče 11 hrastje 3 and hrastje 8 is mostly composed of local precipitation 86 while similar fractions of both sources were calculated for groundwater pumped from the wells kleče 8 kleče 12 and jarški prod 3 the sava river water especially dominates in groundwater pumped from the well jarški prod 1 fraction of both sources is influenced by the distance of the well from the sava river and the depth of the screens in the well 3h analyses indicated a presence of mostly modern water with a short mean residence time mrt in the ljubljansko polje aquifer system however noble gas analyses show that up to 10 of groundwater in kleče 8 and kleče 12 is very old the exact age of which should be precisely determined by another method such as 14c on the other hand groundwater with a long mrt is not present at the jarški prod area in the future these data will be used in groundwater flow simulations and for delineation of groundwater protection areas and capture zones in terms of groundwater resource management the groundwater mrt is an important parameter the highest concentrations of no3 were observed at hrastje where local precipitation is the main source of groundwater thus groundwater at hrastje pumping station is more vulnerable to potential pollution from agricultural sources whereas the wells in jarški prod are more vulnerable to a potential pollution from the sava river selection of this study area is crucial in hydrology especially for investigation of so complex hydrological processes such as surface groundwater interactions the important issues can be highlighted as follows the sava river might change its role from losing to gaining stream within a few kilometres making it an ideal place for modelling of two different relationships on a small scale the system is very dynamic since groundwater table responds to increased river discharge or amount of precipitation within a day or a month its boundary conditions can be controlled very well the bedrock which has a large influence on groundwater dynamic but it is often just a sideline has a diverse geometry here and can be extended from the surface to even 100 m below the surface and the area is occupied by different anthropogenic activities which offer the possibility to study the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution sources as it was also illustrated because of its strategic location south from the alps and close to the adriatic see isotopic composition of the sava river and local precipitation can be easily distinguished which is not the case in many studies the paper further shows how dynamic varied and sensitive the aquifer system in ljubljansko polje is making it an excellent case study not only to investigate surface groundwater interactions but also influences of climate change in the future

7561,river basin aquifers are common sites for drinking water wells as bank filtration can be a cost effective pretreatment technology a groundwater vulnerability to pollution depends on a groundwater mean residence time and on a relative contribution of river water versus local precipitation to groundwater environmental isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen δ 18o and δ 2h tritium 3h and concentrations of nitrate no3 were used to investigate hydrological pathways mean residence time and interactions between surface water and groundwater in the ljubljansko polje aquifer system in slovenia δ 18o and δ 2h values indicate a spatial variability of the influence of individual groundwater sources inside the aquifer local precipitation and the sava river water fractions of river water in groundwater depend on the depth of perforated screens in the pumping wells and their distance from the sava river it was estimated that groundwater at wells kleče 11 hrastje 3 and hrastje 8 is mostly composed of recently infiltrated local precipitation while the sava river is the dominant source of groundwater at the well jarški prod 1 groundwater at wells kleče 8 kleče 12 and jarški prod 3 contains on average between 41 and 48 of the sava river water the 3h and 3h 3he methods indicate short mean residence time of groundwater present at jarški prod 2 7 years and hrastje 7 8 years a small fraction 10 of old groundwater is present at kleče furthermore infiltration of local precipitation influenced the levels of no3 at hrastje these data extend our understanding of groundwater flow in the ljubljansko polje aquifer system interactions between the sava river water local precipitation and groundwater and the utility of isotope tracers in evaluating the spatial distribution of groundwater vulnerability to pollution keywords environmental isotopes 3h 3he groundwater precipitation sava 1 introduction the european water framework directive wfd requires the introduction of remedial measures in case of deterioration of groundwater chemical and quantity status information about a water mean residence time mrt and dynamics of a groundwater recharge are an indispensable basis for assessing the effects of remedial measures i e in which time period and to what extent an improvement in groundwater status can be expected generally groundwater within a river basin aquifer is a mixture of two main sources a precipitation which infiltrates through a soil layer into an aquifer and b river water in some cases the third important groundwater source might also be very old groundwater that is accumulated in deeper layers of an aquifer understanding of relative contributions of these sources to groundwater are important for prediction of potential impacts of pollutants on water supplies a development of management practices to preserve water quality and a diversity of remediation plans for sites that are already polluted environmental isotopes e g δ 18o δ 2h 3h have been widely applied in groundwater studies for better understanding of groundwater origin infiltration areas groundwater dynamics its mrt and vulnerability to pollution aggarwal et al 2006 gat 1996 lachniet and patterson 2002 tracers of groundwater mrt are particularly useful because complex patterns of flow are integrated and the vulnerability of groundwater resources to both pollution and climate change depend on the groundwater mrt in aquifer systems kendall and doctor 2004 also there are regional and temporal variations of isotopic fractionation because of latitudinal continental altitude and seasonal effects cappa et al 2003 kendall and doctor 2004 urresti estala et al 2015 that can help to define flow patterns over the past three decades interpretation of the δ 18o δ 2h and 3h isotopic signatures of water have provided insight into identifying groundwater recharge areas or flow paths under different flow conditions and estimating groundwater mrt in catchments cook and herczeg 1998 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 when initial concentrations of 3h in the atmosphere is not known or when the mid 1960s 3h peak cannot be clearly defined the 3h 3he method for estimation of the mrt can be used schlosser et al 1988 poreda et al 1988 solomon et al 1992 solomon et al 1993 ekwurzel et al 1994 solomon and cook 2000 kipfer et al 2002 the specific aims of the present study are 1 to determine fractions of the sava river water in groundwater samples using isotopes δ 18o and δ 2h in relation to low and high precipitation levels in 2010 and 2011 2 to estimate groundwater mrts using 3h and 3h 3he methods 3 to check the groundwater vulnerability to pollution using 3h and no3 concentrations these new hydrological data would serve as a base for an improvement of the hydrogeological conceptual models of the ljubljansko polje aquifer system and especially 3h 3he data which are to our knowledge obtained for the first time in this area they might be even used as calibration targets for groundwater flow and transport models 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the ljubljansko polje aquifer system is one of the most important groundwater sources for the slovenian capital ljubljana and its surroundings groundwater is exploited from four pumping stations šentvid kleče hrastje and jarški prod natural conditions are characterized by fast groundwater flow strong interconnection between surface and groundwater and elevated vulnerability to pollution bračič železnik and jamnik 2005 the ljubljansko polje is located at the eastern part of the ljubljanska kotlina fig 1 this tectonic depression formulated in the early pleistocene along the main neotectonic fault system running in the east west direction premru 2005 occasional seismic activities indicate that the basin formation is still in progress its elevations vary from 324 m in stanežiče to the 270 m in zalog which are located in the eastern and western sides of the ljubljansko polje respectively geographical boundaries of the basin are defined by surrounded hills with elevations up to 669 m at the šmarna gora which are composed of permian and carboniferous slate claystone and sandstone these layers form a bedrock with variable depths over the ljubljansko polje žlebnik 1971 premru 1983 remainders of paleozoic rocks were also detected at the western and south western areas at depths ranging from 0 to 30 m they represent so called perched aquifers šram 2011 and have an influence on chemical properties of groundwater and transport of pollutants šram et al 2012 a graphical presentation of the perched aquifer is shown in fig 2 the sava river accumulated pleistocene and holocene silty sandy gravels and sandy gravel with lenses of conglomerate in the ljubljansko polje basin fig 2 these fluvial sediments represent the main aquifer in the area with an increased thickness towards the centre of the ljubljansko polje where it exceeds even 100 m bračič železnik et al 2005 the thickness of the aquifer is 80 m at kleče 65 m at jarški prod and 58 m at hrastje bračič železnik 2002 the aquifer is protected from polluted subsurface water by layers of clay or clay with gravel only at isolated areas in the central part of the ljubljansko polje and at its western south western and southern marginals bračič železnik et al 2005 in general the direction of the groundwater flow is toward the southeast fig 1 in relation to the ljubljansko polje aquifer system the sava river might be considered as a losing river from medno to šentjakob and as a gaining river downstream of šentjakob fig 1 however the interaction highly depends on the water level and the river bed geology the sava river water do not interact with groundwater where it flows directly over the bedrock the ljubljanica river is a gaining river starting at fužine and continues to gain as it traverses the ljubljansko polje petauer and hiti 2013 another important source of groundwater is local precipitation since the area exhibits a large quantity of precipitation due to its geographic position and subalpine climate the mean annual rainfall of 1400 mm and the mean air temperature between 8 c and 10 c were observed arso url http meteo arso gov si met en archive however in the 60 years long time period the maximum and minimum precipitation amount of 1798 mm and 998 mm were observed in the years 2010 and 2011 respectively arso url http meteo arso gov si met en archive in addition underground groundwater recharge from the neighbouring groundwater bodies should be mentioned but it occurs only at edges segments of the ljubljansko polje aquifer system where the bedrock is deep therefore the ljubljansko polje aquifer system is also recharged by groundwater from the ljubljansko barje aquifer ljubljana moors in the south as well as from the kamniško bistriško polje and the kranjsko sorško polje in the north jamnik et al 2000 high groundwater table may also change this interaction from recharging to discharging although the underground recharge is still not well known its fraction in the aquifer was estimated to be negligible in relation to other groundwater sources cerar and urbanc 2013 the hydrodynamic in the ljubljansko polje aquifer is also influenced by groundwater pumping for water supply and industrial needs andjelov et al 2005 oscillations of the piezometric groundwater table shown in fig 3 occurred because of variations in pumping rates especially at the well kleče 11 the ljubljansko polje aquifer system has intergranular porosity and an unconfined groundwater table which is located on average around 20 25 m below the surface the main permeable formation is composed of gravels and sands with lenses of conglomerates and muddy gravels and has variable properties transmissivity ranges from 43 2 to 4752 m2 d 1 storage capacity from 0 01 to 0 1 and effective porosity from 5 to 15 bračič železnik et al 2005 vižintin et al 2009 2 2 sampling and analysis samples were collected monthly over one hydrological cycle from march 2010 to december 2011 from 1 the aquifer under ambient non pumping conditions at seven wells at three different water supplies kleče hrastje and jarški prod 2 the sava river at šentjakob and 3 precipitation at geological survey in ljubljana bežigrad the sampling locations with some descriptive parameters are summarized in table 1 and graphically presented in fig 1 perforated screens in the pumping wells range between 205 m and 278 m a s l fig 2 dissolved oxygen and water temperature were measured using a ysi model 58 meter and a ysi 5239 do probe with high sensitivity membranes electrical conductivity was measured using a corning 316 meter with a two point calibration of 0 and 1413 µs cm 1 dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity measurements had precision of 5 a corning 315 high sensitivity ph meter with an orion ross combination ph electrode calibrated with low ionic strength buffers of 4 1 and 6 97 corrected for temperature was used to measure ph in the field as close to the water temperature as possible the reproducibility of field ph determinations was 0 02 ph units stable isotope measurements of oxygen o and hydrogen h were performed in 260 samples results for o and h are reported using conventional delta δ notation δ 18o and δ 2h respectively in permil relative to vsmow the isotopic composition of oxygen δ 18o was measured after equilibration with reference co2 epstein and mayeda 1953 on a multiflow continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime gv instruments while reduction on cr at 800 c was used to determine the isotopic composition of hydrogen δ 2h in water gehre et al 1996 on a varian mat 250 mass spectrometer the accuracy of the measurements were 0 1 for δ 18o and 1 for δ 2h the 3h measurements were performed at hydrosys labor analytical laboratory ltd budapest hungary according to standard procedure fs 78 15 aku 1995 volumes of the water samples were reduced from 250 ml to 14 15 ml by electrolytic enrichment factor of tritium enrichment is about 15 16 the tritium activities of enriched water samples were counted by super low level liquid scintillation counter lsc the tritium 3h concentration in water is expressed in terms of the tritium unit tu with accuracy of 0 4 tu concentrations of no3 were determined in 109 samples previously filtered through 0 45 μm nylon filter on a dionex ics 2500 ic accuracy 2 seven samples taken at kleče hrastje and jarški prod wells in june 2010 were used for groundwater dating by the 3h 3he method helium isotope analyses were performed using a mass analyzers products model 215 50 magnetic sector field mass spectrometer 1 and ne ar kr and xe were measured using a standard research srs model rga 300 quadrupole mass spectrometer 2 at the university of utah usa in these samples also 3h measurements were performed by the 3he in growth method clarke et al 1976 with an accuracy of 3 the uncertainty in 3h 3he dating depends on measurement errors and upon the suitability of models used to determine the component of total 3he that comes from tritium decay 3hetrit the 3hetrit component is estimated by subtracting the atmospheric and terrigenic both crustal and mantle components from total 3he solomon and cook 2000 the atmospheric component of 3he was determined from ne ar kr and xe measurements using the closed equilibrium ce model aeschbach hertig et al 2000 the terrigenic component 3heterr depends on the 3he 4he ratio of mantle rocks mantle fluids and lithospheric crustal he production and can vary over several orders of magnitude the 3hetrit component for samples with large concentrations of total he more than an order of magnitude above atmospheric solubility or mantle derived fluids with high 3he 4he ratios are sensitive to the assumed terrigenic 3he 4he ratio making dating problematic solomon and cook 2000 we assumed a 3he 4he ratio of 2 10 8 for terrigenic he mamyrin and tolstikhin 1984 but let this value vary up to 1 10 7 when calculating the uncertainty of 3h 3he ages the measured 3he 4he ratio is presented as r ra where r is the 3he 4he ratio measured in the sample and ra is the 3he 4he ratio in the air 1 384 10 6 the sava river discharge and precipitation in ljubljana collected at daily intervals were obtained from environmental agency of the republic of slovenia arso www arso si 2 3 calculation methods data analysis normally distributed data were analysed by the one way anova for testing differences in measured parameters according to a season and a location in the statistical test probability p values of less than 05 were used to indicate a significance level if the significance was noted in a response factor the calculation was followed by post hoc testing using the tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test all statistical analyses were performed using statistica software package v 7 statsoft inc tulsa ok usa groundwater dating by the 3 h 3 he method the mean residence time mrt which is based on the 3 h 3 he method was computed using the following equation solomon and cook 2000 1 t λ 1 ln 3 he 3 h 1 where λ is the 3h decay constant of 0 0556 y 1 3h is the measured 3h activity and 3he is the tritiogenic 3he concentration defined as the amount of the total 3he produced by the 3h decay the total amount of 3he in groundwater can be expressed as 2 3 he tot 3 he atm 3 he 3 he nuc 3 he man where subscripts atm nuc and man refer to he of the atmospheric origin and he that is produced by nuclear reactions in the subsurface and he of the mantle origin respectively solomon and cook 2000 because it is difficult to separate 3henuc from 3heman they are often lumped together and simply referred to as 3heterr terrigenic 3he when a mixture of water with longer and shorter mrt is present the mrt estimated with the 3h 3he method is biased towards the shorter mrt małoszewski and zuber 1982 isotope mass balance a fraction of local precipitation versus the sava river water in groundwater was calculated by the two component mixing model the contribution of both sources could be estimated using the following equation 3 δ 18 o gw f rw δ 18 o rw f p δ 18 o p 4 1 f rw f p where frw and fp are respective river water and precipitation fractions while δ 18 ogw δ 18 orw and δ 18 op are the isotopic compositions of oxygen in groundwater river water and precipitation respectively lumped dispersion model transit time distribution was performed by the lumped dispersion model stichler et al 1986 which assumes a tracer transport controlled by advection and dispersion processes the g τ function is then defined as follows małoszewski and zuber 1982 5 g τ 1 τ 4 π p d τ τ m exp 1 τ τ m 2 4 p d τ τ m where τm is the mean transit time of water while pd is the dimensionless dispersion parameter which describes the variance of the distribution in the case of bank filtration it can in large approximation be defined as 6 p d α l x where αl is the dispersivity m and x is the mean flow distance between the input and output locations m pd of 0 2 was used in our calculation the relationship between input crw t and output cgw t concentrations in our case δ 18o values is given by the convolution integral which for non decaying tracers is defined as follows 7 c gw t f r w 0 t c rw t τ g τ d τ where τ is the transit time of a single tracer particle between input and output and fr w is the fraction of river water in the pumping well 3 results the entire data set of basic physical and isotopic parameters obtained over the two years period 2010 2011 are presented in the electronic supplement table s1 the main focus of the paper is related to δ 18o δ 2h 3h and no3 thus the means ranges and standard deviations in groundwater the sava river water and the weighted means ranges and standard deviations in precipitation are shown in table 2 while concentrations of the noble gases determined in june 2010 are presented in table 3 unusual high 3h activities up to 12 5 tu in the sava river water and groundwater were observed in november 2010 table s1 it is assumed that they are related to a systematic analytical error and thus excluded from the further analysis the decision was accepted according to the following reasons 1 as reported by vreča et al 2014 there was no high 3h activity in precipitation observed at that time 2 the event is not correlated with any other hydrological or isotopic parameters and 3 the rapid increase in 3h activity in the sava river water and in groundwater was observed at the same time period which would require unrealistic nearly zero transit time from the river to the wells 3 1 precipitation as already mentioned minimum and maximum annual precipitation over the 60 years period before 2011 were observed exactly over the sampling period 2010 2011 arso url http meteo arso gov si met en archive the total annual rainfall amount of 1798 mm and 998 mm were observed in 2010 and 2011 respectively the maximum monthly precipitation of 140 mm and the maximum discharge of the sava river at šentjakob of 1022 m3 s 1 were observed in september 2010 at the same time the signal of flooding was recorded and its influence on the piezometric groundwater table in the aquifer was observed fig 3 in precipitation only δ 18o values were determined values ranged from 13 9 to 4 9 with a weighted mean of 8 7 2 7 significant differences in δ 18o values in precipitation in different seasons were observed p 01 the marked seasonal variation is typical for the northern hemisphere vreča et al 2008 fig 3 shows that the mean δ 18o values in precipitation over periods from october 2010 to march 2011 and from april to september in 2010 and 2011 were different 10 6 and 7 0 respectively thus winter precipitation was more 18o enriched mainly due to the lower temperature the previous investigation indicated that the local meteoric water line in ljubljana so called ljubljana meteoric water line lmwl δ 2 h 8 06 0 08 δ 18 o 9 84 0 71 is close to the global meteoric water line and shows the predominant influence of atlantic air masses in ljubljana although the influence of mediterranean air masses could not be excluded this contribution was estimated to be in the range 15 26 vreča et al 2008 in addition a recent study of precipitation at the reactor centre in ljubljana over the period 2007 2010 was performed by vreča et al 2014 and the obtained data in 2010 are comparable to our δ 18o values in their study the local meteoric water line was calculated and the slope and the intercept was found to be similar to the lmwl calculated from the long term data from 1981 to 2006 thus the weighted mean δ 18o and δ 2h values together with 3h activities obtained in the study provided by vreča et al 2014 are included in table 2 in addition δ 2h values were calculated from the lmwl for each month in 2011 vreča et al 2014 and included in table s1 the measured 3h activities in precipitation are comparable to those from the past studies in slovenia and neighbouring countries the mean annual 3h activity is 9 1 tu for the period 1998 2010 in ljubljana while the mean values for zagreb croatia precipitation are 8 6 tu and 9 0 tu for periods 1998 2010 and 2007 2010 respectively vreča et al 2014 horvatinčič et al 2011 presented precipitation data observed in zagreb over the year 2010 that ranged from 4 to 14 tu with the highest values observed in summer 3 2 the sava river water temperature of the sava river varied from 4 9 c in march 2011 to 16 1 c in july 2010 table s1 electrical conductivity ec from 236 to 392 µs cm 1 and ph from 7 57 to 8 46 while no3 concentrations ranged from 3 47 mg l 1 to 6 82 mg l 1 with the mean value of 4 55 1 29 mg l 1 tables 2 and s1 temporal differences were not significant in the cases of all three parameters ec p 091 ph p 097 no3 p 142 the discharge and δ 18o values for the sava river over the sampling period 2010 2011 are presented in fig 3 over this period similar trend in δ 18o values in the sava river water and precipitation was observed fig 3 previous investigation indicated that the sava river responds quickly to precipitation which is further reflected in the isotopic composition of the sava river water ogrinc et al 2008 δ 18o values of the sava river water ranged from 9 7 to 8 5 and δ 2h values ranged from 66 4 to 57 6 with the mean δ 18o value of 9 2 0 4 and the mean δ 2h value of 62 0 2 9 table 2 marked seasonal variability was reflected in the isotopic composition of the sava river water p 04 with intra seasonal variations under average flow conditions the sava river water tends to be isotopically depleted in 18o relative to local precipitation the depletion in heavy isotopes in the sava river water likely reflects the dominance of precipitation infiltrating at higher altitude areas the alps rather than locally at the ljubljansko polje ogrinc et al 2008 the 3h activity of the sava river water ranged from 4 5 to 8 7 tu with the highest value observed in august 2010 fig 4 the mean 3h activity was 6 4 1 3 tu significant temporal differences were observed in 3h activity p 0 3 3 groundwater groundwater temperature ranged from 10 2 to 13 6 c the highest temperature was measured at hrastje 8 and the lowest at jarški prod 1 table s1 statistical analyses showed significant differences in temperatures between locations p 034 temperature observed at jarški prod 1 differed significantly from temperature at hrastje 3 and hrastje 8 on the other hand no significant temporal differences in groundwater temperatures were observed p 103 ph ranged from 6 98 to 8 44 with the mean value of 7 75 0 33 table s1 the lowest ph was observed at kleče 8 in august 2010 and the highest at hrastje 3 and kleče 8 in april 2011 spatial and temporal differences in ph were not statistically significant p 070 p 098 in the case of electrical conductivity ec and no3 concentrations significant differences between locations were observed for both parameters p 0001 while temporal differences were not significant p 098 p 477 this indicates different geological and anthropogenic influences on groundwater at different sampling locations due to changes of the aquifer properties and the land use at a local scale ec ranged from 203 to 640 µs cm 1 with the lowest values observed at kleče 12 in june 2010 and the highest at hrastje 8 in april 2010 table s1 ec in jarški prod differed significantly from the other locations in addition the difference in ec was also observed between kleče and hrastje and was found to be higher at hrastje then at kleče the no3 concentrations in groundwater ranged from 1 40 to 50 3 mg l 1 at kleče 8 and hrastje 3 respectively table s1 with the mean values ranging from 7 10 4 47 to 34 3 11 5 mg l 1 table 2 the lowest and the highest mean no3 concentrations were observed at jarški prod 1 and hrastje 8 respectively the δ 18o values of groundwater ranged from 9 4 at jarški prod 1 to 8 4 at kleče 8 with the mean δ 18o value of 8 8 0 2 the δ 2h values ranged from 63 8 at kleče 12 to 55 0 at hrastje 3 with the mean δ 2h value of 59 1 2 2 tables 1 and 2 the 3h activities of groundwater ranged from 3 6 to 7 0 tu at hrastje 3 and jarški prod 1 respectively with the mean values ranging from 5 4 0 8 tu to 6 0 0 6 tu table 2 and can be classified as modern waters no significant differences according to the location and the season were observed for any of the three environmental isotopes δ 18o p 207 p 062 δ 2h p 247 p 534 3h p 200 p 130 noble gases were also determined in groundwater table 3 values of r ra range from 0 153 at kleče 8 to 1 027 at jarški prod 3 measured 4he values range from 3 49 10 7 ccstp g 1 to 4 93 10 8 ccstp g 1 and are highly correlated with the helium isotope ratio as given by r ra calculated concentrations of terrigenic 4he 4he produced in the subsurface from the decay of u and th are significant in some samples with a maximum occurring at kleče 8 of 3 10 7 ccstp g 1 all samples have ne concentrations near equilibrium with the atmosphere with values ranging from only 2 10 10 7 to 2 48 10 7 ccstp g 1 mean residence time mrt calculated with the eq 1 ranged from 2 1 to 8 4 years with uncertainties ranging from 2 8 to 6 2 years table 3 uncertainties in the estimated mrts were evaluated using the monte carlo method in which the input parameters used to calculate the mrt were varied by plus minus one standard deviation from the mean measured value table 3 however it was not possible to estimate a 3h 3he age mrt for the wells at kleče due to significant levels of the terrigenic 4he and the uncertainty in the 3he 4he ratio of this he 4 discussion 4 1 stable isotope composition the mean δ 18o and δ 2h values of groundwater samples plot between the lmwl vreča et al 2008 and the sava river regression line ogrinc et al 2008 showing that groundwater is directly influenced by both sources the infiltration of local precipitation and the recharge from the sava river water fig 5 despite the fact that water supplies effect groundwater mrt groundwater flow dynamics fastest recharge of the sava river water over days without precipitation and consequently also isotopic composition of groundwater the environmental isotope fingerprints still detect infiltrated local precipitation thus it is assumed that production wells should not have significant influence on our data interpretation the groundwater samples scatter around the regression line characterised by the equation δ 2h 3 47 δ 18o 28 61 with r2 0 87 the mean d excess d δ 2h 8 δ 18o of 11 4 for the ljubljansko polje aquifer system is similar to d excess of 11 3 found in the sava river water at šentjakob table 2 thus the sava river water reflected the contribution of precipitation of the mixed atlantic mediterranean origin ogrinc et al 2008 based on the mean average δ 18o and δ 2h values two groups of wells can be clearly defined fig 5 group 1 jarški prod 1 jarški prod 3 kleče 8 and kleče 12 where the sava river water represents a significant or dominant contribution to groundwater group 2 hrastje 3 hrastje 8 and kleče 11 with higher δ 18o and δ 2h values than the group 1 indicating greater influence of local precipitation the δ 18o and δ 2h values show that isotopic composition of groundwater samples taken from individual wells is either more similar to that of local precipitation or to the isotopic composition of the sava river water urbanc and jamnik 1998 the enrichment with both heavy isotopes 18o and 2h along the regression line indicates mixing of water from a river with infiltrated local precipitation in an aquifer higher δ 18o and δ 2h values observed in groundwater in the group 2 could not be explained by evaporation of the sava river water since the sava river is a torrential river where the evaporation effect can be neglected ogrinc et al 2008 it is also known that the ljubljansko polje aquifer system is partly recharged with groundwater from the ljubljansko barje aquifer jamnik et al 2000 which could have an influence on the isotopic composition of groundwater at kleče however in the study provided by cerar and urbanc 2013 it was shown that the contribution of groundwater from the ljubljansko barje aquifer at kleče is of minor importance this estimation was performed based on molar ca mg ratios ranging between 2 5 and 3 0 and hco3 data ljubljansko polje has higher ca mg ratios and lower hco3 concentrations comparing to ljubljansko barje aquifer the two groups of groundwater determined in fig 5 could be further justified by geological properties of the aquifer and spatial distribution of the wells there are two main areas where the sava river recharges the aquifer 1 from tacen to the gameljščica tributary and 2 from tomačevo to šentjakob fig 1 the water inflow from the upstream river section reaches kleče while the water inflow from the downstream river section reaches jarški prod the sava river water needs more time to reach hrastje more likely due to the complicated bedrock geometry in this area therefore the signal of the sava river water is smaller there the wells in jarški prod especially the well jarški prod 1 are located close to the sava river bed on the permeable sava river floodplain which is mainly composed of gravel mixed with sand and silt thus it is expected that groundwater in jarški prod has higher fraction of the sava river water fig 6 the kleče and hrastje pumping stations are located on the higher terrace where the aquifer is deeper under the surface and where conglomerate and clay appear fig 1 the area around kleče pumping station may also be locally covered with thick lenses of poorly permeable sediments since perched aquifers are present near the kleče station šram 2011 for this reason leaching of the subsurface water is stymied the geological composition of the aquifer at kleče might be one of the reasons why the groundwater mixture at the well kleče 11 differs from the groundwater mixtures at the wells kleče 8 and kleče 12 although they are located close to each other fig 1 in fact perforated screens in the wells at kleče are located at different depths fig 2 it can be seen that the wells kleče 8 and kleče 12 pump groundwater from deeper layers of the aquifer than the well kleče 11 thus different isotopic composition between shallow and deep groundwater might be also an effect of smaller hydraulic conductivity in vertical direction than in horizontal direction statistically significant differences between δ 18o values in the sava river water and local precipitation p 0315 were observed thus a simple isotope mass balance calculation was performed to estimate fractions of each recharge water types in the aquifer first a time constant mixing calculation was performed using eqs 3 and 4 in this calculation for δ 18orw a mean δ 18o value of 9 2 for the sava river was applied table 2 while for δ 18op the mean annual weighted value of 8 6 reported by vreča et al 2014 was used the results of this calculation are presented in fig 6 it was found that local precipitation dominates in the groundwater samples taken from the wells kleče 11 hrastje 3 and hrastje 8 where their fractions are even higher than 85 groundwater pumped from the well kleče 12 has also higher fraction of precipitation 59 while both sources equally contribute to groundwater at the wells kleče 8 and jarški prod 3 the main source of groundwater pumped from the well jarški prod 1 is the sava river it should be mentioned that an influence of both end members are changing during time therefore a possibility of using a time dependent mixing ratios was also investigated the transport of 18o from the sava river towards a production well e g jarški prod 1 was performed with the transit analysis eqs 5 7 a one dimensional solution to the advection dispersion equation with the observed δ 18o in the sava river during the sampling period from march 2010 to october 2011 as input was used fig 7 shows the simulated value of δ 18o at the well with the assumption that the virtual well pumps groundwater which has only one source the sava river water f rw 1 in eq 7 if the groundwater mrt between the sava river and the well is only 10 days then as shown in the dark brown curve in fig 7 the δ 18o value in the well jarški prod 1 should have dropped down to 8 5 shortly after the δ 18o value of the sava river did in september 2010 as it can be seen in fig 7 the longer the mrt is the greater is a delay of the δ 18o peak in the sava river which is also getting more attenuated in time for example if the mrt is 500 days 1 36 years the δ 18o in the well would only change to a value about 9 2 and this change would occur in 500 days after it occurs in the sava river the δ 18o values at the well jarški prod 1 do not show this change the time constant mixing model shows that groundwater from the well jarški prod 1 has the highest fraction of the sava river water thus if this change is not observed in the well jarški prod 1 it is not likely to occur in any of the other wells if the mrt between the sava river and the well jarški prod 1 is about 200 days or longer the expected change would only be about 0 4 or less the data showed that the δ 18o variation in the well jarški prod 1 were only slightly larger than the measurement uncertainty of 0 1 and much smaller than the variation observed in the sava river about 1 0 thus the only plausible explanation why in the well jarški prod 1 where the sava river water is the dominant groundwater source the observed δ 18o variations of the sava river water could not be seen is the mrt longer than one year in this case the dispersion would smooth out variations observed during a year which indicate that the mrt is longer than the period of the oscillation therefore a time constant analysis using mean values is appropriate for this study 4 2 3h and 3h 3he values and mean residence time according to vreča et al 2014 the highest mean weighted 3h activity of 9 9 4 9 tu was observed in precipitation the mean 3h activity in the sava river water was estimated to be 6 4 1 3 tu the mean 3h activities in groundwater were 5 6 0 5 tu and 5 8 0 6 tu in the groups 1 and 2 respectively table 2 the lowest 3h activity of 3 6 tu was observed at hrastje 3 in february 2011 based on the decay of 3h and measurements of 3h activities in groundwater it was estimated that the mean residence times mrts 2 5 years best fit the data of groundwater samples indicating that mostly modern water is present in the ljubljansko polje aquifer system table 3 a similarity in 3h activities between groundwater and the sava river water indicates that the sava river water reaches the wells in less than 10 years al charideh and hasan 2013 more accurate information about the groundwater mrt could be obtained by the 3h 3he method which results are given in table 3 and are summarized as follows kleče 8 and 12 significant amounts of terrigenic 4he and low r ra suggest a mixture of mostly very young water probably from the sava river with some very old water this old water must come from deeper parts of the aquifer with a long but unknown mrt since it has accumulated such a large amount of terrigenic 4he however the 3h data suggest that groundwater contain no more than 10 of this old water otherwise the 3h value would be much lower than the measured ones the presence of very old water in kleče could be a consequence of tectonic factors probably of still active ljubljanski fault at these locations the 3h 3he method could not be used to determine the age or mrt of the groundwater since the presence of very old water can influence this estimation kleče 11 low r ra suggests a mixture of mostly very young water with some very old water but with a lesser amount than in wells kleče 8 and kleče 12 in this well the calculated tritiogenic 3he was slightly negative but our uncertainty analysis showed that the mrt could be of 4 years hrastje 3 and 8 modest amounts of terrigenic 4he and low r ra suggest a water mixture of young and a small amount of old water with a long mrt the mrts are between 3 and 8 years with differences possibly related to the difference in the screened intervals jarški prod 1 and 3 samples do not have component of old water this is young groundwater with the variable mrts of 2 and 7 years 4 3 nitrate concentrations in terms of the groundwater resources management with respect to the high no3 levels the mean residence time mrt of groundwater is an important parameter higher values of 3h and no3 concentrations should demonstrate shorter mrts and thus higher vulnerability of the aquifer system to pollution al charideh and hasan 2013 positive correlations were observed between 3h and no3 concentrations for the wells located on the south side of the sava river which receive more water from local precipitation as well as for the wells located on the north side of the sava river that receive more water from the sava river fig 8 the correlation r2 between 3h and no3 in the wells on the south side of the sava river is 0 54 however the slopes of both correlations are different probably due to greater dilution by the sava river water and or different concentrations of no3 near the wells in jarški prod graphical position of the wells in figs 1 and 6show that greater fractions of the sava river water are present in groundwater pumped from the wells located closer to the sava river and thus the sava river water dilutes the no3 signal in groundwater the highest no3 concentrations were observed in the group 2 hrastje 3 hrastje 8 kleče 11 where local precipitation was the main source of groundwater this indicates that precipitation leaches no3 from soil in these agriculturally active areas kladnik et al 2005 the atmospheric deposition of no3 at these locations as estimated using stable isotopes in n and o tamše per com contributes only about 10 of the total no3 thus hrastje is the most endangered pumping station in the ljubljansko polje in terms of pollution from agricultural sources in addition the positive correlation between 3h and no3 might be also a consequence of the damaged pipeline since these processes modify the water quality no3 concentrations and have an influence on 3h activities the damaged and old pipeline is a well known problem it was estimated that up to 37 of pumped groundwater was lost in 2003 in the ljubljansko polje andjelov et al 2005 further investigation based on the stable isotope composition of nitrate should give us better understanding of the no3 sources in the selected study area 5 conclusions an isotopic investigation of precipitation river water and groundwater shows spatial variability of groundwater composition in the ljubljansko polje aquifer system in the central part of slovenia over the period 2010 2011 the sava river and local precipitation are the main sources of groundwater in this alluvial aquifer a binary mixing model indicates that groundwater pumped from the wells kleče 11 hrastje 3 and hrastje 8 is mostly composed of local precipitation 86 while similar fractions of both sources were calculated for groundwater pumped from the wells kleče 8 kleče 12 and jarški prod 3 the sava river water especially dominates in groundwater pumped from the well jarški prod 1 fraction of both sources is influenced by the distance of the well from the sava river and the depth of the screens in the well 3h analyses indicated a presence of mostly modern water with a short mean residence time mrt in the ljubljansko polje aquifer system however noble gas analyses show that up to 10 of groundwater in kleče 8 and kleče 12 is very old the exact age of which should be precisely determined by another method such as 14c on the other hand groundwater with a long mrt is not present at the jarški prod area in the future these data will be used in groundwater flow simulations and for delineation of groundwater protection areas and capture zones in terms of groundwater resource management the groundwater mrt is an important parameter the highest concentrations of no3 were observed at hrastje where local precipitation is the main source of groundwater thus groundwater at hrastje pumping station is more vulnerable to potential pollution from agricultural sources whereas the wells in jarški prod are more vulnerable to a potential pollution from the sava river selection of this study area is crucial in hydrology especially for investigation of so complex hydrological processes such as surface groundwater interactions the important issues can be highlighted as follows the sava river might change its role from losing to gaining stream within a few kilometres making it an ideal place for modelling of two different relationships on a small scale the system is very dynamic since groundwater table responds to increased river discharge or amount of precipitation within a day or a month its boundary conditions can be controlled very well the bedrock which has a large influence on groundwater dynamic but it is often just a sideline has a diverse geometry here and can be extended from the surface to even 100 m below the surface and the area is occupied by different anthropogenic activities which offer the possibility to study the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution sources as it was also illustrated because of its strategic location south from the alps and close to the adriatic see isotopic composition of the sava river and local precipitation can be easily distinguished which is not the case in many studies the paper further shows how dynamic varied and sensitive the aquifer system in ljubljansko polje is making it an excellent case study not only to investigate surface groundwater interactions but also influences of climate change in the future

7562,an inexact nonlinear mλ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp model is developed for irrigation water allocation under uncertainty techniques of inexact quadratic programming iqp mλ measure and fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp are integrated into a general optimization framework the inmfccp model can deal with not only nonlinearities in the objective function but also uncertainties presented as discrete intervals in the objective function variables and left hand side constraints and fuzziness in the right hand side constraints moreover this model improves upon the conventional fuzzy chance constrained programming by introducing a linear combination of possibility measure and necessity measure with varying preference parameters to demonstrate its applicability the model is then applied to a case study in the middle reaches of heihe river basin northwest china an interval regression analysis method is used to obtain interval crop water production functions in the whole growth period under uncertainty therefore more flexible solutions can be generated for optimal irrigation water allocation the variation of results can be examined by giving different confidence levels and preference parameters besides it can reflect interrelationships among system benefits preference parameters confidence levels and the corresponding risk levels comparison between interval crop water production functions and deterministic ones based on the developed inmfccp model indicates that the former is capable of reflecting more complexities and uncertainties in practical application these results can provide more reliable scientific basis for supporting irrigation water management in arid areas keywords irrigation water allocation interval crop water production function nonlinearity mλ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming system benefits 1 introduction china is a large agricultural country and the stable development of agriculture is of decisive significance for ensuring the sustainable development of socio economic situations elliott et al 2014 kang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 irrigation areas are the main base of agricultural production in china where irrigation plays an increasingly notable role because it s the dominant water use generally irrigation water requirements cannot be fully satisfied with limited water resources especially in arid or semiarid areas the irrigation water allocation thus should not be the amount of total evapotranspiration et corresponding to the maximum yield in the crop water production function cwpf for a certain crop but it should be determined through realizing the maximum system benefits of the whole irrigation areas brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 the cwpf is the relation between crop harvested yield and the amount of crop water requirement i e et which can quantitatively describe the effects of irrigation water time and quantity on the crop yield during crop growth tong and guo 2013 it thereby provides the primary basis of optimizing irrigation water allocation for irrigation management purposes therefore it s desirable to explicitly investigate the cwpfs and further reasonably allocate irrigation water resources for achieving the maximum system benefits from irrigation areas jacobs et al 2016 li et al 2016 various uncertain factors exist in the irrigation system such as hydrological elements socio economic parameters and crop patterns regulwar and gurav 2011 this complexity will inevitably affect the estimation of crop yields and the observation of field experimental data e g et which then leads to the errors in determination of fitting cwpfs li et al 2016 which makes it more difficult to address these problems using deterministic cwpfs and conventional optimization models for optimal irrigation water allocation in response to uncertainties in practical applications the interval cwpf can be introduced as the basis of the optimization model to better reflect complex issues for example li et al 2016 developed interval linear cwpfs and interval linear fractional irrigation water allocation model to allocate limited irrigation water for the maximum system efficiency furthermore quadratic cwpf is more representative than linear one because it can provide more information concerning insufficient or sufficient irrigation water for different crops therefore a nonlinear objective arises later in optimization irrigation water allocation model based on the interval quadratic cwpf such a problem can be effectively handled by inexact quadratic programming iqp that can address nonlinear objective and interval uncertainties in the model s constraints and objective function chen and huang 2001 huang et al 2012 for example tong and guo 2013 established an iqp optimization model for crop water allocation based on interval quadratic cwpfs however iqp as an interval based framework model can only regard an uncertain event as the extreme conditions and normally cannot provide more valuable information for managers than fuzzy based methods moreover to define fuzzy possibility distributions fuzzy membership functions and their data requirements is much easier than that of probability distribution functions in agricultural water management the main characteristics of environmental capacity e g available water and the preferences of decision makers is their subjective uncertainty due to human judgments xu and qin 2010 for example the linguistic terms approximately equal to or approximately satisfactory are commonly acceptable and suitable for decision making zeng et al 2010 therefore fuzzy mathematical programming fmp can be a better choice for solving these problems dubois and prade 1983 chen and tan 1994 pohekar and ramachandran 2004 chai et al 2013 razmi et al 2016 apart from possibility measure and necessary measure huang 2006 proposed two types of models using credibility to measure confidence level by extending chance constrained programming in a fuzzy environment however this credibility measure is based on averaging possibility and necessary measures which may have limitations under some conditions as an improvement on the conventional methods m λ measure was initially proposed by yang and iwamura 2008 to extend its applicability to measure a fuzzy event it can be presented as a linear combination of possibility and necessity measures to balance optimism and pessimism a preference parameter λ is thus introduced according to managers subjective judgments and preferences for example dai et al 2014 2015 developed inexact m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming model for carbon capture utilization and storage and domestic wastewater management respectively nevertheless this model cannot address nonlinearity in the objective function furthermore few studies of m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming on the irrigation water management have been undertaken therefore to better address above mentioned concerns an inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp model is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation under uncertainty this method is to incorporate the concept of m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp and inexact quadratic programming iqp into a general optimization framework it can deal with nonlinearities in the objective function uncertainties presented as discrete intervals in the objective function variables and left hand side constraints and fuzziness in the right hand side constraints this model can improve upon the conventional fuzzy chance constrained programming the developed model is applied to a case study in the middle reaches of heihe river basin northwest china the variation of results can be examined by giving different confidence levels and preference parameters besides it can reflect interrelationships among system benefits preference parameters confidence levels and the corresponding constraint violation risk levels 2 model description the following subsections provide five major components 1 interval regression analysis method 2 inexact quadratic programming 3 m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming 4 inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming and 5 solution method for solving the developed model more specifically each of them can be presented as follows 2 1 interval regression analysis method to better reflect the relationship between crop yield and et in the whole growth period an interval regression analysis method is adopted to estimate interval cwpfs tanaka and lee 1998 in fact the results of the interval regression analysis are superior to deterministic ones because they can reflect the uncertainty and complexity of the practical situation moreover a quadratic cwpf is also better than linear one to address the collected experimental data thus interval quadratic cwpf model is chosen to represent the relationship between crop yield and et an interval regression model can be formulated as 1a y x a 0 a 1 x 1 a n x n ax where x 1 x 1 x n t is a real input vector a a 0 a 1 a n is an interval coefficient vector and y x is the associated interval estimation an interval coefficient a i is expressed as a i a i c i where a i is a center value and c i is a radius value in this study an interval regression analysis method based on quadratic programming is adopted because it gives more diverse spread coefficients than a linear programming one it also considers the central tendency of least squares and possibilistic property of fuzzy regression the aim of the interval regression based on quadratic programming is to minimize the sum of j 1 p y j a t x j 2 and j 1 p c t x j x j t c according to different weights to obtain optimal interval coefficients a i a i c i i 1 n therefore the formula of this method is presented as follows 1b min j k 1 j 1 p y j a t x j 2 k 2 j 1 p c t x j x j t c the output y j should be hold in the estimated output y x j which shows that these should be satisfied y i y x i j 1 2 p thus the objective function eq 1b should be subjected to the following constraints 1c a t x j c t x j y j j 1 p 1d a t x j c t x j y j j 1 p 1e c i 0 i 1 n where x j 1 x j 1 x jn t a a 0 a n t c c 0 c n t k 1 and k 2 are weight coefficients generally the larger values of k 1 k 2 the more central tendency will be expected this means that the obtained interval regression results tend to be the regression results based on the least squares regression method when the ratio of k 1 and k 2 changes regression results may be different accordingly therefore interval quadratic cwpfs can be obtained 2 2 inexact quadratic programming iqp an iqp model can effectively handle interval uncertainties and nonlinearities existing in the optimization model a general iqp framework is given as follows 2a max f j 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 2b j 1 n a ij x j b i i 1 2 m 2c x j 0 j 1 2 n where a ij b i c j d j and x j are interval parameters variables and the and are superscripts representing the lower and upper bounds of an interval parameter variable however iqp model cannot deal with the uncertain information that is presented as fuzzy sets li et al 2015 2 3 m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming mfccp 2 3 1 possibility measure necessity measure and m λ measure in fuzzy set theory possibility and necessity measures were commonly adopted to reflect the chance of a fuzzy event they are the fundamental concept for the formulation of fuzzy mathematical programming models let b be a fuzzy variable with membership function μ x and variable a is an arbitrary subset of r then the possibility measure of fuzzy event pos a b is defined as 3a pos a b sup a x μ x similarly the necessary of nec a b means the impossibility of the opposite event and it s defined as 3b nec a b 1 pos a b 1 sup a x μ x triangular fuzzy numbers and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in particular are attractive to use in fuzzy mathematical programming for better application assume a fuzzy variable b i e b b 1 b 2 b 3 with membership function μ x by specifying the most likely value b 2 the lower bound b 1 and the upper bound b 3 the equation of μ x is expressed as follows 3c μ x x b 1 b 2 b 1 if b 1 x b 2 x b 3 b 2 b 3 if b 2 x b 3 0 other thus the following calculation equations denote pos a b and nec a b 3d pos a b 1 if a b 2 a b 3 b 2 b 3 if b 2 a b 3 0 if a b 3 3e nec a b 1 if a b 1 a b 2 b 1 b 2 if b 1 a b 2 0 if a b 2 there is a main limitation in the possibility and necessity measures that is they are not self dual according to the definition of possibility there is a situation where fuzzy events do not necessarily occur even when the possibility is valued at 1 for example when pos a b 1 there is still a fuzzy event a b besides in no case can the possibility measure define a fuzzy event a b but the necessary measure can address this case generally the possibility measure is much acceptable for optimistic managers and the necessary measure is more suitable for pessimistic ones therefore a m λ measure is introduced to balance optimism and pessimism 3f m λ a b λ pos a b 1 λ nec a b where preference parameter λ λ 0 1 is given by managers preference to reflect the tradeoff between possibility and necessary therefore m λ measure extends its scope of applicability compared with conventional measures such as possibility measure λ 1 credibility measure λ 0 5 and necessary measure λ 0 thus we have the following m λ measure of a fuzzy event a b 3g m λ a b 1 if a b 1 1 λ a λ b 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 if b 1 a b 2 λ a λ b 3 b 2 b 3 if b 2 a b 3 0 if a b 3 therefore the information of m λ measure of fuzzy event is not missing and it can reflect the fuzzy information comprehensively moreover m λ measure is of self dual property dai et al 2014 fig 1 shows the differences among possibility necessary and m λ measure of fuzzy event a b where a triangular fuzzy set b is set as 2 4 8 analogous to chance constrained programming with fuzzy parameters proposed by liu and iwamura 1998 the following section is m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming 2 3 2 m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming a general framework of m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming is written as follows 3h max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 3i m λ j 1 n a ij x j b i ξ i i 1 2 i 3j x j 0 j 1 2 j where x j is decision variables c j is coefficients a ij is the coefficients in the left hand side of constraints b i is fuzzy sets in the right hand side of constraints ξ i is predetermined confidence levels in the fuzzy chance constrained programming let substitute s i for the j 1 j a ij x j then constraints 3i can be transformed into 3k m λ s i b i ξ i i 1 2 i let μ b i m λ s i b i denotes the m λ measure of variables s i for b i according to fig 1 if s i b i 1 the fuzzy event is completely satisfied due to μ b i 1 but s i b i 3 then the fuzzy event is completely invalid because of μ b i 0 when b i 1 s i b i 3 μ b i will range from 0 to 1 due to a monotonically decreasing function therefore only a single solution s i exists in b i 1 b i 3 by giving a certain confidence level generally the constraints are meaningful only if the confidence level is greater than 0 5 zhang et al 2015 namely constraint 3k is equivalent to 1 μ b i ξ i 0 5 i 1 2 i therefore there are three cases that can be seen in the decision making process namely 1 0 λ 0 5 and λ ξ i 2 0 5 λ 1 and λ ξ i and 3 λ ξ i then the above three cases can be further summarized as the following two scenarios 1 if λ ξ i we have 3l 1 λ s i λ b i 1 b i 2 b i 1 b i 2 ξ i s i 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ 2 if λ ξ i we have 3m λ s i λ b i 3 b i 2 b i 3 ξ i s i λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ by substituting j 1 j a ij x j for s i then constraint 3k can be solved thus mfccp model can deal with fuzzy uncertainties in the right hand side constraints however it cannot address interval uncertainties and nonlinearities in the optimization model 2 4 inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp to solve the above mentioned problems an inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp under uncertainty is developed for addressing these complexities it incorporates inexact quadratic programming iqp into m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming mfccp within a general optimization framework an inmfccp model is presented as follows 4a max f j 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 4b m λ j 1 n a ij x j b i ξ i i 1 2 i 4c x j 0 j 1 2 n then let j 1 n a ij x j j 1 j a ij x j j 1 j a ij x j s i we have 4d m λ s i b i ξ i i 1 2 i moreover constraint 4d can be classified into two scenarios 4e s i 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ i if λ ξ i 4f s i λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ i if λ ξ i likewise the crisp equivalent of the inmfccp model is expressed as follows 4g max f j 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 4h j 1 n a ij x j 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ i if λ ξ i 4i j 1 n a ij x j λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ i if λ ξ i 4j x j 0 j 1 2 n 2 5 solution method based on the interactive algorithm from chen and huang 2001 this type of problem can be transformed into two deterministic submodels with lower and upper bounds of the objective function value i e f and f however there is a challenge for solving the iqp framework due to the difficulty of determining bounds of decision variables of f and f cai et al 2011 therefore the solution method should be discussed with following two situations 1 when cost coefficient c j and d j have the same sign when cost coefficient c j and d j have the same sign which represents that this problem is much easier to be solved meanwhile the meaning of c j and d j have the same sign is that c j 0 when d j 0 and vice versa because the objective function is to be maximized the upper bound submodel corresponding to f should be firstly solved chen and huang 2001 it can be presented as follows 5a max f j 1 k 1 c j x j d j x j 2 j k 1 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 5b j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ i if λ ξ i 5c j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ i if λ ξ i 5d x j 0 j 1 2 n where x j j 1 2 k 1 and x j j k 1 1 k 1 2 n are interval variables with positive i e c j 0 and d j 0 and negative i e c j 0 and d j 0 coefficients in the objective function and denote the lower and upper bounds of the absolute value of and sign is the sign of which takes 1 when 0 and 1 when 0 therefore solutions of x j opt j 1 2 k 1 x j opt j k 1 1 k 2 2 n and f opt can be obtained from the upper bound submodel similarly the solutions of lower bound submodel can be formulated by incorporating the solutions from the upper bound submodel 6a max f j 1 k 1 c j x j d j x j 2 j k 1 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 6b j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ i if λ ξ i 6c j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ i if λ ξ i 6d x j 0 j 1 2 n 6e x j x j opt 0 j 1 2 k 1 6f x j x j opt j k 1 1 k 1 2 n solutions of x j opt j 1 2 k 1 x j opt j k 1 1 k 1 2 n and f opt can be obtained from lower bound submodel therefore combining the solutions from the two submodels the final solutions are f opt f opt f opt and x j opt x j opt x j opt 2 when cost coefficient c j and d j have different sign when c j and d j have different sign e g c j 0 and d j 0 the problem becomes more difficult to define whether x j or x j corresponding to f to identify the optimal bounds of x j a derivative algorithm method dam is employed chen and huang 2001 in dam a mid value model is constructed firstly and the corresponding criteria based on the solutions can be used to determine the results firstly the mid value model is constructed by letting all the coefficients take their mid values then the inmfccp model can be transformed into a following quadratic programming problem 7a max f mv j 1 n c j mv x j mv d j mv x j mv 2 subject to 7b j 1 n a ij mv x j mv 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ i if λ ξ i 7c j 1 n a ij mv x

above analysis the problem can be finally solved fig 2 graphically presents the framework of the inmfccp model the detailed process of solution method for inmfccp is shown as follows step 1 acquire

largest irrigation district in the middle oasis region with a typically inland arid climate the total area of study area is 19 220 ha of which 68 13 147 ha are arable land that needs to be irrigated the mean annual precipitation is 125 mm and annual et is about 1200 mm of which the proportion of precipitation in july and september is relatively large the yid as a major agricultural production base in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin its main crops are maize e g field maize and seed maize and spring wheat due to accounting for 83 of the total area jiang et al 2015 meanwhile economic crops are mainly referred to vegetables according to the actual situation the growth period of spring wheat is from april 1 to july 20 and the growth period of maize is from april 20 to september 22 generally these crops are mainly irrigated by surface water i e canal water from the heihe river and supplemented by groundwater jiang et al 2016 less effective precipitation due to its dryness climate can also be used for irrigation considerable surface water availabilities are used for agricultural irrigation accounting for more than 90 of the total water diversion from mainstream of the heihe river extraction of groundwater is used to compensate insufficient part of surface water due to seasonal variations and untimely events moreover excessive groundwater pumping has resulted in a continuous decline in groundwater levels because of disorder and unreasonable irrigation expansion and irrigation management over the past few decades these existing problems make it highly desirable to develop optimization model for identifying the desired irrigation water allocation schemes moreover cwpf is a useful tool for irrigation planning in fact uncertainties such as water availabilities crop irrigation water requirements and the preferences of decision makers are ubiquitous in agricultural systems therefore it is indeed necessary to develop an optimization model integrating cwpfs for effective allocating irrigation water to different crops under uncertainty 3 2 data preparation and analysis table 1 provides cwpfs of different crops including the interval quadratic cwpfs and deterministic ones an interval regression analysis method see section 2 1 is adopted to investigate the relationship between crop yields and the total crop water requirement i e et in the whole growth period for field maize seed maize spring wheat and economic crops meanwhile the central tendency is particularly considered in determining the regression results in which a ratio of k 1 1 k 2 0 0001 is selected as the input value table 2 presents water availabilities of surface water and groundwater for interval values since the variance of sample series is unknown thus the t distribution is used to estimate the range of interval parameters and the interval is estimated at 90 confidence level for each element taking the mean of the sample series as the middle value of the fuzzy numbers and the upper and lower bounds are the maximum and minimum possible values of fuzzy numbers other parameters including crop planting area crop prices and cost of irrigation water use and water conveyance from the survey statistics and water management annual report of zhangye city table 3 irrigation water requirements i e maximum evapotranspiration is obtained based on et c k c et o allen et al 1998 where et c is the actual evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient and et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day daily reference evapotranspiration is calculated by the fao 56 penman monteith method based on the meteorological data the precipitation data comes from the weather station of ganzhou district table 3 3 3 application of the inmfccp model two assumptions are given in this study 1 the change in soil water storage during the whole growth period is zero the amount of groundwater recharge in the irrigation area is negligible 2 considering the higher level of water management that is the amount of irrigation water requirement during the whole growth period is equal to the effective irrigation water plus the effective precipitation tong and guo 2013 in general the difficulties of optimal irrigation water allocation in this study are 1 how to deal with interval and fuzzy uncertainties in the system 2 how to address nonlinear characteristics 3 how to allocate water to different crops to achieve maximum net system benefits and 4 how to identify the optimal irrigation water allocation solutions under different confidence levels and decision making preferences therefore an inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp model is developed under uncertainty based on interval regression analysis the inmfccp model can be formulated as follows 3 3 1 objective function 8a max f j 1 4 a j nb j a j sw j gw j p e 2 b j sw j gw j p e c j j 1 4 a j ca j ct j sw j η s gw j η g where f is system benefits 104 yuan its physical meaning is that economic returns from the harvested crops in whole irrigation district minus the water costs including irrigation water use and water conveyance j is type of crop j 1 2 4 nb j is price of crop j yuan kg a j is planting area of crop j ha a j b j and c j are the coefficients of interval quadratic cwpf of crop j sw j and gw j are the decision variables which denotes that optimal irrigation surface water and groundwater m3 ha p e is effective precipitation of study area m3 ha ca j and ct j are the cost of irrigation water use and water conveyance of crop j yuan m3 η s and η g are irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and groundwater 3 3 2 constraints 1 surface water availability constraint 8b m λ q s j 1 4 1 δ s a j sw

are surface water and groundwater availabilities which can be presented as fuzzy membership functions δ s and δ g are the rate of surface water groundwater loss during water conveyance i e δ s 0 2 0 3 and δ g 0 1 0 2 η s and η g are irrigation water use coefficients of surface water groundwater η s 0 52 and η g 0 6 β s and β g are the proportion of surface water and groundwater used for irrigation β s 0 9 and β g 0 9 ξ i is confidence level of fuzzy chance constraints where i is the number of given confidence levels i 1 2 i 3 irrigation water requirement constraint 8d et min j sw j gw j p e et max j j et min j and et max j are the minimum and maximum crop water requirement of crop j m3 ha 4 nonnegative constraint 8e sw j 0 gw j 0 j sw j and gw j are the decision variables and they should be

formulated firstly and the corresponding criteria based on the solutions can be used to determine the results see section 2 5 then the inmfccp model can be solved through transforming it into two deterministic submodels therefore by solving the upper and lower bounds submodels we have solutions 9a f opt f opt f opt 9b sw j opt sw j opt sw j opt 9c gw j opt gw j opt gw j opt 4 results and discussion two risk related parameters are introduced i e confidence level ξ i 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 and preference parameters λ 0 1 0 2 0 9 to examine the variations of constraints and then generate decision solutions from the inmfccp model whether the manager s decision preferences and changes in the confidence level in the system will have an impact on the results by solving the first submodel upper bound submodel and the second submodel lower bound submodel optimal solution of the decision variables and objective function can be obtained therefore the optimal interval solutions with different risk parameters combinations ξ i and λ for crop irrigation water allocation can be found the results of the solution have deterministic values and interval solutions which shows that the change of parameter and system uncertainty have influence on the result generally the upper and lower bounds of the interval values indicate the decision space and range of the solution the smaller the difference in the upper and lower bounds of the interval the smaller the uncertainty range of the results and thus the results provide a more reliable reference for the manager more results analysis are presented as follows 4 1 optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation table 4 presents optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation under different λ when confidence level ξ i is fixed at 0 9 generally different λ can reflect the manager s decision aspiration preferences and attitudes such as optimism or pessimism especially when system input information is presented as fuzzy uncertainty an increased preference parameter means possibility experiences a steady rise when deciding on the constraints and objective functions more possibility will lead to an expended decision space in the right side hand constraints the results show that there is water competition among different crops with the variation of different λ the results of economic crops remain unchanged all of which are 0 2648 8 2851 0 m3 ha surface water groundwater this results imply that the economic crops are all irrigated by groundwater and they are not sensitive to the system variations for other three crops with the increase of λ there is an overall decrease in the optimal irrigation water allocation of surface water while we can see the opposite trend in that of groundwater this is due to the fact that the irrigation water use coefficient of groundwater is greater than that of surface water η g η s resulting in the system choosing less surface water to achieve greater economic benefits for example when λ changes from 0 1 to 0 9 the results of field maize is 2986 0 3218 5 1896 7 1906 1 m3 ha 2983 6 3215 3 1899 9 1908 5 m3 ha 2979 5 3211 0 1904 2 1912 6 m3 ha 2966 9 3205 4 1909 8 1925 5 m3 ha 2961 6 3199 9 1915 3 1930 2 m3 ha 2955 3 3186 0 1929 2 1936 8 m3 ha 2936 6 3167 1 1948 1 1955 5 m3 ha 2900 9 3130 2 1985 0 1991 2 m3 ha and 2773 8 2992 4 2118 3 2122 8 m3 ha surface water groundwater respectively in general the allocated surface water is roughly greater than groundwater because surface water is the main source of irrigation water moreover the difference between upper bound and lower bound of the allocated surface water still remain ahead of groundwater indicating that the results of groundwater changes in a small range table 5 provides optimal irrigation water allocation solutions under different ξ i when preference parameter is fixed at 0 5 different ξ i illustrate the satisfactory degree of constraints in addition a higher confidence level renders the constraints to become increasingly strict for the optimization model this will make the system more reliable and less risky while the decision space will be smaller e g decreased water availabilities in addition to the optimal solutions of economic crops remaining unchanged the allocated surface water of the other three crops is increasing and the allocated groundwater is decreasing when ξ i is raised from 0 7 to 1 0 taking seed maize as an example the optimal solutions are 4497 2 4687 6 721 1 768 0 m3 ha 4570 8 4767 7 641 0 694 4 m3 ha 4660 6 4859 6 549 2 604 6 m3 ha 4734 1 4891 1 517 6 531 1 m3 ha under an increased ξ i under a higher ξ i both surface water and groundwater availabilities have slightly shrunk whereas the available surface water is overwhelmingly greater than the available groundwater therefore under such circumstances to satisfy the crop irrigation water demands surface water is prone to be allocated for irrigation the results show that managers and systems conditions become more conservative as confidence levels rise 4 2 system benefits different scenarios with different set of λ and ξ i will yield different system benefits the interval solutions with lower and upper bounds provide two extremes of the objective functions based on the optimal irrigation water allocation pattern fig 4 presents system benefits under different λ and ξ i the results show that a higher preference parameter i e more possibility will lead to greater objective function values system benefits for example when λ is raised from 0 1 to 0 9 the solutions of system benefits will be slightly increased from 55309 58 92029 11 104 yuan to 55419 27 92111 64 104 yuan when ξ i is fixed at 0 8 moreover the greater the λ is the greater the growth rate of system benefits besides this result also reflects the subjective judgment of the managers that is optimism or pessimism for example when λ 0 1 managers have a pessimistic attitude toward water availabilities less possibility is considered leading to more difficulties when deciding on satisfying the objective function conversely planning under λ 0 9 shows that a higher system benefits can be obtained due to their optimistic towards and easily satisfied objective functions furthermore compared with credibility measure i e λ 0 5 the developed inmfccp model involving m λ measure i e λ 0 1 0 9 can explicitly show the influence of the change of λ on the results and it can express more systematic uncertain information because credibility measure can only provide a single solution in terms of ξ i as shown in fig 4 the results indicate that a higher ξ i leads to slightly lower system benefits than that of lower ξ i under a range of λ levels for example when ξ i is raised from 0 7 to 1 0 and λ 0 1 system benefits will decrease from 55314 41 92034 39 104 yuan to 55299 9 92018 56 104 yuan as for λ 0 9 the results is 55464 86 92157 24 104 yuan 55419 27 92111 64 104 yuan 55343 44 92066 05 104 yuan 55299 9 92018 56 104 yuan when ξ i 0 7 1 0 obviously an increased ξ i leads to an increased strictness for the constraints of the optimization model thereby generating a smaller decision space both the λ and ξ i in the decision making process are connected with the risk level a higher λ means much more possibility and positive strategy indicating a larger degree of constraints violation risk however a lower λ i e less possibility and more necessary will bring the risk arising from conservative strategies that eventually lead to resources not being taken full advantage of moreover the higher ξ i is the better the constraint is satisfied the more reliable results can be obtained theoretically a higher ξ i corresponding to a high degree of satisfaction level of constraints and thus a lower system failure risk therefore the corresponding objective function values can be obtained by giving different λ and ξ i the above analysis shows that the results can reflect the interrelationships among system benefits λ ξ i and risk level 4 3 discussion in terms of application problems interval quadratic cwpfs are adopted as the basic framework for irrigation planning to better reflect the effect of the interval quadratic cwpfs on the optimal results deterministic quadratic cwpfs table 1 based on the least square method is introduced for comparison and the other interval parameters take their mean values thus the inmfccp model can be changed into a deterministic one table 6 presents the optimal irrigation water allocation solutions based on deterministic model under different λ and ξ i 0 9 it is found that the deterministic model can only provide single solution for managers fig 5 illustrates comparison of the obtained results resulting from deterministic and inmfccp models under ξ i 0 9 obviously the results from deterministic model appear in the middle of the upper and lower bound values of the inmfccp model the results are fixed values rather than interval values even though their change trends are similar to the inmfccp solutions this results indicate that the deterministic model only represents a special case and it may be highly vulnerable because of system variation and uncertainties in summary on one hand the interval quadratic cwpfs are indeed informative and superior to deterministic ones to provide abundant information about system conditions for example observation errors measurement and computation methods of the field experimental data will definitely affect the fitting results of cwpfs interval quadratic cwpfs can effectively reveal these complexities and uncertainties in the practical applications and experiment process and thus make the results more reliable therefore the optimal solutions based on interval quadratic cwpfs can provide a more scientific and effective decision making support on the other hand without considering interval uncertainty the generated optimal schemes are relatively simple and poorly inflexible while the interval results can provide a decision space the results can fluctuate in the upper and lower bounds which can provide more choices in terms of model it s able to balance optimism and pessimism from various decision alternatives by introducing m λ measure with varying preference parameters λ accordingly the developed models can reflect extensive information and results and support in depth analysis moreover it should be noted that when the λ 0 5 the framework of the model is transformed into credibility measure based model which can be regarded as a simplified and special case of the inmfccp model see table 5 compared with the developed model the results based on credibility measure is a single solution therefore the developed model can extensively reflect the credibility possibility and necessary problems which can be regarded as a more generalized and practical method 5 conclusions an inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp model is developed for irrigation water allocation under uncertainty it s applied to a case study in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china this study can effectively address the following difficulties of optimal irrigation water allocation in 1 interval and fuzzy uncertainties in the system 2 nonlinear objective function 3 allocating irrigation water to different crops to achieve maximum system benefits and 4 identifying the optimal irrigation water allocation solutions under different λ and ξ i moreover this model improves on the conventional fuzzy chance constrained programming by introducing a linear combination of possibility measure and necessity measure therefore it can balance optimism and pessimism from various decision alternatives the interval quadratic cwpfs based on the interval regression analysis method can better reflect the complexity and uncertainty in practical applications the results can effectively reflect the interrelationships among system benefits λ ξ i and risk level this study attempts to present a novel optimization model framework for dealing with nonlinear optimization problems in a fuzzy environment although this developed model is used for optimal irrigation water management under uncertainty the results suggest that it s also applicable to other resources and environmental management problems however it also has some limitations when accounting for the problems involved in many practical factors such as soil types soil moisture content and their dynamic variations consequently the integration of more practical factors is desired for further improving the inmfccp model besides the inmfccp model can be further investigated by integrating methods of stochastic mathematical programming integer programming and

7562,an inexact nonlinear mλ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp model is developed for irrigation water allocation under uncertainty techniques of inexact quadratic programming iqp mλ measure and fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp are integrated into a general optimization framework the inmfccp model can deal with not only nonlinearities in the objective function but also uncertainties presented as discrete intervals in the objective function variables and left hand side constraints and fuzziness in the right hand side constraints moreover this model improves upon the conventional fuzzy chance constrained programming by introducing a linear combination of possibility measure and necessity measure with varying preference parameters to demonstrate its applicability the model is then applied to a case study in the middle reaches of heihe river basin northwest china an interval regression analysis method is used to obtain interval crop water production functions in the whole growth period under uncertainty therefore more flexible solutions can be generated for optimal irrigation water allocation the variation of results can be examined by giving different confidence levels and preference parameters besides it can reflect interrelationships among system benefits preference parameters confidence levels and the corresponding risk levels comparison between interval crop water production functions and deterministic ones based on the developed inmfccp model indicates that the former is capable of reflecting more complexities and uncertainties in practical application these results can provide more reliable scientific basis for supporting irrigation water management in arid areas keywords irrigation water allocation interval crop water production function nonlinearity mλ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming system benefits 1 introduction china is a large agricultural country and the stable development of agriculture is of decisive significance for ensuring the sustainable development of socio economic situations elliott et al 2014 kang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 irrigation areas are the main base of agricultural production in china where irrigation plays an increasingly notable role because it s the dominant water use generally irrigation water requirements cannot be fully satisfied with limited water resources especially in arid or semiarid areas the irrigation water allocation thus should not be the amount of total evapotranspiration et corresponding to the maximum yield in the crop water production function cwpf for a certain crop but it should be determined through realizing the maximum system benefits of the whole irrigation areas brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 the cwpf is the relation between crop harvested yield and the amount of crop water requirement i e et which can quantitatively describe the effects of irrigation water time and quantity on the crop yield during crop growth tong and guo 2013 it thereby provides the primary basis of optimizing irrigation water allocation for irrigation management purposes therefore it s desirable to explicitly investigate the cwpfs and further reasonably allocate irrigation water resources for achieving the maximum system benefits from irrigation areas jacobs et al 2016 li et al 2016 various uncertain factors exist in the irrigation system such as hydrological elements socio economic parameters and crop patterns regulwar and gurav 2011 this complexity will inevitably affect the estimation of crop yields and the observation of field experimental data e g et which then leads to the errors in determination of fitting cwpfs li et al 2016 which makes it more difficult to address these problems using deterministic cwpfs and conventional optimization models for optimal irrigation water allocation in response to uncertainties in practical applications the interval cwpf can be introduced as the basis of the optimization model to better reflect complex issues for example li et al 2016 developed interval linear cwpfs and interval linear fractional irrigation water allocation model to allocate limited irrigation water for the maximum system efficiency furthermore quadratic cwpf is more representative than linear one because it can provide more information concerning insufficient or sufficient irrigation water for different crops therefore a nonlinear objective arises later in optimization irrigation water allocation model based on the interval quadratic cwpf such a problem can be effectively handled by inexact quadratic programming iqp that can address nonlinear objective and interval uncertainties in the model s constraints and objective function chen and huang 2001 huang et al 2012 for example tong and guo 2013 established an iqp optimization model for crop water allocation based on interval quadratic cwpfs however iqp as an interval based framework model can only regard an uncertain event as the extreme conditions and normally cannot provide more valuable information for managers than fuzzy based methods moreover to define fuzzy possibility distributions fuzzy membership functions and their data requirements is much easier than that of probability distribution functions in agricultural water management the main characteristics of environmental capacity e g available water and the preferences of decision makers is their subjective uncertainty due to human judgments xu and qin 2010 for example the linguistic terms approximately equal to or approximately satisfactory are commonly acceptable and suitable for decision making zeng et al 2010 therefore fuzzy mathematical programming fmp can be a better choice for solving these problems dubois and prade 1983 chen and tan 1994 pohekar and ramachandran 2004 chai et al 2013 razmi et al 2016 apart from possibility measure and necessary measure huang 2006 proposed two types of models using credibility to measure confidence level by extending chance constrained programming in a fuzzy environment however this credibility measure is based on averaging possibility and necessary measures which may have limitations under some conditions as an improvement on the conventional methods m λ measure was initially proposed by yang and iwamura 2008 to extend its applicability to measure a fuzzy event it can be presented as a linear combination of possibility and necessity measures to balance optimism and pessimism a preference parameter λ is thus introduced according to managers subjective judgments and preferences for example dai et al 2014 2015 developed inexact m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming model for carbon capture utilization and storage and domestic wastewater management respectively nevertheless this model cannot address nonlinearity in the objective function furthermore few studies of m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming on the irrigation water management have been undertaken therefore to better address above mentioned concerns an inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp model is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation under uncertainty this method is to incorporate the concept of m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp and inexact quadratic programming iqp into a general optimization framework it can deal with nonlinearities in the objective function uncertainties presented as discrete intervals in the objective function variables and left hand side constraints and fuzziness in the right hand side constraints this model can improve upon the conventional fuzzy chance constrained programming the developed model is applied to a case study in the middle reaches of heihe river basin northwest china the variation of results can be examined by giving different confidence levels and preference parameters besides it can reflect interrelationships among system benefits preference parameters confidence levels and the corresponding constraint violation risk levels 2 model description the following subsections provide five major components 1 interval regression analysis method 2 inexact quadratic programming 3 m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming 4 inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming and 5 solution method for solving the developed model more specifically each of them can be presented as follows 2 1 interval regression analysis method to better reflect the relationship between crop yield and et in the whole growth period an interval regression analysis method is adopted to estimate interval cwpfs tanaka and lee 1998 in fact the results of the interval regression analysis are superior to deterministic ones because they can reflect the uncertainty and complexity of the practical situation moreover a quadratic cwpf is also better than linear one to address the collected experimental data thus interval quadratic cwpf model is chosen to represent the relationship between crop yield and et an interval regression model can be formulated as 1a y x a 0 a 1 x 1 a n x n ax where x 1 x 1 x n t is a real input vector a a 0 a 1 a n is an interval coefficient vector and y x is the associated interval estimation an interval coefficient a i is expressed as a i a i c i where a i is a center value and c i is a radius value in this study an interval regression analysis method based on quadratic programming is adopted because it gives more diverse spread coefficients than a linear programming one it also considers the central tendency of least squares and possibilistic property of fuzzy regression the aim of the interval regression based on quadratic programming is to minimize the sum of j 1 p y j a t x j 2 and j 1 p c t x j x j t c according to different weights to obtain optimal interval coefficients a i a i c i i 1 n therefore the formula of this method is presented as follows 1b min j k 1 j 1 p y j a t x j 2 k 2 j 1 p c t x j x j t c the output y j should be hold in the estimated output y x j which shows that these should be satisfied y i y x i j 1 2 p thus the objective function eq 1b should be subjected to the following constraints 1c a t x j c t x j y j j 1 p 1d a t x j c t x j y j j 1 p 1e c i 0 i 1 n where x j 1 x j 1 x jn t a a 0 a n t c c 0 c n t k 1 and k 2 are weight coefficients generally the larger values of k 1 k 2 the more central tendency will be expected this means that the obtained interval regression results tend to be the regression results based on the least squares regression method when the ratio of k 1 and k 2 changes regression results may be different accordingly therefore interval quadratic cwpfs can be obtained 2 2 inexact quadratic programming iqp an iqp model can effectively handle interval uncertainties and nonlinearities existing in the optimization model a general iqp framework is given as follows 2a max f j 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 2b j 1 n a ij x j b i i 1 2 m 2c x j 0 j 1 2 n where a ij b i c j d j and x j are interval parameters variables and the and are superscripts representing the lower and upper bounds of an interval parameter variable however iqp model cannot deal with the uncertain information that is presented as fuzzy sets li et al 2015 2 3 m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming mfccp 2 3 1 possibility measure necessity measure and m λ measure in fuzzy set theory possibility and necessity measures were commonly adopted to reflect the chance of a fuzzy event they are the fundamental concept for the formulation of fuzzy mathematical programming models let b be a fuzzy variable with membership function μ x and variable a is an arbitrary subset of r then the possibility measure of fuzzy event pos a b is defined as 3a pos a b sup a x μ x similarly the necessary of nec a b means the impossibility of the opposite event and it s defined as 3b nec a b 1 pos a b 1 sup a x μ x triangular fuzzy numbers and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in particular are attractive to use in fuzzy mathematical programming for better application assume a fuzzy variable b i e b b 1 b 2 b 3 with membership function μ x by specifying the most likely value b 2 the lower bound b 1 and the upper bound b 3 the equation of μ x is expressed as follows 3c μ x x b 1 b 2 b 1 if b 1 x b 2 x b 3 b 2 b 3 if b 2 x b 3 0 other thus the following calculation equations denote pos a b and nec a b 3d pos a b 1 if a b 2 a b 3 b 2 b 3 if b 2 a b 3 0 if a b 3 3e nec a b 1 if a b 1 a b 2 b 1 b 2 if b 1 a b 2 0 if a b 2 there is a main limitation in the possibility and necessity measures that is they are not self dual according to the definition of possibility there is a situation where fuzzy events do not necessarily occur even when the possibility is valued at 1 for example when pos a b 1 there is still a fuzzy event a b besides in no case can the possibility measure define a fuzzy event a b but the necessary measure can address this case generally the possibility measure is much acceptable for optimistic managers and the necessary measure is more suitable for pessimistic ones therefore a m λ measure is introduced to balance optimism and pessimism 3f m λ a b λ pos a b 1 λ nec a b where preference parameter λ λ 0 1 is given by managers preference to reflect the tradeoff between possibility and necessary therefore m λ measure extends its scope of applicability compared with conventional measures such as possibility measure λ 1 credibility measure λ 0 5 and necessary measure λ 0 thus we have the following m λ measure of a fuzzy event a b 3g m λ a b 1 if a b 1 1 λ a λ b 1 b 2 b 1 b 2 if b 1 a b 2 λ a λ b 3 b 2 b 3 if b 2 a b 3 0 if a b 3 therefore the information of m λ measure of fuzzy event is not missing and it can reflect the fuzzy information comprehensively moreover m λ measure is of self dual property dai et al 2014 fig 1 shows the differences among possibility necessary and m λ measure of fuzzy event a b where a triangular fuzzy set b is set as 2 4 8 analogous to chance constrained programming with fuzzy parameters proposed by liu and iwamura 1998 the following section is m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming 2 3 2 m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming a general framework of m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming is written as follows 3h max f j 1 n c j x j subject to 3i m λ j 1 n a ij x j b i ξ i i 1 2 i 3j x j 0 j 1 2 j where x j is decision variables c j is coefficients a ij is the coefficients in the left hand side of constraints b i is fuzzy sets in the right hand side of constraints ξ i is predetermined confidence levels in the fuzzy chance constrained programming let substitute s i for the j 1 j a ij x j then constraints 3i can be transformed into 3k m λ s i b i ξ i i 1 2 i let μ b i m λ s i b i denotes the m λ measure of variables s i for b i according to fig 1 if s i b i 1 the fuzzy event is completely satisfied due to μ b i 1 but s i b i 3 then the fuzzy event is completely invalid because of μ b i 0 when b i 1 s i b i 3 μ b i will range from 0 to 1 due to a monotonically decreasing function therefore only a single solution s i exists in b i 1 b i 3 by giving a certain confidence level generally the constraints are meaningful only if the confidence level is greater than 0 5 zhang et al 2015 namely constraint 3k is equivalent to 1 μ b i ξ i 0 5 i 1 2 i therefore there are three cases that can be seen in the decision making process namely 1 0 λ 0 5 and λ ξ i 2 0 5 λ 1 and λ ξ i and 3 λ ξ i then the above three cases can be further summarized as the following two scenarios 1 if λ ξ i we have 3l 1 λ s i λ b i 1 b i 2 b i 1 b i 2 ξ i s i 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ 2 if λ ξ i we have 3m λ s i λ b i 3 b i 2 b i 3 ξ i s i λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ by substituting j 1 j a ij x j for s i then constraint 3k can be solved thus mfccp model can deal with fuzzy uncertainties in the right hand side constraints however it cannot address interval uncertainties and nonlinearities in the optimization model 2 4 inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp to solve the above mentioned problems an inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp under uncertainty is developed for addressing these complexities it incorporates inexact quadratic programming iqp into m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming mfccp within a general optimization framework an inmfccp model is presented as follows 4a max f j 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 4b m λ j 1 n a ij x j b i ξ i i 1 2 i 4c x j 0 j 1 2 n then let j 1 n a ij x j j 1 j a ij x j j 1 j a ij x j s i we have 4d m λ s i b i ξ i i 1 2 i moreover constraint 4d can be classified into two scenarios 4e s i 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ i if λ ξ i 4f s i λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ i if λ ξ i likewise the crisp equivalent of the inmfccp model is expressed as follows 4g max f j 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 4h j 1 n a ij x j 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ i if λ ξ i 4i j 1 n a ij x j λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ i if λ ξ i 4j x j 0 j 1 2 n 2 5 solution method based on the interactive algorithm from chen and huang 2001 this type of problem can be transformed into two deterministic submodels with lower and upper bounds of the objective function value i e f and f however there is a challenge for solving the iqp framework due to the difficulty of determining bounds of decision variables of f and f cai et al 2011 therefore the solution method should be discussed with following two situations 1 when cost coefficient c j and d j have the same sign when cost coefficient c j and d j have the same sign which represents that this problem is much easier to be solved meanwhile the meaning of c j and d j have the same sign is that c j 0 when d j 0 and vice versa because the objective function is to be maximized the upper bound submodel corresponding to f should be firstly solved chen and huang 2001 it can be presented as follows 5a max f j 1 k 1 c j x j d j x j 2 j k 1 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 5b j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ i if λ ξ i 5c j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ i if λ ξ i 5d x j 0 j 1 2 n where x j j 1 2 k 1 and x j j k 1 1 k 1 2 n are interval variables with positive i e c j 0 and d j 0 and negative i e c j 0 and d j 0 coefficients in the objective function and denote the lower and upper bounds of the absolute value of and sign is the sign of which takes 1 when 0 and 1 when 0 therefore solutions of x j opt j 1 2 k 1 x j opt j k 1 1 k 2 2 n and f opt can be obtained from the upper bound submodel similarly the solutions of lower bound submodel can be formulated by incorporating the solutions from the upper bound submodel 6a max f j 1 k 1 c j x j d j x j 2 j k 1 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 6b j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ i if λ ξ i 6c j 1 k 1 a ij sign a ij x j j k 1 1 n a ij sign a ij x j λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ i if λ ξ i 6d x j 0 j 1 2 n 6e x j x j opt 0 j 1 2 k 1 6f x j x j opt j k 1 1 k 1 2 n solutions of x j opt j 1 2 k 1 x j opt j k 1 1 k 1 2 n and f opt can be obtained from lower bound submodel therefore combining the solutions from the two submodels the final solutions are f opt f opt f opt and x j opt x j opt x j opt 2 when cost coefficient c j and d j have different sign when c j and d j have different sign e g c j 0 and d j 0 the problem becomes more difficult to define whether x j or x j corresponding to f to identify the optimal bounds of x j a derivative algorithm method dam is employed chen and huang 2001 in dam a mid value model is constructed firstly and the corresponding criteria based on the solutions can be used to determine the results firstly the mid value model is constructed by letting all the coefficients take their mid values then the inmfccp model can be transformed into a following quadratic programming problem 7a max f mv j 1 n c j mv x j mv d j mv x j mv 2 subject to 7b j 1 n a ij mv x j mv 1 ξ i b i 2 ξ i λ b i 1 1 λ i if λ ξ i 7c j 1 n a ij mv x j mv λ ξ i b i 3 λ b i 2 λ i if λ ξ i 7d x j mv 0 j 1 2 n where c j mv d j mv and a ij mv are the mid values of c j d j and a ij for example c j mv c j c j 2 the solutions can thus be obtained as x mv opt x j mv opt j and x j mv opt x j opt x j opt according to x j mv opt the following criteria can be used to identify the optimal results for x j 7e f j x j opt f j x j opt when 2 d j x j mv opt c j 0 7f f j x j opt f j x j opt when 2 d j x j mv opt c j 0 thus when formula 7e is satisfied x j corresponds to f and the opposite results can be obtained i e x j corresponds to f in formula 7f based on above analysis the problem can be finally solved fig 2 graphically presents the framework of the inmfccp model the detailed process of solution method for inmfccp is shown as follows step 1 acquire the parameters of model required in terms of interval boundaries and fuzzy sets fuzzy membership function step 2 formulate the inmfccp model step 3 give different preference parameters λ and confidence levels ξ i step 4 transform the m λ measure fuzzy chance constraints into the equivalent ones according to predetermined λ ξ i step 5 judge whether cost coefficients c j and d j have different or the same sign and choose corresponding above mentioned solution method step 6 reformulate the model into two submodels through the interactive algorithm because the objective function is the maximum system benefits then solve the upper bound submodel f firstly the corresponding solutions can be obtained f opt x j opt step 7 solve the lower bound submodel based on the solutions obtained from step 6 the corresponding solutions can also be obtained f opt x j opt step 8 combine solutions from steps 6 and 7 then the final solutions can be generated as f opt f opt f opt and x j opt x j opt x j opt 3 case study 3 1 study area the yingke irrigation district yid is located in midstream area of heihe river basin northwest china 100 17 100 34 e 38 50 38 58 n fig 3 it s the third largest irrigation district in the middle oasis region with a typically inland arid climate the total area of study area is 19 220 ha of which 68 13 147 ha are arable land that needs to be irrigated the mean annual precipitation is 125 mm and annual et is about 1200 mm of which the proportion of precipitation in july and september is relatively large the yid as a major agricultural production base in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin its main crops are maize e g field maize and seed maize and spring wheat due to accounting for 83 of the total area jiang et al 2015 meanwhile economic crops are mainly referred to vegetables according to the actual situation the growth period of spring wheat is from april 1 to july 20 and the growth period of maize is from april 20 to september 22 generally these crops are mainly irrigated by surface water i e canal water from the heihe river and supplemented by groundwater jiang et al 2016 less effective precipitation due to its dryness climate can also be used for irrigation considerable surface water availabilities are used for agricultural irrigation accounting for more than 90 of the total water diversion from mainstream of the heihe river extraction of groundwater is used to compensate insufficient part of surface water due to seasonal variations and untimely events moreover excessive groundwater pumping has resulted in a continuous decline in groundwater levels because of disorder and unreasonable irrigation expansion and irrigation management over the past few decades these existing problems make it highly desirable to develop optimization model for identifying the desired irrigation water allocation schemes moreover cwpf is a useful tool for irrigation planning in fact uncertainties such as water availabilities crop irrigation water requirements and the preferences of decision makers are ubiquitous in agricultural systems therefore it is indeed necessary to develop an optimization model integrating cwpfs for effective allocating irrigation water to different crops under uncertainty 3 2 data preparation and analysis table 1 provides cwpfs of different crops including the interval quadratic cwpfs and deterministic ones an interval regression analysis method see section 2 1 is adopted to investigate the relationship between crop yields and the total crop water requirement i e et in the whole growth period for field maize seed maize spring wheat and economic crops meanwhile the central tendency is particularly considered in determining the regression results in which a ratio of k 1 1 k 2 0 0001 is selected as the input value table 2 presents water availabilities of surface water and groundwater for interval values since the variance of sample series is unknown thus the t distribution is used to estimate the range of interval parameters and the interval is estimated at 90 confidence level for each element taking the mean of the sample series as the middle value of the fuzzy numbers and the upper and lower bounds are the maximum and minimum possible values of fuzzy numbers other parameters including crop planting area crop prices and cost of irrigation water use and water conveyance from the survey statistics and water management annual report of zhangye city table 3 irrigation water requirements i e maximum evapotranspiration is obtained based on et c k c et o allen et al 1998 where et c is the actual evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient and et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm day daily reference evapotranspiration is calculated by the fao 56 penman monteith method based on the meteorological data the precipitation data comes from the weather station of ganzhou district table 3 3 3 application of the inmfccp model two assumptions are given in this study 1 the change in soil water storage during the whole growth period is zero the amount of groundwater recharge in the irrigation area is negligible 2 considering the higher level of water management that is the amount of irrigation water requirement during the whole growth period is equal to the effective irrigation water plus the effective precipitation tong and guo 2013 in general the difficulties of optimal irrigation water allocation in this study are 1 how to deal with interval and fuzzy uncertainties in the system 2 how to address nonlinear characteristics 3 how to allocate water to different crops to achieve maximum net system benefits and 4 how to identify the optimal irrigation water allocation solutions under different confidence levels and decision making preferences therefore an inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp model is developed under uncertainty based on interval regression analysis the inmfccp model can be formulated as follows 3 3 1 objective function 8a max f j 1 4 a j nb j a j sw j gw j p e 2 b j sw j gw j p e c j j 1 4 a j ca j ct j sw j η s gw j η g where f is system benefits 104 yuan its physical meaning is that economic returns from the harvested crops in whole irrigation district minus the water costs including irrigation water use and water conveyance j is type of crop j 1 2 4 nb j is price of crop j yuan kg a j is planting area of crop j ha a j b j and c j are the coefficients of interval quadratic cwpf of crop j sw j and gw j are the decision variables which denotes that optimal irrigation surface water and groundwater m3 ha p e is effective precipitation of study area m3 ha ca j and ct j are the cost of irrigation water use and water conveyance of crop j yuan m3 η s and η g are irrigation water use coefficients of surface water and groundwater 3 3 2 constraints 1 surface water availability constraint 8b m λ q s j 1 4 1 δ s a j sw

are surface water and groundwater availabilities which can be presented as fuzzy membership functions δ s and δ g are the rate of surface water groundwater loss during water conveyance i e δ s 0 2 0 3 and δ g 0 1 0 2 η s and η g are irrigation water use coefficients of surface water groundwater η s 0 52 and η g 0 6 β s and β g are the proportion of surface water and groundwater used for irrigation β s 0 9 and β g 0 9 ξ i is confidence level of fuzzy chance constraints where i is the number of given confidence levels i 1 2 i 3 irrigation water requirement constraint 8d et min j sw j gw j p e et max j j et min j and et max j are the minimum and maximum crop water requirement of crop j m3 ha 4 nonnegative constraint 8e sw j 0 gw j 0 j sw j and gw j are the decision variables and they should be nonnegative m3 ha because the coefficients of interval quadratic cwpfs c j and d j have different sign i e c j 0 and d j 0 a dam method is adopted to solve problem cai et al 2011 a mid value model is formulated firstly and the corresponding criteria based on the solutions can be used to determine the results see section 2 5 then the inmfccp model can be solved through transforming it into two deterministic submodels therefore by solving the upper and lower bounds submodels we have solutions 9a f opt f opt f opt 9b sw j opt sw j opt sw j opt 9c gw j opt gw j opt gw j opt 4 results and discussion two risk related parameters are introduced i e confidence level ξ i 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 0 and preference parameters λ 0 1 0 2 0 9 to examine the variations of constraints and then generate decision solutions from the inmfccp model whether the manager s decision preferences and changes in the confidence level in the system will have an impact on the results by solving the first submodel upper bound submodel and the second submodel lower bound submodel optimal solution of the decision variables and objective function can be obtained therefore the optimal interval solutions with different risk parameters combinations ξ i and λ for crop irrigation water allocation can be found the results of the solution have deterministic values and interval solutions which shows that the change of parameter and system uncertainty have influence on the result generally the upper and lower bounds of the interval values indicate the decision space and range of the solution the smaller the difference in the upper and lower bounds of the interval the smaller the uncertainty range of the results and thus the results provide a more reliable reference for the manager more results analysis are presented as follows 4 1 optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation table 4 presents optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation under different λ when confidence level ξ i is fixed at 0 9 generally different λ can reflect the manager s decision aspiration preferences and attitudes such as optimism or pessimism especially when system input information is presented as fuzzy uncertainty an increased preference parameter means possibility experiences a steady rise when deciding on the constraints and objective functions more possibility will lead to an expended decision space in the right side hand constraints the results show that there is water competition among different crops with the variation of different λ the results of economic crops remain unchanged all of which are 0 2648 8 2851 0 m3 ha surface water groundwater this results imply that the economic crops are all irrigated by groundwater and they are not sensitive to the system variations for other three crops with the increase of λ there is an overall decrease in the optimal irrigation water allocation of surface water while we can see the opposite trend in that of groundwater this is due to the fact that the irrigation water use coefficient of groundwater is greater than that of surface water η g η s resulting in the system choosing less surface water to achieve greater economic benefits for example when λ changes from 0 1 to 0 9 the results of field maize is 2986 0 3218 5 1896 7 1906 1 m3 ha 2983 6 3215 3 1899 9 1908 5 m3 ha 2979 5 3211 0 1904 2 1912 6 m3 ha 2966 9 3205 4 1909 8 1925 5 m3 ha 2961 6 3199 9 1915 3 1930 2 m3 ha 2955 3 3186 0 1929 2 1936 8 m3 ha 2936 6 3167 1 1948 1 1955 5 m3 ha 2900 9 3130 2 1985 0 1991 2 m3 ha and 2773 8 2992 4 2118 3 2122 8 m3 ha surface water groundwater respectively in general the allocated surface water is roughly greater than groundwater because surface water is the main source of irrigation water moreover the difference between upper bound and lower bound of the allocated surface water still remain ahead of groundwater indicating that the results of groundwater changes in a small range table 5 provides optimal irrigation water allocation solutions under different ξ i when preference parameter is fixed at 0 5 different ξ i illustrate the satisfactory degree of constraints in addition a higher confidence level renders the constraints to become increasingly strict for the optimization model this will make the system more reliable and less risky while the decision space will be smaller e g decreased water availabilities in addition to the optimal solutions of economic crops remaining unchanged the allocated surface water of the other three crops is increasing and the allocated groundwater is decreasing when ξ i is raised from 0 7 to 1 0 taking seed maize as an example the optimal solutions are 4497 2 4687 6 721 1 768 0 m3 ha 4570 8 4767 7 641 0 694 4 m3 ha 4660 6 4859 6 549 2 604 6 m3 ha 4734 1 4891 1 517 6 531 1 m3 ha under an increased ξ i under a higher ξ i both surface water and groundwater availabilities have slightly shrunk whereas the available surface water is overwhelmingly greater than the available groundwater therefore under such circumstances to satisfy the crop irrigation water demands surface water is prone to be allocated for irrigation the results show that managers and systems conditions become more conservative as confidence levels rise 4 2 system benefits different scenarios with different set of λ and ξ i will yield different system benefits the interval solutions with lower and upper bounds provide two extremes of the objective functions based on the optimal irrigation water allocation pattern fig 4 presents system benefits under different λ and ξ i the results show that a higher preference parameter i e more possibility will lead to greater objective function values system benefits for example when λ is raised from 0 1 to 0 9 the solutions of system benefits will be slightly increased from 55309 58 92029 11 104 yuan to 55419 27 92111 64 104 yuan when ξ i is fixed at 0 8 moreover the greater the λ is the greater the growth rate of system benefits besides this result also reflects the subjective judgment of the managers that is optimism or pessimism for example when λ 0 1 managers have a pessimistic attitude toward water availabilities less possibility is considered leading to more difficulties when deciding on satisfying the objective function conversely planning under λ 0 9 shows that a higher system benefits can be obtained due to their optimistic towards and easily satisfied objective functions furthermore compared with credibility measure i e λ 0 5 the developed inmfccp model involving m λ measure i e λ 0 1 0 9 can explicitly show the influence of the change of λ on the results and it can express more systematic uncertain information because credibility measure can only provide a single solution in terms of ξ i as shown in fig 4 the results indicate that a higher ξ i leads to slightly lower system benefits than that of lower ξ i under a range of λ levels for example when ξ i is raised from 0 7 to 1 0 and λ 0 1 system benefits will decrease from 55314 41 92034 39 104 yuan to 55299 9 92018 56 104 yuan as for λ 0 9 the results is 55464 86 92157 24 104 yuan 55419 27 92111 64 104 yuan 55343 44 92066 05 104 yuan 55299 9 92018 56 104 yuan when ξ i 0 7 1 0 obviously an increased ξ i leads to an increased strictness for the constraints of the optimization model thereby generating a smaller decision space both the λ and ξ i in the decision making process are connected with the risk level a higher λ means much more possibility and positive strategy indicating a larger degree of constraints violation risk however a lower λ i e less possibility and more necessary will bring the risk arising from conservative strategies that eventually lead to resources not being taken full advantage of moreover the higher ξ i is the better the constraint is satisfied the more reliable results can be obtained theoretically a higher ξ i corresponding to a high degree of satisfaction level of constraints and thus a lower system failure risk therefore the corresponding objective function values can be obtained by giving different λ and ξ i the above analysis shows that the results can reflect the interrelationships among system benefits λ ξ i and risk level 4 3 discussion in terms of application problems interval quadratic cwpfs are adopted as the basic framework for irrigation planning to better reflect the effect of the interval quadratic cwpfs on the optimal results deterministic quadratic cwpfs table 1 based on the least square method is introduced for comparison and the other interval parameters take their mean values thus the inmfccp model can be changed into a deterministic one table 6 presents the optimal irrigation water allocation solutions based on deterministic model under different λ and ξ i 0 9 it is found that the deterministic model can only provide single solution for managers fig 5 illustrates comparison of the obtained results resulting from deterministic and inmfccp models under ξ i 0 9 obviously the results from deterministic model appear in the middle of the upper and lower bound values of the inmfccp model the results are fixed values rather than interval values even though their change trends are similar to the inmfccp solutions this results indicate that the deterministic model only represents a special case and it may be highly vulnerable because of system variation and uncertainties in summary on one hand the interval quadratic cwpfs are indeed informative and superior to deterministic ones to provide abundant information about system conditions for example observation errors measurement and computation methods of the field experimental data will definitely affect the fitting results of cwpfs interval quadratic cwpfs can effectively reveal these complexities and uncertainties in the practical applications and experiment process and thus make the results more reliable therefore the optimal solutions based on interval quadratic cwpfs can provide a more scientific and effective decision making support on the other hand without considering interval uncertainty the generated optimal schemes are relatively simple and poorly inflexible while the interval results can provide a decision space the results can fluctuate in the upper and lower bounds which can provide more choices in terms of model it s able to balance optimism and pessimism from various decision alternatives by introducing m λ measure with varying preference parameters λ accordingly the developed models can reflect extensive information and results and support in depth analysis moreover it should be noted that when the λ 0 5 the framework of the model is transformed into credibility measure based model which can be regarded as a simplified and special case of the inmfccp model see table 5 compared with the developed model the results based on credibility measure is a single solution therefore the developed model can extensively reflect the credibility possibility and necessary problems which can be regarded as a more generalized and practical method 5 conclusions an inexact nonlinear m λ measure fuzzy chance constrained programming inmfccp model is developed for irrigation water allocation under uncertainty it s applied to a case study in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin northwest china this study can effectively address the following difficulties of optimal irrigation water allocation in 1 interval and fuzzy uncertainties in the system 2 nonlinear objective function 3 allocating irrigation water to different crops to achieve maximum system benefits and 4 identifying the optimal irrigation water allocation solutions under different λ and ξ i moreover this model improves on the conventional fuzzy chance constrained programming by introducing a linear combination of possibility measure and necessity measure therefore it can balance optimism and pessimism from various decision alternatives the interval quadratic cwpfs based on the interval regression analysis method can better reflect the complexity and uncertainty in practical applications the results can effectively reflect the interrelationships among system benefits λ ξ i and risk level this study attempts to present a novel optimization model framework for dealing with nonlinear optimization problems in a fuzzy environment although this developed model is used for optimal irrigation water management under uncertainty the results suggest that it s also applicable to other resources and environmental management problems however it also has some limitations when accounting for the problems involved in many practical factors such as soil types soil moisture content and their dynamic variations consequently the integration of more practical factors is desired for further improving the inmfccp model besides the inmfccp model can be further investigated by integrating methods of stochastic mathematical programming integer programming and

7563,combined sewer overflow causes severe water pollution urban flooding and reduced treatment plant efficiency understanding the behavior of cso structures is vital for urban flooding prevention and overflow control neural networks have been extensively applied in water resource related fields in this study we collect data from an internet of things monitoring cso structure and build different neural network models for simulating and predicting the water level of the cso structure through a comparison of four different neural networks namely multilayer perceptron mlp wavelet neural network wnn long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru the lstm and gru present superior capabilities for multi step ahead time series prediction furthermore gru achieves prediction performances similar to lstm with a quicker learning curve keywords combined sewer overflow deep learning long short term memory gated recurrent unit internet of things 1 introduction the sewer system is one of the most important infrastructures in modern cities although separate sewer systems have been introduced decades old combined sewer system still continues to service many developed cities under normal circumstances these systems transport all wastewater to the wastewater treatment plant during heavy rainfall events when wastewater volume exceeds the capacity of the sewer system the combined sewer system is designed to overflow and discharge wastewater directly to water bodies this phenomenon is called combined sewer overflow cso climate change and rapid urbanization in metropolitan areas have resulted in an increase in the cso over the last decades decreasing the influence of overflows is an important part of reducing pollution in water bodies garofalo et al 2017 autixier et al 2014 lucas and sample 2015 several cities have employed internet of things iot to monitor the performance of sewer systems and to provide useful data to managers and engineers montserrat et al 2015 the basic idea of iot is to let things such as sensors actuators mobile or desktop devices etc be able to interact and cooperate with each other through wireless communication protocols giusto 2010 iot is a new catalyst for the data explosion the world will have 50 billion iot devices by 2020 these devices will generate massive data to extract insight from data collected by iot and convey the extracted insight to stakeholders the analysis and application of iot data are as important as data collection for example for the cso structures in addition to properly monitoring it is also imperative to construct a model to predict the cso events by utilizing data from the realm of iot the model is expected to provide sufficient response time for making decisions about cso control protect downstream hydraulic infrastructures during extreme rainfall events and mitigate the impact of cso on the receiving waters garofalo et al 2017 chang et al 2014 mounce et al 2014 darsono and labadie 2007 grum et al 2011 most iot data collected by sensors have a temporal dimension and can be modeled as a time series characterized by high complexity dynamism and non stationarity time series forecasting has always presented a challenge to hydrologists nourani et al 2014 recent years have seen a significant rise in the number of machine learning approaches applied to hydrologic time series forecasting among numerous machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine k nearest neighbors or linear discriminant analysis artificial neural network ann had shown superior performance for iot time series data alam et al 2016 as the most traditional ann multilayer perceptron mlp is a very popular tool for handling hydrologic time series problems in previous researches a few studies have explored using mlp and data collected by iot to predict cso events kurth et al 2008 mounce et al 2014 another common practice in solving hydrologic time series problems is couple wavelet transforms wt with different ann such as the mlp wt is a kind of technique that can illustrate how the frequency content of a signal changes over time wt relies on the mother wavelet which can be changed according to the shape and compactness of the signal barzegar et al 2017 ann that use mother wavelet as activation functions instead of traditionally used sigmoid function are called wavelet neural network wnn wang and ding 2003 wnn had shown have better fitting in estimating hydrologic time series data nourani et al 2014 the advances of wnn had led to an increase in hydrological studies for different applications such as hydro climatology time series prediction alexandridis and zapranis 2013 reservoir inflow modeling abghari et al 2009 chen et al 2006 and evaporation prediction abghari et al 2012 a state of the art branch of ann is deep learning hinton et al 2006 ann have been less active during a period called artificial intelligence ai winter marçais and de dreuzy 2017 in recent years renewed interest in ann surged in part due to exposure in popular media when the computer program google deepmind s alphago defeated go game world champion silver et al 2016 the game changer behind the revival of ann is deep learning deep learning is a topic that is making big waves now alongside alphago a fascinating application of deep learning is the latest google neural machine translation gnmt system released in 2016 the gnmt system produces translation quality that is vastly improved compared to previous systems even for a notoriously difficult language pair chinese to english google 2016 the technology utilized by the gnmt system is a kind of recurrent neural network rnn long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 rnn is a kind of advanced ann that involves feedback connections in the architecture unlike traditional ann that all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other the output of rnn depends on previous computations as well as calculations of the current time step one way to think about rnn is that they have a memory that captures information from previous computations rnn are considered very effective in modeling complex hydrologic time series however due to the difficulty of learning long range dependencies the training of rnn can be extremely challenging this problem is commonly known as the vanishing exploding gradient problem hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 therefore certain types of rnn such as lstm were designed to solve these problems lstm is today s dominant technology in the field of natural language processing when processing natural language the model has to consider not only the current word but also other adjoining words in the sentence or even paragraph data with this kind of context information called sequential data time series data are the most popular form of sequential data stimulated by the success of lstm on machine translation a few studies have explored the power of lstm on time series prediction and obtained promising results zaytar and amrani 2016 ma et al 2015 xingjian et al 2015 one drawback of lstm is its complexity therefore simplifying lstm has become a highly researched topic in the field of computer science the gated recurrent unit gru cho et al 2014 first proposed in 2014 is one of the most successful lstm variants chung et al 2014 evaluated the performance of lstm and gru on the tasks of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling the evaluation revealed the gru to be comparable to lstm and better performing than more traditional rnn to the best of the author s knowledge no prior studies have employed gru to analyze time series data given the success of the gru in modeling sequential data such as speech synthesis wu king 2016 sentiment classification tang et al 2015 targeted sentiment analysis zhang et al 2016 etc the effectiveness of gru on the prediction of hydrologic time series has to be investigated the objectives of this research are to investigate the performance of lstm and gru on predicting the multi step ahead hydrologic time series data collected by the iot and to compare with the performance of traditional methods such as mlp and wnn the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a general description about the study area and different algorithms are provided in the first section the simulation results are presented in section two where the prediction efficiencies of the studied algorithms are compared conclusions and envisioned future developments are discussed at the end of this paper 2 method and data 2 1 case study area drammen is a coastal city with approximately 150 000 inhabitants located in the southeast of norway it is the fourth largest city in norway and the capital of buskerud county the catchment of drammen s sewer system is around 15 km2 and the total length of the sewer system is approximately 500 km fig 1 is an overview of drammen in fig 1 the rain gauges are denoted by squares and cso structures are denoted by triangles the traditional city center distributes along the drammen fjord which flows through drammen the sewer system in the city center mainly consists of the combined sewer system during heavy rainfall events the combined sewer system in the city center discharges overflows directly into the drammen fjord though cso structures cause heavy pollution in order to mitigate pollutions from the combined sewer system the government of drammen initialized the regnbyge 3 m project the ultimate goal of the regnbyge 3 m project is integrates intelligent monitoring modeling and control solutions manage the sewer system and water bodies in a holistic way this study focuses on the cso structure of dr hansteensgate which located adjacent to important infrastructures such as the train station shopping center and the stadium the risks of overflow and consequent pollution risks may be decreased if accurate hydrological time series prediction can be provided therefore to test the performance of different ann models against this objective dr hansteensgate cso highlighted by a circle in fig 1 was selected for consideration 2 2 the regnbyge no iot in order to monitor the hydraulic behavior of cso structures data must be provided for further analysis and model construction in the first phase of the regnbyge 3 m project rosim as norway developed an iot regnbyge no to monitor the sewer system typical iot architecture consists of three layers sensing layer network layer and application layer atzori et al 2010 the sensing layer includes devices that are deployed in the field such as sensors actuators and wireless transmitters the major function of the sensing layer is to collect data the network layer provides a bridge between the sensing layer and the application layer in the network layer data sensed by sensors transmit through wireless communication protocols to the application layer on the top of the iot architecture is the application layer it enabling users algorithms or models to interact with devices in the sensing layer the sensing layer of the regnbyge no iot consists of ultrasonic water level sensors produced by nivus gmbh germany and rain gauges the measurements collected by the water level sensors and rain gauges transmit using wireless telemetry to a remote server located inside rosim as a spatial database is designed to manage the transmitted data simplifying the process for searching editing and giving real time information in a user friendly way once data is stored in the database information can be shared via the web and accessed through a desktop or mobile devices furthermore the data in the database is visualized using web based geographic information system web gis currently the web gis only provides an interface for displaying real time and historical data of the water level and rainfall in the next phase of the regnbyge 3 m project forecasting models and actuators will be implemented in the regnbyge no iot the forecasting model will predict future water levels according to the predicted water level managers of the sewer system can operate actuators timely using control commands sent from the server thus guide the behavior of cso structures fig 2 displays major components of the regnbyge no iot platform fig 2 a shows an ultrasonic water level sensor installed on the top of a cso structure fig 2 b illustrates how engineers embed a sensor s antenna in the road surface fig 2 c is the installation of a transmitter on a lamp post fig 2 d demonstrates the user interface of the regnbyge no iot 2 3 ann 2 3 1 mlp mlp is one of the most popular ann which is usually comprised of input layer hidden layer and output layer there are some neurons in each layer and different layers are connected by weights and bias fig 3 shows the architecture of a three layered mlp in fig 3 the circles denote neurons and lines between circles denote weights the mlp first computes the weighted sum of the inputs which can be mathematically represented as 1 s i 1 n w i x i b where w i represents the weights x i is the inputs b is the bias afterwards the computed weighted sum s is fed into the neuron the neuron consists of an activation function there are various functions that can be used and the most classical one is the sigmoid function the sigmoid function is defined as 2 f s 1 1 e s when training the mlp the ultimate goal is to minimize the cost function the cost function can be defined as 3 c 1 2 f s f s observed 2 where c is the cost of the cost function f s is the predicted output from neuron and f s observed is the observed true value back propagation bp is the most commonly used training algorithms bp uses the chain rule of differentiation to calculate the partial derivative or gradient of the cost corresponding to the weights for a single training example of a neuron the gradient of cost c corresponding to a weight w i can be represented as 4 c w i c f s f s s s w i the partial derivative of the cost function corresponding to activation function is 5 c f s f s f s observed the partial derivative of the sigmoid activation function corresponding to the weighted sum input of the neuron s is 6 f s s f s 1 f s bp calculates the error contribution of each neuron the cost function i e error between predicted and observed value can be minimized through adjusting the weights of each neuron 2 3 2 wnn wt is a multi resolution analysis in time and frequency domain for example for time series f t wt is the sum over all time of f t multiplied by the scale 7 w f a b a 1 2 f t ψ t b a dt where ψ t is the mother wavelet a is the parameter defining the window of analysis b is the parameter localizing the wavelet function in the time domain and f t is the complex conjugate of the basic wavelet function w f a b represents the correlation between the signal f t and a scaled version of the function ψ t similar to mlp the wnn also consists of an input layer hidden layer and output layer the difference of wnn is its use mother wavelet as an activation function the neuron of wnn often referred as wavelons which transfer the input variables to the dilated and translated version of the mother wavelet the mother wavelet used in this study is the morlet mother wavelet morlet mother wavelet is a complex exponential with a gaussian envelope that ensures localization fig 4 shows the morlet mother wavelet the mathematical representation of the morlet wavelet activation function is given as 8 f x cos 1 75 x e x 2 2 when training the wnn through bp the partial derivation of the morlet wavelet activation function can be written as 9 f x x 1 75 sin 1 75 x e x 2 2 x cos 1 75 x e x 2 2 according to several recent studies majeed et al 2017 chitsaz et al 2015 xu liu 2013 alexandridis and zapranis 2013 morlet wavelet ann is a good alternative in cases with difficult nonlinear systems the morlet wavelet ann is reliable and robust it can solve the problem with almost the same accuracy as other wnns with the mexican hat wavelet or haar wavelet based activation function 2 3 3 lstm different from traditional ann rnn elman 1990 takes the state of the hidden neuron at the previous time steps as an additional input for the next time step ishak et al 2003 as shown in fig 5 the neuron state of the present time step h t 1 is calculated by the equation 10 h t 1 w h 1 h t w i 1 x t 1 b similar to h t 1 the h t is calculated by 11 h t w h h t 1 w i x t b where h t 1 h t and h t 1 are states of the hidden neuron at the time step t 1 t and t 1 respectively w i 1 w i and w h 1 w h are weights between input values and hidden neurons input weights and between hidden neurons hidden weights respectively the training of rnn relies on an extended version of bp called backpropagation through time bptt unlike bp bptt not only calculates the gradient of the cost corresponding to the input weights but also the gradient of the cost corresponding to the hidden weights of the previous time steps as shown in fig 5 the dashed line and arrow is the direction of gradient calculation of bptt bptt first calculates the gradient of output at time step t 1 o t 1 in fig 5 corresponding to the state of hidden neuron at time step t 1 h t 1 in fig 5 i e o t 1 h t 1 in fig 5 it then calculates the gradient of the state of hidden neuron at time step t 1 corresponding to the state of hidden neuron at previous time step h t 1 h t in fig 5 and backpropagation to earlier neurons step by step in this way when using the bptt method with gradient calculation the error of partial derivative accumulates through time steps hence it will be extremely hard to learn and tune the parameters of the earlier neurons and learn long term dependencies because the gradient going through the network either gets very small and vanish or gets very large and explode this problem is commonly known as the vanishing exploding gradient problem in recent years modern rnn combat vanishing exploding gradient such as lstm had been proposed lipton et al 2015 gers 2001 gers et al 2000 the lstm replaced the ordinary neuron in the hidden layer with a memory cell and three gates the input gate forget gate and output gate lstm can selectively update the memory cell state based on the new input forget irrelevant content or selectively output part of the memory cell state as the new hidden neuron state according to the state of the input forget and output gate respectively similar to data in a computer s memory in this way the lstm is able to learn long time span time series fig 6 shows the neuron in the hidden layer of lstm i f and o represent the input forget and output gate respectively c and c denote the memory cell and the new memory cell the principal of the memory cell in lstm can be mathematically represented by the following equations input gate 12 i t σ g w i x t u i h t 1 v i c t 1 b i forget gate 13 f t σ g w f x t u f h t 1 v f c t 1 b f output gate 14 o t σ g w o x t u o h t 1 v o c t 1 b o cell state 15 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 16 c t σ c w c x t u c h t 1 b c output vector 17 h t o t σ h c t where x t is the input vector w u v and b are parameters for weights and bias represents the scalar product of two vectors σ g is the sigmoid function σ h and σ c are hyperbolic tangent function for a given input z the output of hyperbolic tangent function is 18 f z e z e z e z e z 2 3 4 gru the concept of a gru is quite similar to lstm the gru also use gates to modulate the flow of information inside the neuron in the hidden layer the difference is the gru has two gates reset gate and an update gate while lstm has three gates gru combines the input and forget gates into an update gate to balance between previous activation and the candidate activation the activation of h at time t depends on h at the previous time and the candidate h the h in fig 7 the update gate z decides how much of the previous memory to keep around the gru unit forgets the previously computed state when the reset gate r is off cho et al 2014 chung et al 2014 the gru is formulated as 19 z t σ g w z x t u z h t 1 b z 20 r t σ g w r x t u r h t 1 b r 21 h t z t h t 1 1 z t h t 22 h t σ h w h x t u t r t h t 1 b h where x t is the input vector h t is the output vector z t is the update gate vector h t is the reset gate vector w u and b are parameters for weights and bias represents the scalar product of two vectors σ is the sigmoid function σ g represent the sigmoid activation function σ h represent the hyperbolic tangent activation function 2 3 5 model implementation in this paper the mlp and wnn were implemented using matlab r2016a the lstm and gru were programmed using keras chollet 2015 keras is a high level deep learning library it is written in python and runs on top of either tensorflow abadi et al 2016 or theano backend tensorflow backend was employed in this study tensorflow is an open source software for deep learning released by google in 2015 besides keras and tensorflow other python libraries such as matplotlib numpy pandas sklearn were also used 2 4 model performance criteria the performance of the developed models was evaluated by three criteria the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the coefficient of determination r2 the calculation of rmse as shown below 23 rmse i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 n rmse value of 0 means a perfect fit between observed and predicted values nse is a parameter that determines the relative importance of residual variance noise compare to the variance in the measured data information the nse is calculated by the following equation 24 nse 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 nse varies from to 1 nse 1 indicates a perfect correlation between simulated and observed data values between 0 0 and 1 0 is generally acceptable the equation for the coefficient of determination r2

equations n y i obs the i th observed data y i sim the i th simulated data y mean mean value of observed data y sim mean mean value of simulated data n number of data 3 results and discussion 3 1 datasets for ann training according to cso water level data of dr hansteensgate and rainfall intensity data from the fagerlibakken rain gauge recorded by the regnbyge no iot during 2014 26 cso events were selected for constructing ann models in this study during a cso event the water level in the cso structures rises due to rainfall in the associated catchment the fagerlibakken rain gauge was selected using the cross correlation function xcorr function in matlab r2016a the collected time series data have 2352 records with a temporal resolution of 10 min in consideration of maintaining similar statistical characteristics 20 events were selected as training sets and the remaining 6 events were allocated as testing sets the difference between training and testing is regularization mechanisms which is used to prevent overfitting are turned off during the testing mode dropout and l2 weight penalty method were used as regularization methods in this study dropout is a technique that randomly drops selected neurons and set their associated weights to zero during training l2 weight penalty method adds an extra squared term to the cost function to constrain the weights it keeps the weights small unless they have big error derivatives the summary statistics for water levels and rainfall are presented in table 1 3 2 training of ann as the primary objective of this paper to anticipate the occurrence of cso events and develop early warning and supply references for necessary cso reduction measures different ann models were developed the purposes of the developed models are to predict the one to six step ahead water level in the cso structure based on data collected by iot to make a fair comparison the input of the developed ann models remain the same i e data from the previous six steps collected by iot after confirming input data and prediction goals the training of anns was implemented through trial and error procedures while the best performed mlp has one hidden layer with fifteen hidden neurons the wnn used in this study has one hidden layer with eighteen wavelons the optimal structure of lstm and gru have two hidden layers with ten hidden neurons in each layer in this study the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used for training of mlp the wnn was trained using the standard bp method for lstm and gru the adam kingma and ba 2014 method was selected as the optimization algorithm 3 3 performance of ann all the four ann models performed rather consistently in the training stages while showing different performance during the testing stages the results for the one to six step ahead cso water level forecasting within the testing stages are provided in table 2 as shown in table 2 the model prediction accuracy reduced as the prediction steps increased for the one step ahead prediction all the ann models showed satisfying results with low rmse value high nse value and high r2 value when turning the prediction time step to two the performance of mlp deteriorated immediately compared to the one step ahead prediction the rmse value of mlp for the two step ahead prediction almost doubled increasing from 0 0918 to 0 1656 the r2 value and nse values reduced from 0 9531 and 0 9197 to 0 8967 and 0 7648 respectively with longer time steps the mlp performance decreased continually it reveals that as a static feedforward ann the mlp is not suitable for multi step ahead forecasting the wnn presented better performance than mlp for three step ahead prediction the wnn even got the highest r2 value 0 9334 however this fact alone doesn t prove that the performance of wnn is better than lstm and gru when comprehensively considering all the performance criteria because the remaining values of rmse nse and r2 of wnn are very unstable across the different time steps compared to lstm and gru when the prediction time step exceeds four lstm and gru outperform mlp and wnn in terms of all the performance criteria lstm and gru even produce low rmse value around 0 15 high nse value around 0 8 and high r2 value around 0 8 as the prediction time step reaches six besides lstm shows a slightly better performance than gru but the difference is marginal to further illustrate the performance of lstm gru and wnn in a more intuitive way hydrographs of the observed versus four five and six step ahead predicted water level for three rainfall events in the testing sets were drawn in fig 8 for six step ahead prediction fig 8 d f when the cso water level starts to increase the lstm and gru react quicker than wnn whereas the wnn presents the time lag problem moreover it obviously shows that lstm and gru better predict the peak water level while the wnn either underestimates or overestimates the peak value the inconsistency of wnn indicates its poor performance compared to lstm and gru similar observations can also be found in the five and four step ahead prediction fig 8 g i only in fig 8 k does the wnn look more stable than lstm and gru as we can see from fig 8 in general the lstm and gru can better capture the sudden change of water levels compared to wnn and significantly alleviate the time lag problem at the peak value in terms of peak water level the wnn either underestimates or undergoes strong fluctuations at the peak value this is probably due to the insufficient learning capability of wnn predictions by both lstm and gru showed very similar behavior especially for the six step ahead prediction however the gru has several advantages compared to lstm fig 9 displays the learning curves of lstm and gru in fig 9 the x axis is epochs one full training cycle on the training samples and the y axis is the rmse value the gru makes faster progress than lstm during training the rmse value of the gru is lower than lstm during the first 30 epochs but the final rmse value of the gru is slightly higher than lstm the quick learning curve of the gru is due to its simplified architecture for large scale data the model training can consume a significant amount of cpu time hence the gru s quicker convergence and comparable performance is a good alternative to lstm on the other hand the gru has fewer parameters to make predictions in iot the controller has to calculate the future water level based on real time water level data read from the sensor and the parameters of the prediction model with fewer parameters the hardware implementation and the real time computing process of controllers could be simplified and accelerated 4 conclusion in order to reduce pollutions caused by cso it is essential to predict the cso event in advance the prediction could enable better decision making greater automation and higher efficiencies through a case study in drammen norway the present work compared the performance of four ann on the multi step ahead prediction of the cso water level collected by iot the preliminary conclusions summarized below the mlp only presented accurate predictions for the one and two step ahead prediction but not for multi step ahead predictions wnn can improve the multi step ahead predictions however when checking the hydrography of observed and predicted water level the wnn presented several problems such as time delay and strong fluctuation with the gating mechanisms the lstm and gru outperformed wnn and mlp both lstm and gru achieved satisfying results for multi step ahead prediction the behavior of lstm and gru is quite similar lstm had marginally better performance than gru but the advantages of gru are the quicker learning curve fewer parameters and simpler architecture for practical problems with very large datasets the gru provides a trade off between accuracy and training time iot will become the backbone of urban success devices are integrated together in order to enhance key smart sectors such as transport energy water supply and waste treatment on the other hand advanced ai techniques such as the lstm have shown their power of optimizing iot there are many possible scenarios to extend iot for purposes of environmental monitoring and modeling applications the potential power of deep learning is fascinating and it is worth to conduct further studies about adapting deep learning into water resource related fields studies about the performance of other deep learning methods such as deep belief nets stacked deep encode and generative adversarial networks in water resource related fields are other interesting research directions in the future acknowledgements this work has been supported by the regnbyge

7563,combined sewer overflow causes severe water pollution urban flooding and reduced treatment plant efficiency understanding the behavior of cso structures is vital for urban flooding prevention and overflow control neural networks have been extensively applied in water resource related fields in this study we collect data from an internet of things monitoring cso structure and build different neural network models for simulating and predicting the water level of the cso structure through a comparison of four different neural networks namely multilayer perceptron mlp wavelet neural network wnn long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru the lstm and gru present superior capabilities for multi step ahead time series prediction furthermore gru achieves prediction performances similar to lstm with a quicker learning curve keywords combined sewer overflow deep learning long short term memory gated recurrent unit internet of things 1 introduction the sewer system is one of the most important infrastructures in modern cities although separate sewer systems have been introduced decades old combined sewer system still continues to service many developed cities under normal circumstances these systems transport all wastewater to the wastewater treatment plant during heavy rainfall events when wastewater volume exceeds the capacity of the sewer system the combined sewer system is designed to overflow and discharge wastewater directly to water bodies this phenomenon is called combined sewer overflow cso climate change and rapid urbanization in metropolitan areas have resulted in an increase in the cso over the last decades decreasing the influence of overflows is an important part of reducing pollution in water bodies garofalo et al 2017 autixier et al 2014 lucas and sample 2015 several cities have employed internet of things iot to monitor the performance of sewer systems and to provide useful data to managers and engineers montserrat et al 2015 the basic idea of iot is to let things such as sensors actuators mobile or desktop devices etc be able to interact and cooperate with each other through wireless communication protocols giusto 2010 iot is a new catalyst for the data explosion the world will have 50 billion iot devices by 2020 these devices will generate massive data to extract insight from data collected by iot and convey the extracted insight to stakeholders the analysis and application of iot data are as important as data collection for example for the cso structures in addition to properly monitoring it is also imperative to construct a model to predict the cso events by utilizing data from the realm of iot the model is expected to provide sufficient response time for making decisions about cso control protect downstream hydraulic infrastructures during extreme rainfall events and mitigate the impact of cso on the receiving waters garofalo et al 2017 chang et al 2014 mounce et al 2014 darsono and labadie 2007 grum et al 2011 most iot data collected by sensors have a temporal dimension and can be modeled as a time series characterized by high complexity dynamism and non stationarity time series forecasting has always presented a challenge to hydrologists nourani et al 2014 recent years have seen a significant rise in the number of machine learning approaches applied to hydrologic time series forecasting among numerous machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine k nearest neighbors or linear discriminant analysis artificial neural network ann had shown superior performance for iot time series data alam et al 2016 as the most traditional ann multilayer perceptron mlp is a very popular tool for handling hydrologic time series problems in previous researches a few studies have explored using mlp and data collected by iot to predict cso events kurth et al 2008 mounce et al 2014 another common practice in solving hydrologic time series problems is couple wavelet transforms wt with different ann such as the mlp wt is a kind of technique that can illustrate how the frequency content of a signal changes over time wt relies on the mother wavelet which can be changed according to the shape and compactness of the signal barzegar et al 2017 ann that use mother wavelet as activation functions instead of traditionally used sigmoid function are called wavelet neural network wnn wang and ding 2003 wnn had shown have better fitting in estimating hydrologic time series data nourani et al 2014 the advances of wnn had led to an increase in hydrological studies for different applications such as hydro climatology time series prediction alexandridis and zapranis 2013 reservoir inflow modeling abghari et al 2009 chen et al 2006 and evaporation prediction abghari et al 2012 a state of the art branch of ann is deep learning hinton et al 2006 ann have been less active during a period called artificial intelligence ai winter marçais and de dreuzy 2017 in recent years renewed interest in ann surged in part due to exposure in popular media when the computer program google deepmind s alphago defeated go game world champion silver et al 2016 the game changer behind the revival of ann is deep learning deep learning is a topic that is making big waves now alongside alphago a fascinating application of deep learning is the latest google neural machine translation gnmt system released in 2016 the gnmt system produces translation quality that is vastly improved compared to previous systems even for a notoriously difficult language pair chinese to english google 2016 the technology utilized by the gnmt system is a kind of recurrent neural network rnn long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 rnn is a kind of advanced ann that involves feedback connections in the architecture unlike traditional ann that all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other the output of rnn depends on previous computations as well as calculations of the current time step one way to think about rnn is that they have a memory that captures information from previous computations rnn are considered very effective in modeling complex hydrologic time series however due to the difficulty of learning long range dependencies the training of rnn can be extremely challenging this problem is commonly known as the vanishing exploding gradient

on time series prediction and obtained promising results zaytar and amrani 2016 ma et al 2015 xingjian et al 2015 one drawback of lstm is its complexity therefore simplifying lstm has become a highly researched topic in the field of computer science the gated recurrent unit gru cho et al 2014 first proposed in 2014 is one of the most successful lstm variants chung et al 2014 evaluated the performance of lstm and gru on the tasks of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling the evaluation revealed the gru to be comparable to lstm and better performing than more traditional rnn to the best of the author s knowledge no prior studies have employed gru to analyze time series data given the success of the gru in modeling sequential data such as speech synthesis wu king 2016 sentiment classification tang et al 2015 targeted sentiment analysis zhang et al 2016 etc the effectiveness of gru on the prediction of hydrologic time series has to be investigated the objectives of this research are to investigate the performance of lstm and gru on predicting the multi step ahead hydrologic time series data collected by the iot and to compare with the performance of traditional methods such as mlp and wnn the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a general description about the study area and different algorithms are provided in the first section the simulation

of the cost function f s is the predicted output from neuron and f s observed is the observed true value back propagation bp is the most commonly used training algorithms bp uses the chain rule of differentiation to calculate the partial derivative or gradient of the cost corresponding to the weights for a single training example of a neuron the gradient of cost c corresponding to a weight w i can be represented as 4 c w i c f s f s s s w i the partial derivative of the cost function corresponding to activation function is 5 c f s f s f s observed the partial derivative of the sigmoid activation function corresponding to the weighted sum input of the neuron s is 6 f s s f s 1 f s bp calculates the error contribution of each neuron the cost function i e error between predicted and observed value can be minimized through adjusting the weights of each neuron 2 3 2 wnn wt is a multi resolution analysis in time and frequency domain for example for time series f t wt is the sum over all time of f t multiplied by the scale 7 w f a b a 1 2 f t ψ t b a dt where ψ t is the mother wavelet a is the parameter defining the window of analysis b is the parameter localizing the wavelet function in the time domain and f t is the complex conjugate of the basic wavelet function w f a b represents the correlation between the signal f t and a scaled version of the function ψ t similar to mlp the wnn also consists of an input layer hidden layer and output layer the difference of wnn is its use mother wavelet as an activation function the neuron of wnn often referred as wavelons which transfer the input variables to the dilated and translated version of the mother wavelet the mother wavelet used in this study is the morlet mother wavelet morlet mother wavelet is a complex exponential with a gaussian envelope that ensures localization fig 4 shows the morlet mother wavelet the mathematical representation of the morlet wavelet activation function is given as 8 f x cos 1 75 x e x 2 2 when training the wnn through bp the partial derivation of the morlet wavelet activation function can be written as 9 f x x 1 75 sin 1 75 x e x 2 2 x cos 1 75 x e x 2 2 according to several recent studies majeed et al 2017 chitsaz et al 2015 xu liu 2013 alexandridis and zapranis 2013 morlet wavelet ann is a good alternative in cases with difficult nonlinear systems the morlet wavelet ann is reliable and robust it can solve the problem with almost the same accuracy as other wnns with the mexican hat wavelet or haar wavelet based activation function 2 3 3 lstm different from traditional ann rnn elman 1990 takes the state of the hidden neuron at the previous time steps as an additional input for the next time step ishak et al 2003 as shown in fig 5 the neuron state of the present time step h t 1 is calculated by the equation 10 h t 1 w h 1 h t w i 1 x t 1 b similar to h t 1 the h t is calculated by 11 h t w h h t 1 w i x t b where h t 1 h t and h t 1 are states of the hidden neuron at the time step t 1 t and t 1 respectively w i 1 w i and w h 1 w h are weights between input values and hidden neurons input weights and between hidden neurons hidden weights respectively the training of rnn relies on an extended version of bp called backpropagation through time bptt unlike bp bptt not only calculates the gradient of the cost corresponding to the input weights but also the gradient of the cost corresponding to the hidden weights of the previous time steps as shown in fig 5 the dashed line and arrow is the direction of gradient calculation of bptt bptt first calculates the gradient of output at time step t 1 o t 1 in fig 5 corresponding to the state of hidden neuron at time step t 1 h t 1 in fig 5 i e o t 1 h t 1 in fig 5 it then calculates the gradient of the state of hidden neuron at time step t 1 corresponding to the state of hidden neuron at previous time step h t 1 h t in fig 5 and backpropagation to earlier neurons step by step in this way when using the bptt method with gradient calculation the error of partial derivative accumulates through time steps hence it will be extremely hard to learn and tune the parameters of the earlier neurons and learn long term dependencies because the gradient going through the network either gets very small and vanish or gets very large and explode this problem is commonly known as the vanishing exploding gradient problem in recent years modern rnn combat vanishing exploding gradient such as lstm had been proposed lipton et al 2015 gers 2001 gers et al 2000 the lstm replaced the ordinary neuron in the hidden layer with a memory cell and three gates the input gate forget gate and output gate lstm can selectively update the memory cell state based on the new input forget irrelevant content or selectively output part of the memory cell state as the new hidden neuron state according to the state of the input forget and output gate respectively similar to data in a computer s memory in this way the lstm is able to learn long time span time series fig 6 shows the neuron in the hidden layer of lstm i f and o represent the input forget and output gate respectively c and c denote the memory cell and the new memory cell the principal of the memory cell in lstm can be mathematically represented by the following equations input gate 12 i t σ g w i x t u i h t 1 v i c t 1 b i forget gate 13 f t σ g w f x t u f h t 1 v f c t 1 b f output gate 14 o t σ g w o x t u o h t 1 v o c t 1 b o cell state 15 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 16 c t σ c w c x t u c h t 1 b c output vector 17 h t o t σ h c t where x t is the input vector w u v and b are parameters for weights and bias represents the scalar product of two vectors σ g is the sigmoid function σ h and σ c are hyperbolic tangent function for a given input z the output of hyperbolic tangent function is 18 f z e z e z e z e z 2 3 4 gru the concept of a gru is quite similar to lstm the gru also use gates to modulate the flow of information inside the neuron in the hidden layer the difference is the gru has two gates reset gate and an update gate while lstm has three gates gru combines the input and forget gates into an update gate to balance between previous activation and the candidate activation the activation of h at time t depends on h at the previous time and the candidate h the h in fig 7 the update gate z decides how much of the previous memory to keep around the gru unit forgets the previously computed state when the reset gate r is off cho et al 2014 chung et al 2014 the gru is formulated as 19 z t σ g w z x t u z h t 1 b z 20 r t σ g w r x t u r h t 1 b r 21 h t z t h t 1 1 z t h t 22 h t σ h w h x t u t r t h t 1 b h where x t is the input vector h t is the output vector z t is the update gate vector h t is the reset gate vector w u and b are parameters for weights and bias represents the scalar product of two vectors σ is the sigmoid function σ g represent the sigmoid activation function σ h represent the hyperbolic tangent activation function 2 3 5 model implementation in this paper the mlp and wnn were implemented using matlab r2016a the lstm and gru were programmed using keras chollet 2015 keras is a high level deep learning library it is written in python and runs on top of either tensorflow abadi et al 2016 or theano backend tensorflow backend was employed in this study tensorflow is an open source software for deep learning released by google in 2015 besides keras and tensorflow other python libraries such as matplotlib numpy pandas sklearn were also used 2 4 model performance criteria the performance of the developed models was evaluated by three criteria the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the coefficient of determination r2 the calculation of rmse as shown below 23 rmse i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 n rmse value of 0 means a perfect fit between observed and predicted values nse is a parameter that determines the relative importance of residual variance noise compare to the variance in the measured data information the nse is calculated by the following equation 24 nse 1 i 1 n y i obs y i sim 2 i 1 n y i obs y mean 2 nse varies from to 1 nse 1 indicates a perfect correlation between simulated and observed data values between 0 0 and 1 0 is generally acceptable the equation for the coefficient of determination r2

datasets for ann training according to cso water level data of dr hansteensgate and rainfall intensity data from the fagerlibakken rain gauge recorded by the regnbyge no iot during 2014 26 cso events were selected for constructing ann models in this study during a cso event the water level in the cso structures rises due to rainfall in the associated catchment the fagerlibakken rain gauge was selected using the cross correlation function xcorr function in matlab r2016a the collected time series data have 2352 records with a temporal resolution of 10 min in consideration of maintaining similar statistical characteristics 20 events were selected as training sets and the remaining 6 events were allocated as testing sets the difference between training and testing is regularization mechanisms which is used to prevent overfitting are turned off during the testing mode dropout and l2 weight penalty method were used as regularization methods in this study dropout is a technique that randomly drops selected neurons and set their associated weights to zero during training l2 weight penalty method adds an extra squared term to the cost function to constrain the weights it keeps the weights small unless they have big error derivatives the summary statistics for water levels and rainfall are presented in table 1 3 2 training of ann as the primary objective of this paper to anticipate the occurrence of cso events and develop early warning and supply references for necessary cso reduction measures different ann models were developed the purposes of the developed models are to predict the one to six step ahead water level in the cso structure based on data collected by iot to make a fair comparison the input of the developed ann models remain the same i e data from the previous six steps collected by iot after confirming input data and prediction goals the training of anns was implemented through trial and error procedures while the best performed mlp has one hidden layer with fifteen hidden neurons the wnn used in this study has one hidden layer with eighteen wavelons the optimal structure of lstm and gru have two hidden layers with ten hidden neurons in each layer in this study the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used for training of mlp the wnn was trained using the standard bp method for lstm and gru the adam kingma and ba 2014 method was selected as the optimization algorithm 3 3 performance of ann all the four ann models performed rather consistently in the training stages while showing different performance during the testing stages the results for the one to six step ahead cso water level forecasting within the testing stages are provided in table 2 as shown in table 2 the model prediction accuracy reduced as the prediction steps increased for the one step ahead prediction all the ann models showed satisfying results with low rmse value high nse value and high r2 value when turning the prediction time step to two the performance of mlp deteriorated immediately compared to the one step ahead prediction the rmse value of mlp for the two step ahead prediction almost doubled increasing from 0 0918 to 0 1656 the r2 value and nse values reduced from 0 9531 and 0 9197 to 0 8967 and 0 7648 respectively with longer time steps the mlp performance decreased continually it reveals that as a static feedforward ann the mlp is not suitable for multi step ahead forecasting the wnn presented better performance than mlp for three step ahead prediction the wnn even got the highest r2 value 0 9334 however this fact alone doesn t prove that the performance of wnn is better than lstm and gru when comprehensively considering all the performance criteria because the remaining values of rmse nse and r2 of wnn are very unstable across the different time steps compared to lstm and gru when the prediction time step exceeds four lstm and gru outperform mlp and wnn in terms of all the performance criteria lstm and gru even produce low rmse value around 0 15 high nse value around 0 8 and high r2 value around 0 8 as the prediction time step reaches six besides lstm shows a slightly better performance than gru but the difference is marginal to further illustrate the performance of lstm gru and wnn in a more intuitive way hydrographs of the observed versus four five and six step ahead predicted water level for three rainfall events in the testing sets were drawn in fig 8 for six step ahead prediction fig 8 d f when the cso water level starts to increase the lstm and gru react quicker than wnn whereas the wnn presents the time lag problem moreover it obviously shows that lstm and gru better predict the peak water level while the wnn either underestimates or overestimates the peak value the inconsistency of wnn indicates its poor performance compared to lstm and gru similar observations can also be found in the five and four step ahead prediction fig 8 g i only in fig 8 k does the wnn look more stable than lstm and gru as we can see from fig 8 in general the lstm and gru can better capture the sudden change of water levels compared to wnn and significantly alleviate the time lag problem at the peak value in terms of peak water level the wnn either underestimates or undergoes strong fluctuations at the peak value this is probably due to the insufficient learning capability of wnn predictions by both lstm and gru showed very similar behavior especially for the six step ahead prediction however the gru has several advantages compared to lstm fig 9 displays the learning curves of lstm and gru in fig 9 the x axis is epochs one full training cycle on the training samples and the y axis is the rmse value the gru makes faster progress than lstm during training the rmse value of the gru is lower than lstm during the first 30 epochs but the final rmse value of the gru is slightly higher than lstm the quick learning curve of the gru is due to its simplified architecture for large scale data the model training can consume a significant amount of cpu time hence the gru s quicker convergence and comparable performance is a good alternative to lstm on the other hand the gru has fewer parameters to make predictions in iot the controller has to calculate the future water level based on real time water level data read from the sensor and the parameters of the prediction model with fewer parameters the hardware implementation and the real time computing process of controllers could be simplified and accelerated 4 conclusion in order to reduce pollutions caused by cso it is essential to predict the cso event in advance the prediction could enable better decision making greater automation and higher efficiencies through a case study in drammen norway the present work compared the performance of four ann on the multi step ahead prediction of the cso water level collected by iot the preliminary conclusions summarized below the mlp only presented accurate predictions for the one and two step ahead prediction but not for multi step ahead predictions wnn can improve the multi step ahead predictions however when checking the hydrography of observed and predicted water level the wnn presented several problems such as time delay and strong fluctuation with the gating mechanisms the lstm and gru outperformed wnn and mlp both lstm and gru achieved satisfying results for multi step ahead prediction the behavior of lstm and gru is quite similar lstm had marginally better performance than gru but the advantages of gru are the quicker learning curve fewer parameters and simpler architecture for practical problems with very large datasets the gru provides a trade off between accuracy and training time iot will become the backbone of urban success devices are integrated together in order to enhance key smart sectors such as transport energy water supply and waste treatment on the other hand advanced ai techniques such as the lstm have shown their power of optimizing iot there are many possible scenarios to extend iot for purposes of environmental monitoring and modeling applications the potential power of deep learning is fascinating and it is worth to conduct further studies about adapting deep learning into water resource related fields studies about the performance of other deep learning methods such as deep belief nets stacked deep encode and generative adversarial networks in water resource related fields are other interesting research directions in the future acknowledgements this work has been supported by the regnbyge

our research recovers the advection dispersion equations through the chapman enskog expansion of the lattice boltzmann equation the model differs from the existing schemes in two points 1 the lattice boltzmann numerical method is adopted to solve the advection dispersion problem by meso scopic particle distribution 2 and the model describes the relation between discharge cross section area and solute concentration which increases the applicability of the water quality model in practical engineering the model is verified using three benchmark tests 1 instantaneous solute transport within a short distance 2 1d point source pollution with constant velocity 3 1d point source pollution in a dam break flow the model is then applied to a 50 year flood point source pollution accident on the yongding river which showed good agreement with a mike 11 solution and gauging data keywords lattice boltzmann method advection dispersion equation saint venant equations open channel flows yongding river 1 introduction a coupled hydrodynamic and solute transport lattice boltzmann model is investigated for 1d open channel flow the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a newly developed numerical approach to solve the incompressible navier stokes equations chen and doolen 1998 it is a entirely explicit easy to parallelize and can handle complex fluids and geometries shan et al 2006 it uses a different solver for the nonlinear partial differential equations compared to traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd methods such as the finite difference method fdm finite volume method fvm and finite element method fem which discretize the equations in time and space directly zhang et al 2002 for example gurarslan et al 2013 derived a compact finite difference method solution for 1d advection diffusion ad equation which is sixth order in space and fourth order in time accuracy gurarslan 2014 also compared high order finite difference method two dimensional 2d ad model to a fourth order runge kutta scheme and verified its accuracy and efficiency the lbm simulates the macroscopic dynamics indirectly by calculating microscopic molecular particle movements and integrates them to form physical variables zhou 2004 the unique features of the lbm brings significant benefits for calculation and programming especially for high computational density problems in engineering the lbm is used in many fluid dynamics engineering applications especially in solving the advection dispersion equation ade advection dispersion problems have been an important area of research for many years due to applications in practical engineering for example pollutant transport in open channel flows heat transfer in multi phase fluid flows nutrition transport in organism colonies and cell movement in blood vessels etc merks et al 2002 hughes et al 1989 presented a finite element formulation for advection diffusive equations in computational fluid dynamics leveque 1996 used a wave propagation finite volume approach to solve the advection diffusion equation in second order accuracy meerschaert and tadjeran 2004 developed an practical numerical finite difference method to approximate the fractional advection dispersion equations in groundwater and modeled the passive tracers transport in porous medium properly in previous research most lattice boltzmann schemes for advection dispersion problems focused on improving the accuracy and stability in 2d fluid flows o brien et al 2002 compared experimental data to a 2d lattice boltzmann method for advection diffusion model in porous media flow ginzburg 2006 proposed a lattice boltzmann scheme to advection and anisotropic dispersion equations aade to solve richard s equation in saturated flow zhou 2009 studied the lbm for the ade in 1d area based on solve the 2d shallow water equations li and huang 2008 coupled a hydrodynamic model with advection and anisotropic dispersion using the lbm in shallow water flows servan camas and tsai 2009 analyzed the stability constraints for the lbm for the ade and illustrated that the negativity equilibrium distribution function values do not necessarily lead to instabilities peng et al 2011 investigated a 2d lbm solute transport model in shallow water showing that the multiple relaxation time mrt terms have better stability than the bhatnagar gross krook bgk terms hammou et al 2011 focused on the analysis the relation between kinetic parameters and stability of two relaxation times trt lattice boltzmann scheme ginzburg 2013 presented several anisotropic collisions for a lattice boltzmann model dealing with the ade and introduced many different anisotropic schemes to remove numerical diffusion patel et al 2014 reported a discontinuous galerkin lattice boltzmann scheme to solve heat transfer advection dispersion problems ginzburg and roux 2015 analyzed the truncation effect of trt lbm scheme on advection diffusion equations and further compared the accuracy and stability of different boundary schemes with variable peclet number pe most recently markl and korner 2015 derived a neumann boundary condition for no flux free surface which expanded the study area of the lbm for the ade problems our study couples the 1d hydrodynamics model with ad model based on solving the saint venant equations sve and the advection dispersion equations which could improve the practicality of using lbm for dealing with flux and wetted boundaries when simulating solute transport in open channel flow it also introduces a more efficient method to deal with 1d ade problems for engineering applications e g dam break flow which is a typical hydrodynamic problem in engineering can cause significant loss of human life zhou 2004 and it is much faster than 2d models in computation section 2 introduces the lattice boltzmann equations and the ade using the chapman enskog expansion section 3 simulates three benchmarks to validate the method section 4 presents an application to a pollution accident demonstrating the utility of the formulation 2 lattice boltzmann method 2 1 lattice boltzmann equation the lattice boltzmann method was derived first by mcnamara and zanetti 1988 from a lattice gas automata lga model and further developed using the bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision operator bhatnagar et al 1954 which is also called the single relaxation time srt the srt collision operator is simpler and more efficient compared to two relaxation times trt and multiple relaxation times mrt collision operators peng et al 2016 the lbm considers particle movement as two separate steps streaming and collision in streaming particles move forwards or backwards to neighboring lattices according to velocity vectors in a d1q3 scheme zhou et al 2004 fig 1 the streaming is governed by 1 f α x e α δ t t δ t f α x t 1 2 δ te α f x t where f α is the particle distribution function and f α is the initial f α before the streaming step e α is a particle velocity vector defined by 2 e α 0 α 0 e α 1 e α 2 where e δ x δ t δ x is the lattice size and δ t is the time step and f x t is the external force term in the collision step particles collide with each other and reach equilibrium according to a scattering rule within each lattice which is defined by 3 f α x t f α x t ω α f x t where ω α is the collision operator which controls the collision speed of f α it can be linearized to the bgk collision operator bhatnagar et al 1954 4 ω α f 1 τ f α f α eq where τ is the single relaxation time coefficient and f α eq is the local equilibrium distribution function combining the two steps together gives the lattice boltzmann equation lbe 5 f α x e α δ t t δ t f α x t 1 τ f α f α eq 1 2 δ te α f x t the derivation of f α eq is listed in appendix a which is similar to the conduction of shallow water lbm model by zhou 2004 the solution of f α eq is 6 f α eq 1 2 λ ca e α qc 2 e 2 α 1 2 1 λ ca α 3 where λ is 7 λ k d δ t τ 1 2 e 2 2 2 advection dispersion equations the solute transport and pollutant concentration variation in an open channel flow can be described by ade advection describes the pollutant or solute particles moved from one place to another due to the local velocity of the water in dispersion solute molecules move from high concentration regions to lower concentration according to a dispersion coefficient k d proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient according to fick s law garcia navarro et al 2000 these phenomena can be described by the advection dispersion equation as the wetted area averaged concentration is to be considered a simple form of the 1d advection dispersion model is holly 1975 8 ca t qc x x k d ca x the recovery of advection dispersion equation is a well known process and listed in appendix b which verified the accuracy of the conduction hence the concentration is expressed as 9 c 1 a α f α from eqs 7 and 9 we can derive the sufficient stability condition with τ 1 in order to assure the positive concentration providing positive equilibrium distribution to fulfill this the parameters of the proposed ade models should be carefully selected ginzburg and d humières 2010 kuzmin et al 2011 the wetted area a was calculated during the advection dispersion process instead of h the water depth h can be derived from the wetted area a and the respective cross section by using the mathematical dichotomy dunnell 1978 we assume that wetted area a i is known for a cross section i then the calculation is as follows 10 h a h max h min 2 where h max and h min are the maximum and minim water depth for the cross section i the respective wetted area a a can be then derived from h a we do the iterative calculation of eq 10 and the following equations 11 h max h a if a a a i h min h a if a a a i until 12 abs a a a i a err where a err is an acceptable wetted area error for example the value of 0 1 m 2 is used in our benchmarks then h i h a is the water depth for wetted area a i in cross section i 3 benchmarks 3 1 case 1 solute transport in steady flow conservative solute transport in steady flow is a common advection dispersion problem with constant concentration c 0 0 001 kg m 3 at the inflow and a zero gradient boundary at the outflow for the lbm ade scheme the analytical solution is given by wexler 1992 as following equation 13 c x t c 0 1 2 exp xu 2 d u 2 t 4 d i 1 β i sin β i x l exp β i 2 dt l 2 β i 2 ul 2 d 2 ul 2 d where x is the distance from zero point mean velocity u q a 5 10 6 m s a 1 10 6 m 2 in this case for both inlet and outlet boundaries k d 2 10 7 m 2 s is the dispersion coefficient and l 0 4 m is the length of the channel in this case the peclet number is small and equals to 0 25 which brings stability to the ad model β is given by 14 β cot β ul 2 d 0 in the computation the straight channel is flat and 0 4 m in length forty grids were used for the numerical model with δ x 0 01 m all of the grids have the same wetted area a 0 0001 m 2 δ t 60 s and single relaxation time τ 1 1 compared to zhou 2009 s similar 2d model the 1d ad model was based on liu et al 2015 s 1d saint venant hydrodynamic lbm model the results of the lbm the explicit upwind fdm and the analytical solution at different times are shown in fig 2 from which the lbm shows better agreement with analytical result than the fdm the table 1 gives the root mean square error of the lbm and the fdm to analytical solution and from which the lbm error is smaller than the fdm at every time instance 3 2 case 2 1d point source transported in steady flow one point source transportation with an initial condition c x t 0 is tested in this case a similar 2d test was run by zhou 2009 and the analytical solution can be found from following equation 15 c x t c 0 4 π dt exp x ut 2 4 dt the numerical model has a 500 m long trapezoidal channel with 500 grids δ x 1 m the expected shape of the channel is shown in fig 3 the time step is δ t 0 1 s the dispersion coefficient k d 0 01 m 2 s and the single relaxation time τ 1 1 the entire flat channel is initialized at a 1 m 2 where h 0 4 m the water depth h can be calculated by wetted area a of the corresponding cross section the mean flow velocity u q a and in this case it is a constant u 0 008 m s the peclet number is 0 8 a point source with concentration c 0 1 kg m 3 was added into the model when t 0 s at x 20 m after 50 000 s transport the concentration at different times is shown in fig 4 from which we can see that the numerical solutions of the lbm shows good agreement with the analytical solution but the explicit upwind fdm has bigger error value than the lbm and the analytical result at every time instance the root mean square error in table 2 supports previous conclusion 3 3 case 3 1d point source pollution in dam break flow in this case we simulate point source pollution transport in a dam break flow where mike 11 fails in this case due to its inability to capture shock waves liu et al 2015 the hydrodynamic parameters are the same as the test in liu et al 2015 the 600 m channel is separated by a dam at x 250 m the initial water level is 16 h 10 m x 250 m h 5 m x 250 m the water level evolution within the first 4 s is shown in fig 5 for the dispersion model the point source was added at 240 m 10 m before the dam at t 0 s the initial concentration is 1000 g m 3 the dispersion coefficient can be estimated according to empirical equation feng et al 2009 17 k α hu where u is friction velocity and can be calculated by u ghi i is hydraulic slope α is an estimate coefficient between 0 23 and 0 8 in straight river and it can be varied according to different side shear force wind speed temperature or different solute here the dispersion coefficient is estimated as k d 4 m 2 s and the single relaxation time τ 1 001 in order to increase the numerical stability after 4 s simulation the concentration at different points from lbm is shown in fig 6 we can see that before the dam break point at x 240 m the pollutant concentration drops rapidly from the initial value of 1000 g m 3 to nearly 0 g m 3 within 1 s after the dam break occurs the concentration directly after the dam at x 241 m increased dramatically to 300 g m 3 but this is very different to other points such as x 250 m x 270 or x 290 m the concentration increases more quickly than at the other three points due to the dam break flow the successful simulation of point source pollution in dam break flow shows lbm s great stability of advection dispersion calculation in steep water front in which the mike 11 failed due to the sharp front variation leads to discontinuous flow liu et al 2015 4 application the yongding river is one of the seven drainage systems of the hai river it is 680 km long and most of it flows in mountain areas in northern china in historical records unbalanced rainfall in the west mountains brought disastrous floods to the plains area of beijing several times ye et al 2016 flood control and disaster reduction for the yongding river has become a prime concern floods may cause pollutant accidents along the drainage area where there is a lot of business activity such as the sanjiadian to lugouqiao stretch fig 7 the 50 year worst flood discharge in 72 h is shown in fig 8 this study is based on liu et al 2015 s hydrodynamics research which

yongding river which showed good agreement with a mike 11 solution and gauging data keywords lattice boltzmann method advection dispersion equation saint venant equations open channel flows yongding river 1 introduction a coupled hydrodynamic and solute transport lattice boltzmann model is investigated for 1d open channel flow the lattice boltzmann method lbm is a newly developed numerical approach to solve the incompressible navier stokes equations chen and doolen 1998 it is a entirely explicit easy to parallelize and can handle complex fluids and geometries shan et al 2006 it uses a different solver for the nonlinear partial differential equations compared to traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd methods such as the finite difference method fdm finite volume method fvm and finite element method fem which discretize the equations in time and space directly zhang et al 2002 for example gurarslan et al 2013 derived a compact finite difference method solution for 1d advection diffusion ad equation which is sixth order in space and fourth order in time accuracy gurarslan 2014 also compared high order finite difference method two dimensional 2d ad model to a fourth order runge kutta scheme and verified its accuracy and efficiency the lbm simulates the macroscopic dynamics indirectly by calculating microscopic molecular particle movements and integrates them to form physical variables zhou 2004 the unique features of the lbm brings significant benefits for calculation and programming especially for high computational density problems in engineering the lbm is used in many fluid dynamics engineering applications especially in solving the advection dispersion equation ade advection dispersion problems have been an important area of research for many years due to applications in practical engineering for example pollutant transport in open channel flows heat transfer in multi phase fluid flows nutrition transport in organism colonies and cell movement in blood vessels etc merks et al 2002 hughes et al 1989 presented a finite element formulation for advection diffusive equations in computational fluid dynamics leveque 1996 used a wave propagation finite volume approach to solve the advection diffusion equation in second order accuracy meerschaert and tadjeran 2004 developed an practical numerical finite difference method to approximate the fractional advection dispersion equations in groundwater and modeled the passive tracers transport in porous medium properly in previous research most lattice boltzmann schemes for advection dispersion problems focused on improving the accuracy and stability in 2d fluid flows o brien et al 2002 compared experimental data to a 2d lattice boltzmann method for advection diffusion model in porous media flow ginzburg 2006 proposed a lattice boltzmann scheme to advection and anisotropic dispersion equations aade to solve richard s equation in saturated flow zhou 2009 studied the lbm for the ade in 1d area based on solve the 2d shallow water equations li and huang 2008 coupled a hydrodynamic model with advection and anisotropic dispersion using the lbm in shallow water flows servan camas and tsai 2009 analyzed the stability constraints for the lbm for the ade and illustrated that the negativity equilibrium distribution function values do not necessarily lead to instabilities peng et al 2011 investigated a 2d lbm solute transport model in shallow water showing that the multiple relaxation time mrt terms have better stability than the bhatnagar gross krook bgk terms hammou et al 2011 focused on the analysis the relation between kinetic parameters and stability of two relaxation times trt lattice boltzmann scheme ginzburg 2013 presented several anisotropic collisions for a lattice boltzmann model dealing with the ade and introduced many different anisotropic schemes to remove numerical diffusion patel et al 2014 reported a discontinuous galerkin lattice boltzmann scheme to solve heat transfer advection dispersion problems ginzburg and roux 2015 analyzed the truncation effect of trt lbm scheme on advection diffusion equations and further compared the accuracy and stability of different boundary schemes with variable peclet number pe most recently markl and korner 2015 derived a neumann boundary condition for no flux free surface which expanded the study area of the lbm for the ade problems our study couples the 1d hydrodynamics model with ad model based on solving the saint venant equations sve and the advection dispersion equations which could improve the practicality of using lbm for dealing with flux and wetted boundaries when simulating solute transport in open channel flow it also introduces a more efficient method to deal with 1d ade problems for engineering applications e g dam break flow which is a typical hydrodynamic problem in engineering can cause significant loss of human life zhou 2004 and it is much faster than 2d models in computation section 2 introduces the lattice boltzmann equations and the ade using the chapman enskog expansion section 3 simulates three benchmarks to validate the method section 4 presents an application to a pollution accident demonstrating the utility of the formulation 2 lattice boltzmann method 2 1 lattice boltzmann equation the lattice boltzmann method was derived first by mcnamara and zanetti 1988 from a lattice gas automata lga model and further developed using the bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision operator bhatnagar et al 1954 which is also called the single relaxation time srt the srt collision operator is simpler and more efficient compared to two relaxation times trt and multiple relaxation times mrt collision operators peng et al 2016 the lbm considers particle movement as two separate steps streaming and collision in streaming particles move forwards or backwards to neighboring lattices according to velocity vectors in a d1q3 scheme zhou et al 2004 fig 1 the streaming is governed by 1 f α x e α δ t t δ t f α x t 1 2 δ te α f x t where f α is the particle distribution function and f α is the initial f α before the streaming step e α is a particle velocity vector defined by 2 e α 0 α 0 e α 1 e α 2 where e δ x δ t δ x is the lattice size and δ t is the time step and f x t is the external force term in the collision step particles collide with each other and reach equilibrium according to a scattering rule within each lattice which is defined by 3 f α x t f α x t ω α f x t where ω α is the collision operator which controls the collision speed of f α it can be linearized to the bgk collision operator bhatnagar et al 1954 4 ω α f 1 τ f α f α eq where τ is the single relaxation time coefficient and f α eq is the local equilibrium distribution function combining the two steps together gives the lattice boltzmann equation lbe 5 f α x e α δ t t δ t f α x t 1 τ f α f α eq 1 2 δ te α f x t the derivation of f α eq is listed in appendix a which is similar to the conduction of shallow water lbm model by zhou 2004 the solution of f α eq is 6 f α eq 1 2 λ ca e α qc 2 e 2 α 1 2 1 λ ca α 3 where λ is 7 λ k d δ t τ 1 2 e 2 2 2 advection dispersion equations the solute transport and pollutant concentration variation in an open channel flow can be described by ade advection describes the pollutant or solute particles moved from one place to another due to the local velocity of the water in dispersion solute molecules move from high concentration regions to lower concentration according to a dispersion coefficient k d proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient according to fick s law garcia navarro et al 2000 these phenomena can be described by the advection dispersion equation as the wetted area averaged concentration is to be considered a simple form of the 1d advection dispersion model is holly 1975 8 ca t qc x x k d ca x the recovery of advection dispersion equation is a well known process and listed in appendix b which verified the accuracy of the conduction hence the concentration is expressed as 9 c 1 a α f α from eqs 7 and 9 we can derive the sufficient stability condition with τ 1 in order to assure the positive concentration providing positive equilibrium distribution to fulfill this the parameters of the proposed ade models should be carefully selected ginzburg and d humières 2010 kuzmin et al 2011 the wetted area a was calculated during the advection dispersion process instead of h the water depth h can be derived from the wetted area a and the respective cross section by using the mathematical dichotomy dunnell 1978 we assume that wetted area a i is known for a cross section i then the calculation is as follows 10 h a h max h min 2 where h max and h min are the maximum and minim water depth for the cross section i the respective wetted area a a can be then derived from h a we do the iterative calculation of eq 10 and the following equations 11 h max h a if a a a i h min h a if a a a i until 12 abs a a a i a err where a err is an acceptable wetted area error for example the value of 0 1 m 2 is used in our benchmarks then h i h a is the water depth for wetted area a i in cross section i 3 benchmarks 3 1 case 1 solute transport in steady flow conservative solute transport in steady flow is a common advection dispersion problem with constant concentration c 0 0 001 kg m 3 at the inflow and a zero gradient boundary at the outflow for the lbm ade scheme the analytical solution is given by wexler 1992 as following equation 13 c x t c 0 1 2 exp xu 2 d u 2 t 4 d i 1 β i sin β i x l exp β i 2 dt l 2 β i 2 ul 2 d 2 ul 2 d where x is the distance from zero point mean velocity u q a 5 10 6 m s a 1 10 6 m 2 in this case for both inlet and outlet boundaries k d 2 10 7 m 2 s is the dispersion coefficient and l 0 4 m is the length of the channel in this case the peclet number is small and equals to 0 25 which brings stability to the ad model β is given by 14 β cot β ul 2 d 0 in the computation the straight channel is flat and 0 4 m in length forty grids were used for the numerical model with δ x 0 01 m all of the grids have the same wetted area a 0 0001 m 2 δ t 60 s and single relaxation time τ 1 1 compared to zhou 2009 s similar 2d model the 1d ad model was based on liu et al 2015 s 1d saint venant hydrodynamic lbm model the results of the lbm the explicit upwind fdm and the analytical solution at different times are shown in fig 2 from which the lbm shows better agreement with analytical result than the fdm the table 1 gives the root mean square error of the lbm and the fdm to analytical solution and from which the lbm error is smaller than the fdm at every time instance 3 2 case 2 1d point source transported in steady flow one point source transportation with an initial condition c x t 0 is tested in this case a similar 2d test was run by zhou 2009 and the analytical solution can be found from following equation 15 c x t c 0 4 π dt exp x ut 2 4 dt the numerical model has a 500 m long trapezoidal channel with 500 grids δ x 1 m the expected shape of the channel is shown in fig 3 the time step is δ t 0 1 s the dispersion coefficient k d 0 01 m 2 s and the single relaxation time τ 1 1 the entire flat channel is initialized at a 1 m 2 where h 0 4 m the water depth h can be calculated by wetted area a of the corresponding cross section the mean flow velocity u q a and in this case it is a constant u 0 008 m s the peclet number is 0 8 a point source with concentration c 0 1 kg m 3 was added into the model when t 0 s at x 20 m after 50 000 s transport the concentration at different times is shown in fig 4 from which we can see that the numerical solutions of the lbm shows good agreement with the analytical solution but the explicit upwind fdm has bigger error value than the lbm and the analytical result at every time instance the root mean square error in table 2 supports previous conclusion 3 3 case 3 1d point source pollution in dam break flow in this case we simulate point source pollution transport in a dam break flow where mike 11 fails in this case due to its inability to capture shock waves liu et al 2015 the hydrodynamic parameters are the same as the test in liu et al 2015 the 600 m channel is separated by a dam at x 250 m the initial water level is 16 h 10 m x 250 m h 5 m x 250 m the water level evolution within the first 4 s is shown in fig 5 for the dispersion model the point source was added at 240 m 10 m before the dam at t 0 s the initial concentration is 1000 g m 3 the dispersion coefficient can be estimated according to empirical equation feng et al 2009 17 k α hu where u is friction velocity and can be calculated by u ghi i is hydraulic slope α is an estimate coefficient between 0 23 and 0 8 in straight river and it can be varied according to different side shear force wind speed temperature or different solute here the dispersion coefficient is estimated as k d 4 m 2 s and the single relaxation time τ 1 001 in order to increase the numerical stability after 4 s simulation the concentration at different points from lbm is shown in fig 6 we can see that before the dam break point at x 240 m the pollutant concentration drops rapidly from the initial value of 1000 g m 3 to nearly 0 g m 3 within 1 s after the dam break occurs the concentration directly after the dam at x 241 m increased dramatically to 300 g m 3 but this is very different to other points such as x 250 m x 270 or x 290 m the concentration increases more quickly than at the other three points due to the dam break flow the successful simulation of point source pollution in dam break flow shows lbm s great stability of advection dispersion calculation in steep water front in which the mike 11 failed due to the sharp front variation leads to discontinuous flow liu et al 2015 4 application the yongding river is one of the seven drainage systems of the hai
