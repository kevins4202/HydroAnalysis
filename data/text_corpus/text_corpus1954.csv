9770,the traditional groundwater drought monitoring method relies on the ground observation data which is difficult to reflect the large scale groundwater drought information thus gravity recovery and climate experiment grace gravity satellite technology is applied to estimate large scale groundwater drought condition which can provide a new data source for drought investigation however the dynamic variations of grace based groundwater drought were still unclear across china in this study the evolutions of groundwater drought were investigated from a high resolution grace mass concentration mascon model perspective the spatio temporal variations and gridded trend characteristics of groundwater drought were comprehensively identified across china during 2003 2018 subsequently the relationships between groundwater and meteorological drought were quantitatively revealed the results indicated that 1 the verification results of grace were credible and reliable for groundwater drought evaluation 2 the most serious groundwater drought occurred in april 2011 with an average groundwater drought index gdi value of 0 86 3 the gridded drought trend characteristic showed that groundwater drought presented an upward trend during 2003 2018 and 4 the propagation dynamics from meteorological to groundwater drought were shorter in summer 5 6 months and longer in winter 14 15 months across china this study sheds new viewpoints into groundwater drought variations from a perspective of high resolution grace mascon model which can also be applied in other areas graphical

cycle and one of the important fresh water sources for agricultural irrigation industrial production and urban life rodell et al 2009 famiglietti 2014 since the 20th century due to climate change agricultural production and rapid development of urbanization the global groundwater drought phenomenon has become increasingly obvious which seriously hindered the economic and social development marchant and bloomfield 2018 han et al 2019 li et al 2019 groundwater drought is a special type of drought caused by the reduction of groundwater storages which is easily affected by anthropogenic factors thomas et al 2017 more groundwater is exploited by people for agricultural irrigation and industrial production than ever before which will evoke a prominent groundwater drought crisis inevitably lin et al 2019 furthermore groundwater over withdrawal will cause sea level rise affect the natural runoff and then lead to land subsidence soil salinization groundwater quality deterioration and other ecological and environmental problems seriously restricting the sustainable development of human society wada et al 2012 therefore the effective monitoring of groundwater drought is the research emphasis of geography hydrology and sustainable science and is also an important foundation for regional water resources management due to the lack of measured groundwater observation data it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the complex groundwater drought conditions the traditional groundwater drought monitoring method mainly relies on the measurement of monitoring well points which has high requirements on the number and representativeness of monitoring well points however the traditional method needs a lot of manpower to complete the preliminary work of well points selection and arrangement which is difficult to accurately reflect the regional groundwater storage changes li et al 2019 meanwhile although the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater drought can be obtained by spatial interpolation of site data the results of spatial interpolation are not very high long et al 2014 hydrological model is also widely used in groundwater drought evaluation which may ignore the complexity of hydrological processes resulting in inaccurate evaluation results shen et al 2015 more recently gravity recovery and climate experiment grace gravity satellite is used to retrieve groundwater storage changes which can provide an important and effective approach for large scale groundwater drought monitoring thomas et al 2017 van loon et al 2017 grace gravity satellite can monitor the change of regional terrestrial water storage by perceiving the subtle gravitational change caused by the local change of the earth s mass and further obtain the groundwater storage change by combining with the output data of hydrological model rodell et al 2007 grace satellite solves the problems of data insufficiency time and labor consuming in ground station measurement and provides an effective way to monitor the groundwater drought although grace satellite was used to detect groundwater drought in some researches these researches were insufficient to explore the relationships between teleconnection factors and groundwater drought teleconnection factors are strong signals of the interaction between ocean and atmospheric circulation in global change which can change the regional conditions of water heat balance by affecting the exchange process of atmospheric mass momentum and heat and then bring about climate anomalies gupta and jain 2020 many studies have shown that drought is not only related to the direct impact of climate change and human activities but also related to the indirect effect of teleconnection factors nicholson et al 2001 lanckriet et al 2014 huang et al 2016 räsänen et al 2016 guo et al 2019 vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 for instance the el niño southern oscillation enso and north atlantic oscillation nao play important roles on the magnitude and evolution of drought forootan et al 2019 generally the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and arctic oscillation ao are considered as significant influence factors of spatial and temporal variations of drought asong et al 2018 in addition the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo dipole mode index dmi and nao can be regarded as important factors for predicting drought phenomena kim et al 2017 hosseini moghari et al 2019 to sum up teleconnection factors have close relationships with droughts which deserve to be further explored in recent years the groundwater drought caused by the rapid decline of groundwater storages and the decrease of groundwater recharge has become a major factor threatening the national water resources security in some areas of china feng et al 2013 2018 zhong et al 2018 liu et al 2016 investigated the characteristics of groundwater drought during 1989 2012 in jiangsu province china and found that the average duration and magnitude of groundwater drought were longer and larger than that of meteorological drought in this region han et al 2019 adopted grace satellite and simulated runoff and soil moisture data to estimate groundwater drought and discovered that the grace based drought index can effectively capture and identify groundwater drought information it is essential to investigate the groundwater drought in china based on grace gravity satellite for revealing the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of groundwater drought and carrying out efficient and reliable groundwater resources management although the regional groundwater drought situation based on grace satellite has been discussed in some studies the comprehensive investigation of nationwide groundwater drought has not been reported in china from a perspective of grace mass concentration mascon model the newly released grace mascon model is derived from the established observation equation based on the dynamic principle which can effectively improve the temporal and spatial resolution of inversion results göttl et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 grace mascon model can avoid the problem of signal leakage caused by filtering and can also reflect more detailed signals of groundwater storage changes which can significantly improve the spatial and temporal accuracy of inversion results rowlands et al 2005 save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 neves et al 2020 it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the groundwater drought variations from a perspective of high resolution grace mascon model and profoundly explore the dynamic relationships between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors therefore the primary objectives of this study are 1 to propose a metric for exploring the groundwater drought condition comprehensively and systematically 2 to identify the spatio temporal variations of groundwater drought from a grace mascon model perspective 3 to reveal the gridded groundwater drought trend characteristics and 4 to clarify the relationships between groundwater and meteorological drought quantitatively our findings can provide valuable information for recognizing and identifying the dynamic evolution characteristics of groundwater drought and can also make people better protect and plan groundwater resources 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area china is located in the east of asia and the west coast of the pacific ocean with an extensive territorial area of about 9 6 million square kilometers the geological conditions of china are complex and diverse with stepped topography distribution characteristics there is a wide range of landforms in china with plateaus mountains and basins in the west and plains and hills in the east additionally the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation is uneven with more precipitation in summer and autumn and less precipitation in winter and spring also the spatial distribution of precipitation gradually decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland as shown in fig 1 there are nine major river basins in china including the songhua and liao river basin slb hai river basin hb huai river basin hrb yellow river basin yb yangtze river basin yrb pearl river basin prb southeast river basin seb southwestern river basin swb and continental river basin cb table 1 is the details of the above nine major river basins and mainland china mc in addition affected by drought the annual grain production is reduced by more than 26 billion kilogram in china which is equivalent to the food demand of 60 million people qin et al 2015 with the intensive climate change and human activities the abnormal drought characteristics are prominent with obvious changes of drought intensity frequency and duration in china as an important type of drought groundwater drought will aggravate the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources and cause land subsidence crop yield reduction and a series of ecological and environmental problems thus it is essential and imperative to investigate groundwater drought variations in china 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 grace gravity satellite grace gravity satellite is a cooperative project of national aeronautics and space administration nasa and german aerospace center which consists of two identical satellites with an initial altitude of approximately 500 km swenson et al 2003 grace satellite can monitor the regional terrestrial water storage change by perceiving the subtle gravitational change caused by the local earth mass change and transform it into the terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa in the form of equivalent water height compared with the traditional spherical harmonic coefficient method grace mascon model eliminates the north south stripe error with a higher spatial resolution and more effective signals in view of this we selected the latest grace rl06 mascon model to obtain the twsa in this work with a temporal range of 2003 2018 and a spatial resolution of 0 25 http www2 csr utexas edu grace for some months with missing data due to battery management linear interpolation method was used to fill in the missing data according to the data of adjacent months long et al 2015 xie et al 2019 2 2 2 hydrological model global land data assimilation system gldas hydrological model adopts nasa ground and space observation system and obtains near real time information of land surface change by constraining its model with near real time ground and space data gldas model can generate global surface variables and flux data such as precipitation soil moisture evapotranspiration and land surface temperature through the combination of model simulation and data assimilation ghazanfari et al 2013 meanwhile gldas model is one of the important data sources for global change and water cycle research with four land surface models i e noah mosaic community land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic model also gldas hydrological model has a high accuracy and is suitable for the reliability verification of grace cao et al 2015 yang and chen 2015 since noah model has the highest spatial resolution 0 25 we adopt gldas noah model to verify the accuracy of grace with a temporal range of 2003 2018 consistent with that of grace http disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology data holdings 2 2 3 meteorological station data monthly precipitation and temperature data from the 607 meteorological stations during 2003 2018 in china were selected from the ground climatological datasets produced by the national meteorological data center http data cma cn a strict homogeneity test and correction have been carried out in these meteorological station data and the quality of the data has been significantly improved and presented a good consistency after a strict quality control the distribution of meteorological stations is shown in fig 1 2 2 4 teleconnection indices eight large scale monthly teleconnection indices were utilized during 2003 2018 to clarify the dynamic links between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors the teleconnection indices used in this study are described in table 2 3 methodology 3 1 groundwater storage anomalies gwsa the terrestrial water storages of vertical aquifer monitored by grace satellite are composed of surface water storage soil moisture storage snow water equivalent and groundwater storage based on the water balance principle the groundwater storage anomalies gwsa can be obtained by deducting the surface water storage anomalies swsa soil moisture storage anomalies smsa and snow water equivalent anomalies swea from the twsa feng et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 specifically the swsa smsa and swea are estimated based on gldas model the gwsa is calculated as follows 1 g w s a t w s a s w s a s m s a s w e a 3 2 groundwater drought index gdi the grace based groundwater drought investigation has not been implemented in china thus we constructed a dimensionless groundwater drought index gdi to reflect the dynamic variations of groundwater drought in china as a standardized index gdi can reflect the surplus or deficit of groundwater status more details on the gdi calculation can be found in thomas et al 2017 and wang et al 2020 3 3 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei can describe the drought situation in a certain area by the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the calculation process of spei thornthwaite method is used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration with the advantages of simple calculation and less meteorological input elements thornthwaite 1948 both spei and gdi can reflect drought from different perspectives thus they are related to each other to some extent in this study spei was adopted to verify the reliability of grace based gdi more details on the spei calculation can be found in vicente serrano et al 2010 3 4 singular spectral analysis ssa the single spectral analysis ssa is a powerful method to study the fluctuation of non linear time series which constructs the trajectory matrix based on the observed time series and decomposes and reconstructs the trajectory matrix so as to extract the long term fluctuation signals representing different components of the original time series ssa is suitable for non linear and non stationary time series processing with a simple computational procedure and a high calculation precision in this study ssa was used to describe the variation characteristics of gdi time series details about the ssa method can be found in walwer et al 2016 and will not be further clarified here 3 5 gridded trend identification method the modified mann kendall mmk method is a non parametric testing method for detecting the variation trend of time series which is widely used in the hydro meteorological field mmk method can effectively remove the autocorrelation components in time series and significantly improve the testing ability of the traditional mann kendall method compared with other traditional test methods we can get the drought trend characteristics at the grid scale by using the mmk method the detailed mmk calculation processes can be referred to huang et al 2015 3 6 cross wavelet transform method the cross wavelet transform method can not only reveal the links between two signals but also obtain the phase relationship of signals in time frequency space based on the wavelet analysis theory the cross wavelet transform method can analyze the correlation between two non stationary signals in time and frequency domain in this study the cross wavelet transform method was utilized to investigate the dynamic relationships between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors in china the theoretical distribution of cross wavelet power of two time series with their background power spectra p k x and p k y is described as follows 2 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level associated with the probability p of a probability distribution function huang et al 2016 4 results 4 1 reliability verification of grace and gdi 4 1 1 grace verification the reliability of grace gravity satellite can be verified by combining with gldas hydrological model thus we adopted gldas hydrological model to verify the reliability of grace as shown in fig 2 the temporal variation tendency of grace was generally consistent with that of gldas simultaneously grace and gldas exhibited significant correlations p 0 01 with pearson correlation coefficient r ranging from 0 56 to 0 89 the variation of grace and gldas was also relatively consistent in each sub basin of china fig 2a i moreover underlying surface conditions have different influences on hydrological cycle process which may be the main reason for the spatial heterogeneity of water storage changes in different sub basins across china among them the minimum grace value 126 94 mm appeared in december 2011 in the swb while the minimum gldas value 68 24 mm appeared in november 2014 in the cb conversely the maximum grace value 148 74 mm occurred in april 2013 in the yrb whilst the maximum gldas value 97 41 mm occurred in june 2014 in the seb for the whole country grace and gldas were also significantly correlated r 0 78 p 0 01 with variation amplitude of grace ranging from 88 42 103 58 mm and that of gldas ranging from 53 31 76 86 mm fig 2j compared with gldas grace contains not only surface water but also groundwater which leads to a relatively larger variation amplitude of grace than that of gldas based on the method recommended by landerer and swenson 2012 the uncertainty in grace was 8 31 mm month the grace showed a downward trend 0 005 mm month in mc from 2003 to 2018 which may be caused by the over exploitation of groundwater or the accelerated consumption of soil moisture storage the increase of vegetation coverage caused by ecological restoration project in china enlarged the leaf interception of precipitation and the deficit of soil moisture in general the precipitation grace and gldas presented good correlations during 2003 2018 and they showed apparent consistency and seasonal variation precipitation needs to be redistributed through complex hydrological processes such as surface runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration and finally transforms into terrestrial water storage therefore the fluctuations of precipitation and grace were not very consistent in some periods it is worth noting that the least annual precipitation 730 95 mm occurred in 2011 with an average grace reaching a minimum value 30 09 mm in this year the comparison results of grace gldas and precipitation data showed that they presented regular seasonal fluctuations with good consistencies consequently the quantitative inversion results of grace were credible and reliable which could be used for further investigating the dynamic variations of groundwater drought in china 4 1 2 gdi verification after evaluating the reliability of grace the groundwater drought index gdi can be obtained by calculating the groundwater storage deviation gsd as seen from fig 3 the minimum values of gwsa 31 05 mm gsd 37 81 mm and gdi 0 86 appeared in april 2011 meanwhile the minimum c i value 3 08 mm appeared in august furthermore the maximum values of gwsa 36 84 mm gsd 31 09 mm and gdi 0 99 appeared in june 2003 while the maximum c i value 9 05 mm appeared in march the grace based gdi was calculated through the above calculation process and then the reliability of gdi was verified by comparing the month by month correlation between gdi and spei of corresponding station fig 4 through comparative analysis we found that gdi and corresponding spei showed high correlations and consistent spatial distribution characteristics with an average r value of 0 74 on the monthly scale the average r values between gdi and spei ranged from 0 59 to 0 88 p 0 05 among all stations reaching a maximum value of 0 88 in july the largest percentage 92 7 of the number of stations occurred in july with r values passing the significance test of α 0 05 on the seasonal scale the average r values between gdi and spei in spring summer autumn and winter were 0 75 0 87 0 69 and 0 69 respectively p 0 01 meanwhile the largest percentage 79 9 of the number of stations occurred in summer with r values passing the significance test of α 0 01 since most of gdi and spei were positively correlated with good correlations the grace based gdi could be used as a metric to accurately capture the groundwater drought information in china 4 2 spatio temporal variations of groundwater drought 4 2 1 temporal evolutions fig 5 shows the temporal evolution characteristics of groundwater drought during 2003 2018 across china it can be seen that the gdi showed downward trends in mc and seven sub basins with different decline amplitudes indicating that the groundwater droughts were generally increasing from 2003 to 2018 in china for all sub basins fig 5a i the groundwater droughts were increasing except for those in the hrb and yb among them the most significant upward trend of groundwater drought with a gdi linear tendency rate of 0 02 10a occurred in the cb followed by slb with a gdi linear tendency rate of 0 019 10a for the whole country fig 5j the linear tendency rate of gdi was 0 01 10a during 2003 2018 the most serious groundwater drought occurred in 2011 with an average gdi reaching a minimum value of 0 51 in this year moreover the minimum gdi value was 0 86 in april 2011 during this drought event in 2011 the minimum value of average gdi 1 26 appeared in the yrb among all sub basins in addition ssa was adopted to describe the fluctuations of gdi time series gdi series also showed good correlations with the ssa derived trend items with r values ranging from 0 70 to 0 84 p 0 01 4 2 2 spatial distribution since the worst groundwater drought occurred in 2011 we depicted the spatial distribution of drought during this year in fig 6 by calculating the average gdi of all pixels in china the average gdi from january to december ranged from 0 21 to 0 86 table 3 the most serious groundwater drought occurred in april with a drought area percentage of 65 2 and an average gdi of 0 86 followed by february with a drought area percentage of 64 2 and an average gdi of 0 79 conversely the least serious groundwater drought occurred in june with a drought area percentage of 40 6 and an average gdi of 0 21 additionally there were six months april may july august september and november with the worst groundwater drought occurring in the yrb with average gdi ranging from 1 45 to 1 85 4 3 gridded groundwater drought trend identification fig 7 illustrates the gridded groundwater drought trend characteristics using the mmk trend test method across china during 2003 2018 the trend characteristic z s values of gdi are shown in fig 8 on the monthly scale the average trend characteristic z s values of gdi ranged from 0 48 to 0 03 indicating that the groundwater drought generally showed an insignificant increasing trend from 2003 to 2018 in china among the 12 months the largest and smallest groundwater drought area percentage with an upward trend occurred in october 79 7 and december 55 3 respectively besides the largest groundwater drought area percentage with a significant increasing trend p 0 01 occurred in november 6 9 on the seasonal scale the average z s values of gdi ranged from 0 49 to 0 31 implying that the groundwater drought also showed an insignificant upward trend during 2003 2018 the groundwater drought area percentage with an upward trend in spring summer autumn and winter was 75 2 79 3 75 7 and 73 8 respectively meanwhile the largest groundwater drought area percentage with a significant increasing trend p 0 01 occurred in winter 9 2 additionally the trend characteristics of groundwater drought were different in each sub basin of china specifically the maximum z s value 0 87 occurred in august in the yb and the minimum z s value 1 34 occurred in october in the yrb 4 4 propagation dynamics from meteorological to groundwater drought meteorological drought usually occurs earlier than groundwater drought which is also the foundation of other types of drought han et al 2019 there is a certain propagation time for meteorological drought to evolve into groundwater drought with different propagation time in each region due to various hydro meteorological conditions underlying surface conditions and human factors motlagh et al 2017 wossenyeleh et al 2020 thus the investigation of propagation dynamics from meteorological to groundwater drought can further clarify the concept of groundwater drought response to meteorological drought deepen the understanding of spatio temporal evolution patterns of drought and also help to reasonably predict and protect groundwater resources in china in order to quantitatively explore the dynamic propagation characteristics from meteorological to groundwater drought we compared the moving correlations between multi time scale spei 1 24 months and monthly gdi series and selected the time scale with the largest r value as the optimal propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought as presented in fig 9 the propagation time can be obtained from the largest r value p 0 05 between gdi and spei at different time scales for all sub basins fig 9a i groundwater drought had delayed responses on meteorological drought with different time lags in each sub basin of china for the whole country fig 9j the propagation time from january to december was 14 months 15 months 8 months 9 months 9 months 5 months 6 months 6 months 12 months 11 months 12 months and 15 months respectively with the corresponding r values of 0 52 0 51 0 61 0 64 0 62 0 69 0 71 0 72 0 59 0 59 0 61 and 0 55 respectively generally the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought was shorter in summer 5 6 months and longer in winter 14 15 months in china furthermore gdi was mostly positively correlated with spei with an average r value of 0 71 in summer and 0 53 in winter therefore the corresponding r value between gdi and spei was higher in summer and lower in winter since it takes a long time for precipitation to pass through the soil and develop into groundwater groundwater drought has a delay effect compared with meteorological drought liu et al 2016 han et al 2019 the meteorological drought caused by the decrease of precipitation will not directly develop into groundwater drought which is primarily due to the slow infiltration process of soil water gates et al 2011 at the same time the propagation time will be different in each sub basin in view of the differential climate hydrology and topography in the vast areas of china in summer the temperature evapotranspiration and crop water requirement are larger than those in other seasons wu et al 2018 people often exploit more groundwater than usual to meet the irrigation water demand of crops in summer so the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought is shorter in this season in winter the relatively longer propagation time may be caused by snowmelt huang et al 2017 5 discussion 5 1 dynamic relationships between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors 5 1 1 bivariate wavelet coherence drought is not only related to the direct influence of climate change and human activities but also related to the indirect impact of teleconnection factors guo et al 2019 vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 therefore the effects of teleconnection factors enso pna ao pdo nao amo npi and dmi on groundwater drought in china were revealed using cross wavelet transform technology fig 10 it can be observed that there are three significant resonance periods between gdi and enso which are 10 14 months in 2005 2006 and 10 16 months in 2010 2012 with negative correlations and 32 40 months in 2008 2014 with positive correlations fig 10a fig 10b indicates that there are two significant resonance periods between gdi and pna which are 26 30 months in 2006 and 14 18 months in 2014 2015 with negative correlations fig 10c shows that there are three significant resonance periods between gdi and ao which are 8 10 months in 2010 2011 and 32 36 months in 2011 2012 with negative correlations and 16 18 months in 2014 with positive correlations there is a significant resonance period between gdi and pdo which is 8 12 months in 2004 2006 with negative correlations fig 10d similarly the relationships between gdi and nao amo npi and dmi are depicted in fig 10e h meanwhile there are short term intermittent resonance periods of 1 8 months between gdi and teleconnection factors enso pna ao pdo nao amo npi and dmi during 2003 2018 as depicted in fig 10 the cross wavelet transform can effectively reveal the dynamic relationships between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors in china teleconnection factors have statistically significant relationships with groundwater drought implying that they play important roles during the drought evolution in general enso has the greatest impact on groundwater drought while pdo has the least effect on groundwater drought in china the cross wavelet energy spectrum can analyze the correlation between two sequences in the high energy region while the wavelet coherence can identify the detailed mutual characteristics in the low energy region fig 11 there is an obvious positive correlations between gdi and enso fig 11a at scale of 24 48 months 2008 2015 furthermore the correlation is different between groundwater drought and other teleconnection factors in both time and frequency domains fig 11b h 5 1 2 multivariate wavelet coherence since enso was the dominant teleconnection factor on groundwater drought we applied multivariate cross wavelet transform between gdi enso and other teleconnection factors pna ao pdo nao amo npi and dmi to reveal the coupled effect of two teleconnection factors on groundwater drought fig 12 it can be observed from fig 12a that gdi enso is closely related to pna at scale of 24 48 months 2007 2015 similarly the links between gdi enso and ao pdo nao amo npi and dmi are described in fig 12b g overall the combination of enso and pna has the highest dependence on gdi indicating that enso pna has the largest combined effects on groundwater drought in china the combination of enso and pna had the greatest impact on groundwater drought so we also explored the influence of enso pna and other teleconnection factors on groundwater drought fig 13 for one factor it can be concluded that the average wavelet coherence awc ranges from 0 75 to 0 82 and the percent area of significant coherence pasc ranges from 1 05 to 8 65 enso has the closest relationship on groundwater drought with an awc value of 0 82 and a pasc value of 8 65 for two factors enso pna is obviously related to groundwater drought with an awc value of 0 93 and a pasc value of 17 87 for three factors enso pna dmi has the strongest impact on groundwater drought with an awc value of 0 96 and a pasc value of 18 08 this implies that three factor combinations enso pna dmi are needed to explain the groundwater drought variation in china generally as the number of teleconnection factors increases the awc and pasc values increase suggesting that groundwater drought is affected simultaneously by multiple teleconnection factors table 4 5 2 uncertainties the uncertainties of detecting dynamic variations of groundwater drought based on grace gravity satellite mainly come from grace products and post processing errors missing monthly data and hydrological model quantifying other water layer i e surface water layer soil water layer and snow water layer firstly there are some uncertainties in the post processing of grace satellite data there are three kinds of grace datasets and different results may be obtained by using different datasets to retrieve water storage changes the grace data obtained by the traditional spherical harmonic coefficient method is processed by a series of filtering which not only eliminates the error influence but also weakens the real signal therefore the scale factor should be used to recover the signal leakage caused by filtering in this study the newly developed grace rl06 mascon model was selected to replace the traditional spherical harmonic coefficient method which can reduce the calculation error in solving the earth gravity field model göttl et al 2018 crowley and huang 2020 as seen from fig 2 the uncertainty in grace is approximately 8 31 mm month secondly linear interpolation method was used to obtain continuous grace time series for the missing data in some months which may also produce uncertainties long et al 2015 hu et al 2019 grace was significantly correlated with gldas p 0 01 confirming that the accuracy of the results obtained by linear interpolation method met the requirements fig 2 finally due to the discrepancy of parameter setting of hydrological model other water layer data obtained by different hydrological models were also different feng et al 2013 considering that only gldas noah hydrological model has the highest spatial resolution 0 25 consistent with grace mascon model we selected gldas noah hydrological model to compare with grace mascon model 5 3 advantages and limitations grace gravity satellite provides a new perspective to study groundwater drought in the case of insufficient ground observation data researchers have compared grace mascon model with traditional spherical harmonic coefficient method and found that grace mascon model can improve the accuracy of inversion results and retain more effective signals save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 wiese et al 2016 sun et al 2018 liu et al 2020 although the mascon model does not carry out post processing such as filtering it separates the influence of different regional mass changes on the earth gravity field and makes the calculation results more realistic by adding space time constraint equations the prominent advantage of mascon model is that the change of earth mass is directly calculated as a parameter through the high precision inter satellite observation data of grace gravity satellite which can eliminate the north south stripe error and avoid the signal leakage problem caused by filtering bhanja et al 2016 sinha et al 2019 the newly released mascon model is demonstrated to be equivalent to or superior to traditional scaled spherical harmonic coefficient method scanlon et al 2016 grace gldas and precipitation data have similar seasonal variation trend fig 2 which can also be found in other researches yang and chen 2015 wu et al 2019 the reliability verification of grace and gdi concluded that grace mascon model can accurately capture the gridded groundwater drought information in china as a standardized drought index gdi can objectively compare the groundwater drought status on the temporal and spatial scale which can also be used to monitor the groundwater drought in other regions moreover the study area should be more than 200 000 km2 for retrieving terrestrial water storage using grace which is also applicable for the major river basins in china swenson et al 2003 xie et al 2019 liu et al 2020 discovered that the grace based drought was increasing in china which was consistent with the results of this study in conclusion the combination of grace gravity satellite and gldas hydrological model provides an important scientific foundation for the monitoring and mitigation of groundwater drought disasters as well as the establishment of reasonable utilization system of groundwater resources in china as for teleconnection factors people gradually realize that the identification of the dynamic relationship between teleconnection factors and drought is helpful to understand the formation mechanism of drought lanckriet et al 2014 räsänen et al 2016 forootan et al 2019 vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 fig 10 illustrates that there are significant resonance periods between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors at different time scales in china with obvious correlation differences in different frequencies and temporal domains enso can change the atmospheric circulation and cause abnormal fluctuation of hydro climatic events which will lead to reduced rainfall and increased drought risk reginald and yong 1996 the results of cross wavelet transform showed that enso had the greatest impact on groundwater drought in china furthermore the combination of enso pna and dmi has the most obvious relationship with groundwater drought fig 13 therefore enso pna and dmi can be used as the input factors of drought early warning system to improve the accuracy of drought prediction the lack of grace sequence length is a limitation of accurate groundwater drought monitoring thomas et al 2014 if grace time series is longer more accurate and reliable dynamic evolution characteristics of groundwater drought will be obtained in addition the impact of human activities on grace results should also be paid attention to felfelani et al 2017 5 4 challenges and future perspectives to date there are still some challenges in identifying the variations of groundwater drought based on grace satellite the spatial resolution of grace is not very high which is a main challenge for scholars to study the change of groundwater drought due to the observation altitude and orbit determination deviation of grace satellite it is not suitable for accurate monitoring of small scale groundwater storage change chen et al 2016 nevertheless in most areas lacking of measured groundwater data grace satellite can complement the traditional small scale groundwater change monitoring method which has an important reference value for improving the accuracy of regional groundwater drought monitoring and realizing efficient groundwater resources management thomas et al 2017 therefore in the future the monitoring of groundwater drought based on grace satellite data can be improved and the utilization of more accurate grace data e g mascon model will help to improve the monitoring accuracy of groundwater drought combining grace with interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar global position system gps measured groundwater data and regional land subsidence to analyze and verify groundwater drought variations will improve the reliability of grace satellite monitoring groundwater drought castellazzi et al 2018 besides in order to reduce the uncertainty and improve the accuracy of hydrological model grace satellite can be used for data assimilation of hydrological model tangdamrongsub et al 2018 in the aspect of application it is necessary to monitor groundwater evolutions at multiple scales based on grace satellite analyze the relationships between urbanization and groundwater storage changes in combination with the impact of human activities i e agricultural irrigation groundwater abstraction and identify the dynamic variations of groundwater drought in different regions so as to provide support for promoting regional sustainable development liu et al 2020 furthermore the distance measurement method of the next generation grace follow on missions has changed from microwave to laser distance measurement with the improvement of separation measurement accuracy and pivotal gravity satellite sensor technology as well as the progress of scientific data system grace follow on satellite can perceive the change of the earth gravity field on a smaller scale and realize the accurate measurement of the earth gravity ellmer and mayer gürr 2017 zhong et al 2018 in the future work we will attempt to explore the grace follow on satellite which is of great importance for the dynamic variations of global groundwater drought 6 conclusions in this study the dynamic variations of groundwater drought were investigated from a high resolution grace rl06 mascon model perspective across china additionally the temporal characteristics spatial distribution and gridded trend detections of groundwater drought were quantitatively identified during 2003 2018 meanwhile the dynamic relationships between groundwater and meteorological drought were explicitly clarified from the results major conclusions are given as follows 1 the reliability verification of grace and gdi indicated that the quantitative grace results were reliable and gdi can be used to accurately identify the groundwater drought information in china meanwhile grace gldas and precipitation data showed consistent seasonal fluctuations 2 the groundwater droughts were generally increasing during 2003 2018 with different variation trends in each sub basin of china the most significant upward trend of groundwater drought occurred in the cb with a gdi linear tendency rate of 0 02 10a noticeably the most serious groundwater drought occurred in april 2011 with a drought area percentage of 65 2 and an average gdi value of 0 86 3 the results of gridded drought trend identification showed that the groundwater droughts were increasing insignificantly from 2003 to 2018 in china on the monthly scale the largest groundwater drought area percentage 79 7 with an increasing trend occurred in october on the seasonal scale the largest groundwater drought area percentage 79 3 with an increasing trend occurred in summer 4 groundwater drought had delayed responses on meteorological drought and the response time was different in each sub basin across china generally the propagation dynamics were shorter in summer 5 6 months and longer in winter 14 15 months the high resolution grace mascon model provides a novel perspective to identify the dynamic variations of groundwater drought across china and it can also be applied in

9770,the traditional groundwater drought monitoring method relies on the ground observation data which is difficult to reflect the large scale groundwater drought information thus gravity recovery and climate experiment grace gravity satellite technology is applied to estimate large scale groundwater drought condition which can provide a new data source for drought investigation however the dynamic variations of grace based groundwater drought were still unclear across china in this study the evolutions of groundwater drought were investigated from a high resolution grace mass concentration mascon model perspective the spatio temporal variations and gridded trend characteristics of groundwater drought were comprehensively identified across china during 2003 2018 subsequently the relationships between groundwater and meteorological drought were quantitatively revealed the results indicated that 1 the verification results of grace were credible and reliable for groundwater drought evaluation 2 the most serious groundwater drought occurred in april 2011 with an average groundwater drought index gdi value of 0 86 3 the gridded drought trend characteristic showed that groundwater drought presented an upward trend during 2003 2018 and 4 the propagation dynamics from meteorological to groundwater drought were shorter in summer 5 6 months and longer in winter 14 15 months across china this study sheds new viewpoints into groundwater drought variations from a perspective of high resolution grace mascon model which can also be applied in other areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater drought meteorological drought grace mascon model propagation dynamics china 1 introduction groundwater is an important component of the global terrestrial water cycle and one of the important fresh water sources for agricultural irrigation industrial production and urban life rodell et al 2009 famiglietti 2014 since the 20th century due to climate change agricultural production and rapid development of urbanization the global groundwater drought phenomenon has become increasingly obvious which seriously hindered the economic and social development marchant and bloomfield 2018 han et al 2019 li et al 2019 groundwater drought is a special type of drought caused by the reduction of groundwater storages which is easily affected by anthropogenic factors thomas et al 2017 more groundwater is exploited by people for agricultural irrigation and industrial production than ever before which will evoke a prominent groundwater drought crisis inevitably lin et al 2019 furthermore groundwater over withdrawal will cause sea level rise affect the natural runoff and then lead to land subsidence soil salinization groundwater quality deterioration and other ecological and environmental problems seriously restricting the sustainable development of human society wada et al 2012 therefore the effective monitoring of groundwater drought is the research emphasis of geography hydrology and sustainable science and is also an important foundation for regional water resources management due to the lack of measured groundwater observation data it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the complex groundwater drought conditions the traditional groundwater drought monitoring method mainly relies on the measurement of monitoring well points which has high requirements on the number and representativeness of monitoring well points however the traditional method needs a lot of manpower to complete the preliminary work of well points selection and arrangement which is difficult to accurately reflect the regional groundwater storage changes li et al 2019 meanwhile although the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater drought can be obtained by spatial interpolation of site data the results of spatial interpolation are not very high long et al 2014 hydrological model is also widely used in groundwater drought evaluation which may ignore the complexity of hydrological processes resulting in inaccurate evaluation results shen et al 2015 more recently gravity recovery and climate experiment grace gravity satellite is used to retrieve groundwater storage changes which can provide an important and effective approach for large scale groundwater drought monitoring thomas et al 2017 van loon et al 2017 grace gravity satellite can monitor the change of regional terrestrial water storage by perceiving the subtle gravitational change caused by the local change of the earth s mass and further obtain the groundwater storage change by combining with the output data of hydrological model rodell et al 2007 grace satellite solves the problems of data insufficiency time and labor consuming in ground station measurement and provides an effective way to monitor the groundwater drought although grace satellite was used to detect groundwater drought in some researches these researches were insufficient to explore the relationships between teleconnection factors and groundwater drought teleconnection factors are strong signals of the interaction between ocean and atmospheric circulation in global change which can change the regional conditions of water heat balance by affecting the exchange process of atmospheric mass momentum and heat and then bring about climate anomalies gupta and jain 2020 many studies have shown that drought is not only related to the direct impact of climate change and human activities but also related to the indirect effect of teleconnection factors nicholson et al 2001 lanckriet et al 2014 huang et al 2016 räsänen et al 2016 guo et al 2019 vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 for instance the el niño southern oscillation enso and north atlantic oscillation nao play important roles on the magnitude and evolution of drought forootan et al 2019 generally the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and arctic oscillation ao are considered as significant influence factors of spatial and temporal variations of drought asong et al 2018 in addition the atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo dipole mode index dmi and nao can be regarded as important factors for predicting drought phenomena kim et al 2017 hosseini moghari et al 2019 to sum up teleconnection factors have close relationships with droughts which deserve to be further explored in recent years the groundwater drought caused by the rapid decline of groundwater storages and the decrease of groundwater recharge has become a major factor threatening the national water resources security in some areas of china feng et al 2013 2018 zhong et al 2018 liu et al 2016 investigated the characteristics of groundwater drought during 1989 2012 in jiangsu province china and found that the average duration and magnitude of groundwater drought were longer and larger than that of meteorological drought in this region han et al 2019 adopted grace satellite and simulated runoff and soil moisture data to estimate groundwater drought and discovered that the grace based drought index can effectively capture and identify groundwater drought information it is essential to investigate the groundwater drought in china based on grace gravity satellite for revealing the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of groundwater drought and carrying out efficient and reliable groundwater resources management although the regional groundwater drought situation based on grace satellite has been discussed in some studies the comprehensive investigation of nationwide groundwater drought has not been reported in china from a perspective of grace mass concentration mascon model the newly released grace mascon model is derived from the established observation equation based on the dynamic principle which can effectively improve the temporal and spatial resolution of inversion results göttl et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 grace mascon model can avoid the problem of signal leakage caused by filtering and can also reflect more detailed signals of groundwater storage changes which can significantly improve the spatial and temporal accuracy of inversion results rowlands et al 2005 save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 neves et al 2020 it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the groundwater drought variations from a perspective of high resolution grace mascon model and profoundly explore the dynamic relationships between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors therefore the primary objectives of this study are 1 to propose a metric for exploring the groundwater drought condition comprehensively and systematically 2 to identify the spatio temporal variations of groundwater drought from a grace mascon model perspective 3 to reveal the gridded groundwater drought trend characteristics and 4 to clarify the relationships between groundwater and meteorological drought quantitatively our findings can provide valuable information for recognizing and identifying the dynamic evolution characteristics of groundwater drought and can also make people better protect and plan groundwater resources 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area china is located in the east of asia and the west coast of the pacific ocean with an extensive territorial area of about 9 6 million square kilometers the geological conditions of china are complex and diverse with stepped topography distribution characteristics there is a wide range of landforms in china with plateaus mountains and basins in the west and plains and hills in the east additionally the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation is uneven with more precipitation in summer and autumn and less precipitation in winter and spring also the spatial distribution of precipitation gradually decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland as shown in fig 1 there are nine major river basins in china including the songhua and liao river basin slb hai river basin hb huai river basin hrb yellow river basin yb yangtze river basin yrb pearl river basin prb southeast river basin seb southwestern river basin swb and continental river basin cb table 1 is the details of the above nine major river basins and mainland china mc in addition affected by drought the annual grain production is reduced by more than 26 billion kilogram in china which is equivalent to the food demand of 60 million people qin et al 2015 with the intensive climate change and human activities the abnormal drought characteristics are prominent with obvious changes of drought intensity frequency and duration in china as an important type of drought groundwater drought will aggravate the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources and cause land subsidence crop yield reduction and a series of ecological and environmental problems thus it is essential and imperative to investigate groundwater drought variations in china 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 grace gravity satellite grace gravity satellite is a cooperative project of national aeronautics and space administration nasa and german aerospace center which consists of two identical satellites with an initial altitude of approximately 500 km swenson et al 2003 grace satellite can monitor the regional terrestrial water storage change by perceiving the subtle gravitational change caused by the local earth mass change and transform it into the terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa in the form of equivalent water height compared with the traditional spherical harmonic coefficient method grace mascon model eliminates the north south stripe error with a higher spatial resolution and more effective signals in view of this we selected the latest grace rl06 mascon model to obtain the twsa in this work with a temporal range of 2003 2018 and a spatial resolution of 0 25 http www2 csr utexas edu grace for some months with missing data due to battery management linear interpolation method was used to fill in the missing data according to the data of adjacent months long et al 2015 xie et al 2019 2 2 2 hydrological model global land data assimilation system gldas hydrological model adopts nasa ground and space observation system and obtains near real time information of land surface change by constraining its model with near real time ground and space data gldas model can generate global surface variables and flux data such as precipitation soil moisture evapotranspiration and land surface temperature through the combination of model simulation and data assimilation ghazanfari et al 2013 meanwhile gldas model is one of the important data sources for global change and water cycle research with four land surface models i e noah mosaic community land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic model also gldas hydrological model has a high accuracy and is suitable for the reliability verification of grace cao et al 2015 yang and chen 2015 since noah model has the highest spatial resolution 0 25 we adopt gldas noah model to verify the accuracy of grace with a temporal range of 2003 2018 consistent with that of grace http disc sci gsfc nasa gov hydrology data holdings 2 2 3 meteorological station data monthly precipitation and temperature data from the 607 meteorological stations during 2003 2018 in china were selected from the ground climatological datasets produced by the national meteorological data center http data cma cn a strict homogeneity test and correction have been carried out in these meteorological station data and the quality of the data has been significantly improved and presented a good consistency after a strict quality control the distribution of meteorological stations is shown in fig 1 2 2 4 teleconnection indices eight large scale monthly teleconnection indices were utilized during 2003 2018 to clarify the dynamic links between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors the teleconnection indices used in this study are described in table 2 3 methodology 3 1 groundwater storage anomalies gwsa the terrestrial water storages of vertical aquifer monitored by grace satellite are composed of surface water storage soil moisture storage snow water equivalent and groundwater storage based on the water balance principle the groundwater storage anomalies gwsa can be obtained by deducting the surface water storage anomalies swsa soil moisture storage anomalies smsa and snow water equivalent anomalies swea from the twsa feng et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 specifically the swsa smsa and swea are estimated based on gldas model the gwsa is calculated as follows 1 g w s a t w s a s w s a s m s a s w e a 3 2 groundwater drought index gdi the grace based groundwater drought investigation has not been implemented in china thus we constructed a dimensionless groundwater drought index gdi to reflect the dynamic variations of groundwater drought in china as a standardized index gdi can reflect the surplus or deficit of groundwater status more details on the gdi calculation can be found in thomas et al 2017 and wang et al 2020 3 3 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei can describe the drought situation in a certain area by the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the calculation process of spei thornthwaite method is used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration with the advantages of simple calculation and less meteorological input elements thornthwaite 1948 both spei and gdi can reflect drought from different perspectives thus they are related to each other to some extent in this study spei was adopted to verify the reliability of grace based gdi more details on the spei calculation can be found in vicente serrano et al 2010 3 4 singular spectral analysis ssa the single spectral analysis ssa is a powerful method to study the fluctuation of non linear time series which constructs the trajectory matrix based on the observed time series and decomposes and reconstructs the trajectory matrix so as to extract the long term fluctuation signals representing different components of the original time series ssa is suitable for non linear and non stationary time series processing with a simple computational procedure and a high calculation precision in this study ssa was used to describe the variation characteristics of gdi time series details about the ssa method can be found in walwer et al 2016 and will not be further clarified here 3 5 gridded trend identification method the modified mann kendall mmk method is a non parametric testing method for detecting the variation trend of time series which is widely used in the hydro meteorological field mmk method can effectively remove the autocorrelation components in time series and significantly improve the testing ability of the traditional mann kendall method compared with other traditional test methods we can get the drought trend characteristics at the grid scale by using the mmk method the detailed mmk calculation processes can be referred to huang et al 2015 3 6 cross wavelet transform method the cross wavelet transform method can not only reveal the links between two signals but also obtain the phase relationship of signals in time frequency space based on the wavelet analysis theory the cross wavelet transform method can analyze the correlation between two non stationary signals in time and frequency domain in this study the cross wavelet transform method was utilized to investigate the dynamic relationships between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors in china the theoretical distribution of cross wavelet power of two time series with their background power spectra p k x and p k y is described as follows 2 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level associated with the probability p of a probability distribution function huang et al 2016 4 results 4 1 reliability verification of grace and gdi 4 1 1 grace verification the reliability of grace gravity satellite can be verified by combining with gldas hydrological model thus we adopted gldas hydrological model to verify the reliability of grace as shown in fig 2 the temporal variation tendency of grace was generally consistent with that of gldas simultaneously grace and gldas exhibited significant correlations p 0 01 with pearson correlation coefficient r ranging from 0 56 to 0 89 the variation of grace and gldas was also relatively consistent in each sub basin of china fig 2a i moreover underlying surface conditions have different influences on hydrological cycle process which may be the main reason for the spatial heterogeneity of water storage changes in different sub basins across china among them the minimum grace value 126 94 mm appeared in december 2011 in the swb while the minimum gldas value 68 24 mm appeared in november 2014 in the cb conversely the maximum grace value 148 74 mm occurred in april 2013 in the yrb whilst the maximum gldas value 97 41 mm occurred in june 2014 in the seb for the whole country grace and gldas were also significantly correlated r 0 78 p 0 01 with variation amplitude of grace ranging from 88 42 103 58 mm and that of gldas ranging from 53 31 76 86 mm fig 2j compared with gldas grace contains not only surface water but also groundwater which leads to a relatively larger variation amplitude of grace than that of gldas based on the method recommended by landerer and swenson 2012 the uncertainty in grace was 8 31 mm month the grace showed a downward trend 0 005 mm month in mc from 2003 to 2018 which may be caused by the over exploitation of groundwater or the accelerated consumption of soil moisture storage the increase of vegetation coverage caused by ecological restoration project in china enlarged the leaf interception of precipitation and the deficit of soil moisture in general the precipitation grace and gldas presented good correlations during 2003 2018 and they showed apparent consistency and seasonal variation precipitation needs to be redistributed through complex hydrological processes such as surface runoff evapotranspiration and infiltration and finally transforms into terrestrial water storage therefore the fluctuations of precipitation and grace were not very consistent in some periods it is worth noting that the least annual precipitation 730 95 mm occurred in 2011 with an average grace reaching a minimum value 30 09 mm in this year the comparison results of grace gldas and precipitation data showed that they presented regular seasonal fluctuations with good consistencies consequently the quantitative inversion results of grace were credible and reliable which could be used for further investigating the dynamic variations of groundwater drought in china 4 1 2 gdi verification after evaluating the reliability of grace the groundwater drought index gdi can be obtained by calculating the groundwater storage deviation gsd as seen from fig 3 the minimum values of gwsa 31 05 mm gsd 37 81 mm and gdi 0 86 appeared in april 2011 meanwhile the minimum c i value 3 08 mm appeared in august furthermore the maximum values of gwsa 36 84 mm gsd 31 09 mm and gdi 0 99 appeared in june 2003 while the maximum c i value 9 05 mm appeared in march the grace based gdi was calculated through the above calculation process and then the reliability of gdi was verified by comparing the month by month correlation between gdi and spei of corresponding station fig 4 through comparative analysis we found that gdi and corresponding spei showed high correlations and consistent spatial distribution characteristics with an average r value of 0 74 on the monthly scale the average r values between gdi and spei ranged from 0 59 to 0 88 p 0 05 among all stations reaching a maximum value of 0 88 in july the largest percentage 92 7 of the number of stations occurred in july with r values passing the significance test of α 0 05 on the seasonal scale the average r values between gdi and spei in spring summer autumn and winter were 0 75 0 87 0 69 and 0 69 respectively p 0 01 meanwhile the largest percentage 79 9 of the number of stations occurred in summer with r values passing the significance test of α 0 01 since most of gdi and spei were positively correlated with good correlations the grace based gdi could be used as a metric to accurately capture the groundwater drought information in china 4 2 spatio temporal variations of groundwater drought 4 2 1 temporal evolutions fig 5 shows the temporal evolution characteristics of groundwater drought during 2003 2018 across china it can be seen that the gdi showed downward trends in mc and seven sub basins with different decline amplitudes indicating that the groundwater droughts were generally increasing from 2003 to 2018 in china for all sub basins fig 5a i the groundwater droughts were increasing except for those in the hrb and yb among them the most significant upward trend of groundwater drought with a gdi linear tendency rate of 0 02 10a occurred in the cb followed by slb with a gdi linear tendency rate of 0 019 10a for the whole country fig 5j the linear tendency rate of gdi was 0 01 10a during 2003 2018 the most serious groundwater drought occurred in 2011 with an average gdi reaching a minimum value of 0 51 in this year moreover the minimum gdi value was 0 86 in april 2011 during this drought event in 2011 the minimum value of average gdi 1 26 appeared in the yrb among all sub basins in addition ssa was adopted to describe the fluctuations of gdi time series gdi series also showed good correlations with the ssa derived trend items with r values ranging from 0 70 to 0 84 p 0 01 4 2 2 spatial distribution since the worst groundwater drought occurred in 2011 we depicted the spatial distribution of drought during this year in fig 6 by calculating the average gdi of all pixels in china the average gdi from january to december ranged from 0 21 to 0 86 table 3 the most serious groundwater drought occurred in april with a drought area percentage of 65 2 and an average gdi of 0 86 followed by february with a drought area percentage of 64 2 and an average gdi of 0 79 conversely the least serious groundwater drought occurred in june with a drought area percentage of 40 6 and an average gdi of 0 21 additionally there were six months april may july august september and november with the worst groundwater drought occurring in the yrb with average gdi ranging from 1 45 to 1 85 4 3 gridded groundwater drought trend identification fig 7 illustrates the gridded groundwater drought trend characteristics using the mmk trend test method across china during 2003 2018 the trend characteristic z s values of gdi are shown in fig 8 on the monthly scale the average trend characteristic z s values of gdi ranged from 0 48 to 0 03 indicating that the groundwater drought generally showed an insignificant increasing trend from 2003 to 2018 in china among the 12 months the largest and smallest groundwater drought area percentage with an upward trend occurred in october 79 7 and december 55 3 respectively besides the largest groundwater drought area percentage with a significant increasing trend p 0 01 occurred in november 6 9 on the seasonal scale the average z s values of gdi ranged from 0 49 to 0 31 implying that the groundwater drought also showed an insignificant upward trend during 2003 2018 the groundwater drought area percentage with an upward trend in spring summer autumn and winter was 75 2 79 3 75 7 and 73 8 respectively meanwhile the largest groundwater drought area percentage with a significant increasing trend p 0 01 occurred in winter 9 2 additionally the trend characteristics of groundwater drought were different in each sub basin of china specifically the maximum z s value 0 87 occurred in august in the yb and the minimum z s value 1 34 occurred in october in the yrb 4 4 propagation dynamics from meteorological to groundwater drought meteorological drought usually occurs earlier than groundwater drought which is also the foundation of other types of drought han et al 2019 there is a certain propagation time for meteorological drought to evolve into groundwater drought with different propagation time in each region due to various hydro meteorological conditions underlying surface conditions and human factors motlagh et al 2017 wossenyeleh et al 2020 thus the investigation of propagation dynamics from meteorological to groundwater drought can further clarify the concept of groundwater drought response to meteorological drought deepen the understanding of spatio temporal evolution patterns of drought and also help to reasonably predict and protect groundwater resources in china in order to quantitatively explore the dynamic propagation characteristics from meteorological to groundwater drought we compared the moving correlations between multi time scale spei 1 24 months and monthly gdi series and selected the time scale with the largest r value as the optimal propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought as presented in fig 9 the propagation time can be obtained from the largest r value p 0 05 between gdi and spei at different time scales for all sub basins fig 9a i groundwater drought had delayed responses on meteorological drought with different time lags in each sub basin of china for the whole country fig 9j the propagation time from january to december was 14 months 15 months 8 months 9 months 9 months 5 months 6 months 6 months 12 months 11 months 12 months and 15 months respectively with the corresponding r values of 0 52 0 51 0 61 0 64 0 62 0 69 0 71 0 72 0 59 0 59 0 61 and 0 55 respectively generally the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought was shorter in summer 5 6 months and longer in winter 14 15 months in china furthermore gdi was mostly positively correlated with spei with an average r value of 0 71 in summer and 0 53 in winter therefore the corresponding r value between gdi and spei was higher in summer and lower in winter since it takes a long time for precipitation to pass through the soil and develop into groundwater groundwater drought has a delay effect compared with meteorological drought liu et al 2016 han et al 2019 the meteorological drought caused by the decrease of precipitation will not directly develop into groundwater drought which is primarily due to the slow infiltration process of soil water gates et al 2011 at the same time the propagation time will be different in each sub basin in view of the differential climate hydrology and topography in the vast areas of china in summer the temperature evapotranspiration and crop water requirement are larger than those in other seasons wu et al 2018 people often exploit more groundwater than usual to meet the irrigation water demand of crops in summer so the propagation time from meteorological to groundwater drought is shorter in this season in winter the relatively longer propagation time may be caused by snowmelt huang et al 2017 5 discussion 5 1 dynamic relationships between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors 5 1 1 bivariate wavelet coherence drought is not only related to the direct influence of climate change and human activities but also related to the indirect impact of teleconnection factors guo et al 2019 vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 therefore the effects of teleconnection factors enso pna ao pdo nao amo npi and dmi on groundwater drought in china were revealed using cross wavelet transform technology fig 10 it can be observed that there are three significant resonance periods between gdi and enso which are 10 14 months in 2005 2006 and 10 16 months in 2010 2012 with negative correlations and 32 40 months in 2008 2014 with positive correlations fig 10a fig 10b indicates that there are two significant resonance periods between gdi and pna which are 26 30 months in 2006 and 14 18 months in 2014 2015 with negative correlations fig 10c shows that there are three significant resonance periods between gdi and ao which are 8 10 months in 2010 2011 and 32 36 months in 2011 2012 with negative correlations and 16 18 months in 2014 with positive correlations there is a significant resonance period between gdi and pdo which is 8 12 months in 2004 2006 with negative correlations fig 10d similarly the relationships between gdi and nao amo npi and dmi are depicted in fig 10e h meanwhile there are short term intermittent resonance periods of 1 8 months between gdi and teleconnection factors enso pna ao pdo nao amo npi and dmi during 2003 2018 as depicted in fig 10 the cross wavelet transform can effectively reveal the dynamic relationships between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors in china teleconnection factors have statistically significant relationships with groundwater drought implying that they play important roles during the drought evolution in general enso has the greatest impact on groundwater drought while pdo has the least effect on groundwater drought in china the cross wavelet energy spectrum can analyze the correlation between two sequences in the high energy region while the wavelet coherence can identify the detailed mutual characteristics in the low energy region fig 11 there is an obvious positive correlations between gdi and enso fig 11a at scale of 24 48 months 2008 2015 furthermore the correlation is different between groundwater drought and other teleconnection factors in both time and frequency domains fig 11b h 5 1 2 multivariate wavelet coherence since enso was the dominant teleconnection factor on groundwater drought we applied multivariate cross wavelet transform between gdi enso and other teleconnection factors pna ao pdo nao amo npi and dmi to reveal the coupled effect of two teleconnection factors on groundwater drought fig 12 it can be observed from fig 12a that gdi enso is closely related to pna at scale of 24 48 months 2007 2015 similarly the links between gdi enso and ao pdo nao amo npi and dmi are described in fig 12b g overall the combination of enso and pna has the highest dependence on gdi indicating that enso pna has the largest combined effects on groundwater drought in china the combination of enso and pna had the greatest impact on groundwater drought so we also explored the influence of enso pna and other teleconnection factors on groundwater drought fig 13 for one factor it can be concluded that the average wavelet coherence awc ranges from 0 75 to 0 82 and the percent area of significant coherence pasc ranges from 1 05 to 8 65 enso has the closest relationship on groundwater drought with an awc value of 0 82 and a pasc value of 8 65 for two factors enso pna is obviously related to groundwater drought with an awc value of 0 93 and a pasc value of 17 87 for three factors enso pna dmi has the strongest impact on groundwater drought with an awc value of 0 96 and a pasc value of 18 08 this implies that three factor combinations enso pna dmi are needed to explain the groundwater drought variation in china generally as the number of teleconnection factors increases the awc and pasc values increase suggesting that groundwater drought is affected simultaneously by multiple teleconnection factors table 4 5 2 uncertainties the uncertainties of detecting dynamic variations of groundwater drought based on grace gravity satellite mainly come from grace products and post processing errors missing monthly data and hydrological model quantifying other water layer i e surface water layer soil water layer and snow water layer firstly there are some uncertainties in the post processing of grace satellite data there are three kinds of grace datasets and different results may be obtained by using different datasets to retrieve water storage changes the grace data obtained by the traditional spherical harmonic coefficient method is processed by a series of filtering which not only eliminates the error influence but also weakens the real signal therefore the scale factor should be used to recover the signal leakage caused by filtering in this study the newly developed grace rl06 mascon model was selected to replace the traditional spherical harmonic coefficient method which can reduce the calculation error in solving the earth gravity field model göttl et al 2018 crowley and huang 2020 as seen from fig 2 the uncertainty in grace is approximately 8 31 mm month secondly linear interpolation method was used to obtain continuous grace time series for the missing data in some months which may also produce uncertainties long et al 2015 hu et al 2019 grace was significantly correlated with gldas p 0 01 confirming that the accuracy of the results obtained by linear interpolation method met the requirements fig 2 finally due to the discrepancy of parameter setting of hydrological model other water layer data obtained by different hydrological models were also different feng et al 2013 considering that only gldas noah hydrological model has the highest spatial resolution 0 25 consistent with grace mascon model we selected gldas noah hydrological model to compare with grace mascon model 5 3 advantages and limitations grace gravity satellite provides a new perspective to study groundwater drought in the case of insufficient ground observation data researchers have compared grace mascon model with traditional spherical harmonic coefficient method and found that grace mascon model can improve the accuracy of inversion results and retain more effective signals save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2016 wiese et al 2016 sun et al 2018 liu et al 2020 although the mascon model does not carry out post processing such as filtering it separates the influence of different regional mass changes on the earth gravity field and makes the calculation results more realistic by adding space time constraint equations the prominent advantage of mascon model is that the change of earth mass is directly calculated as a parameter through the high precision inter satellite observation data of grace gravity satellite which can eliminate the north south stripe error and avoid the signal leakage problem caused by filtering bhanja et al 2016 sinha et al 2019 the newly released mascon model is demonstrated to be equivalent to or superior to traditional scaled spherical harmonic coefficient method scanlon et al 2016 grace gldas and precipitation data have similar seasonal variation trend fig 2 which can also be found in other researches yang and chen 2015 wu et al 2019 the reliability verification of grace and gdi concluded that grace mascon model can accurately capture the gridded groundwater drought information in china as a standardized drought index gdi can objectively compare the groundwater drought status on the temporal and spatial scale which can also be used to monitor the groundwater drought in other regions moreover the study area should be more than 200 000 km2 for retrieving terrestrial water storage using grace which is also applicable for the major river basins in china swenson et al 2003 xie et al 2019 liu et al 2020 discovered that the grace based drought was increasing in china which was consistent with the results of this study in conclusion the combination of grace gravity satellite and gldas hydrological model provides an important scientific foundation for the monitoring and mitigation of groundwater drought disasters as well as the establishment of reasonable utilization system of groundwater resources in china as for teleconnection factors people gradually realize that the identification of the dynamic relationship between teleconnection factors and drought is helpful to understand the formation mechanism of drought lanckriet et al 2014 räsänen et al 2016 forootan et al 2019 vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 fig 10 illustrates that there are significant resonance periods between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors at different time scales in china with obvious correlation differences in different frequencies and temporal domains enso can change the atmospheric circulation and cause abnormal fluctuation of hydro climatic events which will lead to reduced rainfall and increased drought risk reginald and yong 1996 the results of cross wavelet transform showed that enso had the greatest impact on groundwater drought in china furthermore the combination of enso pna and dmi has the most obvious relationship with groundwater drought fig 13 therefore enso pna and dmi can be used as the input factors of drought early warning system to improve the accuracy of drought prediction the lack of grace sequence length is a limitation of accurate groundwater drought monitoring thomas et al 2014 if grace time series is longer more accurate and reliable dynamic evolution characteristics of groundwater drought will be obtained in addition the impact of human activities on grace results should also be paid attention to felfelani et al 2017 5 4 challenges and future perspectives to date there are still some challenges in identifying the variations of groundwater drought based on grace satellite the spatial resolution of grace is not very high which is a main challenge for scholars to study the change of groundwater drought due to the observation altitude and orbit determination deviation of grace satellite it is not suitable for accurate monitoring of small scale groundwater storage change chen et al 2016 nevertheless in most areas lacking of measured groundwater data grace satellite can complement the traditional small scale groundwater change monitoring method which has an important reference value for improving the accuracy of regional groundwater drought monitoring and realizing efficient groundwater resources management thomas et al 2017 therefore in the future the monitoring of groundwater drought based on grace satellite data can be improved and the utilization of more accurate grace data e g mascon model will help to improve the monitoring accuracy of groundwater drought combining grace with interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar global position system gps measured groundwater data and regional land subsidence to analyze and verify groundwater drought variations will improve the reliability of grace satellite monitoring groundwater drought castellazzi et al 2018 besides in order to reduce the uncertainty and improve the accuracy of hydrological model grace satellite can be used for data assimilation of hydrological model tangdamrongsub et al 2018 in the aspect of application it is necessary to monitor groundwater evolutions at multiple scales based on grace satellite analyze the relationships between urbanization and groundwater storage changes in combination with the impact of human activities i e agricultural irrigation groundwater abstraction and identify the dynamic variations of groundwater drought in different regions so as to provide support for promoting regional sustainable development liu et al 2020 furthermore the distance measurement method of the next generation grace follow on missions has changed from microwave to laser distance measurement with the improvement of separation measurement accuracy and pivotal gravity satellite sensor technology as well as the progress of scientific data system grace follow on satellite can perceive the change of the earth gravity field on a smaller scale and realize the accurate measurement of the earth gravity ellmer and mayer gürr 2017 zhong et al 2018 in the future work we will attempt to explore the grace follow on satellite which is of great importance for the dynamic variations of global groundwater drought 6 conclusions in this study the dynamic variations of groundwater drought were investigated from a high resolution grace rl06 mascon model perspective across china additionally the temporal characteristics spatial distribution and gridded trend detections of groundwater drought were quantitatively identified during 2003 2018 meanwhile the dynamic relationships between groundwater and meteorological drought were explicitly clarified from the results major conclusions are given as follows 1 the reliability verification of grace and gdi indicated that the quantitative grace results were reliable and gdi can be used to accurately identify the groundwater drought information in china meanwhile grace gldas and precipitation data showed consistent seasonal fluctuations 2 the groundwater droughts were generally increasing during 2003 2018 with different variation trends in each sub basin of china the most significant upward trend of groundwater drought occurred in the cb with a gdi linear tendency rate of 0 02 10a noticeably the most serious groundwater drought occurred in april 2011 with a drought area percentage of 65 2 and an average gdi value of 0 86 3 the results of gridded drought trend identification showed that the groundwater droughts were increasing insignificantly from 2003 to 2018 in china on the monthly scale the largest groundwater drought area percentage 79 7 with an increasing trend occurred in october on the seasonal scale the largest groundwater drought area percentage 79 3 with an increasing trend occurred in summer 4 groundwater drought had delayed responses on meteorological drought and the response time was different in each sub basin across china generally the propagation dynamics were shorter in summer 5 6 months and longer in winter 14 15 months the high resolution grace mascon model provides a novel perspective to identify the dynamic variations of groundwater drought across china and it can also be applied in

9771,drought stress is a major limiting factor for banana production and the incidence of drought spells is expected to increase with climate change climate smart practices and varieties are needed but evaluation in the field is hampered by a lack of reliable physiological drought stress indicators we investigated the potential of using stable carbon isotope ratios δ13c and leaf temperature and its derived dans degrees above non stressed canopy index as proxies for drought stress in banana leaf samples were taken for δ13c analysis and leaf temperature was monitored throughout the day in a field trial with different banana plant stages mother and daughter plants under two irrigation treatments rainfed and irrigated during the dry season in arusha tanzania we found that δ13c leaf temperature and dans were highly sensitive proxies for drought stress in banana soil volumetric water content had a significant effect on both δ13c values and dans there was a significant difference in δ13c 1 5 0 1 p 0 01 and afternoon leaf temperature 7 1 c p 0 01 between the rainfed and irrigated treatment to deal with variability in δ13c within the leaf we developed a banana tailored sampling method this study also revealed the complexity of carbon isotope dynamics in the intertwined system of mother and daughter plants daughter plants had more negative δ13c values 1 9 0 1 p 0 01 and lower temperatures 4 1 c than mother plants this indicates less stress but interpretation of the δ13c ratio is complicated by the potential carbon flux from mother to daughter plant once we have a full understanding of these complexities within the plant the δ13c and leaf temperature based methods we developed can be directly implemented for both mother and daughter plants under various field conditions keywords canopy temperature carbon 13 infrared thermometry musa sampling methods water stress 1 introduction about 150 million tonnes of banana are produced per year mostly in asia africa and south and central america fao 2018 the unavailability of water is probably the most important abiotic constraint to banana production worldwide turner 1995 drought stress in banana has been reported in various geographic regions and climate change predictions indicate an increasing demand but uncertain supply of water adhikari et al 2015 calberto et al 2015 machovina and feeley 2013 ramirez et al 2011 in east africa in particular the livelihood of millions of people is expected to be impacted by changing weather conditions banana serves as a daily staple and is typically cultivated by smallholder farmers in rainfed systems adhikari et al 2015 gambart et al 2020 temperature in east africa is predicted to increase by 1 4 5 5 c by the end of the century adhikari et al 2015 increasing temperature can benefit banana production by making growth conditions in the subtropics and highlands more favorable but also leads to an increased water demand calberto et al 2015 varma and bebber 2019 over the last 37 years rainfall has increased in certain parts of the region and decreased in others muthoni et al 2019 in most east african countries an increase in annual rainfall between 5 and 15 is expected by 2090 adhikari et al 2015 however intra seasonal heterogeneity has been increasing and is expected to continue doing so drought is already the most limiting factor for banana production carr 2009 van asten et al 2010 rising temperatures together with increasingly variable and unpredictable rainfall will irrevocably aggravate the problem adhikari et al 2015 muthoni et al 2019 the need for climate smart varieties and management practices becomes only more urgent drought stress in agriculture is defined as a shortage of water in the root zone leading to reduced plant yields salekdeh et al 2009 in the last two decades most research on drought stress in banana has been carried out at the molecular level or under controlled conditions progress has been made in the identification of genes and pathways associated with drought tolerance traits whereby drought tolerance is defined as the ability to sustain growth or yield despite the occurrence of drought brown et al 2020 muthusamy et al 2016 souza santos et al 2018 van wesemael et al 2019 however the major barrier to the selection of climate smart varieties are the complications associated with phenotyping under field conditions a number of phenotypical drought associated traits in banana have been identified but the majority is only usable under greenhouse or screenhouse conditions brown et al 2020 methods have been developed for measuring leaf turgor pressure and sap flow where the first was found to be affected by absence of irrigation and the second to be correlated with soil water availability lu et al 2002 zimmermann et al 2010 however neither has been employed to identify drought stress in the field as such field evaluation faces a lot of practical challenges banana has a long growth cycle 12 20 months its growth is not seasonal and not synchronized within a field and it has an inconveniently large size brown et al 2020 typically field trials evaluate growth and or yield as a measure for stress but this is time and labor intensive easily applicable and affordable methods for stress evaluation or phenotyping under field conditions are missing brown et al 2020 carr 2009 turner et al 2007 stable carbon isotope analysis could be such a method farquhar et al 1982 described how during photosynthesis c3 plants discriminate against the heavier 13c atom the extent of this discrimination in c3 plants mainly depends on stomatal opening when drought stress occurs stomatal closure is initiated leading to a reduction in discrimination the ratio of 13c to 12c under stressed conditions will thus be higher than under optimal conditions this ratio is typically compared to the ratio of the international v pdb standard i e limestone from the pee dee formation in south carolina and expressed as δ13c whereby 1 δ 13 c sample 13 c 12 c sample 13 c 12 c standard 13 c 12 c standard 1000 measuring the δ13c values of plant material has become one of the standard methods for the evaluation of drought stress or water use efficiency in particular in trees and cereals gao et al 2018 jákli et al 2016 seibt et al 2008 tree ring or whole leaf samples are taken from plants under different treatments or at different moments in time to compare the plants response to un availability of water so far stable carbon isotope analysis on banana has to our knowledge only been done in three instances and only once with the purpose of evaluating drought stress israeli et al 1996 kissel et al 2015 zhenyu et al 2020 kissel et al 2015 screened different banana genotypes in terms of transpiration efficiency and included δ13c analysis in their research they found a strong correlation between δ13c and transpiration efficiency although only under water deficient conditions they attributed the lack of an overall correlation to the fact that δ13c is a measure for co2 exchange whereas transpiration efficiency considers whole plant carbon accumulation this is in accordance with the conclusions of seibt et al 2008 namely that δ13c cannot be directly linked to transpiration or whole plant water use efficiency wue rather it is a proxy measure of stomatal closure and its driving environmental factors among which drought is one one of the reasons for the limited use of stable carbon isotope fractionation in banana might be the specific nature of this plant banana is a semi perennial crop that reproduces vegetatively through the formation of suckers or daughter plants therefore a banana plant cannot be seen as a mere individual but rather as an integrated whole of mother and daughter plants called a mat in addition banana leaves are formed in the underground corm develop rolled up in the pseudostem to eventually emerge almost fully completed barker 1969 while the leaves are inside they serve as a carbon sink the carbon in their tissue originates from other photosynthetically active leaves hence these non emerged leaves are heterotrophic once the leaves emerge they become autotrophic this unusual plant structure and leaf development complicate sampling and might affect δ13c ratios zhenyu et al 2020 indeed described a large variation in δ13c within the leaf 0 5 because of this sequential development from the heterotrophic to the autotrophic stage besides stable carbon isotope analysis leaf temperature can be used as a proxy for drought stress in plants plants heat up during the day because of increasing temperature and solar radiation as a mechanism to prevent overheating part of the energy is released again as latent heat through transpiration plants under drought stress will close their stomata to prevent transpiration consequently a drought stressed plant will have a higher temperature than a non stressed plant nanda et al 2018 leaf temperature based methods have successfully been used among others in maize dejonge et al 2015 wheat alderfasi and nielsen 2001 and fruit trees ngao et al 2017 in the seventies and eighties of last century several authors also included leaf temperature measurements in their assessment of photosynthetic parameters of banana under drought stress kallarackal et al 1990 robinson and bower 1987 taylor and sexton 1972 they confirmed there was a difference between stressed and non stressed plants yet often small none of them considered leaf temperature as a practical proxy for drought stress however technology has progressed since infrared thermometry strongly facilitates leaf temperature measurement allowing for faster and more accurate data collection than the thermocouples previously used yu et al 2015 dong et al 2012 successfully used an infrared camera to identify the presence of drought stress in banana plants as a consequence of fusarium infection uwimana et al 2021 found differences in leaf temperature between drought stressed and non stressed plants although not of a significant nature in this research we evaluated the use of 1 δ13c and 2 leaf temperature as proxies for drought stress in banana we investigated stable carbon isotope dynamics in field grown banana plants mother and daughter plants under two watering treatments in addition we investigated the drivers of the δ13c signal and proposed a suitable sampling method leaf temperature was monitored throughout the day in both treatments and its derived index dans degrees above non stressed canopy was evaluated as a proxy for drought stress finally we investigated the environmental drivers behind dans and proposed a measurement approach tailored to banana 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site field research was carried out in the joint research farm of the nelson mandela african institution of science and technology nm aist and the international institute of tropical agriculture iita in arusha tanzania 3 23 58 s 36 47 48 e the study area is characterized by a tropical highland climate with a moderately cool thermal zone fao 2002 the rainfall pattern is bimodal the long rainy season usually ranges from march to june and the short one from october to december during the year of our experiment however rainfall already ceased in may while the short rainy season lasted until the end of january fig 1 our measurements were carried out in july 2019 the beginning of august 2019 and the beginning of february 2020 during these periods rainfall was less than or equal to eto 2

description we refer to stevens et al 2020 2 2 experimental set up this study was part of an experiment initiated in 2017 that had the aim to model banana growth under deficit and optimal irrigation for two contrasting varieties i e east african highland huti green musa aa mchare subgroup and grand nain musa aaa cavendish subgroup stevens et al 2020 the first variety was planted in may 2017 and the latter one in november 2017 at time of data collection the banana mats in the field were mostly of the second generation and usually consisted of two generations a mother plant and a single daughter plant some mother plants were flowering while others were still growing vegetatively here we refer to banana mats that merely consist of a vegetatively growing mother plant as v to mats consisting of a mother plant with a daughter plant as vd and finally to a flowering fruiting mother plant with a daughter plant as fd fig 2 all mats in the field received optimal irrigation until four months after planting from then on both varieties underwent two watering treatments in a non randomized blocked design the treatments were rainfed and irrigated for the irrigated treatment plants were irrigated once a day if more than 25 of the total available water taw was depleted in the first 0 30 cm or second 30 60 cm horizon which was the case nearly every day during the dry season rainfed plants were exceptionally irrigated when there were indications of extreme stress like wilting leaves the irrigation system used was drip irrigation with two irrigation lines for every banana row the grand nain variety was distributed over four blocks whereby a block consisted of five rows of 15 mats both treatments rainfed and irrigated were applied once in every block resulting in eight treatment plots the mchare variety was distributed over two blocks the rainfed treatment was replicated three times in the first block and the irrigated treatment three times in the second block resulting in a total of six treatment plots 2 3 environmental conditions 2 3 1 weather daily on site weather conditions were monitored with a tahmo weather station decagon ds 2 sonic anemometer 148 with pyranometer rec 1 rain gauge vp 4 thermometer and humidity sensor at 5 min intervals the monitored and calculated variables of interest as well as their range during the experiment are given in

house developed time domain reflectometry tdr sensors positioned vertically in every plot in two horizons 0 30 and 30 60 cm for modeling purposes the vwc in the upper 30 cm was used as this zone

total available soil water taw that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress occurs determined at 0 35 for banana allen et al 1998 the irrigated treatment resulted in a relatively constant and sufficient vwc throughout the year the measurements and sampling took place at times where water deficit in the rainfed treatment was most severe 2 4 stable carbon isotopes 2 4 1 leaf sampling strategy leaf sampling for δ13c analysis took place during the dry season between 23 and 30 july 2019 fig 3 samples were taken from vegetatively growing mother plants v mats and vegetatively growing mother and daughter plant pairs vd mats in both varieties in addition samples were taken from grand nain daughter plants in mats with a flowering fruiting mother plant fd plants were randomly selected in the different blocks in every plant two photosynthetically active consecutive leaves were sampled the youngest of both leaves was referred to as young and the other one as old in case of irrigated grand nain the third and fourth fully open leaves were sampled while in mchare and rainfed grand nain the second and third fully open leaves were sampled this was done to account for the larger growth speed of irrigated grand nain as the aim was to sample leaves of a similar age samples were taken with a small metal auger resulting in circular perforations of 1 cm2 fig 4a to assess the variability in δ13c within the leaf and to determine the optimal sampling position s samples were taken according to a predetermined pattern in mother plants ten samples were taken five on every side of the midrib fig 4b the pattern was designed in such a way to assess the variability in both vertical and horizontal direction through repeated measures anova analysis in daughter plants six samples were taken varying only in vertical direction 2 4 2 δ13c analysis samples were oven dried at 70 c for 72 h and prepared for transport in the laboratories of nm aist δ13c analysis was done with an elemental analyzer vario isotope select elementar langenselbold germany coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms isoprime 100 elementar at the soil and water management and crop nutrition laboratory of the joint fao iaea centre of nuclear techniques in food and agriculture in seibersdorf austria the irms measurements were normalized using in house standards sf1 sugar beet standard with a δ13c ratio of 26 07 and ss1 sugar cane standard with a δ13c ratio of 10 95 these lab standards were calibrated against respectively iaea ch 6 10 449 0 033 and iaea ch 7 32 151 0 050 2 4 3 determining optimal sample size in this research we aimed to determine the optimal number of samples per plant to obtain a correct and precise estimate of the δ13c value of that plant the larger the number of samples per plant the more precise the estimate becomes and the smaller its variance σ2 plant we consider the precision high enough when it is possible to differentiate the δ13c value of individual plants this implies that the number of samples is large enough when the within plant variance σ2 plant is smaller than the between plant or population variance σ2 pop to determine the optimal sample size we created 4000 subsets of our obtained dataset these subsets consisted of random combinations of two to nine randomly selected samples from every leaf from mother plants only for every subset a linear mixed model was built with δ13c as the dependent variable volumetric water content mat stage and variety as fixed effects and block and plant as random effects from this model the variance of the random plant effect was obtained being the between plant variance s2 pop in comparison the mean of the variance within every individual plant was calculated s2 plant s2 plant and s2 pop were compared to each other through a one tailed paired t test the optimal number of samples per plant was then determined as the number for which s2 plant was significantly smaller than s2 pop 2 4 4 regression approach to understand which factors drive the variability in δ13c in banana leaves we created a model with δ13c as dependent variable we built the model with a dataset of 780 observations from mother and daughter plants the observations in our dataset were grouped at different levels and were therefore not independent firstly the experiment had a blocked design secondly a mat could consist of two plants thirdly several leaves per plant were sampled and finally multiple samples per leaf were taken data within a group share a residual covariance we used a linear mixed model approach to account for this nested group structure volumetric water content vwc variety mat stage plant stage and leaf age were tested as fixed effects and block mat plant mat growth stage and leaf mat growth stage leaf age as random effects vwc data were averaged over two months prior to leaf sampling based on the growth rate of the leaves this period was deemed to have been of influence for the sampled leaves interaction effects were retained at a significance level of α 0 05 flowering mats were excluded from the regression analysis as these were only present in grand nain 2 5 leaf temperature 2 5 1 measurement leaf temperature was measured with a handheld infrared thermometer bosch gis 1000c 1 c every two hours between 09 00 and 17 00 measurements took place on 8 august 2019 and 18 and 20 february 2020 fig 3 twenty vd grand nain mats from both watering treatments were selected five in every block both mother and daughter plants were included in every plant the most south facing leaf of the second to fifth fully emerged leaves was identified and measured stavrinides et al 2010 the effect of solar angle was presumed to be larger than the effect of leaf age hence this strategy both the left and right side of the midrib were measured and then averaged on february 20 data were collected from both abaxial lower and adaxial upper side of the leaf this was done to estimate the effect of leaf side on the temperature on other days only the adaxial side was measured 2 5 2 calculation of degrees above non stressed canopy dans index leaf temperature is strongly dependent on the plant s micro environment this complicates its interpretation as a measure for drought stress therefore it is recommended to normalize leaf temperature data dejonge et al 2015 nanda et al 2018 a simple and straightforward way to do so is by calculating the temperature stress day tsd or degrees above non stressed canopy dans index which is the difference between a stressed and non stressed crop at the same place and time clawson and blad 1982 dejonge et al 2015 in contrast to other methods no information besides leaf temperature is needed in this research we used the minimal temperature measured in the irrigated treatment as a non stressed reference level this minimum was obtained at every time of measurement for mother and daughter plants separately 2 5 3 regression approach to understand the driving factors of changes in dans throughout the day we created a model with a combination of weather variables and plant soil factors the model was built with a total of 790 observations obtained in august 2019 and february 2020 dans values were averages per plant meaning the average of left and right side of the midrib was used in accordance to our approach estimating the δ13c values we used a mixed model a logarithmic transformation was applied to normalize the strongly skewed dans data to avoid issues of collinearity we excluded several weather variables prior to model building solar radiation w m2 wind velocity m s and vpd kpa were withheld in addition to these growth stage and soil volumetric water content vwc cm³ cm³ were included as fixed terms and plant and mat as random effects interaction effects were retained at a significance level of α 0 05 2 6 statistical software used all analyses were done in r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 except the modeling of δ13c and dans which was done in jmp software sas institute inc 2019 all plots were made with the ggplot2 package for r wickham 2016 3 results 3 1 the effect of drought on δ13c in different varieties mat and plant stages the effect of the watering treatments on the δ13c values was significant for both studied banana varieties p 0 05 rainfed plants had δ13c values of on average 25 7 0 1 and irrigated plants of 27 2 0 1 fig 5 this implies rainfed plants experienced more stomatal limitations than irrigated plants due to water deficiency in mats consisting of a mother and daughter plant vd daughter plants had more negative δ13c values than mother plants with a significant difference of 1 9 0 1 p 0 01 the difference was most pronounced in grand nain 2 4 0 3 p 0 01 the effect of mat stage was found to be variety dependent in grand nain mother plants with a daughter plant vd had less negative δ13c values than mother plants without a daughter plant v although this difference was not significant in the rainfed treatment p 0 23 in mchare we observed the opposite vd mother plants had a more negative δ13c than v mother plants this difference was however not significant in the irrigated treatment p 0 25 daughter plants from flowering fruiting plants fd were only sampled in grand nain as mchare plants were not flowering at time of sampling rainfed fd daughter plants had δ13c values similar to rainfed vd daughter plants irrigated fd daughter plants however had less negative δ13c values than irrigated vd daughter plants indicating less stress p 0 05 3 2 variability of δ13c in the leaf the effect of sampling position in the banana leaf on the δ13c values was significant both when varying in vertical and horizontal direction p 0 01 table 2 δ13c became more negative towards the outer side of the leaf outer and further away from the pseudostem upper the difference in the horizontal direction was significantly larger than in the vertical direction p 0 01 we calculated the minimal number of samples per plant as the number of samples for which the condition s2 plant s2 pop would be fulfilled one sample per leaf already results in an average s2 plant which is significantly smaller than s2 pop p 0 01 however for 8 of the subsets of our data s2 plant was not smaller than s2 pop datasets with four samples per plant fulfilled the condition in 100 of the cases making this a safer sample size 3 3 driving factors of δ13c leaf age plant stage and soil volumetric water content vwc had a significant effect on δ13c in banana leaves table 3 old leaves systematically had a more negative δ13c than young leaves implying less stomatal closure and thus likely less drought stress at the time of leaf formation variety and mat stage were not significant but their interaction was as well as the interaction between variety and plant stage most of the variance in δ13c which was not explained by the fixed effects could be ascribed to the plant level implying differences from plant to plant were larger than between blocks mats or leaves 3 4 effect of drought on the diurnal leaf temperature profile of mother and daughter plants our measurements during the dry season revealed that there was a diurnal trend in banana leaf temperature fig 6a leaves warmed up until a maximum in the afternoon at 15 00 after which they cooled down again this maximum seems to correspond to a maximum in solar radiation intensity fig 6b however the maximum in vpd and ambient temperature occurred later at 16 00 there was significant variation in leaf temperature in the different watering treatments and plant stages rainfed plants heated up more than irrigated plants at the maximum at 15 00 rainfed mother plants were on average 7 1 c warmer than irrigated mother plants p 0 01 the difference between daughter plants was smaller with an average of 4 1 c p 0 01 within both watering treatments the difference between mother and daughter plants was significant as well p 0 01 in the rainfed treatment there was an average difference between the plant stages of 6 1 c while under irrigation the difference was 2 1 c at other times of the day not all treatments and plant stages were significantly different from each other the rate of increase in temperature towards the afternoon was smaller for tmin than for the treatment averages trainfed and tirrigated the slope of tirrigated remained identical to tmin until 13 00 but then increased while the slope of trainfed already increased from the morning onwards tmin was below the ambient temperature at all times and was not significantly different in mother and daughter plants p 0 71 3 5 temperature variability within the leaf the difference in temperature between the abaxial and adaxial side of the leaf was not significantly different from zero p 0 09 fig 7 leaf temperature on the left and right side of the midrib were significantly different from each other p 0 01 the difference was on average 0 5 c which is less than the measurement accuracy 1 c however there was diurnal variation in this difference during the morning temperatures were higher on the left side of the midrib while in the afternoon we observed higher temperatures on the right side fig 7 this translated into an average absolute difference between left and right side of the midrib of 2 1 c the average absolute difference in mother plants was 3 1 c and in rainfed mother plants went up to 7 1 c at 11 00 3 6 variation in dans like leaf temperature dans increased towards a maximum at 15 00 especially in rainfed mother plants fig 8 the difference between both treatments especially towards the afternoon is more pronounced in dans than in leaf temperature per se there was a strong correlation between average dans at a certain time and its variance r2 0 84 implying higher average dans values came with a larger range in measurements 3 7 driving factors of dans all variables included in the model explaining dans were significant table 4 solar radiation intensity and vpd increased dans whilst wind speed and vwc decreased dans daughter plants generally had a lower dans than mother plants to compare the size of those effects they should be rescaled every effect has a different range and the model estimates the logarithm of dans considering the difference in dans for the minimum and maximum of every parameter table 1 the effects were largest for solar radiation vwc and wind speed the difference between the minimum and maximum of their range results in a change of about 4 c in dans the effect of vpd was slightly lower with a difference of only 2 c plant stage finally had an effect of 1 c three interaction terms were found to be significant as well their effect being less than 1 c the contribution of the random effects to the unexplained variance was relatively small 3 8 correlation between δ13c and dans δ13c and dans are both proxies for drought stress although at a different time scale δ13c of a plant leaf is a time integrated measure while dans represents the current level of stress nonetheless we found a strong correlation between δ13c and dans averaged per plot fig 9 p 0 01 the plots are clustered along the trendline according to plant stage and treatment only irrigated mother plants are located below the line having a lower dans than their δ13c would suggest 4 discussion 4 1 δ13c is a highly sensitive proxy for drought stress in banana rainfed plants had δ13c values on average 1 6 less negative than irrigated plants while drought stress in the rainfed treatment was not attempted to be ascertained by a physiological measurement several indications point indeed to its extreme likelihood firstly reference crop evapotranspiration eto as well as eto 2 exceeded rainfall fig 1 secondly soil volumetric water content vwc measurements indicated severe moisture deficiencies in the rainfed plots often reaching the pwp whereas such did not occur in the irrigated plots fig 3 we can thus conclude that the difference in δ13c can be ascribed to drought stress and as such that δ13c can be used as a proxy for drought stress in banana plants moreover the effect of volumetric water content vwc on δ13c was highly significant table 3 the parameter estimate of 8 indicates that a change in soil volumetric water content of 0 1 would result in a difference in δ13c of 0 8 assuming other factors of influence remain the same the measurement error for δ13c analysis in an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms is around 0 12 this would correspond to a difference in soil volumetric water content of 0 015 in other words differences in vwc as small as 0 015 can be detected with stable carbon isotope analysis it is therefore a highly sensitive method for drought stress detection and quantification in banana 4 2 drought stress distribution in a banana mat we found that both in grand nain and mchare varieties daughter plants experienced less drought stress than mother plants fig 5 table 3 the mat has a shared root system so this cannot be linked to a difference in water availability however daughter plants mostly grow below the canopy where they receive less direct sunlight than mother plants light intensity alters δ13c in two ways firstly more light leads to a higher rate of photosynthesis and therefore a higher water demand lambers et al 2008 in a water limited environment the plant will rapidly close its stomata and δ13c values will be less negative than in a shaded environment secondly a higher photosynthetic activity results in a depletion in co2 inside the stomata and therefore a decrease in carbon discrimination cernusak et al 2013 israeli et al 1996 showed that this light effect also occurs in banana plants be it in mother plants finally light intensity also increases the water demand of a plant indirectly as it coincides with an increase in air temperature and eventually vpd in addition to the light effect it is possible that water is preferentially allocated to daughter plants as a survival mechanism young daughter plants typically act as sinks in a banana mat they receive photo assimilates from the photosynthetically more active mother plant in grand nain in particular suckers are strongly dependent on the mother plant dens et al 2015 dorel et al 2016 our results indicate that suckers are not only sinks for carbon but also for water there is no previous research to confirm this furthermore the fact that daughter plants are carbon sinks complicates the interpretation of their δ13c values some of the carbon in a sucker is generated autotrophically through photosynthesis of its own leaves while other carbon originates from the mother plant we do however not know these carbon flux rates which might vary with variety and age of the sucker and the flowering state of the mother plant consequently we cannot draw clear conclusions on the stress level of a banana daughter plant based on its δ13c values as we do not know the origin of this carbon hence it becomes clear that we need a better understanding of the carbon and water dynamics within a banana mat if we want to use carbon isotope discrimination as a measure for stress in daughter plants the mat stage had a significant effect on δ13c but interacted with variety fig 5 table 3 in grand nain mother plants with a daughter plant vd were slightly more stressed than vegetatively growing mother plants v this can be explained by the presence of an extra sink the sucker the same effect could be seen in irrigated flowering fruiting mats fd the presence of an additional sink namely a banana bunch or a flower creates competition for water and therefore more stress for the fd daughter plant in mchare the mat stage effect was different from grand nain vd mats were less stressed than v mats at least in the rainfed treatment this might indicate that mchare suckers are less dependent from the mother plant than grand nain which is supported by the smaller difference in δ13c between mother and daughter plant in mchare in addition vd mats are in a further developmental stage than v mats and as a consequence have a larger root system karamura et al 2011 it could be that the effect of the more developed vd root system compensates for the additional sink and that therefore mchare vd mats are slightly less stressed than v mats however it is difficult to draw conclusions on differences between grand nain and mchare as they were not established at the same time and because planting density might have been suboptimal for mchare 4 3 δ13c in different leaves a timeline for water availability leaf age had a significant effect on δ13c whereby old leaves had less negative δ13c values than young leaves this could be an effect of ageing as has been reported for other plants dercon et al 2006 however in our case the leaves differed only about ten days in age and the first five leaves of a banana plant are equally photosynthetically active eckstein et al 1995 moreover during their growth young banana leaves are presumed to receive carbon from older leaves assuming that only a small portion of the carbon in a leaf consists of recently assimilated sugars δ13c values thus give information on the environmental conditions at the time of leaf development rather than about its current conditions in this experiment younger leaves formed later in the season when the dry season was more pronounced as can be seen in fig 3 possibly explaining why they systematically expressed less negative δ13c values nonetheless there is also a difference in leaves in the irrigated treatment it is possible that there were stomatal limitations in the irrigated treatment as well considering the slight decrease in vwc that occurred in july 2019 fig 3 to figure out whether the difference is a result of a different water history or whether there is a systematic effect of leaf age further research is required 4 4 sampling approach for δ13c analysis to date no banana tailored sampling method for δ13c exists possibly due to the large size making it impractical to sample entire banana leaves as is often done in other crops aside from determining which part of the leaf to sample it is essential to optimize the number of samples on one hand a sample size should be large enough to obtain a sufficient statistical power on the other hand measurements can be costly and labor intensive we found that there is variation in δ13c within the leaf both in the vertical and horizontal direction but mostly in the horizontal direction table 2 analysis revealed that four punctured samples of the leaf are adequate to cover this variation considering maximal variance in the horizontal direction we suggest to take two samples on both sides of the midrib centrally along the width of the leaf alternatively a composite strip of leaf could be taken on both sides of the midrib as is typically done for nutrient analysis 4 5 the potential of leaf temperature and dans for drought stress evaluation our experiment revealed that leaf temperature based indices have a strong potential to detect drought stress in banana we found that the temperature of rainfed plants in the dry season was on average 7 c above the temperature of irrigated plants during the afternoon as well as above the ambient temperature fig 6 this is in agreement with earlier findings that stomatal closure due to drought stress is typically most pronounced in the afternoon ekanayake et al 1994 robinson and bower 1987 individual plants were up to 20 c warmer than the non stressed reference fig 8 these differences are larger than so far reported kallarackal et al 1990 only reported that the temperature of non stressed plants was below ambient temperature while the temperature of water stressed plants did not significantly differ from the ambient temperature this led them to believe that leaf temperature was not a good proxy for drought stress their research was however conducted with a small sample size under greenhouse conditions robinson and bower 1988 found that leaf temperature was equal or slightly above ambient temperature under normal conditions and 3 4 c higher during stressed winter or summer days in this case stress was purely driven by a strong evaporative demand in our experiment the rainfed treatment suffered from both high evaporative demand and low soil water availability this resulted in more severe drought stress and explains why we found larger differences in leaf temperature this is in correspondence with taylor and sexton 1972 who measured the range in leaf temperature during wet and dry season which on average measured 6 c an argument often raised against using leaf temperature as a proxy for drought stress is its dependence on the environment we however found that in the afternoon the leaf temperature in rainfed plants increased independently from the environment all banana plants warmed up during the day but the increase in temperature in rainfed plants was much steeper than in non stressed plants tmin fig 6 in addition the dans values in rainfed plants were a lot more extreme than in irrigated plants fig 8 finally it should be noted that the high temperatures in rainfed plant leaves are in particular remarkable considering their more pronounced folding behavior in order to avoid interception of direct sunlight stevens et al 2020 therefore we can conclude that the increase in temperature in the afternoon is largely due to stomatal closure in response to water deficit and can thus be considered a proxy for drought stress for comparison over time and space it remains necessary though to normalize leaf temperature to exclude the effect of the local environment we opted for the calculation of dans because it is simple easily interpretable and does not require additional data we are aware that dans requires the presence of a non stressed baseline which might be not be feasible or desirable in every research context or for on farm applications its simplicity could however be vital for its widespread adoption finally in comparison to other stress measurement methods leaf temperature is straightforward and easy to measure currently more commonly used methods for drought stress evaluation such as measuring stomatal conductance or leaf water potential are expensive complicated and time consuming our results showed a large degree of plant to plant variability in the field fig 8 under such conditions those methods do not come in handy our approach using a handheld infrared thermometer allows for rapid data collection resulting in a large dataset we measured the temperature of 40 mats in one hour 2 plants per mat moreover the low investment cost ours had a cost of 200 but alternatives are available from 40 onwards of this technology is a major benefit for research and farm management in the global south the limited precision 1 c of the low cost system is a downside but the large differences in leaf temperatures we measured ensure adequate detection with a handheld infrared thermometer furthermore this opens the door to the use of thermal cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles uav s for detecting drought stress in banana plantations we believe using infrared thermometry to detect drought stress is highly suitable for in field research and field operational purposes 4 6 leaf temperature measurement strategy leaf temperature on the right and left side of the midrib were significantly different from each other although the trend was opposite in the morning and afternoon fig 7 this difference between morning and afternoon can be explained by the sampling strategy and banana leaf structure south oriented leaves were sampled since banana actively folds its leaves in order to prevent direct sun interception stevens et al 2020 the eastern or left side of the leaf receives more direct light during the morning while in the afternoon the opposite is the case consequently temperature is higher on the left side of the midrib in the morning and on the right side in the afternoon it becomes clear that temperature around noon when the sun is at its highest point is equal on both sides this effect is not so obvious in daughter plants which are not as much exposed to direct sunlight to account for this variability in the leaf we suggest to always measure temperature on both sides of the midrib 4 7 the drivers behind instantaneous drought stress our research revealed that instantaneous stress estimated through dans is driven by solar radiation intensity wind speed vpd and soil volumetric water content but also depends on the plant stage mother or daughter plant table 4 the strong effect of vwc confirms the validity of dans as a measure for drought stress on the other hand it becomes clear that the micro environment plays an important role in instantaneous drought stress at the plant or even leaf level drought stress and dans are most pronounced under maximal solar radiation intensity and vpd and in the absence of wind as such those are the optimal conditions for measurement we found that when dans is maximal the variation in dans is also at a maximum fig 8 in addition temperature varies within a leaf due to leaf orientation fig 7 there is clearly heterogeneity in the field as well as within the plant nonetheless to obtain homogenous results most authors in the past have opted for measuring leaf temperature of fully sun exposed leaves eckstein et al 1995 kallarackal et al 1990 robinson and bower 1988 however the micro environment including light is a direct driver for stress excluding this effect might thus lead to erroneous conclusions about the stress level of a plant or field we instead suggest measuring a specific leaf in every plant that is orientated in the same wind direction whether it is partly shaded or not this is an objective approach and will provide correct information on the stress level in a field it also leads to more heterogeneous data as seen in our case but our sample size was large enough to overcome this this again makes the case for the use of a commercially available handheld infrared thermometer that allows for the collection of a large dataset in a short time 4 8 comparing δ13c and dans in this study we showed that δ13c and dans are good proxies for drought stress in banana both are based on the principle of stomatal closure and they correlate well fig 9 nonetheless their relation to drought stress is slightly different and this also impacts their potential application firstly the δ13c values represent a time scale of months whereas dans changes over a course of minutes this implies that dans might work better as an early predictor for drought stress than δ13c on the other hand δ13c is stable both within and between plants fig 5 table 2 while the variation in dans is large fig 8 this implies stable isotope analysis requires less plants for sampling then dans or leaf temperature the instantaneous nature of leaf temperature data allows to readily understand a situation allowing for a fast irrigation response isotope analysis on the other hand takes time and comes with a cost considering these facts we suggest that dans could be of use for a quick in field evaluation of drought stress to evaluate the robustness of different varieties under progressive stress and to manage irrigation δ13c on the other hand has the potential to deliver accurate quantitative data on a long term stress response for variety screening or the evaluation of management practices 5 conclusions stable carbon isotope analysis and leaf temperature based methods show strong potential for drought stress evaluation in banana under field conditions both δ13c and leaf temperature are strongly affected by changes in soil volumetric water content and clear differences can be observed between well watered and drought stressed plants drought stress is however not uniformly distributed in the banana mat both proxies indicate that daughter plants are less stressed than mother plants although interpretation of the δ13c values is complicated by the internal carbon exchange processes in the banana mat further research should aim to understand and quantify the water and carbon dynamics in a banana mat under stressed and normal conditions in addition δ13c values vary within a leaf in this research pragmatic approaches were developed for dealing with this variability to obtain samples which give a representative idea of the plants stress status four punch samples or one composite strip of leaf is recommended to be taken alongside the central part of the leaf whereas δ13c is a time integrated measure leaf temperature and dans degrees above non stressed canopy index give an indication of instantaneous stress dans is maximal when vpd and solar radiation are maximal and in the absence of wind this is the optimal time for stress detection temperature does not differ between abaxial and adaxial side of the leaf but should be measured on both left and right side of the midrib with increasing dans its variation increases as well this indicates the need for a large number of replicates especially under stressed conditions the large number of required measurements can easily be handled by low cost infrared thermometry however as dans can be mainly used in an irrigation set up where optimally watered plants are available as a reference the potential of alternative

9771,drought stress is a major limiting factor for banana production and the incidence of drought spells is expected to increase with climate change climate smart practices and varieties are needed but evaluation in the field is hampered by a lack of reliable physiological drought stress indicators we investigated the potential of using stable carbon isotope ratios δ13c and leaf temperature and its derived dans degrees above non stressed canopy index as proxies for drought stress in banana leaf samples were taken for δ13c analysis and leaf temperature was monitored throughout the day in a field trial with different banana plant stages mother and daughter plants under two irrigation treatments rainfed and irrigated during the dry season in arusha tanzania we found that δ13c leaf temperature and dans were highly sensitive proxies for drought stress in banana soil volumetric water content had a significant effect on both δ13c values and dans there was a significant difference in δ13c 1 5 0 1 p 0 01 and afternoon leaf temperature 7 1 c p 0 01 between the rainfed and irrigated treatment to deal with variability in δ13c within the leaf we developed a banana tailored sampling method this study also revealed the complexity of carbon isotope dynamics in the intertwined system of mother and daughter plants daughter plants had more negative δ13c values 1 9 0 1 p 0 01 and lower temperatures 4 1 c than mother plants this indicates less stress but interpretation of the δ13c ratio is complicated by the potential carbon flux from mother to daughter plant once we have a full understanding of these complexities within the plant the δ13c and leaf temperature based methods we developed can be directly implemented for both mother and daughter plants under various field conditions keywords canopy temperature carbon 13 infrared thermometry musa sampling methods water stress 1 introduction about 150 million tonnes of banana are produced per year mostly in asia africa and south and central america fao 2018 the unavailability of water is probably the most important abiotic constraint to banana production worldwide turner 1995 drought stress in banana has been reported in various geographic regions and climate change predictions indicate an increasing demand but uncertain supply of water adhikari et al 2015 calberto et al 2015 machovina and feeley 2013 ramirez et al 2011 in east africa in particular the livelihood of millions of people is expected to be impacted by changing weather conditions banana serves as a daily staple and is typically cultivated by smallholder farmers in rainfed systems adhikari et al 2015 gambart et al 2020 temperature in east africa is predicted to increase by 1 4 5 5 c by the end of the century adhikari et al 2015 increasing temperature can benefit banana production by making growth conditions in the subtropics and highlands more favorable but also leads to an increased water demand calberto et al 2015 varma and bebber 2019 over the last 37 years rainfall has increased in certain parts of the region and decreased in others muthoni et al 2019 in most east african countries an increase in annual rainfall between 5 and 15 is expected by 2090 adhikari et al 2015 however intra seasonal heterogeneity has been increasing and is expected to continue doing so drought is already the most limiting factor for banana production carr 2009 van asten et al 2010 rising temperatures together with increasingly variable and unpredictable rainfall will irrevocably aggravate the problem adhikari et al 2015 muthoni et al 2019 the need for climate smart varieties and management practices becomes only more urgent drought stress in agriculture is defined as a shortage of water in the root zone leading to reduced plant yields salekdeh et al 2009 in the last two decades most research on drought stress in banana has been carried out at the molecular level or under controlled conditions progress has been made in the identification of genes and pathways associated with drought tolerance traits whereby drought tolerance is defined as the ability to sustain growth or yield despite the occurrence of drought brown et al 2020 muthusamy et al 2016 souza santos et al 2018 van wesemael et al 2019 however the major barrier to the selection of climate smart varieties are the complications associated with phenotyping under field conditions a number of phenotypical drought associated traits in banana have been identified but the majority is only usable under greenhouse or screenhouse conditions brown et al 2020 methods have been developed for measuring leaf turgor pressure and sap flow where the first was found to be affected by absence of irrigation and the second to be correlated with soil water availability lu et al 2002 zimmermann et al 2010 however neither has been employed to identify drought stress in the field as such field evaluation faces a lot of practical challenges banana has a long growth cycle 12 20 months its growth is not seasonal and not synchronized within a field and it has an inconveniently large size brown et al 2020 typically field trials evaluate growth and or yield as a measure for stress but this is time and labor intensive easily applicable and affordable methods for stress evaluation or phenotyping under field conditions are missing brown et al 2020 carr 2009 turner et al 2007 stable carbon isotope analysis could be such a method farquhar et al 1982 described how during photosynthesis c3 plants discriminate against the heavier 13c atom the extent of this discrimination in c3 plants mainly depends on stomatal opening when drought stress occurs stomatal closure is initiated leading to a reduction in discrimination the ratio of 13c to 12c under stressed conditions will thus be higher than under optimal conditions this ratio is typically compared to the ratio of the international v pdb standard i e limestone from the pee dee formation in south carolina and expressed as δ13c whereby 1 δ 13 c sample 13 c 12 c sample 13 c 12 c standard 13 c 12 c standard 1000 measuring the δ13c values of plant material has become one of the standard methods for the evaluation of drought stress or water use efficiency in particular in trees and cereals gao et al 2018 jákli et al 2016 seibt et al 2008 tree ring or whole leaf samples are taken from plants under different treatments or at different moments in time to compare the plants response to un availability of water so far stable carbon isotope analysis on banana has to our knowledge only been done in three instances and only once with the purpose of evaluating drought stress israeli et al 1996 kissel et al 2015 zhenyu et al 2020 kissel et al 2015 screened different banana genotypes in terms of transpiration efficiency and included δ13c analysis in their research they found a strong correlation between δ13c and transpiration efficiency although only under water deficient conditions they attributed the lack of an overall correlation to the fact that δ13c is a measure for co2 exchange whereas transpiration efficiency considers whole plant carbon accumulation this is in accordance with the conclusions of seibt et al 2008 namely that δ13c cannot be directly linked to transpiration or whole plant water use efficiency wue rather it is a proxy measure of stomatal closure and its driving environmental factors among which drought is one one of the reasons for the limited use of stable carbon isotope fractionation in banana might be the specific nature of this plant banana is a semi perennial crop that reproduces vegetatively through the formation of suckers or daughter plants therefore a banana plant cannot be seen as a mere individual but rather as an integrated whole of mother and daughter plants called a mat in addition banana leaves are formed in the underground corm develop rolled up in the pseudostem to eventually emerge almost fully completed barker 1969 while the leaves are inside they serve as a carbon sink the carbon in their tissue originates from other photosynthetically active leaves hence these non emerged leaves are heterotrophic once the leaves emerge they become autotrophic this unusual plant structure and leaf development complicate sampling and might affect δ13c ratios zhenyu et al 2020 indeed described a large variation in δ13c within the leaf 0 5 because of this sequential development from the heterotrophic to the autotrophic stage besides stable carbon isotope analysis leaf temperature can be used as a proxy for drought stress in plants plants heat up during the day because of increasing temperature and solar radiation as a mechanism to prevent overheating part of the energy is released again as latent heat through transpiration plants under drought stress will close their stomata to prevent transpiration consequently a drought stressed plant will have a higher temperature than a non stressed plant nanda et al 2018 leaf temperature based methods have successfully been used among others in maize dejonge et al 2015 wheat alderfasi and nielsen 2001 and fruit trees ngao et al 2017 in the seventies and eighties of last century several authors also included leaf temperature measurements in their assessment of photosynthetic parameters of banana under drought stress kallarackal et al 1990 robinson and bower 1987 taylor and sexton 1972 they confirmed there was a difference between stressed and non stressed plants yet often small none of them considered leaf temperature as a practical proxy for drought stress however technology has progressed since infrared thermometry strongly facilitates leaf temperature measurement allowing for faster and more accurate data collection than the thermocouples previously used yu et al 2015 dong et al 2012 successfully used an infrared camera to identify the presence of drought stress in banana plants as a consequence of fusarium infection uwimana et al 2021 found differences in leaf temperature between drought stressed and non stressed plants although not of a significant nature in this research we evaluated the use of 1 δ13c and 2 leaf temperature as proxies for drought stress in banana we investigated stable carbon isotope dynamics in field grown banana plants mother and daughter plants under two watering treatments in addition we investigated the drivers of the δ13c signal and proposed a suitable sampling method leaf temperature was monitored throughout the day in both treatments and its derived index dans degrees above non stressed canopy was evaluated as a proxy for drought stress finally we investigated the environmental drivers behind dans and proposed a measurement approach tailored to banana 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental

for two contrasting varieties i e east african highland huti green musa aa mchare subgroup and grand nain musa aaa cavendish subgroup stevens et al 2020 the first variety was planted in may 2017 and the latter one in november 2017 at time of data collection the banana mats in the field were mostly of the second generation and usually consisted of two generations a mother plant and a single daughter plant some mother plants were flowering while others were still growing vegetatively here we refer to banana mats that merely consist of a vegetatively growing mother plant as v to mats consisting of a mother plant with a daughter plant as vd and finally to a flowering fruiting mother plant with a daughter plant as fd fig 2 all mats in the field received optimal irrigation until four months after planting from then on both varieties underwent two watering treatments in a non randomized blocked design the treatments were rainfed and irrigated for the irrigated treatment plants were irrigated once a day if more than 25 of the total available water taw was depleted in the first 0 30 cm or second 30 60 cm horizon which was the case nearly every day during the dry season rainfed plants were exceptionally irrigated when there were indications of extreme stress like wilting leaves the irrigation system used was drip irrigation with two irrigation lines for every banana row the grand nain variety was distributed over four blocks whereby a block consisted of five rows of 15 mats both treatments rainfed and irrigated were applied once in every block resulting in eight treatment plots the mchare variety was distributed over two blocks the rainfed treatment was replicated three times in the first block and the irrigated treatment three times in the second block

constant and sufficient vwc throughout the year the measurements and sampling took place at times where water deficit in the rainfed treatment was most severe 2 4 stable carbon isotopes 2 4 1 leaf sampling strategy leaf sampling for δ13c analysis took place during the dry season between 23 and 30 july 2019 fig 3 samples were taken from vegetatively growing mother plants v mats and vegetatively growing mother and daughter plant pairs vd mats in both varieties in addition samples were taken from grand nain daughter plants in mats with a flowering fruiting mother plant fd plants were randomly selected in the different blocks in every plant two photosynthetically active consecutive leaves were sampled the youngest of both leaves was referred to as young and the other one as old in case of irrigated grand nain the third and fourth fully open leaves were sampled while in mchare and rainfed grand nain the second and third fully open leaves were sampled this was done to account for the larger growth speed of irrigated grand nain as the aim was to sample leaves of a similar age samples were taken with a small metal auger resulting in circular perforations of 1 cm2 fig 4a to assess the variability in δ13c within the leaf and to determine the optimal sampling position s samples were taken according to a predetermined pattern in mother plants ten samples were taken five on every side of the midrib fig 4b the pattern was designed in such a way to assess the variability in both vertical and horizontal direction through repeated measures anova analysis in daughter plants six samples were taken varying only in vertical direction 2 4 2 δ13c analysis samples were oven dried at 70 c for 72 h and prepared for transport in the laboratories of nm aist δ13c analysis was done with an elemental analyzer vario isotope select elementar langenselbold germany coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms isoprime 100 elementar at the soil and water management and crop nutrition laboratory of the joint fao iaea centre of nuclear techniques in food and agriculture in seibersdorf austria the irms measurements were normalized using in house standards sf1 sugar beet standard with a δ13c ratio of 26 07 and ss1 sugar cane standard with a δ13c ratio of 10 95 these lab standards were calibrated against respectively iaea ch 6 10 449 0 033 and iaea ch 7 32 151 0 050 2 4 3 determining optimal sample size in this research we aimed to determine the optimal number of samples per plant to obtain a correct and precise estimate of the δ13c value of that plant the larger the number of samples per plant the more precise the estimate becomes and the smaller its variance σ2 plant we consider the precision high enough when it is possible to differentiate the δ13c value of individual plants this implies that the number of samples is large enough when the within plant variance σ2 plant is smaller than the between plant or population variance σ2 pop to determine the optimal sample size we created 4000 subsets of our obtained dataset these subsets consisted of random combinations of two to nine randomly selected samples from every leaf from mother plants only for every subset a linear mixed model was built with δ13c as the dependent variable volumetric water content mat stage and variety as fixed effects and block and plant as random effects from this model the variance of the random plant effect was obtained being the between plant variance s2 pop in comparison the mean of the variance within every individual plant was calculated s2 plant s2 plant and s2 pop were compared to each other through a one tailed paired t test the optimal number of samples per plant was then determined as the number for which s2 plant was significantly smaller than s2 pop 2 4 4 regression approach to understand which factors drive the variability in δ13c in banana leaves we created a model with δ13c as dependent variable we built the model with a dataset of 780 observations from mother and daughter plants the observations in our dataset were grouped at different levels and were therefore not independent firstly the experiment had a blocked design secondly a mat could consist of two plants thirdly several leaves per plant were sampled and finally multiple samples per leaf were taken data within a group share a residual covariance we used a linear mixed model approach to account for this nested group structure volumetric water content vwc variety mat stage plant stage and leaf age were tested as fixed effects and block mat plant mat growth stage and leaf mat growth stage leaf age as random effects vwc data were averaged over two months prior to leaf sampling based on the growth rate of the leaves this period was deemed to have been of influence for the sampled leaves interaction effects were retained at a significance level of α 0 05 flowering mats were excluded from the regression analysis as these were only present in grand nain 2 5 leaf temperature 2 5 1 measurement leaf temperature was measured with a handheld infrared thermometer bosch gis 1000c 1 c every two hours between 09 00 and 17 00 measurements took place on 8 august 2019 and 18 and 20 february 2020 fig 3 twenty vd grand nain mats from both watering treatments were selected five in every block both mother and daughter plants were included in every plant the most south facing leaf of the second to fifth fully emerged leaves was identified and measured stavrinides et al 2010 the effect of solar angle was presumed to be larger than the effect of leaf age hence this strategy both the left and right side of the midrib were measured and then averaged on february 20 data were collected from both abaxial lower and adaxial upper side of the leaf this was done to estimate the effect of leaf side on the temperature on other days only the adaxial side was measured 2 5 2 calculation of degrees above non stressed canopy dans index leaf temperature is strongly dependent on the plant s micro environment this complicates its interpretation as a measure for drought stress therefore it is recommended to normalize leaf temperature data dejonge et al 2015 nanda et al 2018 a simple and straightforward way to do so is by calculating the temperature stress day tsd or degrees above non stressed canopy dans index which is the difference between a stressed and non stressed crop at the same place and time clawson and blad 1982 dejonge et al 2015 in contrast to other methods no information besides leaf temperature is needed in this research we used the minimal temperature measured in the irrigated treatment as a non stressed reference level this minimum was obtained at every time of measurement for mother and daughter plants separately 2 5 3 regression approach to understand the driving factors of changes in dans throughout the day we created a model with a combination of weather variables and plant soil factors the model was built with a total of 790 observations obtained in august 2019 and february 2020 dans values were averages per plant meaning the average of left and right side of the midrib was used in accordance to our approach estimating the δ13c values we used a mixed model a logarithmic transformation was applied to normalize the strongly skewed dans data to avoid issues of collinearity we excluded several weather variables prior to model building solar radiation w m2 wind velocity m s and vpd kpa were withheld in addition to these growth stage and soil volumetric water content vwc cm³ cm³ were included as fixed terms and plant and mat as random effects interaction effects were retained at a significance level of α 0 05 2 6 statistical software used all analyses were done in r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 except the modeling of δ13c and dans which was done in jmp software sas institute inc 2019 all plots were made with the ggplot2 package for r wickham 2016 3 results 3 1 the effect of drought on δ13c in different varieties mat and plant stages the effect of the watering treatments on the δ13c values was significant for both studied banana varieties p 0 05 rainfed plants had δ13c values of on average 25 7 0 1 and irrigated plants of 27 2 0 1 fig 5 this implies rainfed plants experienced more stomatal limitations than irrigated plants due to water deficiency in mats consisting of a mother and daughter plant vd daughter plants had more negative δ13c values than mother plants with a significant difference of 1 9 0 1 p 0 01 the difference was most pronounced in grand nain 2 4 0 3 p 0 01 the effect of mat stage was found to be variety dependent in grand nain mother plants with a daughter plant vd had less negative δ13c values than mother plants without a daughter plant v although this difference was not significant in the rainfed treatment p 0 23 in mchare we observed the opposite vd mother plants had a more negative δ13c than v mother plants this difference was however not significant in the irrigated treatment p 0 25 daughter plants from flowering fruiting plants fd were only sampled in grand nain as mchare plants were not flowering at time of sampling rainfed fd daughter plants had δ13c values similar to rainfed vd daughter plants irrigated fd daughter plants however had less negative δ13c values than irrigated vd daughter plants indicating less stress p 0 05 3 2 variability of δ13c in the leaf the effect of sampling position in the banana leaf on the δ13c values was significant both when varying in vertical and horizontal direction p 0 01 table 2 δ13c became more negative towards the outer side of the leaf outer and further away from the pseudostem upper the difference in the horizontal direction was significantly larger than in the vertical direction p 0 01 we calculated the minimal number of samples per plant as the number of samples for which the condition s2 plant s2 pop would be fulfilled one sample per leaf already results in an average s2 plant which is significantly smaller than s2 pop p 0 01 however for 8 of the subsets of our data s2 plant was not smaller than s2 pop datasets with four samples per plant fulfilled the condition in 100 of the cases making this a safer sample size 3 3 driving factors of δ13c leaf age plant stage and soil volumetric water content vwc had a significant effect on δ13c in banana leaves table 3 old leaves systematically had a more negative δ13c than young leaves implying less stomatal closure and thus likely less drought stress at the time of leaf formation variety and mat stage were not significant but their interaction was as well as the interaction between variety and plant stage most of the variance in δ13c which was not explained by the fixed effects could be ascribed to the plant level implying differences from plant to plant were larger than between blocks mats or leaves 3 4 effect of drought on the diurnal leaf temperature profile of mother and daughter plants our measurements during the dry season revealed that there was a diurnal trend in banana leaf temperature fig 6a leaves warmed up until a maximum in the afternoon at 15 00 after which they cooled down again this maximum seems to correspond to a maximum in solar radiation intensity fig 6b however the maximum in vpd and ambient temperature occurred later at 16 00 there was significant variation in leaf temperature in the different watering treatments and plant stages rainfed plants heated up more than irrigated plants at the maximum at 15 00 rainfed mother plants were on average 7 1 c warmer than irrigated mother plants p 0 01 the difference between daughter plants was smaller with an average of 4 1 c p 0 01 within both watering treatments the difference between mother and daughter plants was significant as well p 0 01 in the rainfed treatment there was an average difference between the plant stages of 6 1 c while under irrigation the difference was 2 1 c at other times of the day not all treatments and plant stages were significantly different from each other the rate of increase in temperature towards the afternoon was smaller for tmin than for the treatment averages trainfed and tirrigated the slope of tirrigated remained identical to tmin until 13 00 but then increased while the slope of trainfed already increased from the morning onwards tmin was below the ambient temperature at all times and was not significantly different in mother and daughter plants p 0 71 3 5 temperature variability within the leaf the difference in temperature between the abaxial and adaxial side of the leaf was not significantly different from zero p 0 09 fig 7 leaf temperature on the left and right side of the midrib were significantly different from each other p 0 01 the difference was on average 0 5 c which is less than the measurement accuracy 1 c however there was diurnal variation in this difference during the morning temperatures were higher on the left side of the midrib while in the afternoon we observed higher temperatures on the right side fig 7 this translated into an average absolute difference between left and right side of the midrib of 2 1 c the average absolute difference in mother plants was 3 1 c and in rainfed mother plants went up to 7 1 c at 11 00 3 6 variation in dans like leaf temperature dans increased towards a maximum at 15 00 especially in rainfed mother plants fig 8 the difference between both treatments especially towards the afternoon is more pronounced in dans than in leaf temperature per se there was a strong correlation between average dans at a certain time and its variance r2 0 84 implying higher average dans values came with a larger range in measurements 3 7 driving factors of dans all variables included in the model explaining dans were significant table 4 solar radiation intensity and vpd increased dans whilst wind speed and vwc decreased dans daughter plants generally had a lower dans than mother plants to compare the size of those effects they should be rescaled every effect has a different range and the model estimates the logarithm of dans considering the difference in dans for the minimum and maximum of every parameter table 1 the effects were largest for solar radiation vwc and wind speed the difference between the minimum and maximum of their range results in a change of about 4 c in dans the effect of vpd was slightly lower with a difference of only 2 c plant stage finally had an effect of 1 c three interaction terms were found to be significant as well their effect being less than 1 c the contribution of the random effects to the unexplained variance was relatively small 3 8 correlation between δ13c and dans δ13c and dans are both proxies for drought stress although at a different time scale δ13c of a plant leaf is a time integrated measure while dans represents the current level of stress nonetheless we found a strong correlation between δ13c and dans averaged per plot fig 9 p 0 01 the plots are clustered along the trendline according to plant stage and treatment only irrigated mother plants are located below the line having a lower dans than their δ13c would suggest 4 discussion 4 1 δ13c is a highly sensitive proxy for drought stress in banana rainfed plants had δ13c values on average 1 6 less negative than irrigated plants while drought stress in the rainfed treatment was not attempted to be ascertained by a physiological measurement several indications point indeed to its extreme likelihood firstly reference crop evapotranspiration eto as well as eto 2 exceeded rainfall fig 1 secondly soil volumetric water content vwc measurements indicated severe moisture deficiencies in the rainfed plots often reaching the pwp whereas such did not occur in the irrigated plots fig 3 we can thus conclude that the difference in δ13c can be ascribed to drought stress and as such that δ13c can be used as a proxy for drought stress in banana plants moreover the effect of volumetric water content vwc on δ13c was highly significant table 3 the parameter estimate of 8 indicates that a change in soil volumetric water content of 0 1 would result in a difference in δ13c of 0 8 assuming other factors of influence remain the same the measurement error for δ13c analysis in an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms is around 0 12 this would correspond to a difference in soil volumetric water content of 0 015 in other words differences in vwc as small as 0 015 can be detected with stable carbon isotope analysis it is therefore a highly sensitive method for drought stress detection and quantification in banana 4 2 drought stress distribution in a banana mat we found that both in grand nain and mchare varieties daughter plants experienced less drought stress than mother plants fig 5 table 3 the mat has a shared root system so this cannot be linked to a difference in water availability however daughter plants mostly grow below the canopy where they receive less direct sunlight than mother plants light intensity alters δ13c in two ways firstly more light leads to a higher rate of photosynthesis and therefore a higher water demand lambers et al 2008 in a water limited environment the plant will rapidly close its stomata and δ13c values will be less negative than in a shaded environment secondly a higher photosynthetic activity results in a depletion in co2 inside the stomata and therefore a decrease in carbon discrimination cernusak et al 2013 israeli et al 1996 showed that this light effect also occurs in banana plants be it in mother plants finally light intensity also increases the water demand of a plant indirectly as it coincides with an increase in air temperature and eventually vpd in addition to the light effect it is possible that water is preferentially allocated to daughter plants as a survival mechanism young daughter plants typically act as sinks in a banana mat they receive photo assimilates from the photosynthetically more active mother plant in grand nain in particular suckers are strongly dependent on the mother plant dens et al 2015 dorel et al 2016 our results indicate that suckers are not only sinks for carbon but also for water there is no previous research to confirm this furthermore the fact that daughter plants are carbon sinks complicates the interpretation of their δ13c values some of the carbon in a sucker is generated autotrophically through photosynthesis of its own leaves while other carbon originates from the mother plant we do however not know these carbon flux rates which might vary with variety and age of the sucker and the flowering state of the mother plant consequently we cannot draw clear conclusions on the stress level of a banana daughter plant based on its δ13c values as we do not know the origin of this carbon hence it becomes clear that we need a better understanding of the carbon and water dynamics within a banana mat if we want to use carbon isotope discrimination as a measure for stress in daughter plants the mat stage had a significant effect on δ13c but interacted with variety fig 5 table 3 in grand nain mother plants with a daughter plant vd were slightly more stressed than vegetatively growing mother plants v this can be explained by the presence of an extra sink the sucker the same effect could be seen in irrigated flowering fruiting mats fd the presence of an additional sink namely a banana bunch or a flower creates competition for water and therefore more stress for the fd daughter plant in mchare the mat stage effect was different from grand nain vd mats were less stressed than v mats at least in the rainfed treatment this might indicate that mchare suckers are less dependent from the mother plant than grand nain which is supported by the smaller difference in δ13c between mother and daughter plant in mchare in addition vd mats are in a further developmental stage than v mats and as a consequence have a larger root system karamura et al 2011 it could be that the effect of the more developed vd root system compensates for the additional sink and that therefore mchare vd mats are slightly less stressed than v mats however it is difficult to draw conclusions on differences between grand nain and mchare as they were not established at the same time and because planting density might have been suboptimal for mchare 4 3 δ13c in different leaves a timeline for water availability leaf age had a significant effect on δ13c whereby old leaves had less negative δ13c values than young leaves this could be an effect of ageing as has been reported for other plants dercon et al 2006 however in our case the leaves differed only about ten days in age and the first five leaves of a banana plant are equally photosynthetically active eckstein et al 1995 moreover during their growth young banana leaves are presumed to receive carbon from older leaves assuming that only a small portion of the carbon in a leaf consists of recently assimilated sugars δ13c values thus give information on the environmental conditions at the time of leaf development rather than about its current conditions in this experiment younger leaves formed later in the season when the dry season was more pronounced as can be seen in fig 3 possibly explaining why they systematically expressed less negative δ13c values nonetheless there is also a difference in leaves in the irrigated treatment it is possible that there were stomatal limitations in the irrigated treatment as well considering the slight decrease in vwc that occurred in july 2019 fig 3 to figure out whether the difference is a result of a different water history or whether there is a systematic effect of leaf age further research is required 4 4 sampling approach for δ13c analysis to date no banana tailored sampling method for δ13c exists possibly due to the large size making it impractical to sample entire banana leaves as is often done in other crops aside from determining which part of the leaf to sample it is essential to optimize the number of samples on one hand a sample size should be large enough to obtain a sufficient statistical power on the other hand measurements can be costly and labor intensive we found that there is variation in δ13c within the leaf both in the vertical and horizontal direction but mostly in the horizontal direction table 2 analysis revealed that four punctured samples of the leaf are adequate to cover this variation considering maximal variance in the horizontal direction we suggest to take two samples on both sides of the midrib centrally along the width of the leaf alternatively a composite strip of leaf could be taken on both sides of the midrib as is typically done for nutrient analysis 4 5 the potential of leaf temperature and dans for drought stress evaluation our experiment revealed that leaf temperature based indices have a strong potential to detect drought stress in banana we found that the temperature of rainfed plants in the dry season was on average 7 c above the temperature of irrigated plants during the afternoon as well as above the ambient temperature fig 6 this is in agreement with earlier findings that stomatal closure due to drought stress is typically most pronounced in the afternoon ekanayake et al 1994 robinson and bower 1987 individual plants were up to 20 c warmer than the non stressed reference fig 8 these differences are larger than so far reported kallarackal et al 1990 only reported that the temperature of non stressed plants was below ambient temperature while the temperature of water stressed plants did not significantly differ from the ambient temperature this led them to believe that leaf temperature was not a good proxy for drought stress their research was however conducted with a small sample size under greenhouse conditions robinson and bower 1988 found that leaf temperature was equal or slightly above ambient temperature under normal conditions and 3 4 c higher during stressed winter or summer days in this case stress was purely driven by a strong evaporative demand in our experiment the rainfed treatment suffered from both high evaporative demand and low soil water availability this resulted in more severe drought stress and explains why we found larger differences in leaf temperature this is in correspondence with taylor and sexton 1972 who measured the range in leaf temperature during wet and dry season which on average measured 6 c an argument often raised against using leaf temperature as a proxy for drought stress is its dependence on the environment we however found that in the afternoon the leaf temperature in rainfed plants increased independently from the environment all banana plants warmed up during the day but the increase in temperature in rainfed plants was much steeper than in non stressed plants tmin fig 6 in addition the dans values in rainfed plants were a lot more extreme than in irrigated plants fig 8 finally it should be noted that the high temperatures in rainfed plant leaves are in particular remarkable considering their more pronounced folding behavior in order to avoid interception of direct sunlight stevens et al 2020 therefore we can conclude that the increase in temperature in the afternoon is largely due to stomatal closure in response to water deficit and can thus be considered a proxy for drought stress for comparison over time and space it remains necessary though to normalize leaf temperature to exclude the effect of the local environment we opted for the calculation of dans because it is simple easily interpretable and does not require additional data we are aware that dans requires the presence of a non stressed baseline which might be not be feasible or desirable in every research context or for on farm applications its simplicity could however be vital for its widespread adoption finally in comparison to other stress measurement methods leaf temperature is straightforward and easy to measure currently more commonly used methods for drought stress evaluation such as measuring stomatal conductance or leaf water potential are expensive complicated and time consuming our results showed a large degree of plant to plant variability in the field fig 8 under such conditions those methods do not come in handy our approach using a handheld infrared thermometer allows for rapid data collection resulting in a large dataset we measured the temperature of 40 mats in one hour 2 plants per mat moreover the low investment cost ours had a cost of 200 but alternatives are available from 40 onwards of this technology is a major benefit for research and farm management in the global south the limited precision 1 c of the low cost system is a downside but the large differences in leaf temperatures we measured ensure adequate detection with a handheld infrared thermometer furthermore this opens the door to the use of thermal cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles uav s for detecting drought stress in banana plantations we believe using infrared thermometry to detect drought stress is highly suitable for in field research and field operational purposes 4 6 leaf temperature measurement strategy leaf temperature on the right and left side of the midrib were significantly different from each other although the trend was opposite in the morning and afternoon fig 7 this difference between morning and afternoon can be explained by the sampling strategy and banana leaf structure south oriented leaves were sampled since banana actively folds its leaves in order to prevent direct sun interception stevens et al 2020 the eastern or left side of the leaf receives more direct light during the morning while in the afternoon the opposite is the case consequently temperature is higher on the left side of the midrib in the morning and on the right side in the afternoon it becomes clear that temperature around noon when the sun is at its highest point is equal on both sides this effect is not so obvious in daughter plants which are not as much exposed to direct sunlight to account for this variability in the leaf we suggest to always measure temperature on both sides of the midrib 4 7 the drivers behind instantaneous drought stress our research revealed that instantaneous stress estimated through dans is driven by solar radiation intensity wind speed vpd and soil volumetric water content but also depends on the plant stage mother or daughter plant table 4 the strong effect of vwc confirms the validity of dans as a measure for drought stress on the other hand it becomes clear that the micro environment plays an important role in instantaneous drought stress at the plant or even leaf level drought stress and dans are most pronounced under maximal solar radiation intensity and vpd and in the absence of wind as such those are the optimal conditions for measurement we found that when dans is maximal the variation in dans is also at a maximum fig 8 in addition temperature varies within a leaf due to leaf orientation fig 7 there is clearly heterogeneity in the field as well as within the plant nonetheless to obtain homogenous results most authors in the past have opted for measuring leaf temperature of fully sun exposed leaves eckstein et al 1995 kallarackal et al 1990 robinson and bower 1988 however the micro environment including light is a direct driver for stress excluding this effect might thus lead to erroneous conclusions about the stress level of a plant or field we instead suggest measuring a specific leaf in every plant that is orientated in the same wind direction whether it is partly shaded or not this is an objective approach and will provide correct information on the stress level in a field it also leads to more heterogeneous data as seen in our case but our sample size was large enough to overcome this this again makes the case for the use of a commercially available handheld infrared thermometer that allows for the collection of a large dataset in a short time 4 8 comparing δ13c and dans in this study we showed that δ13c and dans are good proxies for drought stress in banana both are based on the principle of stomatal closure and they correlate well fig 9 nonetheless their relation to drought stress is slightly different and this also impacts their potential application firstly the δ13c values represent a time scale of months whereas dans changes over a course of minutes this implies that dans might work better as an early predictor for drought stress than δ13c on the other hand δ13c is stable both within and between plants fig 5 table 2 while the variation in dans is large fig 8 this implies stable isotope analysis requires less plants for sampling then dans or leaf temperature the instantaneous nature of leaf temperature data allows to readily understand a situation allowing for a fast irrigation response isotope analysis on the other hand takes time and comes with a cost considering these facts we suggest that dans could be of use for a quick in field evaluation of drought stress to evaluate the robustness of different varieties under progressive stress and to manage irrigation δ13c on the other hand has the potential to deliver accurate quantitative data on a long term stress response for variety screening or the evaluation of management practices 5 conclusions stable carbon isotope analysis and leaf temperature based methods show strong potential for drought stress evaluation in banana under field conditions both δ13c and leaf temperature are strongly affected by changes in soil volumetric water content and clear differences can be observed between well watered and drought stressed plants drought stress is however not uniformly distributed in the banana mat both proxies indicate that daughter plants are less stressed than mother plants although interpretation of the δ13c values is complicated by the internal carbon exchange processes in the banana mat further research should aim to understand and quantify the water and carbon dynamics in a banana mat under stressed and normal conditions in addition δ13c values vary within a leaf in this research pragmatic approaches were developed for dealing with this variability to obtain samples which give a representative idea of the plants stress status four punch samples or one composite strip of leaf is recommended to be taken alongside the central part of the leaf whereas δ13c is a time integrated measure leaf temperature and dans degrees above non stressed canopy index give an indication of instantaneous stress dans is maximal when vpd and solar radiation are maximal and in the absence of wind this is the optimal time for stress detection temperature does not differ between abaxial and adaxial side of the leaf but should be measured on both left and right side of the midrib with increasing dans its variation increases as well this indicates the need for a large number of replicates especially under stressed conditions the large number of required measurements can easily be handled by low cost infrared thermometry however as dans can be mainly used in an irrigation set up where optimally watered plants are available as a reference the potential of alternative

9772,remote sensing techniques are used to estimate the high spatial and temporal hydrological variable of evapotranspiration this is certainly considered a step forward compared to alternate point measurements it is important however to properly interpret these estimations to practical information for water managers in this study results of two separate remote sensing studies fao ihe and rsrc on estimation of actual evapotranspiration for major crops in the urmia lake basin were compared with widely accepted theoretical estimations of corresponding irrigation requirements ir using cropwat cropwat estimations represent the irrigation requirements of crops under no stress whereas rs techniques are used to estimate actual crop water use which may be under nonideal growing situations comparison of irrigation requirements and actual water use for different crops at various locations within the urmia lake basin can provide practical information on the status of field water managements i e sufficiency of applied irrigation such analysis provides grounds for possible improvement on water management in a highly competitive water used region the rs crop water estimations results were crosschecked with cropwat estimations of irrigation requirements as the reference range using ground data adopted from 21 scattered synoptic weather stations across the basin representing the widely variable crop water demand in the region and corresponding effective precipitations fao ihe used the sebal and rsrc used the metric algorithm to produce et a maps the available land use maps with 30 m by 30 m pixels were used for designation of the type of field crops rsrc maps were produced using 1 km by 1 km daily satellite images at this scale a mixed combination of crops occurs in one pixel to provide a more realistic comparison the relative area of each crop cited from the land use maps was used to compare the et a estimates by rsrc with the weighted average of irrigation requirements the results showed the actual water use estimated from remote sensing images were generally higher than irrigation requirements the difference can be attributed to overirrigation which is a common practice in the region rs estimated actual crop water use in rainfed lands was also compared with temporal local precipitations in some areas actual crop water use in rainfed lands was more than the corresponding effective precipitation estimates this observation cannot practically be justified and can be drawback in the preparation of land use maps practical conclusions were drawn from comparison of actual crop water use and theoretical estimates locations of possible over under irrigation were identified for which improved water management can provide means for saving water for the restoration of the desiccating urmia lake the feasibility and versatility of rs techniques have motivated researchers to increase adoption of this method provided that the uncertainties can be

availability of water is progressively reduced heyns 1992 sustainability of water management depends on an integrated approach and at large scales remote sensing techniques have been used for comprehensive studies in numerous fields including geography land surveying ecology meteorology and water resource management basin scale studies on monitoring and assessment of agricultural applications such as crop acreage estimation crop condition soil moisture estimation yield estimation soil survey agriculture water management are now more feasible using satellite images remote sensing has been used to develop soil moisture data and hence the type of crop that can be grown in the soil through remote sensing farmers can tell where water resources are available and adequate for use over a given land lake urmia located in northwestern iran has desiccated in the last decades because of poor water management construction of numerous upstream dam reservoirs leading to expansion of irrigated agriculture is to be blamed first for the imposed disaster on the other hand the livelihood of many residents in the region now depends on agriculture proper management and allocation of agricultural water are recognized as priorities to resolve the problem basin scale studies considering the variability of cropping pattern and water use can depict the possible areas for improvements evapotranspiration et is a major component of water balance and is very difficult to measure deo et al 2017 and to represent at a large scale due to spatial variability a large share of surface and groundwater evaporates from agricultural surfaces by evapotranspiration reliable estimation of actual evapotranspiration et a now viable using rs techniques can facilitate proper management and allocation of water resources shadmani et al 2011 lima et al 2020 many studies use point measurements such as lysimeters for ground evaluation of rs estimation of evapotranspiration sobrino et al 2021 as an example of many these accurate validations still lack proper representation of et at large scale the et estimation formulae such as the fao penman monteith use data from ground based meteorological stations this formula has been the most widely used method for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration et o for many years under variable environments allen et al 1998a 1998b allen 2000 et o represents the evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface this value is then multiplied by the crop coefficients to represent crop water requirements et c under no physical stress et c is affected by weather parameters and crop characteristics allen et al 1998a 1998b proper irrigation management and planning depend on appropriate estimation and comparison of both crop water requirement et c and actual evapotranspiration taheri et al 2019 omar et al 2019 such analysis can be used to detect over and or under irrigation of various crops elhag et al 2011 dastorani and poormohammadi 2012 in this method et c is estimated from the reference evapotranspiration et 0 and crop coefficient k c the major limiting factors that control et 0 are water availability amount of energy and wind speed these factors depend on factors such as soil moisture which varies for different latitudes the season of the year time of day and cloud cover el shirbeny et al 2018 lebon et al 2003 daily accurate data such as land surface temperature air temperature vegetation cover vapor pressure and wind speed is required for an acceptable estimation of et c bandyopadhyay et al 2009 estimated et 0 at 133 stations in india using fao56 pm and the mann kendall method with a significant decreasing trend in et 0 mainly caused by the significant increase in relative humidity and a decrease in wind speed conventional models for estimation of et a using point meteorological data are often inconsistent because they fail to consider spatial temporal variability on the ground situation at large scale aksu and arikan 2017 de oliveira costa et al 2020 mohammed et al 2018 remote sensing techniques have overcome these limitations by estimating actual crop water use et a for extended time and space coverage çetin and köksal 2018 designation of information from several weather stations with relatively close spatial proximity as adopted in this study can improve estimations of ground crop water requirements at large scale satellite information from noaa avhrr landsat and modis is used to estimate the actual crop water use based on surface energy balance for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 sebi su 2002 metric allen et al 2007 etwatch wu et al 2008 and etlook pelgrum et al 2010 algorithms these algorithms can be used to calculate the components of energy balance at a regional scale using terrain data mhawej et al 2020 actual crop water use can vary spatially even for similar crops in addition the actual conditions detected by satellite images often differ from the potential crop water requirements estimated by the penman monteith method comparison of actual and potential crop water use however can have practical merits in evaluation of the quality and extent of on the ground cropping management and the areas of possible improvements recently both remote sensing rs and geographical information systems gis become the main techniques that can be efficiently used for estimating and assessing evapotranspiration in the study of water resources bastiaanssen et al 2005 awada et al 2019 elnmer et al 2019 agriculture and actual water use on regional and global coverage çetin and köksal 2018 de oliveira costa et al 2020 this technique has been used in agriculture to study land use changes crop patterns and water use in the current conditions the scale of evaluation in most studies is large and the validation of these studies is mainly done by point measurements in recent years numerous studies have been conducted to estimate crop water use at the urmia lake basin most studies are limited to evaluating satellite image outputs hence it is important to compare the et a using both satellite and estimated approaches to evaluate their accuracy for proper management of limited available water in competing environments such as the urmia lake basin the purpose of this study was to reexamine the estimated actual crop water use adopted from two spatially and temporally discretized remote sensing studies namely the sharif university remote sensing research center rsrc and a joint fao and ihe delft university fao ihe conducted in the region the outcomes of these two studies was compared with the cropwat estimations of irrigation requirements for various crops throughout the urmia lake basin introduction of variability of meteorological data from several weather stations across the basin is an advantage in this study that is reflected in the wide range of variability in estimated crop water requirement for similar crops satellite images used in the two studies at different spatial scales were projected over the small scaled land use map for better representation of ground situation comparison of actual crop water use from rs studies with irrigation requirement from cropwat model can have practical implications for improving water management in the region therefore in addition to evaluating the actual water use from satellite images a practical outcome recognized by identifying relative irrigation deficiency based on irrigation requirement and crop water use assessing relative irrigation deficiency led to spatial distribution of under and or over irrigation assessments for the basin in addition the rs estimated crop water use in rainfed regions was further explored in real situations the rs actual crop water use should not be higher than the effective precipitation for this analysis estimations from the fao ihe were compared in the solely rainfed pixels of 30 m by 30 m detected using the land use maps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area urmia lake basin is in northwestern iran at latitude of 44 13 47 54 e and 35 40 38 29 n and has an area of 52 000 km2 fathian et al 2016 water runoffs generated in the basin finally drain into the lake at the center of the basin urmia lake is the largest lake in iran and is one of the largest hyper saline water bodies in the world fathian et al 2015 weather conditions significantly vary along the basin extended meteorological data collected at 21 weather stations across the basin show that average air temperature ranges from 3 c to 13 c mahab ghodss updating the water master plan in the basins of caspian sea and urmia 2013 and mean annual potential evapotranspiration varies from 930 to 1513 mm annually mahab ghodss updating the water master plan in the basins of caspian sea and urmia 2012 2 2 precipitation cropping seasonal precipitation data were collected from 21 weather stations across the basin seasonal precipitation occurs mainly between october to june in the region seasonal precipitation values ranged from 227 to 581 mm in the year of 2014 15 and from 145 to 264 mm in 2013 14 cropping year spatial distribution of major crops seasonal precipitation values for 2013 14 and 2014 15 are presented in fig 1 for both the water year of 2013 14 and 2014 2015 the highest rainfalls were for the south and southwest regions whereas the lowest precipitation occurred in east and northeast of the basin for 2014 15 the lowest precipitation occurred in most areas northeast of the basin for 2013 14 ie sahand shabestar and salmas stations the main precipitation is observed in autumn and winter seasons or at the beginning of the winter wheat growing season when crop water requirements are at their lowest on the other hand the main irrigations are required in the spring and summers when precipitation reaches its minimum applied irrigation and corresponding seasonal effective precipitation can directly affect growth and crop production in addition seasonal precipitation data collected across the weather stations were used to estimate the effective precipitation for crop water use and also to assess the validity of rs estimations of actual water use et a in the rainfed lands 2 cropwat 8 0 2 1 model parameterization the cropwat model developed by the fao soil and water development department fao 1992 1998 is a practical tool that can be used to calculations of reference evapotranspiration et0 crop water requirement etc and irrigation scheduling kuo et al 2001 smith and kivumbi 2004 tavakkoli and oweis 2004 bouraima et al 2015 moseki et al 2019 et0 and etc were calculated by cropwat 8 0 model based on irrigation and drainage paper of fao 56 allen et al 1998a 1998b details of cropwat model can be found in refs 2 and 11 and the secondary data used for calculating of crop water requirement is explained in subsequent sections in this study the widely crop water requirement values using fao56 pm method by cropwt model have been compared with actual crop water use eta by remote sensing rs studies for various crops and locations throughout the urmia lake basin this comparison can have practical implications for improving water management in the region the cropwat 8 0 model requires several input data on geographic coordinates weather soil and crop as inputs for estimation of et c clarke et al 2001 2 2 weather stations and climatological data twenty one synoptic weather stations were used to represent the spatial variability of climatic conditions across the basin monthly input data for cropwat 8 0 were developed using daily climatic variables of maximum and minimum temperature and humidity wind speed number of daylight hours rainfall and solar radiation 2 3 crop and soil data crop

working group for sustainable water management and agriculture urmia lake basin regional council 2013 were used in this study table 3 et c values for 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 were estimated for the major crops of winter wheat and sugar beets 2 5 effective precipitation peff the usda scs method estimations of effective precipitation ware developed with water balance calculations based on 50 years of weather data from 22 stations across the united states usda 1967 in this method information such as average monthly evapotranspiration rates total monthly rainfall and irrigation is used to determine the effective precipitation the resulting the following equation is used for estimation of effective precipitation 4 p eff 25 4 sf 0 04931 p 0 82416 0 11565 10 0 000955 et c where p eff is the average monthly effective precipitation mm p is the average monthly precipitation mm et c is the average monthly crop evapotranspiration mm sf is the soil water storage factor the soil water storage factor was defined by 5 sf 0 0531747 0 011621 d 8 943 10 5 d 2 2 321 10 7 d 3 where d is the usable soil water storage in mm the term d was generally calculated as 40 60 of the available soil water capacity in the crop root zone depending on the irrigation management practices used the average monthly effective precipitation calculated by the above equation cannot exceed either the average monthly rainfall p m or average monthly evapotranspiration et m if p eff that exceeds either one the value p eff must be reduced to the lesser of the two 3 remote sensing studies 3 1 developing monthly eta maps 3 1 1 fao ihe study in an assigned joint project from urmia lake restoration program ulrp conducted by fao and ihe delft institute for water education in the netherlands fao ihe monthly actual evapotranspiration et a of various crops were estimated in the urmia lake basin using sebal algorithm sebal is a surface energy balance model which uses remotely sensed data with 30 m resolution the applied method consists of eight major steps as illustrated in fig 2 landsat 7 and 8 satellite images were acquired for the period of 1st october 2013 30th of september 2015 post calibration of et a maps was implemented by land use based correction over the urban areas using the corresponding ndvi data from the same date of acquisition the method includes three major steps i generate daily et a maps from landsat 7 and 8 scenes in the study period ii spatio temporal interpolation using locally weighted regression loess to fill the gaps over time and spline based spatial interpolation to fill the gaps spatially iii land use and season based et a calibration for setting up sebal model at the time of satellite data acquisition instantaneous and 24 hour average meteorological data representing the day of acquisition are required these data were extracted for the urmia lake basin from nasa global land data assimilation system gldas v2 1 which is an assimilated global data product from satellite and ground based observations rodell et al 2004 gldas data is offered at 0 25 degree spatial resolution at 3 h interval the instantaneous data corresponding to the landsat acquisition time was estimated by averaging the 6 h and 9 h outputs while all the 8 images in a day were averaged to estimate 24 h data representing the day of landsat acquisition et a was estimated from remotely sensed spectral data and the gldas land surface model remote sensing based et a mapping in many studies is performed by establishing direct empirical relation between ndvi and crop coefficient k c instead of solving surface energy balance equitation glenn et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2003 kamble et al 2013 hence investigating the relation between et a values derived from sebal and the independent ndvi values directly acquired from satellite can offer strong validation possibilities hence from the spectral reflectance of landsat vegetation parameters like normalized difference vegetation index ndvi vegetation cover vc leaf area index lai and albedo were computed for each landsat observation the average of two approaches asymptotic relationship of lai with vc and the polynomial relationship of lai with ndvi have been used as final lai estimations surface albedo also has been computed based on the following bastiaanssen 2000 the vegetation indices from multi spectral satellite data can well describe the vegetation growth and thereby can explain the water use trend the strong linear correlation between the estimated et a and ndvi over all the land use types has been demonstrated the vegetation growth with the increasing availability of water the expected response of et a to the vegetation growth showed quality assurance of the developed monthly et a maps since the satellite images represent instantaneous snapshots of ground data the outputs were scaled to 24 h in sebal the instantaneous et a is calculated based on the surface energy budget daily actual evapotranspiration for the day of landsat acquisition was finally computed from evaporative fraction ef because the difference between instantaneous value of the latent heat flux during the satellite overpass time and ef derive from 24 h energy balance is marginal pysebal is a new python implementation of sebal model developed by the water accounting group in ihe delft pysebal is a modular implementation of sebal model in python where a set of input data including spectral atmospheric soil and topographic data are provided to estimate the surface energy parameters the outputs include parameters related to vegetation energy balance biomass and evapotranspiration the pysebal library is provided as an open source library with apache version 2 license in a git hub repository the python implementation facilitates automation of the entire process including estimation of the hot and cold pixel from a satellite scene currently pysebal supports spectral radiances from modis landsat proba v with thermal data from viirs the main advantage of pysebal is that it can be run with minimum inputs from the user after running pysebal for all the landsat scenes per processing units pu s 24 h et a maps were then further processed to develop seamless mosaics to cover the basin for every month landsat had 4 observations two from landsat 7 and two from landsat 8 16 days being re visit time for both satellites therefore a total of up to 12 observations per month over 3 pu s were collected but often not all observations were usable due to heavy cloud cover in the region especially during winter season all the scenes from landsat 7 and 8 were incorporated to increase the probability of having maximum valid pixels over a year et a maps estimated from all the landsat data in a month were patched together using the mean operator for example for october 2014 the available landsat data for each pu path were considered similarly for each month in the two cropping years from october 2013 to september 2015 up to a maximum of 12 observations were obtained ten individual et a maps were estimated from landsat acquisitions of october 2014 for the three pu s these maps were then aggregated and clipped to urmia basin the monthly et a maps were then converted from mm day to mm month by multiplying each map by a number of days in the corresponding month the post processing approach was applied for all months from october 2013 to september 2015 the monthly aggregation of individual et a maps per month using the mean operator followed by temporal and spatial interpolation were extended to all the months the gap filling process applied to the monthly maps from october 2013 to september 2015 karimi 2018 3 1 2 rsrc study in a study conducted by the sharif university remote sensing research center rsrc monthly et a maps were estimated using a modified version of metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration model using modis satellite data for the entire the urmia lake basin et a maps were developed in coarse 1 km by 1 km pixels while size of the typical irrigated fields in the region are often less than one hectare the rsrc s model is closer to metric than sebal because 1 the model determines the latent heat at the cold pixel by using et r as a reference and 2 the model does not apply the evaporative fraction ef but the et r fraction etrf for temporal extrapolation rsrc uses neither the original sebal nor the original metric they called their model metric 2002 allen 2000 there are two types of primary input data adopted by rsrc for the et a estimation 1 satellite imagery e g visible near infrared and thermal infrared observations by modis satellite and 2 ground measured meteorological data both satellite analysis i e input data procedures operators decision etc and the ground measured weather data i e quality of weather data and the spatial applicability of the data will need to be further examined to evaluate the quality of et estimation japan international cooperation agency 2020 rsrc has been using modis radiance and surface temperature images after carefully evaluating input satellite data japan international cooperation agency 2020 rsrc is primarily using urmia station data operated not directly by the iranian government but via an internet site operated by a spanish meteorological t agency ogimet com input satellite data such as daily surface temperature and other ground measured weather data were also used only from urmia weather station data from one single station cannot be representative of the urmia lake basin with an area of approximately 52 000 km2 the station however is a properly designed and managed weather station measuring a complete set of standard weather parameters including air temperature humidity precipitation wind speed solar radiation sunshine hour pan evaporation and soil temperatures its solar radiation data measured by pyranometer were not accessible by rsrc and sunshine duration was used instead the rsrc s daily weather dataset has a problem in the time stamp and it potentially has about a 24 h maximum unexpected shift of time the survey team has agreed to keep using the daily weather dataset without correcting the time shift problem because the impact of the problem on hydrological computation will be limited in monthly or longer timescale japan international cooperation agency 2020 3 1 3 rs estimation of actual crop water use et a the results of the two studies conducted by rsrc karimi 2018 and fao ihe fao under the integrated program for sustainable water resources management in urmia lake basin 2017 were used for the objectives of this study to detect the status of water management in agricultural fields across the basin in these two studies monthly et a maps were developed for the entire basin for the years of 2013 2014 and 2015 in addition land use maps developed by tarbiat modares university were used for delineation of cropping pattern in the region at pixels of 30 m by 30 m produced for eight distinct crops and orchards water engineering research institute 2018 the cropping pattern was adopted from the land use map of 2015 fig 3 in preparing the land use maps various data such as cloud free biweekly time series of optical multispectral sentinel 2 interferometric monthly time series of sentinel 1 data dem land slope and aspect were assembled in addition land use map was produced with multiresolution segmentation features extraction and selection random forest classification method no distinction was made between sugar beets and potatoes or between wheat and barley crops in the land use map a 15 km radius buffer zones were developed for each weather station using the intersect instruction in arcgis 10 3 software to designate the proximity of each weather station and to represent variability of the crop water requirements for local regions fig 4 actual monthly crop water use in the designated buffer zones was estimated for summer and winter crops and rainfed land from the monthly et a maps adopted from the rsrc and fao ihe studies using the zonal statistics instruction in arcgis 10 3 finally irrigation requirements ir defined as 6 ir et c p eff where et c is crop water requirement and p eff is the effective precipitation satisfying part or all of crop water requirement the irrigation requirements ir estimated using from cropwat 8 0 for different crops were compared to the actual water use et a estimated from the rsrc and fao ihe studies fao ihe used the sebal algorithm to produce et a maps rsrc however used the metric algorithm to produce et a maps in the metric algorithm 1 km by 1 km daily satellite images are used at this scale a mixed combination of crops is found in one pixel in order to develop a more realistic representation rsrc developed et a estimates were compared with the weighted average of irrigation requirements ir based on the relative area of each crop adopted from the land use maps the general assumption is that when the values from satellite images representing the actual crop water use et a are lower than the estimated irrigation requirements ir the crop has experienced stress from either insufficient irrigation or other poor management measures 5 results 5 1 cropwat ir vs et a estimations from fao ihe study actual crop water use can vary spatially even for the same crop at the basin the same is true for the potential crop water requirement they are not the same across the basin because of the variability of weather parameters as well as estimated effective precipitation it will end up having a range of different irrigation requirements ir for the same crop across the basin as a result comparison of actual crop water use and estimations of irrigation demands can have practical merits in evaluation of the status of water management for different locations and the areas of possible improvements rs techniques were used to estimate actual crop water use based on ground energy balance for the entire lake urmia basin in addition ground climatological data from 21 weather stations scattered throughout the basin were used to estimate irrigation requirements under no stress conditions these two representative estimations for each station are compared here to make an assessment in general of crop water management in different regions across the basin the results showed that irrigation requirements varied widely for different regions within across the basin and even between the two years which indicates the need for better representation of climatic disparity in estimating the crop water use in different areas cherif et al 2015 also maintain that when estimating actual water use and irrigation requirement on a regional scale the spatial variability of the weather parameters is important and thus closer attention to the meteorological input data is required estimated wheat irrigation requirement ir ranges from 459 mm in sarab to 720 mm in maragheh in 2013 2014 and from 411 mm in oshnaviyeh to 752 mm at ajabshir in 2014 2015 fig 5a b whereas estimated actual water use was ranged between 483 and 778 mm in 2013 2014 and between 513 and 756 mm in 2014 2015 fig 5a b irrigation requirement for sugar beets varied from 631 to 911 mm in 2013 14 and from 541 to 852 mm in 2014 2015 fig 5c d for sugar beets crop actual water use was estimated to range between 512 and 756 mm in 2013 2014 and between 585 and 872 mm at in 2014 2015 fig 5c d irrigation requirement ir and actual water use et a for both wheat and sugar beets as major crops in the basin are also graphically compared for different regions in figs 5 and 6 it is evident that in 2013 14 crop water demand for wheat was entirely satisfied in all regions when et a is greater than ir it indicates that over irrigation has occurred leading to excessive actual evapotranspiration maximum irrigation should be limited to satisfy the potential crop water requirements crop water requirement is even curtailed to irrigation demand when effective precipitation is taken into consideration in the drier water years as in 2013 14 despite having lower rainfalls dam reservoirs are normally filled up at the expense of lower reduced water release to the lake on the other hand additional water is freely supplemented for irrigation from groundwater all in all applied irrigation is not necessarily limited even in dry years in 2014 15 the actual water use was also higher than irrigation demand even though it was a wetter year higher seasonal and effective precipitations in theory reduces the requirements for full irrigation but the traditional farmers do not take the precipitations into account and the fields are routinely irrigated according to the assigned turns and water shares and not necessarily based on calculated irrigation requirements surprisingly enough in oshnavieh heris and miandoab excessive irrigation amounted to 40 30 and 25 these are clear examples of the grounds for improved water savings for sugar beets in 2014 15 actual crop water use was also more than what was actually necessary for most regions except for bonab takab and sahand figs 5 and 6 these observations can be attributed to excessive irrigation application sugar beet is a comparatively more water demanding crop and economical has a higher value the general belief of traditional farmers is the more you water the more production this is especially encouraged for higher value crops in 2013 14 having lower precipitations estimated irrigation requirement was higher than rs observed actual crop water use in the entire basin which is interpreted as irrigation deficiency present findings revealed et maps generated that with the aid of landsat satellite images were able to well represent the spatial and temporal distribution of the crop water use values throughout the urmia lake basin for the cropping pattern well complied by with the land use maps developed for the basin tasumi 2019 showed that a good correlation exists between the monthly evapotranspiration et a obtained using landsat 8 satellite imagery and metric model with the independent estimation of et using the fao 56 approach in the western part of urmia lake basin also reported high correlation coefficient between the actual evapotranspiration et a values using sebal algorithm and modis satellite images and et c values of penman monteith method fao 56 in gavkhouni basin in central iran elnmer et al 2019 used the fao penman monteith method to validate the derived et a from the sebal algorithm the results showed that the sebal algorithm with landsat 8 images provided an acceptable estimation of the spatial and temporal distributions of et a in semi arid regions such as the nile delta in egypt crop water use and crop water requirement could also reliably be used in water management studies including irrigation water management and operation of irrigation networks the observed differences in irrigation requirement ir etc peff and actual water use were defined as relative irrigation applied ir et a ir in percentage ir irrigation requirement and p eff effective precipitation this calculated value for wheat ranged between 5 sarab and 24 heris in 2013 2014 and between 42 oshnaviyeh and 7 miandoab in 2014 2015 the relative difference for sugar beet ranges between was 5 heris and 21 sahand maragheh in 2013 2014 and from 23 miandoab and heris to 7 sahand in 2014 2015 fig 6 the negative values could either be due to over estimation of et a or to over irrigation which results in excessive wetting of fields direct field observations are needed for more verifications distribution of actual evapotranspiration and relative irrigation deficiency indicates that water is being excessively applied specially in upstream regions proper valuation of et c depends on accurate estimation of et 0 and representative crop coefficient for each phenological stage rana and katerji 2000 in this study introduction of climatological data collected from multiple weather stations better reflect the variation in crop water demand in the region as was documented cropwat 8 0 estimates the irrigation requirements derived from the crop water requirement et c and effective precipitations p eff under optimum conditions and in the absence of water salinity or nutrient stresses whereas satellite images detect the actual crop water use et a of actual fields operated under a range of management practices which could lead to a variety of crop stresses imposed either intentionally or otherwise overall results of this study indicate that farmers are generally over irrigating their lands at the expense of depriving the historical share of lake water rights in addition farmers often refer to groundwater to supplement their limited surface water rights for the areas where actual crop water use et a was lower than the irrigation demand ir it shows that crop has been under stress either from irrigation deficiency or mismanagements resulting in salinity or nutrients stresses aksu and arikan 2017 mohammed et al 2018 salinity is not generally a problem for agricultural land in urmia lake the basin but problems with improper water allocation commonly occurs especially in lower sections of irrigation schemes 5 2 cropwat ir estimation vs et a from rsrc study in arid and semiarid regions et a values can vary widely depending on the water regimes moreover a change in one weather parameter can readily affect all other parameters because they are mutually related this is one of the problems in correctly evaluating et a estimations using rs techniques in this study data collected from several weather stations throughout the urmia lake basin and weighted average of crop water demand for the large pixels depicted in rsrc study were used to better represent climate variability and crop water demand within the basin in the rsrc study et a maps are produced using coarse pixels at 1 km scale at this scale a mixed combination of crops exists in one single pixel therefore for the sake of comparison a more realistic weighted average of irrigation requirement ir were considered the results showed that the highest irrigation requirement ir weighted values were for tabriz 615 mm and salmas 564 mm stations in 2013 2014 and for tabriz 547 mm and azarshahr 535 mm stations in 2014 2015 the lowest ir weighted values were observed at bostanabad 341 mm and shahindej 348 mm stations in 2013 2014 and at saghez 293 mm and takab 341 mm in 2014 2015 respectively fig 7a b the results for the 21 stations showed that ir weighted values varied widely for different regions within the basin and even between years the highest et a values estimated from rsrc studies were for tabriz and salmas at 598 and 585 mm in 2013 2014 and tabriz and malekan at 632 and 592 mm in 2014 2015 respectively the lowest et a values were recorded at saghez and bokan in 2013 14 420 and 398 mm respectively and at takab and shahindej in 2014 15 423 and 418 mm respectively fig 7a b by comparing the results from fao ihe and rsrc we conclude that the rsrc method overpredicts the actual crop water use in the fao ihe study predictions are made on 30 m 30 m scale therefore the type of crop associated with the pixel is highly accurate in addition ir and eta comparisons were made for wheat and sugar beets only whereas in rsrc the detected pixels were at 1 km 1 km scale as a result a mixed combination of crops was observed using the land use maps to obtain a more realistic prediction for irrigation demand at this scale all covered crops and their proportional share in irrigation demand should be verified this is especially true for the share of the higher demanding crops such as orchards alfalfa which cover a major part of agricultural lands in the region more specifically in orchard in addition to the huge old apple trees that are often heavily flood irrigated alfalfa is grown between the rows which result in higher than predicted actual crop water use observed by remote sensing the relative irrigation deficiency as defined above between the ir and rsrc models was from 4 at bostanabad station to 22 at azarshahr in 2013 2014 and from 1 at takab and salmas to 22 at azarshahr in 2014 2015 fig 8 these results indicate that in most areas the irrigation requirements were satisfied whereas in some areas irrigation was not sufficient the results of this study present the variability in crop water demand in addition to sufficiency of irrigation supply at different locations within the basin unreliable rainfall and particularly lack of reliable et dataset can also lead to the over underestimation of irrigation javadian et al 2019 in the urmia lake basin javadian et al 2019 applied the metric model with modis imagery 1 km resolution to estimate et a in basin scale the results showed that modis based et a maps provided useful information for large scale water balance and hydrology while the coarse spatial resolution prevents quantitative and accurate assessment of the et a estimations allen et al 2007 suggest the metric model is able to captures the water stress condition of the crops via et our assessment of irrigation requirements does not account for water stressed crops çetin and köksal 2018 also showed that the et a value estimated with the metric model was slightly greater than the total quantity of the water to be converted into et within minöz stream watershed in turkey such an error was probably resulted from improper representation of the meteorological data used in the study for the watershed in general and for different micro meteorological sections of the watershed cherif et al 2015 in addition some errors can be attributed to selection of hot and cold pixels for internal calibration of the metric javadian et al 2019 incompliance of assumptions and coefficients of metric model with the watershed conditions can also result in some inaccuracy of results çetin and köksal 2018 although there are uncertainties in terms of the accuracy assessment of this approach the comparison results indicate effective estimation of et a in the urmia lake basin tasumi 2019 and the gareh bygone plain in southern iran jamshidi et al 2019 5 3 analysis of actual crop water use in rainfed lands the basic assumption is that in rainfed lands actual crop water use cannot be more than the amount of seasonal precipitation the available data on actual crop water use from rs studies were compared with recorded rainfalls for such comparison only estimations from the fao ihe were used in which the smaller 30 m 30 m pixels can be selected as solely rainfed using the land use maps precipitations differ widely throughout the basin and even between the two years fig 1 the 1 km by 1 km pixels used in rsrc study consists of mixed crop cover and cannot be used for the analysis of crop water use in rainfed regions results showed that the seasonal precipitation range from 227 to 581 mm in 2014 2015 and from 145 mm to 264 mm in 2013 2014 fig 9a b for rainfed lands actual water use was estimated between 168 and 410 mm at takab and oshnaviyeh in 2014 2015 and between 167 and 315 mm at sahand and in salmas 2013 2014 respectively fig 9a b the estimated crop water use on rainfed regions were found to be lower at some locations as compared with the amount of precipitation tasumi 2019 also showed that estimated et a from metric model and landsat 8 satellite imagery for rain fed wheat fields the western urmia lake basin had in good agreement with the evapotranspiration requirement of healthy wheat the et a estimated on rainfed land were higher than the amount of precipitation at salmas in 2013 2014 this cannot happen in real situations this discrepancy cannot readily be justified the land elevation and surface temperature are often reasons for misrepresentation of et a from landsat images and the sebal algorithm used in the fao ihe studies type of land use and terrain can have a direct effect on the spatial distribution of et a in addition there may have been errors in preparation of land use maps because of the difficulty to distinguish the rainfed from irrigated lands under wheat barley and pasture cultivation 4 summary and conclusions estimation of crop water use is necessary for assessment of the hydrological balance planning design management of irrigation systems many research studies in recent decades have focused to find solutions for the rapid desiccation of urmia lake caused by excessive and unsustainable upstream water abstraction proper allocation of limited renewable water resources especially in the agricultural sector is the key to solving the problem in the region a thorough study on the present situation of water allocation as compared to highly variable irrigation requirements can demonstrate the extent and location of mismanagement within the basin and provide possible solutions to the problem several studies have been conducted to estimate the evapotranspiration of major crops at different spatial scales in the basin the purpose of the present study was to put the available estimations of actual crop water use et a derived from two separate rsrc and fao ihe remote sensing studies in the urmia lake basin into perspective by comparison to the respective cropwat 8 0 estimated irrigation requirement ir the results of this analysis can have practical implications for improved management plans at local level estimation of crop water requirements often does not consider the natural variability of all factors to overcome this limitation data from 21 meteorological stations within the urmia lake basin for 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 were used observations showed that climatological data collected from multiple meteorological stations can better represent the water requirements of the major crops by accommodating the highly localized variability of climatic conditions at the basin level land use maps for wheat summer crops sugar beets were projected to satellite images to compare the et a with the corresponding ir estimations for different areas of the basin actual crop water use in rainfed regions were also compared with the natural precipitations irrigation requirements were generally lower than the actual crop water use estimated from remote sensing images the difference can be attributed to excessive applied irrigation commonly practiced in the region the objective of this study was to obtain as much practical information from estimations using localized ground based data and remote sensing techniques to detect the quality of water management of agricultural fields across the urmia lake basin more clearly based on this analysis the locations of over under irrigation were detected these observations provide means for improved water management to save water for the restoration of urmia lake which has shrunk drastically in the past few decades as more and more of lake water rights is directed away for other uses

9772,remote sensing techniques are used to estimate the high spatial and temporal hydrological variable of evapotranspiration this is certainly considered a step forward compared to alternate point measurements it is important however to properly interpret these estimations to practical information for water managers in this study results of two separate remote sensing studies fao ihe and rsrc on estimation of actual evapotranspiration for major crops in the urmia lake basin were compared with widely accepted theoretical estimations of corresponding irrigation requirements ir using cropwat cropwat estimations represent the irrigation requirements of crops under no stress whereas rs techniques are used to estimate actual crop water use which may be under nonideal growing situations comparison of irrigation requirements and actual water use for different crops at various locations within the urmia lake basin can provide practical information on the status of field water managements i e sufficiency of applied irrigation such analysis provides grounds for possible improvement on water management in a highly competitive water used region the rs crop water estimations results were crosschecked with cropwat estimations of irrigation requirements as the reference range using ground data adopted from 21 scattered synoptic weather stations across the basin representing the widely variable crop water demand in the region and corresponding effective precipitations fao ihe used the sebal and rsrc used the metric algorithm to produce et a maps the available land use maps with 30 m by 30 m pixels were used for designation of the type of field crops rsrc maps were produced using 1 km by 1 km daily satellite images at this scale a mixed combination of crops occurs in one pixel to provide a more realistic comparison the relative area of each crop cited from the land use maps was used to compare the et a estimates by rsrc with the weighted average of irrigation requirements the results showed the actual water use estimated from remote sensing images were generally higher than irrigation requirements the difference can be attributed to overirrigation which is a common practice in the region rs estimated actual crop water use in rainfed lands was also compared with temporal local precipitations in some areas actual crop water use in rainfed lands was more than the corresponding effective precipitation estimates this observation cannot practically be justified and can be drawback in the preparation of land use maps practical conclusions were drawn from comparison of actual crop water use and theoretical estimates locations of possible over under irrigation were identified for which improved water management can provide means for saving water for the restoration of the desiccating urmia lake the feasibility and versatility of rs techniques have motivated researchers to increase adoption of this method provided that the uncertainties can be

improved management of water and strategies to save water in agriculture involves both reduction in water consumption and preservation of the resources this is especially true in arid regions in which availability of water is progressively reduced heyns 1992 sustainability of water management depends on an integrated approach and at large scales remote sensing techniques have been used for comprehensive studies in numerous fields including geography land surveying ecology meteorology and water resource management basin scale studies on monitoring and assessment of agricultural applications such as crop acreage estimation crop condition soil moisture estimation yield estimation soil survey agriculture water management are now more feasible using satellite images remote sensing has been used to develop soil moisture data and hence the type of crop that can be grown in the soil through remote sensing farmers can tell where water resources are available and adequate for use over a given land lake urmia located in northwestern iran has desiccated in the last decades because of poor water management construction of numerous upstream dam reservoirs leading to expansion of irrigated agriculture is to be blamed first for the imposed disaster on the other hand the livelihood of many residents in the region now depends on agriculture proper management and allocation of agricultural water are recognized as priorities to resolve the problem basin scale studies considering the variability of cropping pattern and water use can depict the possible areas for improvements evapotranspiration et is a major component of water balance and is very difficult to measure deo et al 2017 and to represent at a large scale due to spatial variability a large share of surface and groundwater evaporates from agricultural surfaces by evapotranspiration reliable estimation of actual evapotranspiration et a now viable using rs techniques can facilitate proper management and allocation of water resources shadmani et al 2011 lima et al 2020 many studies use point measurements such as lysimeters for ground evaluation of rs estimation of evapotranspiration sobrino et al 2021 as an example of many these accurate validations still lack proper representation of et at large scale the et estimation formulae such as the fao penman monteith use data from ground based meteorological stations this formula has been the most widely used method for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration et o for many years under variable environments allen et al 1998a 1998b allen 2000 et o represents the evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface this value is then multiplied by the crop coefficients to represent crop water requirements et c under no physical stress et c is affected by weather parameters and crop characteristics allen et al 1998a 1998b proper irrigation management and planning depend on appropriate estimation and comparison of both crop water requirement et c and actual evapotranspiration taheri et al 2019 omar et al 2019 such analysis can be used to detect over and or under irrigation of various crops elhag et al 2011 dastorani and poormohammadi 2012 in this method et c is estimated from the reference evapotranspiration et 0 and crop coefficient k c the major limiting factors that control et 0 are water availability amount of energy and wind speed these factors depend on factors such as soil moisture which varies for different latitudes the season of the year time of day and cloud cover el shirbeny et al 2018 lebon et al 2003 daily accurate data such as land surface temperature air temperature vegetation cover vapor pressure and wind speed is required for an acceptable estimation of et c bandyopadhyay et al 2009 estimated et 0 at 133 stations in india using fao56 pm and the mann kendall method with a significant decreasing trend in et 0 mainly caused by the significant increase in relative humidity and a decrease in wind speed conventional models for estimation of et a using point meteorological data are often inconsistent because they fail to consider spatial temporal variability on the ground situation at large scale aksu and arikan 2017 de oliveira costa et al 2020 mohammed et al 2018 remote sensing techniques have overcome these limitations by estimating actual crop water use et a for extended time and space coverage çetin and köksal 2018 designation of information from several weather stations with relatively close spatial proximity as adopted in this study can improve estimations of ground crop water requirements at large scale satellite information from noaa avhrr landsat and modis is used to estimate the actual crop water use based on surface energy balance for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 sebi su 2002 metric allen et al 2007 etwatch wu et al 2008 and etlook pelgrum et al 2010 algorithms these algorithms can be used to calculate the components of energy balance at a regional scale using terrain data mhawej et al 2020 actual crop water use can vary spatially even for similar crops in addition the actual conditions detected by satellite images often differ from the potential crop water requirements estimated by the penman monteith method comparison of actual and potential crop water use however can have practical merits in evaluation of the quality and extent of on the ground cropping management and the areas of possible improvements recently both remote sensing rs and geographical information systems gis become the main techniques that can be efficiently used for estimating and assessing evapotranspiration in the study of water resources bastiaanssen et al 2005 awada et al 2019 elnmer et al 2019 agriculture and actual water use on regional and global coverage çetin and köksal 2018 de oliveira costa et al 2020 this technique has been used in agriculture to study land use changes crop patterns and water use in the current conditions the scale of evaluation in most studies is large and the validation of these studies is mainly done by point measurements in recent years numerous studies have been conducted to estimate crop water use at the urmia lake basin most studies are limited to evaluating satellite image outputs hence it is important to compare the et a using both satellite and estimated approaches to evaluate their accuracy for proper management of limited available water in competing environments such as the urmia lake basin the purpose of this study was to reexamine the estimated actual crop water use adopted from two spatially and temporally discretized remote sensing studies namely the sharif university remote sensing research center rsrc and a joint fao and ihe delft university fao ihe conducted in the region the outcomes of these two studies was compared with the cropwat estimations of irrigation requirements for various crops throughout the urmia lake basin introduction of variability of meteorological data from several weather stations across the basin is an advantage in this study that is reflected in the wide range of variability in estimated crop water requirement for similar crops satellite images used in the two studies at different spatial scales were projected over the small scaled land use map for better representation of ground situation comparison of actual crop water use from rs studies with irrigation requirement from cropwat model can have practical implications for improving water management in the region therefore in addition to evaluating the actual water use from satellite images a practical outcome recognized by identifying relative irrigation deficiency based on irrigation requirement and crop water use assessing relative irrigation deficiency led to spatial distribution of under and or over irrigation assessments for the basin in addition the rs estimated crop water use in rainfed regions was further explored in real situations the rs actual crop water use should not be higher than the effective precipitation for this analysis estimations from the fao ihe were compared in the solely rainfed pixels of 30 m by 30 m detected using the land use maps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area urmia lake basin is in northwestern iran at latitude of 44 13 47 54 e and 35 40 38 29 n and has an area of 52 000 km2 fathian et al 2016 water runoffs generated in the basin finally drain into the lake at the center of the basin urmia lake is the largest lake in iran and is one of the largest hyper saline water bodies in the world fathian et al 2015 weather conditions significantly vary along the basin extended meteorological data collected at 21 weather stations across the basin show that average air temperature ranges from 3

the water master plan in the basins of caspian sea and urmia 2012 2 2 precipitation cropping seasonal precipitation data were collected from 21 weather stations across the basin seasonal precipitation occurs mainly between october to june in the region seasonal precipitation values ranged from 227 to 581 mm in the year of 2014 15 and from 145 to 264 mm in 2013 14 cropping year spatial distribution of major crops seasonal precipitation values for 2013 14 and 2014 15 are presented in fig 1 for both the water year of 2013 14 and 2014 2015 the highest rainfalls were for the south and southwest regions whereas the lowest precipitation occurred in east and northeast of the basin for 2014 15 the lowest precipitation occurred in most areas northeast of the basin for 2013 14 ie sahand shabestar and salmas stations the main precipitation is observed in autumn and winter seasons or at the beginning of the winter wheat growing season when crop water requirements are at their lowest on the other hand the main irrigations are required in the spring and summers when precipitation reaches its minimum applied irrigation and corresponding seasonal effective precipitation can directly affect growth and crop production in addition seasonal precipitation data collected across the weather stations were used to estimate the effective precipitation for crop water use and also to assess the validity of rs estimations of actual water use et a in the rainfed lands 2 cropwat 8 0 2 1 model parameterization the cropwat model developed by the fao soil and water development department fao 1992 1998 is a practical tool that can be used to calculations of reference evapotranspiration et0 crop water requirement etc and irrigation scheduling kuo et al 2001 smith and kivumbi 2004 tavakkoli and oweis 2004 bouraima et al 2015 moseki et al 2019 et0 and etc were calculated by cropwat 8 0 model based on irrigation and drainage paper of fao 56 allen et al 1998a 1998b details of cropwat model can be found in refs 2 and 11 and the secondary data used for calculating of crop water requirement is explained in subsequent sections in this study the widely crop water requirement values using fao56 pm method by cropwt model have been compared with actual crop water use eta by remote sensing rs studies for various crops and locations throughout the urmia lake basin this comparison can have practical implications for improving water management in the region the cropwat 8 0 model requires several input data on geographic coordinates weather soil and crop as inputs for estimation of et c clarke et al 2001 2 2 weather stations and climatological data twenty one synoptic weather stations were used to represent the spatial variability of climatic conditions across the basin monthly input data for cropwat 8 0 were developed using daily climatic variables of maximum and minimum temperature and humidity wind speed number of daylight hours rainfall and solar radiation 2 3 crop and soil data crop

major crops of winter wheat and sugar beets 2 5 effective precipitation peff the usda scs method estimations of effective precipitation ware developed with water balance calculations based on 50 years of weather data from 22 stations across the united states usda 1967 in this method information such as average monthly evapotranspiration rates total monthly rainfall and irrigation is used to determine the effective precipitation the resulting the following equation is used for estimation of effective precipitation 4 p eff 25 4 sf 0 04931 p 0 82416 0 11565 10 0 000955 et c where p eff is the average monthly effective precipitation mm p is the average monthly precipitation mm et c is the average monthly crop evapotranspiration mm sf is the soil water storage factor the soil water storage factor was defined by 5 sf 0 0531747 0 011621 d 8 943 10 5 d 2 2 321 10 7 d 3 where d is the usable soil water storage in mm the term d was generally calculated as 40 60 of the available soil water capacity in the crop root zone depending on the irrigation management practices used the average monthly effective precipitation calculated by the above equation cannot exceed either the average monthly rainfall p m or average monthly evapotranspiration et m if p eff that exceeds either one the value p eff must be reduced to the lesser of the two 3 remote sensing studies 3 1 developing monthly eta maps 3 1 1 fao ihe study in an assigned joint project from urmia lake restoration program ulrp conducted by fao and ihe delft institute for water education in the netherlands fao ihe monthly actual evapotranspiration et a of various crops were estimated in the urmia lake basin using sebal algorithm sebal is a surface energy balance model which uses remotely sensed data with 30 m resolution the applied method consists of eight major steps as illustrated in fig 2 landsat 7 and 8 satellite images were acquired for the period of 1st october 2013 30th of september 2015 post calibration of et a maps was implemented by land use based correction over the urban areas using the corresponding ndvi data from the same date of acquisition the method includes three major steps i generate daily et a maps from landsat 7 and 8 scenes in the study period ii spatio temporal interpolation using locally weighted regression loess to fill the gaps over time and spline based spatial interpolation to fill the gaps spatially iii land use and season based et a calibration for setting up sebal model at the time of satellite data acquisition instantaneous and 24 hour average meteorological data representing the day of acquisition are required these data were extracted for the urmia lake basin from nasa global land data assimilation system gldas v2 1 which is an assimilated global data product from satellite and ground based observations rodell et al 2004 gldas data is offered at 0 25 degree spatial resolution at 3 h interval the instantaneous data corresponding to the landsat acquisition time was estimated by averaging the 6 h and 9 h outputs while all the 8 images in a day were averaged to estimate 24 h data representing the day of landsat acquisition et a was estimated from remotely sensed spectral data and the gldas land surface model remote sensing based et a mapping in many studies is performed by establishing direct empirical relation between ndvi and crop coefficient k c instead of solving surface energy balance equitation glenn et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2003 kamble et al 2013 hence investigating the relation between et a values derived from sebal and the independent ndvi values directly acquired from satellite can offer strong validation possibilities hence from the spectral reflectance of landsat vegetation parameters like normalized difference vegetation index ndvi vegetation cover vc leaf area index lai and albedo were computed for each landsat observation the average of two approaches asymptotic relationship of lai with vc and the polynomial relationship of lai with ndvi have been used as final lai estimations surface albedo also has been computed based on the following bastiaanssen 2000 the vegetation indices from multi spectral satellite data can well describe the vegetation growth and thereby can explain the water use trend the strong linear correlation between the estimated et a and ndvi over all the land use types has been demonstrated the vegetation growth with the increasing availability of water the expected response of et a to the vegetation growth showed quality assurance of the developed monthly et a maps since the satellite images represent instantaneous snapshots of ground data the outputs were scaled to 24 h in sebal the instantaneous et a is calculated based on the surface energy budget daily actual evapotranspiration for the day of landsat acquisition was finally computed from evaporative fraction ef because the difference between instantaneous value of the latent heat flux during the satellite overpass time and ef derive from 24 h energy balance is marginal pysebal is a new python implementation of sebal model developed by the water accounting group in ihe delft pysebal is a modular implementation of sebal model in python where a set of input data including spectral atmospheric soil and topographic data are provided to estimate the surface energy parameters the outputs include parameters related to vegetation energy balance biomass and evapotranspiration the pysebal library is provided as an open source library with apache version 2 license in a git hub repository the python implementation facilitates automation of the entire process including estimation of the hot and cold pixel from a satellite scene currently pysebal supports spectral radiances from modis landsat proba v with thermal data from viirs the main advantage of pysebal is that it can be run with minimum inputs from the user after running pysebal for all the landsat scenes per processing units pu s 24 h et a maps were then further processed to develop seamless mosaics to cover the basin for every month landsat had 4 observations two from landsat 7 and two from landsat 8 16 days being re visit time for both satellites therefore a total of up to 12 observations per month over 3 pu s were collected but often not all observations were usable due to heavy cloud cover in the region especially during winter season all the scenes from landsat 7 and 8 were incorporated to increase the probability of having maximum valid pixels over a year et a maps estimated from all the landsat data in a month were patched together using the mean operator for example for october 2014 the available landsat data for each pu path were considered similarly for each month in the two cropping years from october 2013 to september 2015 up to a maximum of 12 observations were obtained ten individual et a maps were estimated from landsat acquisitions of october 2014 for the three pu s these maps were then aggregated and clipped to urmia basin the monthly et a maps were then converted from mm day to mm month by multiplying each map by a number of days in the corresponding month the post processing approach was applied for all months from october 2013 to september 2015 the monthly aggregation of individual et a maps per month using the mean operator followed by temporal and spatial interpolation were extended to all the months the gap filling process applied to the monthly maps from october 2013 to september 2015 karimi 2018 3 1 2 rsrc study in a study conducted by the sharif university remote sensing research center rsrc monthly et a maps were estimated using a modified version of metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration model using modis satellite data for the entire the urmia lake basin et a maps were developed in coarse 1 km by 1 km pixels while size of the typical irrigated fields in the region are often less than one hectare the rsrc s model is closer to metric than sebal because 1 the model determines the latent heat at the cold pixel by using et r as a reference and 2 the model does not apply the evaporative fraction ef but the et r fraction etrf for temporal extrapolation rsrc uses neither the original sebal nor the original metric they called their model metric 2002 allen 2000 there are two types of primary input data adopted by rsrc for the et a estimation 1 satellite imagery e g visible near infrared and thermal infrared observations by modis satellite and 2 ground measured meteorological data both satellite analysis i e input data procedures operators decision etc and the ground measured weather data i e quality of weather data and the spatial applicability of the data will need to be further examined to evaluate the quality of et estimation japan international cooperation agency 2020 rsrc has been using modis radiance and surface temperature images after carefully evaluating input satellite data japan international cooperation agency 2020 rsrc is primarily using urmia station data operated not directly by the iranian government but via an internet site operated by a spanish meteorological t agency ogimet com input satellite data such as daily surface temperature and other ground measured weather data were also used only from urmia weather station data from one single station cannot be representative of the urmia lake basin with an area of approximately 52 000 km2 the station however is a properly designed and managed weather station measuring a complete set of standard weather parameters including air temperature humidity precipitation wind speed solar radiation sunshine hour pan evaporation and soil temperatures its solar radiation data measured by pyranometer were not accessible by rsrc and sunshine duration was used instead the rsrc s daily weather dataset has a problem in the time stamp and it potentially has about a 24 h maximum unexpected shift of time the survey team has agreed to keep using the daily weather dataset without correcting the time shift problem because the impact of the problem on hydrological computation will be limited in monthly or longer timescale japan international cooperation agency 2020 3 1 3 rs estimation of actual crop water use et a the results of the two studies conducted by rsrc karimi 2018 and fao ihe fao under the integrated program for sustainable water resources management in urmia lake basin 2017 were used for the objectives of this study to detect the status of water management in agricultural fields across the basin in these two studies monthly et a maps were developed for the entire basin for the years of 2013 2014 and 2015 in addition land use maps developed by tarbiat modares university were used for delineation of cropping pattern in the region at pixels of 30 m by 30 m produced for eight distinct crops and orchards water engineering research institute 2018 the cropping pattern was adopted from the land use map of 2015 fig 3 in preparing the land use maps various data such as cloud free biweekly time series of optical multispectral sentinel 2 interferometric monthly time series of sentinel 1 data dem land slope and aspect were assembled in addition land use map was produced with multiresolution segmentation features extraction and selection random forest classification method no distinction was made between sugar beets and potatoes or between wheat and barley crops in the land use map a 15 km radius buffer zones were developed for each weather station using the intersect instruction in arcgis 10 3 software to designate the proximity of each weather station and to represent variability of the crop water requirements for local regions fig 4 actual monthly crop water use in the designated buffer zones was estimated for summer and winter crops and rainfed land from the monthly et a maps adopted from the rsrc and fao ihe studies using the zonal statistics instruction in arcgis 10 3 finally irrigation requirements ir defined as 6 ir et c p eff where et c is crop water requirement and p eff is the effective precipitation satisfying part or all of crop water requirement the irrigation requirements ir estimated using from cropwat 8 0 for different crops were compared to the actual water use et a estimated from the rsrc and fao ihe studies fao ihe used the sebal algorithm to produce et a maps rsrc however used the metric algorithm to produce et a maps in the metric algorithm 1 km by 1 km daily satellite images are used at this scale a mixed combination of crops is found in one pixel in order to develop a more realistic representation rsrc developed et a estimates were compared with the weighted average of irrigation requirements ir based on the relative area of each crop adopted from the land use maps the general assumption is that when the values from satellite images representing the actual crop water use et a are lower than the estimated irrigation requirements ir the crop has experienced stress from either insufficient irrigation or other poor management measures 5 results 5 1 cropwat ir vs et a estimations from fao ihe study actual crop water use can vary spatially even for the same crop at the basin the same is true for the potential crop water requirement they are not the same across the basin because of the variability of weather parameters as well as estimated effective precipitation it will end up having a range of different irrigation requirements ir for the same crop across the basin as a result comparison of actual crop water use and estimations of irrigation demands can have practical merits in evaluation of the status of water management for different locations and the areas of possible improvements rs techniques were used to estimate actual crop water use based on ground energy balance for the entire lake urmia basin in addition ground climatological data from 21 weather stations scattered throughout the basin were used to estimate irrigation requirements under no stress conditions these two representative estimations for each station are compared here to make an assessment in general of crop water management in different regions across the basin the results showed that irrigation requirements varied widely for different regions within across the basin and even between the two years which indicates the need for better representation of climatic disparity in estimating the crop water use in different areas cherif et al 2015 also maintain that when estimating actual water use and irrigation requirement on a regional scale the spatial variability of the weather parameters is important and thus closer attention to the meteorological input data is required estimated wheat irrigation requirement ir ranges from 459 mm in sarab to 720 mm in maragheh in 2013 2014 and from 411 mm in oshnaviyeh to 752 mm at ajabshir in 2014 2015 fig 5a b whereas estimated actual water use was ranged between 483 and 778 mm in 2013 2014 and between 513 and 756 mm in 2014 2015 fig 5a b irrigation requirement for sugar beets varied from 631 to 911 mm in 2013 14 and from 541 to 852 mm in 2014 2015 fig 5c d for sugar beets crop actual water use was estimated to range between 512 and 756 mm in 2013 2014 and between 585 and 872 mm at in 2014 2015 fig 5c d irrigation requirement ir and actual water use et a for both wheat and sugar beets as major crops in the basin are also graphically compared for different regions in figs 5 and 6 it is evident that in 2013 14 crop water demand for wheat was entirely satisfied in all regions when et a is greater than ir it indicates that over irrigation has occurred leading to excessive actual evapotranspiration maximum irrigation should be limited to satisfy the potential crop water requirements crop water requirement is even curtailed to irrigation demand when effective precipitation is taken into consideration in the drier water years as in 2013 14 despite having lower rainfalls dam reservoirs are normally filled up at the expense of lower reduced water release to the lake on the other hand additional water is freely supplemented for irrigation from groundwater all in all applied irrigation is not necessarily limited even in dry years in 2014 15 the actual water use was also higher than irrigation demand even though it was a wetter year higher seasonal and effective precipitations in theory reduces the requirements for full irrigation but the traditional farmers do not take the precipitations into account and the fields are routinely irrigated according to the assigned turns and water shares and not necessarily based on calculated irrigation requirements surprisingly enough in oshnavieh heris and miandoab excessive irrigation amounted to 40 30 and 25 these are clear examples of the grounds for improved water savings for sugar beets in 2014 15 actual crop water use was also more than what was actually necessary for most regions except for bonab takab and sahand figs 5 and 6 these observations can be attributed to excessive irrigation application sugar beet is a comparatively more water demanding crop and economical has a higher value the general belief of traditional farmers is the more you water the more production this is especially encouraged for higher value crops in 2013 14 having lower precipitations estimated irrigation requirement was higher than rs observed actual crop water use in the entire basin which is interpreted as irrigation deficiency present findings revealed et maps generated that with the aid of landsat satellite images were able to well represent the spatial and temporal distribution of the crop water use values throughout the urmia lake basin for the cropping pattern well complied by with the land use maps developed for the basin tasumi 2019 showed that a good correlation exists between the monthly evapotranspiration et a obtained using landsat 8 satellite imagery and metric model with the independent estimation of et using the fao 56 approach in the western part of urmia lake basin also reported high correlation coefficient between the actual evapotranspiration et a values using sebal algorithm and modis satellite images and et c values of penman monteith method fao 56 in gavkhouni basin in central iran elnmer et al 2019 used the fao penman monteith method to validate the derived et a from the sebal algorithm the results showed that the sebal algorithm with landsat 8 images provided an acceptable estimation of the spatial and temporal distributions of et a in semi arid regions such as the nile delta in egypt crop water use and crop water requirement could also reliably be used in water management studies including irrigation water management and operation of irrigation networks the observed differences in irrigation requirement ir etc peff and actual water use were defined as relative irrigation applied ir et a ir in percentage ir irrigation requirement and p eff effective precipitation this calculated value for wheat ranged between 5 sarab and 24 heris in 2013 2014 and between 42 oshnaviyeh and 7 miandoab in 2014 2015 the relative difference for sugar beet ranges between was 5 heris and 21 sahand maragheh in 2013 2014 and from 23 miandoab and heris to 7 sahand in 2014 2015 fig 6 the negative values could either be due to over estimation of et a or to over irrigation which results in excessive wetting of fields direct field observations are needed for more verifications distribution of actual evapotranspiration and relative irrigation deficiency indicates that water is being excessively applied specially in upstream regions proper valuation of et c depends on accurate estimation of et 0 and representative crop coefficient for each phenological stage rana and katerji 2000 in this study introduction of climatological data collected from multiple weather stations better reflect the variation in crop water demand in the region as was documented cropwat 8 0 estimates the irrigation requirements derived from the crop water requirement et c and effective precipitations p eff under optimum conditions and in the absence of water salinity or nutrient stresses whereas satellite images detect the actual crop water use et a of actual fields operated under a range of management practices which could lead to a variety of crop stresses imposed either intentionally or otherwise overall results of this study indicate that farmers are generally over irrigating their lands at the expense of depriving the historical share of lake water rights in addition farmers often refer to groundwater to supplement their limited surface water rights for the areas where actual crop water use et a was lower than the irrigation demand ir it shows that crop has been under stress either from irrigation deficiency or mismanagements resulting in salinity or nutrients stresses aksu and arikan 2017 mohammed et al 2018 salinity is not generally a problem for agricultural land in urmia lake the basin but problems with improper water allocation commonly occurs especially in lower sections of irrigation schemes 5 2 cropwat ir estimation vs et a from rsrc study in arid and semiarid regions et a values can vary widely depending on the water regimes moreover a change in one weather parameter can readily affect all other parameters because they are mutually related this is one of the problems in correctly evaluating et a estimations using rs techniques in this study data collected from several weather stations throughout the urmia lake basin and weighted average of crop water demand for the large pixels depicted in rsrc study were used to better represent climate variability and crop water demand within the basin in the rsrc study et a maps are produced using coarse pixels at 1 km scale at this scale a mixed combination of crops exists in one single pixel therefore for the sake of comparison a more realistic weighted average of irrigation requirement ir were considered the results showed that the highest irrigation requirement ir weighted values were for tabriz 615 mm and salmas 564 mm stations in 2013 2014 and for tabriz 547 mm and azarshahr 535 mm stations in 2014 2015 the lowest ir weighted values were observed at bostanabad 341 mm and shahindej 348 mm stations in 2013 2014 and at saghez 293 mm and takab 341 mm in 2014 2015 respectively fig 7a b the results for the 21 stations showed that ir weighted values varied widely for different regions within the basin and even between years the highest et a values estimated from rsrc studies were for tabriz and salmas at 598 and 585 mm in 2013 2014 and tabriz and malekan at 632 and 592 mm in 2014 2015 respectively the lowest et a values were recorded at saghez and bokan in 2013 14 420 and 398 mm respectively and at takab and shahindej in 2014 15 423 and 418 mm respectively fig 7a b by comparing the results from fao ihe and rsrc we conclude that the rsrc method overpredicts the actual crop water use in the fao ihe study predictions are made on 30 m 30 m scale therefore the type of crop associated with the pixel is highly accurate in addition ir and eta comparisons were made for wheat and sugar beets only whereas in rsrc the detected pixels were at 1 km 1 km scale as a result a mixed combination of crops was observed using the land use maps to obtain a more realistic prediction for irrigation demand at this scale all covered crops and their proportional share in irrigation demand should be verified this is especially true for the share of the higher demanding crops such as orchards alfalfa which cover a major part of agricultural lands in the region more specifically in orchard in addition to the huge old apple trees that are often heavily flood irrigated alfalfa is grown between the rows which result in higher than predicted actual crop water use observed by remote sensing the relative irrigation deficiency as defined above between the ir and rsrc models was from 4 at bostanabad station to 22 at azarshahr in 2013 2014 and from 1 at takab and salmas to 22 at azarshahr in 2014 2015 fig 8 these results indicate that in most areas the irrigation requirements were satisfied whereas in some areas irrigation was not sufficient the results of this study present the variability in crop water demand in addition to sufficiency of irrigation supply at different locations within the basin unreliable rainfall and particularly lack of reliable et dataset can also lead to the over underestimation of irrigation javadian et al 2019 in the urmia lake basin javadian et al 2019 applied the metric model with modis imagery 1 km resolution to estimate et a in basin scale the results showed that modis based et a maps provided useful information for large scale water balance and hydrology while the coarse spatial resolution prevents quantitative and accurate assessment of the et a estimations allen et al 2007 suggest the metric model is able to captures the water stress condition of the crops via et our assessment of irrigation requirements does not account for water stressed crops çetin and köksal 2018 also showed that the et a value estimated with the metric model was slightly greater than the total quantity of the water to be converted into et within minöz stream watershed in turkey such an error was probably resulted from improper representation of the meteorological data used in the study for the watershed in general and for different micro meteorological sections of the watershed cherif et al 2015 in addition some errors can be attributed to selection of hot and cold pixels for internal calibration of the metric javadian et al 2019 incompliance of assumptions and coefficients of metric model with the watershed conditions can also result in some inaccuracy of results çetin and köksal 2018 although there are uncertainties in terms of the accuracy assessment of this approach the comparison results indicate effective estimation of et a in the urmia lake basin tasumi 2019 and the gareh bygone plain in southern iran jamshidi et al 2019 5 3 analysis of actual crop water use in rainfed lands the basic assumption is that in rainfed lands actual crop water use cannot be more than the amount of seasonal precipitation the available data on actual crop water use from rs studies were compared with recorded rainfalls for such comparison only estimations from the fao ihe were used in which the smaller 30 m 30 m pixels can be selected as solely rainfed using the land use maps precipitations differ widely throughout the basin and even between the two years fig 1 the 1 km by 1 km pixels used in rsrc study consists of mixed crop cover and cannot be used for the analysis of crop water use in rainfed regions results showed that the seasonal precipitation range from 227 to 581 mm in 2014 2015 and from 145 mm to 264 mm in 2013 2014 fig 9a b for rainfed lands actual water use was estimated between 168 and 410 mm at takab and oshnaviyeh in 2014 2015 and between 167 and 315 mm at sahand and in salmas 2013 2014 respectively fig 9a b the estimated crop water use on rainfed regions were found to be lower at some locations as compared with the amount of precipitation tasumi 2019 also showed that estimated et a from metric model and landsat 8 satellite imagery for rain fed wheat fields the western urmia lake basin had in good agreement with the evapotranspiration requirement of healthy wheat the et a estimated on rainfed land were higher than the amount of precipitation at salmas in 2013 2014 this cannot happen in real situations this discrepancy cannot readily be justified the land elevation and surface temperature are often reasons for misrepresentation of et a from landsat images and the sebal algorithm used in the fao ihe studies type of land use and terrain can have a direct effect on the spatial distribution of et a in addition there may have been errors in preparation of land use maps because of the difficulty to distinguish the rainfed from irrigated lands under wheat barley and pasture cultivation 4 summary and conclusions estimation of crop water use is necessary for assessment of the hydrological balance planning design management of irrigation systems many research studies in recent decades have focused to find solutions for the rapid desiccation of urmia lake caused by excessive and unsustainable upstream water abstraction proper allocation of limited renewable water resources especially in the agricultural sector is the key to solving the problem in the region a thorough study on the present situation of water allocation as compared to highly variable irrigation requirements can demonstrate the extent and location of mismanagement within the basin and provide possible solutions to the problem several studies have been conducted to estimate the evapotranspiration of major crops at different spatial scales in the basin the purpose of the present study was to put the available estimations of actual crop water use et a derived from two separate rsrc and fao ihe remote sensing studies in the urmia lake basin into perspective by comparison to the respective cropwat 8 0 estimated irrigation requirement ir the results of this analysis can have practical implications for improved management plans at local level estimation of crop water requirements often does not consider the natural variability of all factors to overcome this limitation data from 21 meteorological stations within the urmia lake basin for 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 were used observations showed that climatological data collected from multiple meteorological stations can better represent the water requirements of the major crops by accommodating the highly localized variability of climatic conditions at the basin level land use maps for wheat summer crops sugar beets were projected to satellite images to compare the et a with the corresponding ir estimations for different areas of the basin actual crop water use in rainfed regions were also compared with the natural precipitations irrigation requirements were generally lower than the actual crop water use estimated from remote sensing images the difference can be attributed to excessive applied irrigation commonly practiced in the region the objective of this study was to obtain as much practical information from estimations using localized ground based data and remote sensing techniques to detect the quality of water management of agricultural fields across the urmia lake basin more clearly based on this analysis the locations of over under irrigation were detected these observations provide means for improved water management to save water for the restoration of urmia lake which has shrunk drastically in the past few decades as more and more of lake water rights is directed away for other uses

corresponding author handling editor xiying zhang variable rate irrigation vri can effectively improve the irrigation efficiency in this study we evaluated the two key indicators irrigation uniformity and accuracy for a three span center pivot vri system with the combination of two sprinkler types i e the nelson d3000 a fixed spray plate sprinkler fsps and the r3000 a rotating spray plate sprinkler rsps two sets of irrigation depths designed for four management zones zones 1 4 of 10 8 15 and 20 mm and 10 15 20 and 25 mm and three cycle times cts of the solenoid valve of 30 45 and 60 s with constant rate irrigation cri as a reference in addition the radially affected lengths of irrigation depths in zones 1 4 under various vri treatments were further determined the radial mean cuh 90 8 and circumferential application uniformity mean cuh 95 6 as well as radial irrigation accuracy mean nrmse 15 3 of the r3000 were superior to those of d3000 under vri the irrigation uniformity and accuracy of each management zone were less impacted by the designed irrigation depth and ct but more affected by the location of the management zone the irrigation uniformity and accuracy of vri were close to those of cri indicating that the vri system tested could guarantee the same application performance as the cri system changing the d3000 sprinklers to r3000 sprinklers in the vri system effectively reduced the radially affected lengths of management zones the radially affected lengths of d3000 under various treatments were primarily distributed from 3 6 m whereas those of r3000 were 0 3 m thus it was recommended to select rspss in the design of the center pivot vri system and the transition zone and ct in relation to r3000 sprinklers were suggested to be 0 3 m and 60 s respectively this research provides the recommendations for better implementation of vri keywords variable rate irrigation center pivot irrigation system water application uniformity irrigation accuracy irrigation management zone 1 introduction as one of the most important execution platforms for efficient water saving irrigation the center pivot irrigation system has been quickly promoted since it was introduced to china in 1977 because of its high irrigation efficiency wide application range high degree of automation and extensive coverage of the irrigated area kranz et al 1992 king et al 2005 yan et al 2010 li et al 2017 by the end of 2019 it was estimated that approximately 18 000 center pivot and linear move irrigation systems were in use throughout the country the corresponding irrigated area was approximately 600 000 ha accounting for approximately 14 2 of china s total sprinkler irrigated area hui et al 2021 variable rate irrigation vri is an important topic in agricultural irrigation research and one of the core components of precision agriculture hedley and yule 2009 vories et al 2017 barker et al 2018 sharma and irmak 2020 it is defined as spatially varying irrigation application in ways that optimize plant responses for each unit of water applied site specific water application technology makes it possible to vary both water and agrochemicals to meet the specific needs of a crop in each unique zone within a field yan et al 2020 the high level of mechanization of the center pivot irrigation system provides a strong guarantee for the implementation of vri sui and yan 2017 andrade et al 2020 currently speed control and zone control are two main control methods to realize vri on the center pivot the speed control method varies the travel speed of the center pivot to deliver different application depths but the application depth remains uniform along the lateral pipe in contrast the zone control method can vary the watering application rates of different management zones along the lateral pipe and in the direction of pivot travel omary et al 1997 han et al 2009 chavez et al 2010 larue and evans 2012 o shaughnessy et al 2019 there are two low pressure sprinkler types commonly used on the center pivot which are fixed spray plate sprinklers fspss and rotating spray plate sprinklers rspss in general the rsps has larger average droplet diameter and higher energy consumption in addition to the characteristics of large spraying range low wind drift and evaporative losses wdels and relatively uniform water distribution hills and barragan 1998 faci et al 2001 ortíz et al 2009 chen et al 2020 whereas the cost of the fsps is lower than that of the rsps making it more competitive in the marketplace however this sprinkler type attains high instantaneous application rates and poor application uniformity which is prone to cause soil erosion and crop damage silva 2007 yan et al 2011 the uniformity and accuracy of applied water depths are crucial for center pivot vri systems zhao et al 2014 sui and fisher 2015 takács et al 2018 o shaughnessy et al 2019 the growth yield and quality of crops are related to the application uniformity and thus to the comprehensive benefits of vri systems irmak et al 2011 the accuracy of the system determines the irrigation efficiency the better the irrigation accuracy is the higher the irrigation efficiency attained the center pivot vri system s application uniformity and accuracy are affected by many factors such as equipment components operation management and weather conditions similar to conventional irrigation systems dukes and perry 2006 ortíz et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 meanwhile the various testing methods for the uniformity of center pivot irrigation systems with constant application rates have been successively proposed by iso 11545 2009 iso standards 2009 gb t 19797 2012 chinese standards 2012 and asae s436 1 asabe standards 2016 nevertheless there are currently no standard methods adaptable for vri systems several valuable studies have been conducted on the uniformity and accuracy of center pivot vri systems thus far sui and fisher 2015 evaluated the heermann and hein uniformity coefficient cuh of a four span commercial vri system under application rates of 0 30 50 70 and 100 of the maximum irrigation depth 25 4 mm the results showed that the application rate exerted a strong influence on cuh with a higher application rate leading to a higher cuh value o shaughnessy et al 2013 characterized the effects of wind speed and direction on the application uniformities and accuracies of three and six span center pivot vri systems they found that the cuh values of different application rates varied from 84 4 to 90 8 in windy conditions and when the wind speed exceeded 5 m s 1 the percent mean bias error and percent root mean square error of irrigation accuracy in the direction of pivot travel respectively ranged from 3 9 and 10 16 for catch cans arranged in grid and arc patterns dukes and perry 2006 investigated the vri uniformities of a four span center pivot irrigation system with various sprinkler types travel speeds and duty cycles dcs of the solenoid valve dc represents the ratio of on time to the sum of on and off times of the solenoid valve overall the cuh and lower quarter distribution uniformity coefficient dulq of all treatments averaged 93 and 90 respectively yari et al 2017 compared the uniformities and accuracies of a five span center pivot irrigation system using constant and variable application depths the results indicated that the cuh values of the two irrigation methods ranged from 89 0 to 93 5 and from 81 7 to 94 4 respectively they also observed that the greatest cuh 94 4 and lowest normalized root mean square error nrmse 7 0 were achieved with the 20 3 mm irrigation depth with the commercial vri package zhao et al 2014 reported that the cuh and dulq values of vri were reduced by 9 and 12 percentage points compared with constant rate irrigation cri due to the differences in application depth between adjacent management zones additionally the actual application depths under different vri treatments were observed to be underestimated by 1 46 mm compared to the designed irrigation depths on average the above research results provided key information regarding the improvement of center pivot vri systems and the formulation of uniformity testing standards however the effect of cycle times cts of the solenoid valve ct represents the sum of on time and off time of the solenoid valve has not been considered in the irrigation performance evaluation of vri systems the ct of the solenoid valve is highly related to its service life a larger ct corresponds to a lower switching frequency and a longer service life of the solenoid valve conversely a smaller ct can result in a higher switching frequency and a shorter service life of the solenoid valve if ct can be increased as much as possible while ensuring irrigation performance this is undoubtedly favorable for reducing the potential operating costs of vri systems based on this li et al 2015 analyzed the irrigation accuracies for a three span center pivot vri system under cts of 20 30 35 and 50 s they found that the accuracy of water applied could be increased by optimizing the cts of solenoid valves but information regarding irrigation uniformity was still not published o shaughnessy et al 2013 also believed that the further determination of the impact of cts on vri systems might be an area of future investigation the goals of this study were to assess the irrigation uniformity and accuracy using a modified three span center pivot vri system through the comparison of two sprinkler types the nelson d3000 fsps and r3000 rsps two sets of designed irrigation depths in the four management zones zones 1 4 of 10 8 15 and 20 mm and 10 15 20 and 25 mm and three cts of 30 45 and 60 s the specific objectives were 1 to evaluate the accuracies and uniformities of application depths within the four management zones along the lateral pipe and in the direction of pivot travel respectively with constant rate irrigation cri as a reference and 2 to determine the affected lengths of radial water depths within various management zones then quantify the relationship between irrigation uniformities along the lateral pipe and the radially affected lengths and finally propose an optimal sprinkler design to minimize transition zones between the adjacent management zones under vri 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and irrigation system description a field experiment was conducted in 2020 at the zhuozhou experimental station of china agricultural university hebei china with geographical coordinates of 39 27 n latitude and 115 51 e longitude and an elevation 42 m above mean sea level the experimental area is located in a typical temperate monsoon climatic zone in a continental semi humid region with a summer precipitation pattern the annual mean precipitation is 560 mm 50 75 of which falls between july and august wang et al 2020 a hobo u30 automated weather station onset computer co ma usa was used in the experiment to collect the weather data within 100 m of the measuring site a three span center pivot irrigation system modern agricultural equipment co ltd beijing china was used in the experiment the center pivot was 140 m long of which the first span second span third span and overhang lengths were 37 38 50 and 15 m respectively there were a total of 34 drop hoses along the lateral pipe of which the average spacing of drop hoses on the first span second span and third span was 4 2 m and the average spacing of drop hoses on the overhang was 2 8 m this differed from the sprinkler spacing of 1 52 m used in the study by o shaughnessy et al 2013 mainly because of the different specification parameters among the center pivot manufacturers each drop hose was equipped with a sprinkler 1 2 m above the ground and with a 20 psi 138 kpa pressure regulator nelson irrigation corp walla walla washington usa to maintain a consistent ﬂow rate the travel speed of the center pivot could be adjusted by a percent timer the maximum travel speed of the end tower was 2 14 m min 1 when the percent timer setting pts was 100 and the corresponding irrigation depth was the smallest at 4 5 mm under an inlet ﬂow rate of the system of 45 m3 h 1 the water source of the center pivot was taken from groundwater during the irrigation test the groundwater was pressurized to the inlet of the system by a booster pump td nanfang pump industry co ltd hangzhou china equipped with a frequency converter acs510 asea brown boveri ltd zurich switzerland meanwhile the inlet pressure and ﬂow rate of the system were monitored in real time by a pressure gauge asmik mik px400 range 0 1 mpa accuracy of 0 5 and an ultrasonic ﬂowmeter letrue lcf u range 0 330 m3 h 1 accuracy of 2 respectively we also installed additional hardware to realize vri management of the center pivot a solenoid valve pgv hunter industries corp california usa was installed at the connection between each drop hose and the lateral pipe and every four solenoid valves shared a valve controller intelirri beijing technology co ltd beijing china as shown in fig 1a the on off cycle such as dc and ct of each solenoid valve could be independently controlled by a small wechat program on a smartphone thereby regulating the flow or pulsing rates through various sprinklers as shown in fig 1b 2 2 experimental design the types of sprinkler selected in this study were the nelson d3000 a fsps equipped with a 36 grooved blue plate and r3000 a rsps equipped with a brown plate two common low pressure sprinklers for center pivot irrigation systems according to the manufacturer s recommendation the nozzle diameters of d3000 sprinklers from the pivot point to end of the lateral pipe ranged from 1 79 to 7 34 mm nozzle number 9 to 37 while those of the r3000 sprinklers with 20 psi 138 kpa pressure regulators were in the range of 2 78 7 34 mm nozzle number 14 to 37 correspondingly the measured radii of throw of these two sprinklers along the lateral pipe were in the ranges of 3 50 8 82 m and 7 11 9 62 m respectively the specific nozzle diameter and radius of throw of each sprinkler on the center pivot are shown in fig 2 the irrigation test included vri and cri table 1 for the vri method the 34 sprinklers on the center pivot were divided into 4 management zones zones 1 4 along the lateral pipe in an attempt to facilitate the management of solenoid valves and reduce operation costs the length of each zone was 37 m 38 m 33 m and 32 m and its corresponding amount of sprinklers was 8 9 8 and 9 respectively therefore zone 1 and zone 2 directly corresponded to the area of the first span and second span and the boundary between zone 3 and zone 4 appeared at the third span with distance of 108 m from the center point there were two sets of designed irrigation depths for zones 1 4 10 8 15 and 20 mm and 10 15 20 and 25 mm used to compare the effects of different designed irrigation depths on the water distributions of four management zones in order to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the vri system these irrigation depths of different zones were mainly achieved by adjusting the percent timer setting pts of the system and duty cycle dc of the solenoid valve where a dc of 100 means constant rate irrigation a dc of 80 within a cycle time ct sum of the on time and off time of the solenoid valve of 60 s means 48 s on and 12 s off of the solenoid valve king et al 2005 first the pts values were determined to be 22 and 18 based on the maximum designed irrigation depths of zone 4 in sets 1 and 2 of 20 and 25 mm respectively then dcs in zone 4 were set to 100 to correspondingly adjust dcs in the other zones that is the dcs for zones 1 4 were 50 40 75 and 100 for set 1 and 40 60 80 and 100 for set 2 the main reasons for setting these two irrigation depths of 20 or 25 mm in zone 4 were that a single irrigation depth of 20 or 25 mm is often applied in north china and the irrigation amount should not be excessive to reduce the risk of surface runoff on the other hand the designed irrigation depths of the four management zones were randomly arranged and there was no intention to arrange deliberately the maximum designed irrigation depths 20 or 25 mm in zone 4 with the largest area furthermore cts of 30 45 and 60 s were considered in the vri test to analyze the influence of ct on the water distributions of different management zones and then determine the maximum ct value without reducing irrigation uniformity and accuracy for the cri method the 34 sprinklers on the center pivot were operated as one management zone and dc values of their solenoid valves were uniformly set to 100 to ensure that all sprinklers remained fully open during the irrigation test simultaneously in an attempt to provide a reference for vri the sprinkler type and pts of the center pivot selected in the cri test were the same as the vri that is the sprinkler types were nelson d3000 and r3000 respectively and the pts values were 18 and 22 with corresponding irrigation depths of 25 and 20 mm respectively 2 3 water distribution measurement the water distributions of both vri and cri were tested in the directions of pivot travel and along the lateral pipe as shown in fig 3 in the radial water distribution test 92 catch cans with an opening diameter of 215 mm and a height of 230 mm were uniformly arranged in two radial lines line 1 and line 2 at a spacing of 3 m the angle between the two lines was 12 and the first catch cans in line 1 and line 2 were 3 and 4 5 m from the pivot point respectively the purpose was to stagger the two lines of catch cans by a distance of 1 5 m to prevent interference with each other in the measurement which was in accordance with asae s436 1 asabe standards 2016 in contrast in the circumferential water distribution test the middle positions of the 4 management zones and the overhang were all prepared with a row of catch cans at 1 5 m intervals in the circumferential direction as a result a total of 5 rows of catch cans were arranged the distances from each row to the pivot point were 18 5 56 91 5 124 and 134 m corresponding to the numbers of catch cans of 6 9 12 15 and 18 respectively in summary a total of 150 catch cans were tested for the each combination of designed irrigation depths and cycle times similar measurement methods of the circumferential water distribution were also reported by yan 2004 and zhao et al 2014 the water distribution test began after all the catch cans were arranged in the test the center pivot was started at approximately 10 before passing the radial line to allow adequate time for the pulsing action of the solenoid valves to synchronize o shaughnessy et al 2013 sui and fisher 2015 to avoid the evaporation of water in the catch can affecting the test accuracy during the experiment as soon as a catch can was found to no longer accept the sprinkler water the volume of water collected in this catch can was quickly weighed using an electronic balance meilen mt202 range 0 30 kg accuracy of 0 1 g and then converted to the measured irrigation depth as depicted in table 2 most of tests were conducted in the early morning and evening in order to minimize evaporation and the weather of a few tests at noon and afternoon was cloudy with weak evaporation in addition all the tests were conducted under low wind average ws 1 0 m s 1 conditions with no rainfall r 0 and their average air temperatures and relative humidity were ranged from 25 4 30 1 and 45 8 92 2 respectively 2 4 irrigation uniformity and accuracy calculation a heermann and hein uniformity coefficient asabe standards 2016 was applied to evaluate the water application uniformity of vri and cri for a center pivot irrigation system which could be calculated by the following equation 1 cu h 1 i 1 m h i h s i i 1 m h i s i 100 where cuh is the heermann and hein uniformity coefficient si is the distance of the ith catch can from the pivot point m m is the number of catch cans hi is the measured water depth in the ith catch can mm and h is the weighted average water depth of all catch cans mm calculated as 2 h i 1 m h i s i i 1 m s i a lower quarter distribution uniformity coefficient dulq is another common indicator that reflects the uniformity of the center pivot dukes and perry 2006 this indicator can compensate for the inaccurate prediction of uniformity with cuh when the water depths of individual measuring points are much lower than the average value or even zero the dulq was calculated as 3 du lq i 1 n h i s i h i 1 n s i 100 where n is the number of the lowest one quarter of catch cans the coefficient of variation cv liu et al 2016 was used to evaluate the dispersion degree of water depths caught by the catch cans along the lateral pipe or in the direction of pivot travel 4 cv 1 m i 1 m h i o 2 o 100 where o is the measured average water depth of all catch cans mm the mean absolute error mae o shaughnessy et al 2013 was used to assess how close the measured water depths were to the predicted depths in different management zones 5 mae 1 m i 1 m p h i where p is the designed water depth mm the mean bias error mbe yari et al 2017 reflects the estimation accuracy of application depths of the irrigation system whereby underirrigation can be indicated by a positive value and overirrigation by a negative value 6 mbe 1 m i 1 m p h i the normalized root mean square error nrmse wang et al 2020 could be used to reflect the relative error between the designed and measured irrigation depths 7 nrmse 1 m i 1 m p h i 2 o 100 2 5 radially affected length determination the specific method for determining the radially affected length under vri was as follows o shaughnessy et al 2013 the first step was to exclude the water depth data of catch cans from both borders of the management zone pair by pair and to recalculate cuh until the cuh no longer changed significantly the second step was to multiply half of the number of excluded catch cans by the distance between the catch cans to obtain the radially affected length of each management zone 2 6 data analysis origin 8 5 software originlab northampton ma usa was employed to present the line graphs of radial water distribution for different treatments under vri and cri as well as the bar graphs of affected length cuh and change in cuh after excluding the affected water depths δcuh in each management zone under different vri conditions additionally multivariate analysis of variance anova was applied to evaluate the differences among treatments with respect to cv cuh dulq h mae mbe and nrmse of the radial and circumferential water depths under cri and vri as well as the radially affected length and δcuh under vri means were separated using fisher s protected lsd at the 0 05 level via spss 20 0 software ibm corp armonk ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of water application uniformity for irrigation systems 3 1 1 water distribution and application uniformity under constant rate irrigation water distribution characteristics are a critical indicator to evaluate the irrigation uniformity of center pivots ouazaa et al 2015 fig 4 illustrates the radial water distribution patterns of cri with two sprinkler types and two ptss it is clear that the variability of irrigation depths of d3000 sprinklers along the lateral pipe was greater than that of r3000 sprinklers regardless of the pts of the system this might have been the case due to the difference in spray plate structures of the two sprinklers as depicted in table 3 the cv values of radial water depths under 18 and 22 pts were 28 2 and 29 2 for d3000 respectively however the above cv values changed to 13 2 and 15 4 for r3000 a similar trend has been observed by other researchers li et al 2020 moreover from the perspective of radial water application uniformity r3000 was undoubtedly better than d3000 under different irrigation conditions for the two pts values the radial cuh and dulq values of r3000 were mainly distributed from 90 9 91 6 and 81 2 84 1 respectively which were 11 9 and 17 2 percentage points higher than those of d3000 on average table 3 these values compared well with the results reported by cai et al 2020 for a two span center pivot irrigation system using blue plate d3000 sprinklers and brown plate r3000 sprinklers with 15 psi 103 kpa pressure regulators as a consequence the selection of r3000 sprinklers on the center pivot could help reduce the variability of radial water distribution and improve the irrigation uniformity under cri further analysis of table 3 indicated that when the sprinkler types were the same no considerable differences in radial cv cuh and dulq values were observed between various ptss these outcomes suggested that the travel speed of the irrigation machine had little effect on the radial water distribution uniformity under cri which was consistent with the results reported by zhao et al 2014 but contrasted with the results reported by li et al 2020 the reason for this might be that the two ptss selected in this study were relatively close in addition although r3000 was superior to d3000 in the radial water application uniformity its irrigation depths were relative high within 17 6 m from the pivot point which increased the potential for surface runoff this was mainly because the foremost four theoretically designed nozzles diameters of 1 79 mm 9 1 79 mm 9 2 18 mm 11 and 2 58 mm 13 of r3000 sprinklers near the pivot point were recommended by the manufacturer to replace them with the nozzles of 2 78 mm 14 in diameter to ensure they could operate normally under the damping effect therefore in the design of the cri system the sprinkler configuration along the lateral pipe should start from the smaller nozzle diameter without influencing the irrigation uniformity meanwhile the apparently low radial irrigation depth beyond 135 m from the pivot point due to the insufficient overlap of sprinkler irrigation water was another point requiring attention fig 4 zhao et al 2014 table 4 illustrates the combined results for cv cuh and dulq for water depths in the direction of pivot travel with two sprinkler types and two ptss to determine the circumferential water distribution characteristics under different cri conditions overall both of the circumferential and radial water distributions were significantly p 0 05 better for r3000 than for d3000 in addition for any of the three indicators of cv cuh and dulq the r3000 circumferential differences between the two ptss were not significant p 0 05 but this was not the case for d3000 when the pts of d3000 increased its cvs increased significantly p 0 05 and cuh values decreased accordingly p 0 05 whereas the change in dulq values was no significant p 0 05 this outcome suggested that the circumferential water distributions of d3000 under cri were very sensitive to the travel speed of the system and the faster the travel speed was the poorer the water distributions further analysis of table 4 reveals that for different irrigation treatments high circumferential application uniformities generally occurred near the end tower while low uniformities occurred near the pivot point taking the cd 1 treatment as an example the circumferential cuh and dulq values were only 86 3 and 85 2 at a distance of 18 5 m from the pivot point but as high as 92 5 and 89 3 at a 124 m distance hanson and wallender 1986 believed that this was mainly because the end tower had extremely constant movement compared to that of the other towers moreover it was observed that the circumferential cuh and dulq values of the four treatments were much higher than their corresponding radial values table 3 indicating that under the same cri conditions the water distribution in the direction of pivot travel was always better than that along the lateral pipe this result was consistent with the findings of heermann and swedensky 1984 and zhao et al 2014 3 1 2 water distribution and application uniformity under variable rate irrigation because of the fundamental difference between vri and cri fig 5 illustrates the radial water distributions in four management zones of vri with two sprinkler types two sets of designed irrigation depths and three cts surprisingly the result that the radial water distribution of r3000 was superior to that of d3000 under cri was also applicable to vri as shown in table 5 the cv cuh and dulq values of radial water depths in different management zones ranged from 13 2 38 0 68 4 90 5 and 52 2 87 7 respectively for d3000 vd 1 to vd 6 however they were in the ranges of 6 2 22 2 85 3 95 0 and 81 0 92 4 respectively for r3000 vr 1 to vr 6 this indicated that the rotating spray plate sprinkler had the ability to function under both vri and cri conditions and was a good choice for engineering design additionally it was not difficult to observe from table 5 that the average cuh of vri decreased 84 8 vs 85 3 and the average dulq increased 76 9 vs 74 1 compared to those of cri in table 3 although the values were not significantly different p 0 05 results not presented thus the vri system tested in this paper could basically guarantee similar radial uniformity under cri as previously reported by dukes and perry 2006 moreover the effects of designed irrigation depth and ct on the radial water distributions within four management zones might be considered relatively weak fig 5 since there were no significant differences p 0 05 in the cv cuh and dulq values between the two sets of designed irrigation depths or between the three cts irrespective of the sprinkler type table 5 in fact this also implied that the vri system with d3000 or r3000 sprinklers could maintain similar radial irrigation uniformity regardless of which pts dc and ct were used thus exhibiting good agreement with the experimental observations of dukes and perry 2006 additionally a ct of 60 s is recommended in future vri projects to reduce the switching frequency of the solenoid valve due to the small effect of ct further analysis of fig 5 indicated that the uniformities cuh dulq of radial water depths among the four management zones exhibited a significant p 0 05 results not presented difference for any irrigation condition in regard to d3000 the radial uniformity of zone 2 remained the lowest mean cuh 74 4 and mean dulq 62 6 under different treatments with the highest in zone 3 mean cuh 82 2 and mean dulq 75 7 the uniformities of zone 1 and zone 4 were close and their average cuh and dulq values were maintained at 79 0 and 64 2 respectively in contrast the trend of r3000 seemed to be the opposite the radial cuh and dulq values of r3000 for zones 1 4 averaged 87 9 94 5 91 6 and 89 4 and 86 2 91 0 88 2 and 83 1 respectively for the various treatments table 5 taken together these results indicate that the radial application uniformity was highly impacted by the sprinkler type p 0 05 and the location of the management zone p 0 05 results not presented for a center pivot vri system table 6 illustrates the combined results for cv cuh and dulq of the circumferential water depths at five distances from the pivot point under various vri treatments appreciably the circumferential cv cuh and dulq values of the five distances were maintained at 6 7 26 5 81 1 95 1 and 73 2 91 6 respectively for d3000 vd 1 to vd 6 the corresponding values of r3000 vr 1 to vr 6 were 1 7 17 0 87 1 98 7 and 85 5 97 7 respectively meanwhile no appreciable differences p 0 05 were observed among the circumferential uniformity coefficients obtained from the two sets of designed irrigation depths or the three cts with the same sprinkler type table 6 these findings signified that except for the sprinkler type that could significantly alter the circumferential uniformities under vri conditions the effects of other operating parameters pts dc and ct were not significant this also signified that vri technology could eliminate the influence of pts on circumferential cuh of d3000 with respect to cri table 4 additionally for different irrigation treatments the mean cuh and dulq values of the five distances in the direction of pivot travel reached 88 2 and 83 7 respectively for d3000 and 95 6 and 94 1 respectively for r3000 the abovementioned values increased by 9 5 17 0 4 8 and 7 0 percentage points compared to the corresponding mean cuh and mean dulq values along the lateral pipe suggesting that regardless of cri or vri the circumferential uniformities were indeed superior to the radial uniformities especially for d3000 further analysis of tables 4 and 6 showed that there were no significant differences p 0 05 results not presented in the circumferential uniformities between the cri and vri taking r3000 as an example the mean cv 7 9 vs 5 9 mean cuh 94 2 vs 95 6 and mean dulq 92 0 vs 94 1 values in the direction of pivot travel were observed to be close between the two irrigation methods this outcome suggested that vri did not have an obvious effect on radial uniformity or circumferential uniformity which was consistent with the results of a previous study zhao et al 2014 3 2 evaluation of application depth accuracy for irrigation systems 3 2 1 accuracy of application depth under constant rate irrigation accuracy of the application depth is as important as the application uniformity and it is highly related to the irrigation efficiency of the sprinkler system and the growth of crops o shaughnessy et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 for purposes of evaluating the irrigation accuracy of cri the combined results for h mae mbe and nrmse of the radial water depths under cri with two sprinkler types and two ptss were analyzed and depicted in table 7 as expected the application accuracy mae nrmse of r3000 along the lateral pipe was superior to that of d3000 although there was no significant p 0 05 results not presented difference in h between the two sprinklers under the same pts for instance the d3000 mae and nrmse values of radial water depths under 18 pts were 5 3 mm and 32 7 which were 1 8 mm and 14 0 percentage points respectively larger than those of r3000 these outcomes suggested that r3000 offered absolute advantages in terms of both the accuracy and uniformity of radial water depths for cri conditions compared to d3000 moreover it should be emphasized that the mbe values in table 7 were positive indicating that overall the cri treatments selected in this paper all accomplished insufficient irrigation along the lateral pipe although r3000 might be slightly better fig 4c and d this was mainly because even if the average wind speed during the water distribution test was not above 1 m s 1 the low wind and high instantaneous wind would cause a certain wdels according to the research results of playán et al 2005 when the average wind speed was 0 75 m s 1 without evaporation at night the mean wdels of the irrigation machine was still 3 3 ortíz et al 2009 also reported that the mean wdels at the heights of 1 and 2 5 m were 9 2 and 13 6 for fspss and 8 2 and 12 5 for rspss under the average wind speeds of 1 4 6 2 m s 1 in addition to the wind the size of the catch can installation height of the sprinkler and measurement error all had the effects on actual irrigation depths table 7 further indicated that the mae mbe and nrmse values of radial water depths also decreased as pts increased for the same sprinkler type this signified that pts exerted some negative effects on the radial irrigation accuracy under cri which was consistent with the radial uniformity results overall sprinkler types had the significant p 0 05 effects on h mae mbe and nrmse of circumferential water depths but ptss had no significant p 0 05 effects on these indicators table 8 this result explained that the irrigation accuracies in the direction of pivot travel were little affected by the travel speed of the system under cri meanwhile this also implied that the superiority of r3000 was still obvious in the circumferential irrigation accuracy mean nrmse of 10 8 compared to that of d3000 mean nrmse of 24 5 further observation of table 8 shows that the circumferential application accuracies among the five distances from the pivot point were quite different with the same sprinkler type and pts there was basically a commonality among various irrigation treatments that is the distance of 18 5 m from the pivot point had the worst circumferential application accuracies mean nrmse of up to 29 3 and the best accuracies occurred at a distance of 124 or 134 m mean nrmse of only 11 4 this was not surprising since the circumferential water depths in the area close to the pivot point were too low and the maximum difference between h at 18 5 m from the pivot point and the designed irrigation depth under the four irrigation treatments could reach 28 4 in addition the reason for the best circumferential irrigation accuracies occurring at 124 or 134 m from the pivot point might be due to the proximity of these distances to the end tower hanson and wallender 1986 3 2 2 accuracy of application depth in variable rate irrigation table 9 illustrates the combined results for h mae mbe and nrmse of the radial water depths for four management zones under various vri conditions obviously the radial nrmse values of d3000 for different management zones were significantly p 0 05 higher than those of r3000 although the other evaluation indicators h mae mbe were not significantly p 0 05 different between the two sprinklers this outcome revealed that the sprinkler type was still a critical factor for the radial irrigation accuracy under vri which was in accordance with the cri results in addition no significant p 0 05 differences in any one of h mae mbe or nrmse of radial water depths were observed between the two sets of designed irrigation depths or among the three cts when the sprinkler type remained the same this indirectly explained that the changes in pts ct and dc exerted only minor influences on the radial irrigation accuracy for the same management zone under vri conditions in good agreement with the results reported by o shaughnessy et al 2013 further analysis of table 9 indicated that in addition to the sprinkler type having a significant impact on the radial irrigation accuracy under vri the location of the management zone was also a major influencing factor as far as the four management zones zones 1 4 were concerned the mean nrmses of the radial irrigation depths for various treatments were 34 1 32 6 22 4 and 32 9 respectively for d3000 whereas they were 18 7 9 4 11 6 and 21 6 respectively for r3000 on average the radial nrmse values of d3000 exceeded those of r3000 by 15 2 percentage points but both sprinklers had a common point that is large nrmse values generally occurred in the management zones near the two sides zone 1 and zone 4 while small nrmse values occurred within the middle two management zones zone 2 and zone 3 one possible explanation for this performance was the insufficient superposition of irrigation water near the pivot point and overhang end of the center pivot resulting in low radial irrigation accuracies on both sides moreover it should be emphasized that due to the different spraying methods of the two sprinkler types the minimum radial nrmse values of d3000 for the two sets of designed irrigation depths and three cts always appeared in zone 3 while those of r3000 corresponded to zone 2 on the one hand this finding supported the previous radial uniformity results obtained under vri conditions on the other hand it also showed that the irrigation accuracy and uniformity were highly related and that the better irrigation accuracy resulted in a higher uniformity and vice versa in good agreement with the observations of yari et al 2017 furthermore table 9 shows that the average radial mae and mbe values of zones 1 4 were 2 4 3 2 3 1 and 5 5 mm and 1 1 0 4 0 and 3 4 mm respectively for d3000 while the above values correspondingly changed to 1 6 0 9 1 6 and 3 5 mm and 0 4 0 1 0 3 and 3 2 mm respectively for r3000 these values compared well to the mae 1 9 to 2 6 mm and mbe 0 6 to 1 1 mm outcomes obtained by o shaughnessy et al 2013 using three and six span center pivot vri systems outfitted with fixed plate low drift nozzle sprinklers these values also implied that the radial mae and mbe values of other zones zones 1 3 except for zone 4 were obviously lower than those of cri table 7 thereby revealing that the overall irrigation depths under vri were relatively close to the design depths although zone 4 needed attention with respect to the insufficient irrigation as in cri table 10 further illustrates the combined results for h mae mbe and nrmse of the circumferential water depths at five distances from the pivot point under various vri treatments across all the evaluation indicators apart from mae of circumferential water depths there were no significant p 0 05 differences between sprinkler types or sets of designed irrigation depths or even cts except for individual treatments this finding revealed that vri treatments actually had little impact on the irrigation accuracies in the direction of pivot travel which signified that the switch of the fixed spray plate sprinkler to the rotating spray plate sprinkler might not bring about obvious change in the circumferential irrigation accuracy under vri conditions similar trends have been observed in the circumferential irrigation accuracy results of cri thereby suggesting that sprinkler types influenced the circumferential irrigation uniformity more than the circumferential irrigation accuracy regardless of cri or vri furthermore it was notable that the maximum nrmse values of d3000 mean value reached 40 8 under different treatments consistently occurred at a distance of 18 5 m among the five distances to the pivot point the nrmse values tended to taper off as the distance increased and finally stabilized at approximately 18 1 at 134 m in contrast the circumferential nrmse values of r3000 along the distance from the pivot point showed a normal distribution form namely the maximum nrmse values mean value up to 21 6 of various irrigation conditions basically appeared at the distance of 91 5 m whereas the other distances retained low level circumferential nrmse values 3 3 determination of radially affected length in variable rate irrigation in the vri test the radial irrigation depths at the borders of the four management zones could be affected due to their different designed irrigation depths determining the radial length for which the irrigation depth of each management zone was affected and setting it as a transition zone were of great significance to ensure water application uniformity o shaughnessy et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 fig 6 presents the combined results for the affected length cuh and δcuh of radial water depths in each management zone under various vri conditions appreciably radially affected lengths were large in relation to the low radial irrigation uniformities of d3000 whereas the radially affected lengths were short in relation to the high irrigation uniformities of r3000 this result suggested that by replacing the d3000 sprinklers with r3000 sprinklers in the vri system the radial application uniformity of each management zone could not only be significantly p 0 05 improved but the corresponding affected length would also be reduced in addition it was also observed that for the two sets of designed irrigation depths and three cts the radial application uniformities of d3000 showed obvious increasing trends after excluding the affected lengths however there were basically no changes for r3000 except in zone 4 fig 6b taking the vd 1 and vr 1 treatments as an example the δcuh values of zones 1 4 were 5 9 4 3 1 1 and 7 7 respectively and 1 3 1 2 0 8 and 3 7 respectively it was essential to note that the radial irrigation uniformities in some treatments were unexpectedly reduced when excluding their affected lengths this phenomenon was especially common in the use of r3000 sprinklers these findings signified that excluding the affected length of the management zone would not necessarily improve the radial uniformity under vri or that it might be reduced however the radial application uniformities both before and after the affected length was excluded were significantly p 0 05 results not presented better for r3000 than for d3000 due to the basic difference between the water distributions of the two sprinklers further analysis of fig 6 indicated that although there were significantly p 0 05 results not presented radial cuh differences among the four management zones for the same sprinkler type their affected lengths were similar among them the radially affected lengths of d3000 under various management zones were primarily distributed at 3 6 m whereas those of r3000 were in the range of 0 3 m these results implied that neither changing the location of the management zone nor adjusting the working parameters of the system such as pts ct and dc could shorten the radially affected length under vri the key to solving this problem was to replace the sprinkler type to improve the radial irrigation uniformity of each management zone as a consequence it is recommended to choose the r3000 sprinklers in the design of the three span center pivot vri system and the transition zone is suggested to be 0 3 m radial length similar data have been reported by other researchers o shaughnessy et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 4 summary and conclusions in vri the radial mean cuh 90 8 and circumferential application uniformity mean cuh 95 6 as well as radial irrigation accuracy mean nrmse 15 3 of r3000 were superior to those 78 7 88 2 and 30 5 of d3000 but there was basically no significant difference between the two sprinkler types in the circumferential irrigation accuracy moreover the designed irrigation depth and ct exerted not significant impacts on the irrigation uniformity and accuracy of each management zone along the lateral pipe or in the direction of pivot travel indicating that a ct of 60 s could be recommended in future vri projects to reduce the switching frequency of the solenoid valve due to the small effect of ct in contrast the location of the management zone was a major influencing factor for the radial application uniformity and accuracy except for the circumferential uniformity compared with those of cri the radial mean cuh 84 8 vs 85 3 and circumferential uniformity mean cuh 91 9 vs 90 8 as well as radial mean nrmse 22 9 vs 24 8 and circumferential accuracy mean nrmse 18 5 vs 17 6 of vri were similar these findings revealed that the vri system in this article could result in the same application uniformity and irrigation accuracy as the cri system replacing the d3000 sprinklers with r3000 sprinklers in the vri system could effectively reduce the radially affected lengths of management zones after removing the affected lengths the radial application uniformities of d3000 in various management zones showed an appreciable upward trend overall while those of r3000 remained almost unchanged however the radial uniformities both before and after the affected length was excluded were significantly better for r3000 than for d3000 moreover the location of the management zone and the working parameters of the vri system such as pts ct and dc had small effects on the radially affected length the radially affected lengths of d3000 under various management zones were primarily distributed at 3 6 m whereas those of r3000 were in the range of 0 3 m in summary it is recommended to choose rspss in the design of the three span center pivot vri system and the transition zone and ct in relation to r3000 are suggested to be 0 3 m and 60 s respectively this paper presents the results of water distribution characteristics of different management zones under a center pivot vri system these results can provide a basis information for the optimal design of the vri system but there are still some limitations the shape of management zone in vri in actual projects is often not as regular as that in this article due to factors such as soil texture topography crop types etc these different management zone shapes will result in different required irrigation depths and affected lengths for example the management zone in this paper is divided along the lateral pipe so only the radially affected length is considered if the management zone is also divided in the direction of pivot travel the circumferentially affected length will be occurred and considered in addition the effects of sprinkler spacing operating pressure and other parameters on the application uniformity and accuracy of vri are not discussed in this paper so further research is deserved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there

corresponding author handling editor xiying zhang variable rate irrigation vri can effectively improve the irrigation efficiency in this study we evaluated the two key indicators irrigation uniformity and accuracy for a three span center pivot vri system with the combination of two sprinkler types i e the nelson d3000 a fixed spray plate sprinkler fsps and the r3000 a rotating spray plate sprinkler rsps two sets of irrigation depths designed for four management zones zones 1 4 of 10 8 15 and 20 mm and 10 15 20 and 25 mm and three cycle times cts of the solenoid valve of 30 45 and 60 s with constant rate irrigation cri as a reference in addition the radially affected lengths of irrigation depths in zones 1 4 under various vri treatments were further determined the radial mean cuh 90 8 and circumferential application uniformity mean cuh 95 6 as well as radial irrigation accuracy mean nrmse 15 3 of the r3000 were superior to those of d3000 under vri the irrigation uniformity and accuracy of each management zone were less impacted by the designed irrigation depth and ct but more affected by the location of the management zone the irrigation uniformity and accuracy of vri were close to those of cri indicating that the vri system tested could guarantee the same application performance as the cri system changing the d3000 sprinklers to r3000 sprinklers in the vri system effectively reduced the radially affected lengths of management zones the radially affected lengths of d3000 under various treatments were primarily distributed from 3 6 m whereas those of r3000 were 0 3 m thus it was recommended to select rspss in the design of the center pivot vri system and the transition zone and ct in relation to r3000 sprinklers were suggested to be 0 3 m and 60 s respectively this research provides the recommendations for better implementation of vri keywords variable rate irrigation center pivot irrigation system water application uniformity irrigation accuracy irrigation management zone 1 introduction as one of the most important execution platforms for efficient water saving irrigation the center pivot irrigation system has been quickly promoted since it was introduced to china in 1977 because of its high irrigation efficiency wide application range high degree of automation and extensive coverage of the irrigated area kranz et al 1992 king et al 2005 yan et al 2010 li et al 2017 by the end of 2019 it was estimated that approximately 18 000 center pivot and linear move irrigation systems were in use throughout the country the corresponding irrigated area was approximately 600 000 ha accounting for approximately 14 2 of china s total sprinkler irrigated area hui et al 2021 variable rate irrigation vri is an important topic in agricultural irrigation research and one of the core components of precision agriculture hedley and yule 2009 vories et al 2017 barker et al 2018 sharma and irmak 2020 it is defined as spatially varying irrigation application in ways that optimize plant responses for each unit of water applied site specific water application technology makes it possible to vary both water and agrochemicals to meet the specific needs of a crop in each unique zone within a field yan et al 2020 the high level of mechanization of the center pivot irrigation system provides a strong guarantee for the implementation of vri sui and yan 2017 andrade et al 2020 currently speed control and zone control are two main control methods to realize vri on the center pivot the speed control method varies the travel speed of the center pivot to deliver different application depths but the application depth remains uniform along the lateral pipe in contrast the zone control method can vary the watering application rates of different management zones along the lateral pipe and in the direction of pivot travel omary et al 1997 han et al 2009 chavez et al 2010 larue and evans 2012 o shaughnessy et al 2019 there are two low pressure sprinkler types commonly used on the center pivot which are fixed spray plate sprinklers fspss and rotating spray plate sprinklers rspss in general the rsps has larger average droplet diameter and higher energy consumption in addition to the characteristics of large spraying range low wind drift and evaporative losses wdels and relatively uniform water distribution hills and barragan 1998 faci et al 2001 ortíz et al 2009 chen et al 2020 whereas the cost of the fsps is lower than that of the rsps making it more competitive in the marketplace however this sprinkler type attains high instantaneous application rates and poor application uniformity which is prone to cause soil erosion and crop damage silva 2007 yan et al 2011 the uniformity and accuracy of applied water depths are crucial for center pivot vri systems zhao et al 2014 sui and fisher 2015 takács et al 2018 o shaughnessy et al 2019 the growth yield and quality of crops are related to the application uniformity and thus to the comprehensive benefits of vri systems irmak et al 2011 the accuracy of the system determines the irrigation efficiency the better the irrigation accuracy is the higher the irrigation efficiency attained the center pivot vri system s application uniformity and accuracy are affected by many factors such as equipment components operation management and weather conditions similar to conventional irrigation systems dukes and perry 2006 ortíz et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 meanwhile the various testing methods for the uniformity of center pivot irrigation systems with constant application rates have been successively proposed by iso 11545 2009 iso standards 2009 gb t 19797 2012 chinese standards 2012 and asae s436 1 asabe standards 2016 nevertheless there are currently no standard methods adaptable for vri systems several valuable studies have been conducted on the uniformity and accuracy of center pivot vri systems thus far sui and fisher 2015 evaluated the heermann and hein uniformity coefficient cuh of a four span commercial vri system under application rates of 0 30 50 70 and 100 of the maximum irrigation depth 25 4 mm the results showed that the application rate exerted a strong influence on cuh with a higher application rate leading to a higher cuh value o shaughnessy et al 2013 characterized the effects of wind speed and direction on the application uniformities and accuracies of three and six span center pivot vri systems they found that the cuh values of different application rates varied from 84 4 to 90 8 in windy conditions and when the wind speed exceeded 5 m s 1 the percent mean bias error and percent root mean square error of irrigation accuracy in the direction of pivot travel respectively ranged from 3 9 and 10 16 for catch cans arranged in grid and arc patterns dukes and perry 2006 investigated the vri uniformities of a four span center pivot irrigation system with various sprinkler types travel speeds and duty cycles dcs of the solenoid valve dc represents the ratio of on time to the sum of on and off times of the solenoid valve overall the cuh and lower quarter distribution uniformity coefficient dulq of all treatments averaged 93 and 90 respectively yari et al 2017 compared the uniformities and accuracies of a five span center pivot irrigation system using constant and variable application depths the results indicated that the cuh values of the two irrigation methods ranged from 89 0 to 93 5 and from 81 7 to 94 4 respectively they also observed that the greatest cuh 94 4 and lowest normalized root mean square error nrmse 7 0 were achieved with the 20 3 mm irrigation depth with the commercial vri package zhao et al 2014 reported that the cuh and dulq values of vri were reduced by 9 and 12 percentage points compared with constant rate irrigation cri due to the differences in application depth between adjacent management zones additionally the actual application depths under different vri treatments were observed to be underestimated by 1 46 mm compared to the designed irrigation depths on average the above research results provided key information regarding the improvement of center pivot vri systems and the formulation of uniformity testing standards however the effect of cycle times cts of the solenoid valve ct represents the sum of on time and off time of the solenoid valve has not been considered in the irrigation performance evaluation of vri systems the ct of the solenoid valve is highly related to its service life a larger ct corresponds to a lower switching frequency and a longer service life of the solenoid valve conversely a smaller ct can result in a higher switching frequency and a shorter service life of the solenoid valve if ct can be increased as much as possible while ensuring irrigation performance this is undoubtedly favorable for reducing the potential operating costs of vri systems based on this li et al 2015 analyzed the irrigation accuracies for a three span center pivot vri system under cts of 20 30 35 and 50 s they found that the accuracy of water applied could be increased by optimizing the cts of solenoid valves but information regarding irrigation uniformity was still not published o shaughnessy et al 2013 also believed that the further determination of the impact of cts on vri systems might be an area of future investigation the goals of this study were to assess the irrigation uniformity and accuracy using a modified three span center pivot vri system through the comparison of two sprinkler types the nelson d3000 fsps and r3000 rsps two sets of designed irrigation depths in the four management zones zones 1 4 of 10 8 15 and 20 mm and 10 15 20 and 25 mm and three cts of 30 45 and 60 s the specific objectives were 1 to evaluate the accuracies and uniformities of application depths within the four management zones along the lateral pipe and in the direction of pivot travel respectively with constant rate irrigation cri as a reference and 2 to determine the affected lengths of radial water depths within various management zones then quantify the relationship between irrigation uniformities along the lateral pipe and the radially affected lengths and finally propose an optimal sprinkler design to minimize transition zones between the adjacent management zones under vri 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and irrigation system description a field experiment was conducted in 2020 at the zhuozhou experimental station of china agricultural university hebei china with geographical coordinates of 39 27 n latitude and 115 51 e longitude and an elevation 42 m above mean sea level the experimental area is located in a typical temperate monsoon climatic zone in a continental semi humid region with a summer precipitation pattern the annual mean precipitation is 560 mm 50 75 of which falls between july and august wang et al 2020 a hobo u30 automated weather station onset computer co ma usa was used in the experiment to collect the weather data within 100 m of the measuring site a three span center pivot irrigation system modern agricultural equipment co ltd beijing china was used in the experiment the center pivot was 140 m long of which the first span second span third span and overhang lengths were 37 38 50 and 15 m respectively there were a total of 34 drop hoses along the lateral pipe of which the average spacing of drop hoses on the first span second span and third span was 4 2 m and the average spacing of drop hoses on the overhang was 2 8 m this differed from the sprinkler spacing of 1 52 m used in the study by o shaughnessy et al 2013 mainly because of the different specification parameters among the center pivot manufacturers each drop hose was equipped with a sprinkler 1 2 m above the ground and with a 20 psi 138 kpa pressure regulator nelson irrigation corp walla walla washington usa to maintain a consistent ﬂow rate the travel speed of the center pivot could be adjusted by a percent timer the maximum travel speed of the end tower was 2 14 m min 1 when the percent timer setting pts was 100 and the corresponding irrigation depth was the smallest at 4 5 mm under an inlet ﬂow rate of the system of 45 m3 h 1 the water source of the center pivot was taken from groundwater during the irrigation test the groundwater was pressurized to the inlet of the system by a booster pump td nanfang pump industry co ltd hangzhou china equipped with a frequency converter acs510 asea brown boveri ltd zurich switzerland meanwhile the inlet pressure and ﬂow rate of the system were monitored in real time by a pressure gauge asmik mik px400 range 0 1 mpa accuracy of 0 5 and an ultrasonic ﬂowmeter letrue lcf u range 0 330 m3 h 1 accuracy of 2 respectively we also installed additional hardware to realize vri management of the center pivot a solenoid valve pgv hunter industries corp california usa was installed at the connection between each drop hose and the lateral pipe and every four solenoid valves shared a valve controller intelirri beijing technology co ltd beijing china as shown in fig 1a the on off cycle such as dc and ct of each solenoid valve could be independently controlled by a small wechat program on a smartphone thereby regulating the flow or pulsing rates through various sprinklers as shown in fig 1b 2 2 experimental design the types of sprinkler selected in this study were the nelson d3000 a fsps equipped with a 36 grooved blue plate and r3000 a rsps equipped with a brown plate two common low pressure sprinklers for center pivot irrigation systems according to the manufacturer s recommendation the nozzle diameters of d3000 sprinklers from the pivot point to end of the lateral pipe ranged from 1 79 to 7 34 mm nozzle number 9 to 37 while those of the r3000 sprinklers with 20 psi 138 kpa pressure regulators were in the range of 2 78 7 34 mm nozzle number 14 to 37 correspondingly the measured radii of throw of these two sprinklers along the lateral pipe were in the ranges of 3 50 8 82 m and 7 11 9 62 m respectively the specific nozzle diameter and radius of throw of each sprinkler on the center pivot are shown in fig 2 the irrigation test included vri and cri table 1 for the vri method the 34 sprinklers on the center pivot were divided into 4 management zones zones 1 4 along the lateral pipe in an attempt to facilitate the management of solenoid valves and reduce operation costs the length of each zone was 37 m 38 m 33 m and 32 m and its corresponding amount of sprinklers was 8 9 8 and 9 respectively therefore zone 1 and zone 2 directly corresponded to the area of the first span and second span and the boundary between zone 3 and zone 4 appeared at the third span with distance of 108 m from the center point there were two sets of designed irrigation depths for zones 1 4 10 8 15 and 20 mm and 10 15 20 and 25 mm used to compare the effects of different designed irrigation depths on the water distributions of four management zones in order to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the vri system these irrigation depths of different zones were mainly achieved by adjusting the percent timer setting pts of the system and duty cycle dc of the solenoid valve where a dc of 100 means constant rate irrigation a dc of 80 within a cycle time ct sum of the on time and off time of the solenoid valve of 60 s means 48 s on and 12 s off of the solenoid valve king et al 2005 first the pts values were determined to be 22 and 18 based on the maximum designed irrigation depths of zone 4 in sets 1 and 2 of 20 and 25 mm respectively then dcs in zone 4 were set to 100 to correspondingly adjust dcs in the other zones that is the dcs for zones 1 4 were 50 40 75 and 100 for set 1 and 40 60 80 and 100 for set 2 the main reasons for setting these two irrigation depths of 20 or 25 mm in zone 4 were that a single irrigation depth of 20 or 25 mm is often applied in north china and the irrigation amount should not be excessive to reduce the risk of surface runoff on the other hand the designed irrigation depths of the four management zones were randomly arranged and there was no intention to arrange deliberately the maximum designed irrigation depths 20 or 25 mm in zone 4 with the largest area furthermore cts of 30 45 and 60 s were considered in the vri test to analyze the influence of ct on the water distributions of different management zones and then determine the maximum ct value without reducing irrigation uniformity and accuracy for the cri method the 34 sprinklers on the center pivot were operated as one management zone and dc values of their solenoid valves were uniformly set to 100 to ensure that all sprinklers remained fully open during the irrigation test simultaneously in an attempt to provide a reference for vri the sprinkler type and pts of the center pivot selected in the cri test were the same as the vri that is the sprinkler types were nelson d3000 and r3000 respectively and the pts values were 18 and 22 with corresponding irrigation depths of 25 and 20 mm respectively 2 3 water distribution measurement the water distributions of both vri and cri were tested in the directions of pivot travel and along the lateral pipe as shown in fig 3 in the radial water distribution test 92 catch cans with an opening diameter of 215 mm and a height of 230 mm were uniformly arranged in two radial lines line 1 and line 2 at a spacing of 3 m the angle between the two lines was 12 and the first catch cans in line 1 and line 2 were 3 and 4 5 m from the pivot point respectively the purpose was to stagger the two lines of catch cans by a distance of 1 5 m to prevent interference with each other in the measurement which was in accordance with asae s436 1 asabe standards 2016 in contrast in the circumferential water distribution test the middle positions of the 4 management zones and the overhang were all prepared with a row of catch cans at 1 5 m intervals in the circumferential direction as a result a total of 5 rows of catch cans were arranged the distances from each row to the pivot point were 18 5 56 91 5 124 and 134 m corresponding to the numbers of catch cans of 6 9 12 15 and 18 respectively in summary a total of 150 catch cans were tested for the each combination of designed irrigation depths and cycle times similar measurement methods of the circumferential water distribution were also reported by yan 2004 and zhao et al 2014 the water distribution test began after all the catch cans were arranged in the test the center pivot was started at approximately 10 before passing the radial line to allow adequate time for the pulsing action of the solenoid valves to synchronize o shaughnessy et al 2013 sui and fisher 2015 to avoid the evaporation of water in the catch can affecting the test accuracy during the experiment as soon as a catch can was found to no longer accept the sprinkler water the volume of water collected in this catch can was quickly weighed using an electronic balance meilen mt202 range 0 30 kg accuracy of 0 1 g and then converted to the measured irrigation depth as depicted in table 2 most of tests were conducted in the early morning and evening in order to minimize evaporation and the weather of a few tests at noon and afternoon was cloudy with weak evaporation in addition all the tests were conducted under low wind average ws 1 0 m s 1 conditions with no rainfall r 0 and their average air temperatures and relative humidity were ranged from 25 4 30 1 and 45 8 92 2 respectively 2 4 irrigation uniformity and accuracy calculation a heermann and hein uniformity coefficient asabe standards 2016 was applied to evaluate the water application uniformity of vri and cri for a center pivot irrigation system which could be calculated by the following equation 1 cu h 1 i 1 m h i h s i i 1 m h i s i 100 where cuh is the heermann and hein uniformity coefficient si is the distance of the ith catch can from the pivot point m m is the number of catch cans hi is the measured water depth in the ith catch can mm and h is the weighted average water depth of all catch cans mm calculated as 2 h i 1 m h i s i i 1 m s i a lower quarter distribution uniformity coefficient dulq is another common indicator that reflects the uniformity of the center pivot dukes and perry 2006 this indicator can compensate for the inaccurate prediction of uniformity with cuh when the water depths of individual measuring points are much lower than the average value or even zero the dulq was calculated as 3 du lq i 1 n h i s i h i 1 n s i 100 where n is the number of the lowest one quarter of catch cans the coefficient of variation cv liu et al 2016

radially affected length under vri was as follows o shaughnessy et al 2013 the first step was to exclude the water depth data of catch cans from both borders of the management zone pair by pair and to recalculate cuh until the cuh no longer changed significantly the second step was to multiply half of the number of excluded catch cans by the distance between the catch cans to obtain the radially affected length of each management zone 2 6 data analysis origin 8 5 software originlab northampton ma usa was employed to present the line graphs of radial water distribution for different treatments

multivariate analysis of variance anova was applied to evaluate the differences among treatments with respect to cv cuh dulq h mae mbe and nrmse of the radial and circumferential water depths under

discussion 3 1 evaluation of water application uniformity for irrigation systems 3 1 1 water distribution and application uniformity under constant rate irrigation water distribution characteristics are a critical indicator to evaluate the irrigation uniformity of center pivots ouazaa et al 2015 fig 4 illustrates the radial water distribution patterns of cri with two sprinkler types and two ptss it is clear that the variability of irrigation depths of d3000 sprinklers along the lateral pipe was greater than that of r3000 sprinklers regardless of the pts of the system this might have been the case due to the difference in spray plate structures of the two sprinklers as depicted in table 3 the cv values of radial water depths under 18 and 22 pts were 28 2 and 29 2 for d3000 respectively however the above cv values changed to 13 2 and 15 4 for r3000 a similar trend has been observed by other researchers li et al 2020 moreover from the perspective of radial water application uniformity r3000 was undoubtedly better than d3000 under different irrigation conditions for the two pts values the radial cuh and dulq values of r3000 were mainly distributed from 90 9 91 6 and 81 2 84 1 respectively which were 11 9 and 17 2 percentage points higher than those of d3000 on average table 3 these values compared well with the results reported by cai et al 2020 for a two span center pivot irrigation system using blue plate d3000 sprinklers and brown plate r3000 sprinklers with 15 psi 103 kpa pressure regulators as a consequence the selection of r3000 sprinklers on the center pivot could help reduce the variability of radial water distribution and improve the irrigation uniformity under cri further analysis of table 3 indicated that when the sprinkler types were the same no considerable differences in radial cv cuh and dulq values were observed between various ptss these outcomes suggested that the travel speed of the irrigation machine had little effect on the radial water distribution uniformity under cri which was consistent with the results reported by zhao et al 2014 but contrasted with the results reported by li et al 2020 the reason for this might be that the two ptss selected in this study were relatively close in addition although r3000 was superior to d3000 in the radial water application uniformity its irrigation depths were relative high within 17 6 m from the pivot point which increased the potential for surface runoff this was mainly because the foremost four theoretically designed nozzles diameters of 1 79 mm 9 1 79 mm 9 2 18 mm 11 and 2 58 mm 13 of r3000 sprinklers near the pivot point were recommended by the manufacturer to replace them with the nozzles of 2 78 mm 14 in diameter to ensure they could operate normally under the damping effect therefore in the design of the cri system the sprinkler configuration along the lateral pipe should start from the smaller nozzle diameter without influencing the irrigation uniformity meanwhile the apparently low radial irrigation depth beyond 135 m from the pivot point due to the insufficient overlap of sprinkler irrigation water was another point requiring attention fig 4 zhao et al 2014 table 4 illustrates the combined results for cv cuh and dulq for water depths in the direction of pivot travel with two sprinkler types and two ptss to determine the circumferential water distribution characteristics under different cri conditions overall both of the circumferential and radial water distributions were significantly p 0 05 better for r3000 than for d3000 in addition for any of the three indicators of cv cuh and dulq the r3000 circumferential differences between the two ptss were not significant p 0 05 but this was not the case for d3000 when the pts of d3000 increased its cvs increased significantly p 0 05 and cuh values decreased accordingly p 0 05 whereas the change in dulq values was no significant p 0 05 this outcome suggested that the circumferential water distributions of d3000 under cri were very sensitive to the travel speed of the system and the faster the travel speed was the poorer the water distributions further analysis of table 4 reveals that for different irrigation treatments high circumferential application uniformities generally occurred near the end tower while low uniformities occurred near the pivot point taking the cd 1 treatment as an example the circumferential cuh and dulq values were only 86 3 and 85 2 at a distance of 18 5 m from the pivot point but as high as 92 5 and 89 3 at a 124 m distance hanson and wallender 1986 believed that this was mainly because the end tower had extremely constant movement compared to that of the other towers moreover it was observed that the circumferential cuh and dulq values of the four treatments were much higher than their corresponding radial values table 3 indicating that under the same cri conditions the water distribution in the direction of pivot travel was always better than that along the lateral pipe this result was consistent with the findings of heermann and swedensky 1984 and zhao et al 2014 3 1 2 water distribution and application uniformity under variable rate irrigation because of the fundamental difference between vri and cri fig 5 illustrates the radial water distributions in four management zones of vri with two sprinkler types two sets of designed irrigation depths and three cts surprisingly the result that the radial water distribution of r3000 was superior to that of d3000 under cri was also applicable to vri as shown in table 5 the cv cuh and dulq values of radial water depths in different management zones ranged from 13 2 38 0 68 4 90 5 and 52 2 87 7 respectively for d3000 vd 1 to vd 6 however they were in the ranges of 6 2 22 2 85 3 95 0 and 81 0 92 4 respectively for r3000 vr 1 to vr 6 this indicated that the rotating spray plate sprinkler had the ability to function under both vri and cri conditions and was a good choice for engineering design additionally it was not difficult to observe from table 5 that the average cuh of vri decreased 84 8 vs 85 3 and the average dulq increased 76 9 vs 74 1 compared to those of cri in table 3 although the values were not significantly different p 0 05 results not presented thus the vri system tested in this paper could basically guarantee similar radial uniformity under cri as previously reported by dukes and perry 2006 moreover the effects of designed irrigation depth and ct on the radial water distributions within four management zones might be considered relatively weak fig 5 since there were no significant differences p 0 05 in the cv cuh and dulq values between the two sets of designed irrigation depths or between the three cts irrespective of the sprinkler type table 5 in fact this also implied that the vri system with d3000 or r3000 sprinklers could maintain similar radial irrigation uniformity regardless of which pts dc and ct were used thus exhibiting good agreement with the experimental observations of dukes and perry 2006 additionally a ct of 60 s is recommended in future vri projects to reduce the switching frequency of the solenoid valve due to the small effect of ct further analysis of fig 5 indicated that the uniformities cuh dulq of radial water depths among the four management zones exhibited a significant p 0 05 results not presented difference for any irrigation condition in regard to d3000 the radial uniformity of zone 2 remained the lowest mean cuh 74 4 and mean dulq 62 6 under different treatments with the highest in zone 3 mean cuh 82 2 and mean dulq 75 7 the uniformities of zone 1 and zone 4 were close and their average cuh and dulq values were maintained at 79 0 and 64 2 respectively in contrast the trend of r3000 seemed to be the opposite the radial cuh and dulq values of r3000 for zones 1 4 averaged 87 9 94 5 91 6 and 89 4 and 86 2 91 0 88 2 and 83 1 respectively for the various treatments table 5 taken together these results indicate that the radial application uniformity was highly impacted by the sprinkler type p 0 05 and the location of the management zone p 0 05 results not presented for a center pivot vri system table 6 illustrates the combined results for cv cuh and dulq of the circumferential water depths at five distances from the pivot point under various vri treatments appreciably the circumferential cv cuh and dulq values of the five distances were maintained at 6 7 26 5 81 1 95 1 and 73 2 91 6 respectively for d3000 vd 1 to vd 6 the corresponding values of r3000 vr 1 to vr 6 were 1 7 17 0 87 1 98 7 and 85 5 97 7 respectively meanwhile no appreciable differences p 0 05 were observed among the circumferential uniformity coefficients obtained from the two sets of designed irrigation depths or the three cts with the same sprinkler type table 6 these findings signified that except for the sprinkler type that could significantly alter the circumferential uniformities under vri conditions the effects of other operating parameters pts dc and ct were not significant this also signified that vri technology could eliminate the influence of pts on circumferential cuh of d3000 with respect to cri table 4 additionally for different irrigation treatments the mean cuh and dulq values of the five distances in the direction of pivot travel reached 88 2 and 83 7 respectively for d3000 and 95 6 and 94 1 respectively for r3000 the abovementioned values increased by 9 5 17 0 4 8 and 7 0 percentage points compared to the corresponding mean cuh and mean dulq values along the lateral pipe suggesting that regardless of cri or vri the circumferential uniformities were indeed superior to the radial uniformities especially for d3000 further analysis of tables 4 and 6 showed that there were no significant differences p 0 05 results not presented in the circumferential uniformities between the cri and vri taking r3000 as an example the mean cv 7 9 vs 5 9 mean cuh 94 2 vs 95 6 and mean dulq 92 0 vs 94 1 values in the direction of pivot travel were observed to be close between the two irrigation methods this outcome suggested that vri did not have an obvious effect on radial uniformity or circumferential uniformity which was consistent with the results of a previous study zhao et al 2014 3 2 evaluation of application depth accuracy for irrigation systems 3 2 1 accuracy of application depth under constant rate irrigation accuracy of the application depth is as important as the application uniformity and it is highly related to the irrigation efficiency of the sprinkler system and the growth of crops o shaughnessy et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 for purposes of evaluating the irrigation accuracy of cri the combined results for h mae mbe and nrmse of the radial water depths under cri with two sprinkler types and two ptss were analyzed and depicted in table 7 as expected the application accuracy mae nrmse of r3000 along the lateral pipe was superior to that of d3000 although there was no significant p 0 05 results not presented difference in h between the two sprinklers under the same pts for instance the d3000 mae and nrmse values of radial water depths under 18 pts were 5 3 mm and 32 7 which were 1 8 mm and 14 0 percentage points respectively larger than those of r3000 these outcomes suggested that r3000 offered absolute advantages in terms of both the accuracy and uniformity of radial water depths for cri conditions compared to d3000 moreover it should be emphasized that the mbe values in table 7 were positive indicating that overall the cri treatments selected in this paper all accomplished insufficient irrigation along the lateral pipe although r3000 might be slightly better fig 4c and d this was mainly because even if the average wind speed during the water distribution test was not above 1 m s 1 the low wind and high instantaneous wind would cause a certain wdels according to the research results of playán et al 2005 when the average wind speed was 0 75 m s 1 without evaporation at night the mean wdels of the irrigation machine was still 3 3 ortíz et al 2009 also reported that the mean wdels at the heights of 1 and 2 5 m were 9 2 and 13 6 for fspss and 8 2 and 12 5 for rspss under the average wind speeds of 1 4 6 2 m s 1 in addition to the wind the size of the catch can installation height of the sprinkler and measurement error all had the effects on actual irrigation depths table 7 further indicated that the mae mbe and nrmse values of radial water depths also decreased as pts increased for the same sprinkler type this signified that pts exerted some negative effects on the radial irrigation accuracy under cri which was consistent with the radial uniformity results overall sprinkler types had the significant p 0 05 effects on h mae mbe and nrmse of circumferential water depths but ptss had no significant p 0 05 effects on these indicators table 8 this result explained that the irrigation accuracies in the direction of pivot travel were little affected by the travel speed of the system under cri meanwhile this also implied that the superiority of r3000 was still obvious in the circumferential irrigation accuracy mean nrmse of 10 8 compared to that of d3000 mean nrmse of 24 5 further observation of table 8 shows that the circumferential application accuracies among the five distances from the pivot point were quite different with the same sprinkler type and pts there was basically a commonality among various irrigation treatments that is the distance of 18 5 m from the pivot point had the worst circumferential application accuracies mean nrmse of up to 29 3 and the best accuracies occurred at a distance of 124 or 134 m mean nrmse of only 11 4 this was not surprising since the circumferential water depths in the area close to the pivot point were too low and the maximum difference between h at 18 5 m from the pivot point and the designed irrigation depth under the four irrigation treatments could reach 28 4 in addition the reason for the best circumferential irrigation accuracies occurring at 124 or 134 m from the pivot point might be due to the proximity of these distances to the end tower hanson and wallender 1986 3 2 2 accuracy of application depth in variable rate irrigation table 9 illustrates the combined results for h mae mbe and nrmse of the radial water depths for four management zones under various vri conditions obviously the radial nrmse values of d3000 for different management zones were significantly p 0 05 higher than those of r3000 although the other evaluation indicators h mae mbe were not significantly p 0 05 different between the two sprinklers this outcome revealed that the sprinkler type was still a critical factor for the radial irrigation accuracy under vri which was in accordance with the cri results in addition no significant p 0 05 differences in any one of h mae mbe or nrmse of radial water depths were observed between the two sets of designed irrigation depths or among the three cts when the sprinkler type remained the same this indirectly explained that the changes in pts ct and dc exerted only minor influences on the radial irrigation accuracy for the same management zone under vri conditions in good agreement with the results reported by o shaughnessy et al 2013 further analysis of table 9 indicated that in addition to the sprinkler type having a significant impact on the radial irrigation accuracy under vri the location of the management zone was also a major influencing factor as far as the four management zones zones 1 4 were concerned the mean nrmses of the radial irrigation depths for various treatments were 34 1 32 6 22 4 and 32 9 respectively for d3000 whereas they were 18 7 9 4 11 6 and 21 6 respectively for r3000 on average the radial nrmse values of d3000 exceeded those of r3000 by 15 2 percentage points but both sprinklers had a common point that is large nrmse values generally occurred in the management zones near the two sides zone 1 and zone 4 while small nrmse values occurred within the middle two management zones zone 2 and zone 3 one possible explanation for this performance was the insufficient superposition of irrigation water near the pivot point and overhang end of the center pivot resulting in low radial irrigation accuracies on both sides moreover it should be emphasized that due to the different spraying methods of the two sprinkler types the minimum radial nrmse values of d3000 for the two sets of designed irrigation depths and three cts always appeared in zone 3 while those of r3000 corresponded to zone 2 on the one hand this finding supported the previous radial uniformity results obtained under vri conditions on the other hand it also showed that the irrigation accuracy and uniformity were highly related and that the better irrigation accuracy resulted in a higher uniformity and vice versa in good agreement with the observations of yari et al 2017 furthermore table 9 shows that the average radial mae and mbe values of zones 1 4 were 2 4 3 2 3 1 and 5 5 mm and 1 1 0 4 0 and 3 4 mm respectively for d3000 while the above values correspondingly changed to 1 6 0 9 1 6 and 3 5 mm and 0 4 0 1 0 3 and 3 2 mm respectively for r3000 these values compared well to the mae 1 9 to 2 6 mm and mbe 0 6 to 1 1 mm outcomes obtained by o shaughnessy et al 2013 using three and six span center pivot vri systems outfitted with fixed plate low drift nozzle sprinklers these values also implied that the radial mae and mbe values of other zones zones 1 3 except for zone 4 were obviously lower than those of cri table 7 thereby revealing that the overall irrigation depths under vri were relatively close to the design depths although zone 4 needed attention with respect to the insufficient irrigation as in cri table 10 further illustrates the combined results for h mae mbe and nrmse of the circumferential water depths at five distances from the pivot point under various vri treatments across all the evaluation indicators apart from mae of circumferential water depths there were no significant p 0 05 differences between sprinkler types or sets of designed irrigation depths or even cts except for individual treatments this finding revealed that vri treatments actually had little impact on the irrigation accuracies in the direction of pivot travel which signified that the switch of the fixed spray plate sprinkler to the rotating spray plate sprinkler might not bring about obvious change in the circumferential irrigation accuracy under vri conditions similar trends have been observed in the circumferential irrigation accuracy results of cri thereby suggesting that sprinkler types influenced the circumferential irrigation uniformity more than the circumferential irrigation accuracy regardless of cri or vri furthermore it was notable that the maximum nrmse values of d3000 mean value reached 40 8 under different treatments consistently occurred at a distance of 18 5 m among the five distances to the pivot point the nrmse values tended to taper off as the distance increased and finally stabilized at approximately 18 1 at 134 m in contrast the circumferential nrmse values of r3000 along the distance from the pivot point showed a normal distribution form namely the maximum nrmse values mean value up to 21 6 of various irrigation conditions basically appeared at the distance of 91 5 m whereas the other distances retained low level circumferential nrmse values 3 3 determination of radially affected length in variable rate irrigation in the vri test the radial irrigation depths at the borders of the four management zones could be affected due to their different designed irrigation depths determining the radial length for which the irrigation depth of each management zone was affected and setting it as a transition zone were of great significance to ensure water application uniformity o shaughnessy et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 fig 6 presents the combined results for the affected length cuh and δcuh of radial water depths in each management zone under various vri conditions appreciably radially affected lengths were large in relation to the low radial irrigation uniformities of d3000 whereas the radially affected lengths were short in relation to the high irrigation uniformities of r3000 this result suggested that by replacing the d3000 sprinklers with r3000 sprinklers in the vri system the radial application uniformity of each management zone could not only be significantly p 0 05 improved but the corresponding affected length would also be reduced in addition it was also observed that for the two sets of designed irrigation depths and three cts the radial application uniformities of d3000 showed obvious increasing trends after excluding the affected lengths however there were basically no changes for r3000 except in zone 4 fig 6b taking the vd 1 and vr 1 treatments as an example the δcuh values of zones 1 4 were 5 9 4 3 1 1 and 7 7 respectively and 1 3 1 2 0 8 and 3 7 respectively it was essential to note that the radial irrigation uniformities in some treatments were unexpectedly reduced when excluding their affected lengths this phenomenon was especially common in the use of r3000 sprinklers these findings signified that excluding the affected length of the management zone would not necessarily improve the radial uniformity under vri or that it might be reduced however the radial application uniformities both before and after the affected length was excluded were significantly p 0 05 results not presented better for r3000 than for d3000 due to the basic difference between the water distributions of the two sprinklers further analysis of fig 6 indicated that although there were significantly p 0 05 results not presented radial cuh differences among the four management zones for the same sprinkler type their affected lengths were similar among them the radially affected lengths of d3000 under various management zones were primarily distributed at 3 6 m whereas those of r3000 were in the range of 0 3 m these results implied that neither changing the location of the management zone nor adjusting the working parameters of the system such as pts ct and dc could shorten the radially affected length under vri the key to solving this problem was to replace the sprinkler type to improve the radial irrigation uniformity of each management zone as a consequence it is recommended to choose the r3000 sprinklers in the design of the three span center pivot vri system and the transition zone is suggested to be 0 3 m radial length similar data have been reported by other researchers o shaughnessy et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 4 summary and conclusions in vri the radial mean cuh 90 8 and circumferential application uniformity mean cuh 95 6 as well as radial irrigation accuracy mean nrmse 15 3 of r3000 were superior to those 78 7 88 2 and 30 5 of d3000 but there was basically no significant difference between the two sprinkler types in the circumferential irrigation accuracy moreover the designed irrigation depth and ct exerted not significant impacts on the irrigation uniformity and accuracy of each management zone along the lateral pipe or in the direction of pivot travel indicating that a ct of 60 s could be recommended in future vri projects to reduce the switching frequency of the solenoid valve due to the small effect of ct in contrast the location of the management zone was a major influencing factor for the radial application uniformity and accuracy except for the circumferential uniformity compared with those of cri the radial mean cuh 84 8 vs 85 3 and circumferential uniformity mean cuh 91 9 vs 90 8 as well as radial mean nrmse 22 9 vs 24 8 and circumferential accuracy mean nrmse 18 5 vs 17 6 of vri were similar these findings revealed that the vri system in this article could result in the same application uniformity and irrigation accuracy as the cri system replacing the d3000 sprinklers with r3000 sprinklers in the vri system could effectively reduce the radially affected lengths of management zones after removing the affected lengths the radial application uniformities of d3000 in various management zones showed an appreciable upward trend overall while those of r3000 remained almost unchanged however the radial uniformities both before and after the affected length was excluded were significantly better for r3000 than for d3000 moreover the location of the management zone and the working parameters of the vri system such as pts ct and dc had small effects on the radially affected length the radially affected lengths of d3000 under various management zones were primarily distributed at 3 6 m whereas those of r3000 were in the range of 0 3 m in summary it is recommended to choose rspss in the design of the three span center pivot vri system and the transition zone and ct in relation to r3000 are suggested to be 0 3 m and 60 s respectively this paper presents the results of water distribution characteristics of different management zones under a center pivot vri system these results can provide a basis information for the optimal design of the vri system but there are still some limitations the shape of management zone in vri in actual projects is often not as regular as that in this article due to factors such as soil texture topography crop types etc these different management zone shapes will result in different required irrigation depths and affected lengths for example the management zone in this paper is divided along the lateral pipe so only the radially affected length is considered if the management zone is also divided in the direction of pivot travel the circumferentially affected length will be occurred and considered in addition the effects of sprinkler spacing operating pressure and other parameters on the application uniformity and accuracy of vri are not discussed in this paper so further research is deserved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there

socioeconomic importance for brazil and most of its cultivation is basically carried out by small family farmers vianna et al 2013 especially in the semi arid region of bahia this region accounted for 90 6 and 95 3 of the national production in the 2017 18 and 2018 19 seasons respectively representing a 4 7 increase compared to the previous crop ibge 2019 thus due to the good adaptation to the agroclimatic conditions of the semi arid region of bahia castor bean is a viable option for generating energy employment and income contributing to keeping local workers in rural areas and being able to promote urban exodus other advantages are the harvest season which occurs in the dry period when few crops can be harvested and the use of its cake which is used as fertilizer with high commercial value castor oil for having peculiar properties viscosity and 90 concentration of ricinoleic fatty acid is considered noble oil and one of the most versatile in nature which enables it to meet different market niches renewable product with high added value for a wide range of industrial uses with utility only comparable to that of petroleum azevedo et al 2007 the constant dry spells observed during rainy seasons in the semi arid region of bahia especially in the last six years have caused the death of plants in different activities cultivation of grain crops fruit growing and forestry these facts increase the importance of creating a much more adequate agricultural system starting with soil management and selection of cultivars more adapted to these conditions especially water scarcity thus characterizing castor bean cultivars regarding water use efficiency wue is a determining factor for selecting those that will adapt to the conditions of water scarcity and poor rainfall distribution of the semi arid region of bahia however wue should be estimated by means of soil water balance evaluating the processes of water entry and exit in a soil cultivated with the crop in the layer containing more than 95 of its root system since the spatial variation of soils in the semi arid region is relatively high soil water balance carried out in an agricultural system is a study that encompasses soil plant and atmospheric conditions under anthropic interventions related to soil and crop management the specificities of each stage are preponderant for the hydraulic behavior of this system such as soil physical quality related to soil texture and structure chemical quality biological quality and their interactions with plant development plant morphology and atmospheric conditions mainly related to the temporal distribution of rainfall as well as solar radiation and wind speed associated with relative air humidity the relationship between high wind speeds and low relative humidity in the semi arid region of bahia is preponderant for the removal of water from the cultivation system for a detailed study of this soil plant atmosphere system the water balance must integrate all processes involving water entries and exits in the system subjected to the peculiarities of meteorological phenomena soil attributes and genetic characteristics of the

including with determination of saturated and non saturated soil hydraulic conductivity by the field method instantaneous profile and with daily estimates of the water balance components with the creation of a castor bean breeding program started in 2014 it is important to evaluate important agronomic characteristics of the possible parent genotypes especially regarding water use efficiency as castor bean is an alternative for crop diversification in the semi arid region of brazil for this numerous cultivars have been evaluated with a view to detailing their behavior regarding water relations therefore the aim of the study was to evaluate the wue of castor bean cultivars more adapted to the agroclimatic conditions of the semi arid region of bahia through the characterization of all soil water balance components 2 material and methods the experiment was set up in the experimental area of federal institute of education science and technology if baiano campus of guanambi ba brazil geographic coordinates 14 13 30 s 42 46 53 w altitude of 525 m average rainfall of 663 69 mm and average temperature of 26 c the soil in the experimental area is classified as latossolo

energy and ag ima 110 204 respectively was evaluated based on the components of soil water balance and their wue was calculated water balance components were measured daily starting from the period when plants had nine true leaves and ending at the time of harvest of secondary racemes thus the components were integrated into six periods following the specificities of each phenological stage of the cultivars table 1 2 1 crop planting and cultural practices soil tillage consisted of scarification harrowing and furrowing after that approximately 2 5 kg of bovine manure were distributed and incorporated into the site corresponding to each plant three seeds were manually sown at 0 05 m depth each experimental plot was composed of 15 plants with 2 1 m spacing top dressing fertilization was performed 25 days after seedling emergence applying 9 g plant 1 of urea and after fruiting of the primary raceme 18 g plant 1 of urea and 2 kg ha 1 of boric acid to induce the production of more vigorous secondary and tertiary racemes and avoid fruit abortion respectively according to the recommendation for the crop and soil chemical analysis table 2 at 25 days after sowing das thinning was performed using pruning shears cutting the less vigorous plants below the cotyledonary leaves and leaving only one plant per pit weeding was carried out twice in the crown projection area and mowing was performed between rows leaving the straw on the soil the first one before top dressing fertilization and the second one at 80 das to control spontaneous plants in the plots with shorter plants since these are not as efficient in covering the area under such spacing conditions 2 2 soil physical hydraulic characterization soil physical hydraulic characterization consisted of the determination of particle size distribution bulk density water retention curve hydraulic conductivity moisture profile and water storage these last two being determined using an fdr probe pr2 6 model for which a specific calibration curve was constructed for the soil under study to determine soil bulk density undisturbed samples were collected at depths of 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 m with an uhland sampler using volumetric cylinders with approximately 0 05 m height and diameter and dried in an oven at 105 c until reaching constant weight blake and hartge 1986 for particle size analysis and textural classification disturbed soil samples were collected in the same layers considered for bulk density determination the pipette method was used gee and or 2002 and the dispersing solution was prepared with 4 g l 1 sodium hydroxide and 10 g l 1 sodium hexametaphosphate in the procedure 40 g of soil 250 ml of distilled water and 100 ml of dispersing solution were used soil water retention curves were constructed for the same depths selected to determine bulk density using soil samples with the same technical parameters and prepared in the same way as those used for bulk density determination after these procedures the samples were placed in haines funnels which were used for the tensions of 0 5 1 3 5 7 and 10 kpa and weighed on a precision scale 2 digits after stabilization at the respective tensions the experimental points of the driest portion of the retention curve were determined using the psychrometer wp4 c klein et al 2010 soil water retention curves were fitted using the model of van genuchten 1980 soil hydraulic conductivity at 0 6 m depth was determined by the instantaneous profile method brito et al 2009 ghiberto et al 2011 the soil column was saturated until it reached the highest value of soil water content indicated by the reading taken in tensiometers and corresponding to zero matric potential saturated soil after adequate saturation was performed and after the water depth on the soil column had infiltrated a waterproof tarpaulin was placed on the soil in order to avoid the entry of water rainfall and exit of water evaporation as the aim is to study the process of water redistribution in the soil from that moment on tensiometer readings were performed every hour on the first day after the beginning of the water redistribution process in the soil profile and from the second day onwards readings were performed less frequently the k θ function was calculated by this method using eq 1 1 k θ 0 z d θ d t d z d φ t d z to determine internal drainage id and capillary rise cr two sets of tensiometers were installed at depths of 0 5 and 0 7 m with one access tube for the fdr probe in each experimental plot and the tensiometers were used to determine the matric potential and subsequent calculation of the total soil water potential matric potential gravitational potential and the total water potential gradient in the access tube the sensor reading at 0 6 m from the probe was used to estimate the water content through the specific calibration curve for the 0 6 m depth internal drainage or capillary rise was quantified daily and integrated for phenological periods of interest using the darcy buckingham model 2 q z k θ ϕ t 0 5 ϕ t 0 7 0 2 where ϕt is the total soil water potential at depths of 0 5 and 0 7 m obtained by summing the matric potentials calculated from tensiometer readings and gravitational potential the constant 0 2 is the vertical distance m between the center of the tensiometer porous cups and k θ is the soil hydraulic conductivity calculated by eq 1 from the water content estimated by the retention curve using the matric potential readings of the tensiometer installed at 0 6 m depth a capacitance probe frequency domain reflectometry fdr pr2 6 model was used to determine the moisture profile and subsequent water storage the probe was calibrated for the soil under study using regression analysis between water content m3 m 3 and readings with the probe mv since there is a reduction of accuracy in weathered soils with high levels of iron oxides and under specific types of management silva et al 2012 silva júnior et al 2013 which can change pore size density and distribution oliveira et al 2020 this calibration was performed in the border area of the experiment access tubes were installed in the experimental plots to perform the reading at depths of 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 6 m thus water storage in the soil profile was calculated by the trapezoid method according to libardi 2012 supplemental irrigation was applied with a drip system at a rate of 2 52 mm day 1 rainfall p was measured by a weather station installed in the experimental area the total production of castor bean is obtained for many cultivars by harvesting primary secondary and tertiary racemes along the crop cycle to measure the yield the primary secondary and tertiary racemes of the 15 plants of each experimental plot were manually harvested and the berries were peeled in a mechanical peeler specific to the castor bean crop the yield of the cultivars was estimated by the type of raceme primary secondary and tertiary and the sum was considered the total yield 2 3 crop actual evapotranspiration etr and water use efficiency wue the actual evapotranspiration of the crop was calculated by the soil water balance equation since all other processes of the balance were monitored daily with the etr calculated daily this process was integrated for the evaluation period 3 etr p i cr id h where p is rainfall i is irrigation cr is capillary rise id is internal drainage and δh is water storage variation water use efficiency wue is the ratio between yield y and etr according to eq 4 4 wue y et r 2 4 data analysis data of soil water balance components were subjected to an exploratory analysis in the statistical program r r development core team 2019 to verify whether there were outliers and normal distribution of residuals using the packages mass venables and ripley 2002 and outliers komsta 2015 for cr and id the box cox transformation ln of cr and ln of id was used to normalize the residuals in addition to the shapiro wilk normality test and kolmogorov smirnov homoscedasticity test the statistical design was in randomized blocks in an 8 6 factorial scheme eight cultivars and six evaluation periods during the cycles of the cultivars anova and means comparison test tukey 5 significance level of all balance components were performed using the expdes pt package ferreira et al 2018 yield and wue data were subjected to the same analyses and tests but the design was only in randomized blocks 3 results and discussion soil bulk density at both depths is in a normal state in relation to soil texture table 3 however care should be taken with the 0 3 m depth as it is almost outside the appropriate range due to the history of use with predominant passes of a plowing harrow always at the same depth scarification performed in only one direction of the area was not enough to reduce density at this depth bulk density is affected by crops that alter the structure and consequently the arrangement and volume of pores these changes influence the important physical hydraulic attributes such as aeration porosity soil water retention water availability to plants and soil resistance to penetration alencar et al 2018 however there was no restriction to the full root development of the crop soil texture is sandy loam in the 0 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 2 m layers and sandy clay loam in the others table 3 adequate for the cultivation of castor bean promoting favorable development of its root system and enabling greater water storage in the soil especially in subsurface however the silt content can make this soil more prone to physical restrictions requiring greater attention with its management especially regarding the aspect of organic matter supply rotation with green manures and application of organic fertilizers to promote aggregation the average percentage of clay in the arable layer 0 0 0 2 m was 29 45 lower than that found in the 0 20 0 6 m layer the higher clay content in the 0 2 0 6 m layer promotes greater water retention in this layer making it very important for plant nutrition while it is essential to adjust the physical and chemical environment in this layer in order to enable greater exploration of the soil profile by the root system of the crop by observing the soil water retention curves swrc it is verified that even with a lower percentage of clay the saturated soil water content in the 0 0 0 2 m layer was higher 0 339 m3 m 3 compared to the others due to the higher organic matter content som and the lower bulk density compared to the 0 3 m depth table 4 since som promotes better soil structuring which is directly related to soil water storage however it is observed that the swrc slope was higher for this layer because clay is the active mineral particle of the soil responsible for greater water retention in the soil the depth of 0 4 m showed a slight reduction 9 61 in the saturated soil water content table 4 compared to the others because the increase in soil bulk density 1670 kg m 3 at the depth of 0 3 m is a limiting factor for water storage and redistribution in the soil profile the swrcs at depths of 0 5 and 0 6 m showed similar and intermediate saturation points in comparison to the other layers the accumulated rainfall from sowing to harvest was 379 37 mm of which 243 69 occurred until flowering fig 1 which would not be enough for castor bean to express its production potential therefore in the intervals of the rainy periods irrigation was essential for a significant yield and until flowering the accumulated irrigation was 178 25 mm totaling 421 mm irrigation rainfall in this interval the sum of rainfall and irrigation during the whole cycle was 740 97 mm however in the interval between the beginning of the rainy season and the sowing of castor bean there were rain events which totaled 170 mm since the soil has the function of storing and supplying water fig 1 the availability of water until flowering certainly exceeded the 500 mm required as proposed by távora 1982 ensuring good water conditions for the castor bean cultivars and hybrid to express their production potential the moisture profiles fig 2 refer to specific dates strategically chosen to represent the crop cycle showing the behavior of water in the soil at the beginning of the readings with the fdr probe 10 27 2018 at the beginning of the major stage fmr hmr 2nd period without rainfall 11 17 2019 at the end of the 4th period after a concentration of rain events 02 18 2019 and in the 5th period after the physiological maturity of secondary raceme fruits and rain events 03 29 2019 there is less variation in the moisture profile of the soil volume occupied by the root system of the cultivars in the 5th period fig 2 d with higher moisture at the depth of 0 1 m due to water recharge and atmospheric conditions promoted by the rainy period besides the reduction in water requirement caused by the physiological maturity of the fruits which resulted in greater uniformity of water redistribution in the soil profile on the other hand at the beginning of the 2nd period the uniformity was already lower and the moisture at the 0 1 m depth was approximately half of those found in the other periods since the climatic conditions were different without rainfall and the cultivars had high water requirements with differences between cultivars hybrid fig 2 a and b the soil water content below the 0 4 m depth remained high in almost all cases which is certainly linked to higher clay content lower bulk density which guarantee greater water storage capacity and the lower effect of evaporation on the loss of subsurface water the soil occupied by the cultivars ebda mpa 11 and brs energia had lower moisture content at depths below 0 4 m probably due to a higher efficiency of the root system in exploring this soil volume water storage was lower in the soil volume explored by the cultivars brs energia ebda mpa 11 and iac 2028 and higher for the cultivar ebda mpb 01 for the others there was no statistical difference table 5 the average soil water storage was higher in the stage between primary raceme harvest and secondary raceme harvest periods 5 and 6 due to the reduction in the kc crop coefficient of the crop resulting from the physiological maturity of the fruits table 5 an additional factor is the water recharge of the soil with 127 mm of rainfall during these two periods fig 1 the lowest storage was measured in the vegetative growth stage since the readings with the fdr probe started from 12 27 2019 on average 27 days after emergence a period in which there was no water recharge by rainfall and the plants were preparing for flowering showing high water requirement it can be observed that soil water storage was always above the permanent wilting point and below the field capacity so there was no water restriction or aeration restriction for the plants the storage variation reflects the water balance in the soil control volume fig 3 until the end of the fifth period the storage variation remained positive for most cultivars demonstrating that water supplementation was efficient until the end of the fifth period negative storage variations were observed for cultivars with high water requirement in the sixth period there was a predominance of negative storage variation because the secondary racemes had already reached physiological maturity there were significant differences in id and cr only for the cultivars brs nordestina and iac 226 table 6 which showed the highest and lowest daily means respectively the sums of id and cr per period did not differ significantly in this context besides the need for water by the plant and water recharge through rainfall a factor that influenced these results was the number of days of each stage since the cultivars differentiate and the sum is used instead of the mean in the semi arid region different from other regions of brazil ghiberto et al 2011 there are periods with low relative humidity and winds with high speeds even in the rainy season november to march this climatic condition promotes high water removal from the agrosystem even in periods with reduction in solar radiation this condition combined with the extraction of water by cultivated plants leads to low internal drainage regarding yield the cultivar ebda mpa 11 showed higher values for both racemes but its total yield differed from those of the hybrid ag ima 110 204 and the cultivars brs nordestina iac guarani ebda mpb 31 and brs energia fig 4 in many castor bean cultivars the total yield is computed as the sum of the yields of the primary secondary and tertiary racemes which are produced along the cycle the contribution of the primary raceme to the total yield is approximately 60 however foliar fertilization with 2 kg ha 1 of boric acid and top dressing fertilization with 89 30 kg ha 1 of urea performed before the flowering of the secondary raceme were determinant to increase the yields attributed to the secondary and tertiary racemes fig 4 the micronutrients boron and zinc are directly related to flowering and grain filling and deficiency is caused by the natural lack of these micronutrients in caatinga soil ph conditions and phosphorus concentration in the soil 114 mg dm 3 table 2 which affect their availability by inhibition and antagonism respectively therefore it is essential to apply top dressing or foliar fertilization with boron and zinc until the end of the vegetative growth stage of each cultivar according to table 1 in order to increase castor bean yield under these agroecological conditions in addition the yields of cultivars brs energia and ag ima 110 204 were limited by the fact that the population density established in this experiment 5000 plants ha 1 was well below the recommended density 20 000 plants ha 1 for short cultivars barreto and medeiros 2012 alexopoulou et al 2015 sá et al 2015 however their yields were higher than those reported in the literature indicating the great production potential of these cultivars in the semi arid region using a population arrangement with higher density the cultivar ebda mpa11 had the highest yield 3552 kg ha 1 in both racemes and did not differ only from the cultivars iac 226 iac 2028 and brs paraguaçu 2527 2514 and 2355 kg ha 1 respectively in addition there was lower water storage and low internal drainage which demonstrates great potential for water use in the rhizosphere promoting high yield in comparison to the others these cultivars require a spatial arrangement with larger spacing which does not lead to low yield in relation to actual evapotranspiration it is observed that the cultivars brs energia and ag ima 110 204 had lower values differing statistically from the others which did not differ from one another fig 5 the cultivar brs energia had low yield and low etr but its water use efficiency was statistically equal to that of ebda mpa11 which had the highest yield and highest etr the ratio between low yield and high water requirement directly affects the water use efficiency and this can be observed in the results of wue which show that the cultivar ebda mpb01 had the worst value fig 6 the highest and lowest values of wue were estimated for the cultivars ebda mpa 11 0 68 kg m 3 and ebda mpb 01 0 16 kg m 3 respectively a difference of approximately four times the hybrid ag ima 110 204 had intermediate yield 2006 kg ha 1 in comparison to the others however due to the low water requirement etr 136 5 mm its wue 0 64 kg m 3 was statistically equal to that of the most productive cultivar ebda mpa 11 the cultivars brs nordestina and brs paraguaçu when subjected to conditions of water stress and adequate moisture show wue ranging from 0 33 to 2 83 kg m 3 and from 0 28 to 2 78 kg m 3 respectively as a function of different irrigation depths barros júnior et al 2008 however these authors calculated yield as being phytomass all aerial part of the plant and not only the mass of grains this justify the obtaining of values much higher than those found in the present study these cultivars under the conditions of the present experiment and using grain yield to calculate the wue had values of 0 45 and 0 48 kg m 3 respectively in this study besides the selection of the best cultivars for the semi arid region it was possible to select cultivars more appropriate for family farming which performs manual harvest as well as cultivars with high production potential and destined for denser cultivation and with the possibility of mechanized harvest such as brs energia and ag ima 110 204 4 conclusions water availability was adequate throughout the cycle of the cultivars due to the efficiency of supplemental irrigation and water storage remained below the storage corresponding to the field capacity of the soil except for the cultivar ebda mpb01 and well above the permanent wilting point due to the climatic characteristics of the semi arid region the rates of internal drainage and capillary rise were low not exceeding 0 5 and 0 7 mm day 1 respectively regarding the total yield the cultivar ebda mpa11 obtained 3848 kg ha 1 but did not differ from iac 226 iac 2028 and brs paraguaçu which had yields from 2 527 to 2 355 kg ha 1 the lowest rates of actual evapotranspiration were estimated for the cultivar brs energia and the hybrid ag ima 110 204 leading to significant values of water use efficiency although planting was performed in a standardized spacing hence smaller than that recommended for these cultivars due to the high yield the cultivar ebda mpa11 obtained the highest wue declaration of competing interest the authors

socioeconomic importance for brazil and most of its cultivation is basically carried out by small family farmers vianna et al 2013 especially in the semi arid region of bahia this region accounted for 90 6 and 95 3 of the national production in the 2017 18 and 2018 19 seasons respectively representing a 4 7 increase compared to the previous crop ibge 2019 thus due to the good adaptation to the agroclimatic conditions of the semi arid region of bahia castor bean is a viable option for generating energy employment and income contributing to keeping local workers in rural areas and being able to promote urban exodus other advantages are the harvest season which occurs in the dry period when few crops can be harvested and the use of its cake which is used as fertilizer with high commercial value castor oil for having peculiar properties viscosity and 90 concentration of ricinoleic fatty acid is considered noble oil and one of the most versatile in nature which enables it to meet different market niches renewable product with high added value for a wide range of industrial uses with utility only comparable to that of petroleum azevedo et al 2007 the constant dry spells observed during rainy seasons in the semi arid region of bahia especially in the last six years have caused the death of plants in different activities cultivation of grain crops fruit growing and forestry these facts increase the importance of creating a much more adequate agricultural system starting with soil management and selection of cultivars more adapted to these conditions especially water scarcity thus characterizing castor bean cultivars regarding water use efficiency wue is a determining factor for selecting those that will adapt to the conditions of water scarcity and poor rainfall distribution of the semi arid region of bahia however wue should be estimated by means of soil water balance evaluating the processes of water entry and exit in a soil cultivated with the crop in the layer containing more than 95 of its root system since the spatial variation of soils in the semi arid region is relatively high soil water balance carried out in an agricultural system is a study that encompasses soil plant and atmospheric conditions under anthropic interventions related to soil and crop management the specificities of each stage are preponderant for the hydraulic behavior of this system such as soil physical quality related to soil texture and structure chemical quality biological quality and their interactions with plant development plant morphology and atmospheric conditions mainly related to the temporal distribution of rainfall as well as solar radiation and wind speed associated with relative air humidity the relationship between high wind speeds and low relative humidity in the semi arid region of bahia is preponderant for the removal of water from the cultivation system for a detailed study of this soil plant atmosphere system the water balance must integrate all processes involving water entries and exits in the system subjected to the peculiarities of meteorological phenomena soil attributes and genetic characteristics of the species or even plant variety brito et al 2009 libardi et al 2015 mota et al 2018 the soil control volume considered for water balance libardi 2012 should contain 95 or more of the active root system

experimental plots to perform the reading at depths of 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 6 m thus water storage in the soil profile was calculated by the trapezoid method according to libardi 2012 supplemental irrigation was applied with a drip system at a rate of 2 52 mm day 1 rainfall p was measured by a weather station installed in the experimental area the total production of castor bean is obtained for many cultivars by harvesting primary secondary and tertiary racemes along the crop cycle to measure the yield the primary secondary and tertiary racemes of the 15 plants of each experimental plot were manually harvested and the berries were peeled in a mechanical peeler specific to the castor bean crop the yield of the cultivars was estimated by the type of raceme primary secondary and tertiary and the sum was considered the total yield 2 3 crop actual evapotranspiration etr and water use efficiency wue the actual evapotranspiration of the crop was calculated by the soil water balance equation since all other processes of the balance were monitored daily with the etr calculated daily this process was integrated for the evaluation period 3 etr p i cr id h where p is rainfall i is irrigation cr is capillary rise id is internal drainage and δh is water storage variation water use efficiency wue is the ratio between yield y and etr according to eq 4 4 wue y et r 2 4 data analysis data of soil water balance components were subjected to an exploratory analysis in the statistical program r r development core team 2019 to verify whether there were outliers and normal distribution of residuals using the packages mass venables and ripley 2002 and outliers komsta 2015 for cr and id the box cox transformation ln of cr and ln of id was used to normalize the residuals in addition to the shapiro wilk normality test and kolmogorov smirnov homoscedasticity test the statistical design was in randomized blocks in an 8 6 factorial scheme eight cultivars and six evaluation periods during the cycles of the cultivars anova and means comparison test tukey 5 significance level of all balance components were performed using the expdes pt package ferreira et al 2018 yield and wue data were subjected to the same analyses and tests but the design was only in randomized blocks 3 results and discussion soil bulk density at both depths is in a normal state in relation to soil texture table 3 however care should be taken with the 0 3 m depth as it is almost outside the appropriate range due to the history of use with predominant passes of a plowing harrow always at the same depth scarification performed in only one direction of the area was not enough to reduce density at this depth bulk density is affected by crops that alter the structure and consequently the arrangement and volume of pores these changes influence the important physical hydraulic attributes such as aeration porosity soil water retention water availability to plants and soil resistance to penetration alencar et al 2018 however there was no restriction to the full root development of the crop soil texture is sandy loam in the 0 0 0 1 and 0 1 0 2 m layers and sandy clay loam in the others table 3 adequate for the cultivation of castor bean promoting favorable development of its root system and enabling greater water storage in the soil especially in subsurface however the silt content can make this soil more prone to physical restrictions requiring greater attention with its management especially regarding the aspect of organic matter supply rotation with green manures and application of organic fertilizers to promote aggregation the average percentage of clay in the arable layer 0 0 0 2 m was 29 45 lower than that found in the 0 20 0 6 m layer the higher clay content in the 0 2 0 6 m layer promotes greater water retention in this layer making it very important for plant nutrition while it is essential to adjust the physical and chemical environment in this layer in order to enable greater exploration of the soil profile by the root system of the crop by observing the soil water retention curves swrc it is verified that even with a lower percentage of clay the saturated soil water content in the 0 0 0 2 m layer was higher 0 339 m3 m 3 compared to the others due to the higher organic matter content som and the lower bulk density compared to the 0 3 m depth table 4 since som promotes better soil structuring which is directly related to soil water storage however it is observed that the swrc slope was higher for this layer because clay is the active mineral particle of the soil responsible for greater water retention in the soil the depth of 0 4 m showed a slight reduction 9 61 in the saturated soil water content table 4 compared to the others because the increase in soil bulk density 1670 kg m 3 at the depth of 0 3 m is a limiting factor for water storage and redistribution in the soil profile the swrcs at depths of 0 5 and 0 6 m showed similar and intermediate saturation points in comparison to the other layers the accumulated rainfall from sowing to harvest was 379 37 mm of which 243 69 occurred until flowering fig 1 which would not be enough for castor bean to express its production potential therefore in the intervals of the rainy periods irrigation was essential for a significant yield and until flowering the accumulated irrigation was 178 25 mm totaling 421 mm irrigation rainfall in this interval the sum of rainfall and irrigation during the whole cycle was 740 97 mm however in the interval between the beginning of the rainy season and the sowing of castor bean there were rain events which totaled 170 mm since the soil has the function of storing and supplying water fig 1 the availability of water until flowering certainly exceeded the 500 mm required as proposed by távora 1982 ensuring good water conditions for the castor bean cultivars and hybrid to express their production potential the moisture profiles fig 2 refer to specific dates strategically chosen to represent the crop cycle showing the behavior of water in the soil at the beginning of the readings with the fdr probe 10 27 2018 at the beginning of the major stage fmr hmr 2nd period without rainfall 11 17 2019 at the end of the 4th period after a concentration of rain events 02 18 2019 and in the 5th period after the physiological maturity of secondary raceme fruits and rain events 03 29 2019 there is less variation in the moisture profile of the soil volume occupied by the root system of the cultivars in the 5th period fig 2 d with higher moisture at the depth of 0 1 m due to water recharge and atmospheric conditions promoted by the rainy period besides the reduction in water requirement caused by the physiological maturity of the fruits which resulted in greater uniformity of water redistribution in the soil profile on the other hand at the beginning of the 2nd period the uniformity was already lower and the moisture at the 0 1 m depth was approximately half of those found in the other periods since the climatic conditions were different without rainfall and the cultivars had high water requirements with differences between cultivars hybrid fig 2 a and b the soil water content below the 0 4 m depth remained high in almost all cases which is certainly linked to higher clay content lower bulk density which guarantee greater water storage capacity and the lower effect of evaporation on the loss of subsurface water the soil occupied by the cultivars ebda mpa 11 and brs energia had lower moisture content at depths below 0 4 m probably due to a higher efficiency of the root system in exploring this soil volume water storage was lower in the soil volume explored by the cultivars brs energia ebda mpa 11 and iac 2028 and higher for the cultivar ebda mpb 01 for the others there was no statistical difference table 5 the average soil water storage was higher in the stage between primary raceme harvest and secondary raceme harvest periods 5 and 6 due to the reduction in the kc crop coefficient of the crop resulting from the physiological maturity of the fruits table 5 an additional factor is the water recharge of the soil with 127 mm of rainfall during these two periods fig 1 the lowest storage was measured in the vegetative growth stage since the readings with the fdr probe started from 12 27 2019 on average 27 days after emergence a period in which there was no water recharge by rainfall and the plants were preparing for flowering showing high water requirement it can be observed that soil water storage was always above the permanent wilting point and below the field capacity so there was no water restriction or aeration restriction for the plants the storage variation reflects the water balance in the soil control volume fig 3 until the end of the fifth period the storage variation remained positive for most cultivars demonstrating that water supplementation was efficient until the end of the fifth period negative storage variations were observed for cultivars with high water requirement in the sixth period there was a predominance of negative storage variation because the secondary racemes had already reached physiological maturity there were significant differences in id and cr only for the cultivars brs nordestina and iac 226 table 6 which showed the highest and lowest daily means respectively the sums of id and cr per period did not differ significantly in this context besides the need for water by the plant and water recharge through rainfall a factor that influenced these results was the number of days of each stage since the cultivars differentiate and the sum is used instead of the mean in the semi arid region different from other regions of brazil ghiberto et al 2011 there are periods with low relative humidity and winds with high speeds even in the rainy season november to march this climatic condition promotes high water removal from the agrosystem even in periods with reduction in solar radiation this condition combined with the extraction of water by cultivated plants leads to low internal drainage regarding yield the cultivar ebda mpa 11 showed higher values for both racemes but its total yield differed from those of the hybrid ag ima 110 204 and the cultivars brs nordestina iac guarani ebda mpb 31 and brs energia fig 4 in many castor bean cultivars the total yield is computed as the sum of the yields of the primary secondary and tertiary racemes which are produced along the cycle the contribution of the primary raceme to the total yield is approximately 60 however foliar fertilization with 2 kg ha 1 of boric acid and top dressing fertilization with 89 30 kg ha 1 of urea performed before the flowering of the secondary raceme were determinant to increase the yields attributed to the secondary and tertiary racemes fig 4 the micronutrients boron and zinc are directly related to flowering and grain filling and deficiency is caused by the natural lack of these micronutrients in caatinga soil ph conditions and phosphorus concentration in the soil 114 mg dm 3 table 2 which affect their availability by inhibition and antagonism respectively therefore it is essential to apply top dressing or foliar fertilization with boron and zinc until the end of the vegetative growth stage of each cultivar according to table 1 in order to increase castor bean yield under these agroecological conditions in addition the yields of cultivars brs energia and ag ima 110 204 were limited by the fact that the population density established in this experiment 5000 plants ha 1 was well below the recommended density 20 000 plants ha 1 for short cultivars barreto and medeiros 2012 alexopoulou et al 2015 sá et al 2015 however their yields were higher than those reported in the literature indicating the great production potential of these cultivars in the semi arid region using a population arrangement with higher density the cultivar ebda mpa11 had the highest yield 3552 kg ha 1 in both racemes and did not differ only from the cultivars iac 226 iac 2028 and brs paraguaçu 2527 2514 and 2355 kg ha 1 respectively in addition there was lower water storage and low internal drainage which demonstrates great potential for water use in the rhizosphere promoting high yield in comparison to the others these cultivars require a spatial arrangement with larger spacing which does not lead to low yield in relation to actual evapotranspiration it is observed that the cultivars brs energia and ag ima 110 204 had lower values differing statistically from the others which did not differ from one another fig 5 the cultivar brs energia had low yield and low etr but its water use efficiency was statistically equal to that of ebda mpa11 which had the highest yield and highest etr the ratio between low yield and high water requirement directly affects the water use efficiency and this can be observed in the results of wue which show that the cultivar ebda mpb01 had the worst value fig 6 the highest and lowest values of wue were estimated for the cultivars ebda mpa 11 0 68 kg m 3 and ebda mpb 01 0 16 kg m 3 respectively a difference of approximately four times the hybrid ag ima 110 204 had intermediate yield 2006 kg ha 1 in comparison to the others however due to the low water requirement etr 136 5 mm its wue 0 64 kg m 3 was statistically equal to that of the most productive cultivar ebda mpa 11 the cultivars brs nordestina and brs paraguaçu when subjected to conditions of water stress and adequate moisture show wue ranging from 0 33 to 2 83 kg m 3 and from 0 28 to 2 78 kg m 3 respectively as a function of different irrigation depths barros júnior et al 2008 however these authors calculated yield as being phytomass all aerial part of the plant and not only the mass of grains this justify the obtaining of values much higher than those found in the present study these cultivars under the conditions of the present experiment and using grain yield to calculate the wue had values of 0 45 and 0 48 kg m 3 respectively in this study besides the selection of the best cultivars for the semi arid region it was possible to select cultivars more appropriate for family farming which performs manual harvest as well as cultivars with high production potential and destined for denser cultivation and with the possibility of mechanized harvest such as brs energia and ag ima 110 204 4 conclusions water availability was adequate throughout the cycle of the cultivars due to the efficiency of supplemental irrigation and water storage remained below the storage corresponding to the field capacity of the soil except for the cultivar ebda mpb01 and well above the permanent wilting point due to the climatic characteristics of the semi arid region the rates of internal drainage and capillary rise were low not exceeding 0 5 and 0 7 mm day 1 respectively regarding the total yield the cultivar ebda mpa11 obtained 3848 kg ha 1 but did not differ from iac 226 iac 2028 and brs paraguaçu which had yields from 2 527 to 2 355 kg ha 1 the lowest rates of actual evapotranspiration were estimated for the cultivar brs energia and the hybrid ag ima 110 204 leading to significant values of water use efficiency although planting was performed in a standardized spacing hence smaller than that recommended for these cultivars due to the high yield the cultivar ebda mpa11 obtained the highest wue declaration of competing interest the authors
