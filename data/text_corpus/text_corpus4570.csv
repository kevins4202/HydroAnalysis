22850,the suction bucket foundation is turning to be an increasingly prevalent foundation for offshore wind turbines owts in this study a series of centrifuge tests are performed to investigate the vertical bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation in sandy soil under drained condition four bucket models are tested by considering the influence of aspect ratios aps the foundations are tested under compressive and tensile vertical loadings the bucket foundation is in the general shear failure mode and the ultimate bearing capacity increases with the ap the tensile bearing capacity is smaller than the compressive capacity the sharing factor of the base capacity and the skirt friction of the suction bucket foundation is determined with the assistance of the tensile test the bucket lid provides the majority of the bearing capacity the internal skirt friction is larger than the external skirt friction due to the soil constraint effect and the increased vertical stress several analytical methods are proposed to estimate the bearing capacity and the results are compared with the test data the bearing capacity equation is more applicable to the wide shallow bucket foundations the recommended design method is regarded as the upper bound when calculating the ultimate bearing capacity keywords aspect ratio centrifuge modelling offshore wind turbine sand suction bucket foundation ultimate bearing capacity 1 introduction the suction bucket foundation is believed to be an effective alternative for offshore wind turbines byrne et al 2002 the concept of the suction bucket foundation was first introduced to the offshore industry in 1982 bang et al 2000 and it was considered as the support structure for owts in 2001 byrne et al 2002 the total installation cost is expected to drop up to 30 by using the suction bucket foundation aspizua 2015 and it can be easily removed by reversing the installation procedures and the scour effect is minimized byrne and houlsby 2003 the first prototype owt with the bucket foundation was installed at frederikshavn denmark in 2003 and two suction bucket foundations were installed in the uk in 2014 leblanc bakmar 2009 nielsen 2013 recently in 2017 two steel suction bucket foundation supported owts were successfully installed in xiangshui china wang et al 2018b although the foundation has not been widely used in practical wind farms its behaviors under variable loading conditions have been investigated using model tests field tests and numerical simulations the lateral bearing behavior of the suction bucket foundation is an important aspect since the owt is subjected to large lateral loads and overturning moments liu et al 2014 conducted a series of model tests and numerical simulations to study the ultimate bearing capacity and the failure mode of the suction bucket foundation it was demonstrated that the foundation experienced large lateral displacements that resulted from the rotation under lateral loads and the rotation points are influenced by the skirt length wang et al wang et al 2017a b performed a set of centrifuge tests to investigate the bearing behavior of the suction bucket foundation under lateral loadings and a simplified analytical method is proposed to estimate the lateral ultimate bearing capacity the long term cyclic lateral response of the suction bucket foundation was studied by zhu et al 2012 the accumulated angular rotation was predicted by an empirical equation and the cyclic stiffness was found to be relatively unaffected by cycle numbers meanwhile the seismic response of the suction bucket foundation supported owt was investigated through the seismic centrifuge modelling wang et al 2017c the soil was reinforced by the bucket and the liquefaction did not occur under the suction bucket foundation during the earthquake loading moreover the installation of the suction bucket foundation has been investigated by several researchers the design procedure for installing the foundation was summarized houlsby and byrne 2005 calculations included the self weight penetration suction penetration and the limits for suction penetration afterward laboratory model tests were performed by lian et al 2014 with the focus on the difference between inner and outer earth pressures acting on bucket skirt and the design methods were put forward besides the loading conditions described above the suction bucket foundation is subjected to the vertical loading introduced by the wind turbine self weight in service conditions the vertical bearing capacity of the foundation is necessary to be assessed to ensure that the vertically applied load is smaller than the capacity the loading condition for owts is complex which is combined vertical lateral and moment loadings due to the wind wave current and man made loadings houlsby et al 2005a wang et al 2018c it was demonstrated that the lateral and moment capacity could be enhanced when the vertical loading was applied and the combined loading envelope was often scaled by the vertical bearing capacity gottardi et al 1999 liu et al 2014 therefore the assessment of the vertical bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation is imperative for owts and it is necessary to determine design procedures for more complex loading conditions the undrained vertical bearing capacity of the skirted foundation was investigated using numerical simulations and physical modellings and it was suggested that the foundation could be regarded as rigid with the embedment depth equals to the skirt length yun and bransby 2007 model tests of the suction bucket foundation were carried out under vertical loadings in clay and the behavior of a foundation model with the aspect ratio height diameter short for ap of 1 was considered villalobos et al 2010 moreover a series of laboratory tests were performed together with the numerical simulation to examine the effect of embedment depth to the bucket vertical bearing capacity in clay the bearing capacity was proved to be sensitive to the aspect ratio barari and ibsen 2011 in summary of the previous studies the vertical response of the suction bucket in clay has been investigated more than the foundation response in granular soils however many offshore wind projects require the foundation resting on sandy soils with high water tables and the suction bucket foundation is an economic choice due to the fast installation therefore investigations on the behavior of the foundation installed in sandy soils are necessary to enrich the database moreover most established design methods are developed from suction buckets with large aps since this foundation is initially used for the offshore platform the penetration depth of the bucket has great influence on its bearing capacity and hence the bucket dimension design should be considered in the study finally besides the compression loadings tensions are likely to be applied in service conditions to the offshore wind foundation which is a critical topic in the design phase consequently high quality tests are required by considering these factors to extend our understanding of the vertical bearing behavior of the suction bucket foundation centrifuge modelling is an advanced test technique to investigate the geotechnical problem by testing the reduced scale models under high gravitational accelerations to simulate the field condition in a study of bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation the strength stiffness and deformation of the surrounding soil are stress dependent thereby the small scale model test at 1 g is not applicable to reproduce the stress state of the in situ condition li et al 2019 meanwhile just a few suction bucket foundations supported owts have been installed currently and hence the field data is not easy to collect the behavior of the suction bucket foundation under vertical loading conditions have been studied through the model tests and numerical simulations as mentioned above barari and ibsen 2011 villalobos et al 2010 yun and bransby 2007 therefore the centrifuge modelling is used here to fill the gap between the low accuracy model test and the scarcely performed field tests in this study a series of centrifuge tests have been performed in sandy soil to investigate the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation for owts a total number of four bucket models are constructed with a range of aps from 0 3 to 1 aiming to demonstrate the effect of the dimensions on the response the models are tested under both compressive and tensile loadings the test results are calibrated with several calculation methods in predicting the vertical bearing capacity after which the revised design method is put forward the main contribution of this study is to present and interpret high quality experimental data and provide design considerations to accelerate the broader application of suction bucket foundation 2 centrifuge test the centrifuge tests are conducted on the 20 g ton geotechnical centrifuge with a payload capacity of 182 kg at case western reserve university figueroa et al 1998 the radius of the rotation arm during the flight is 1 37 m and the maximum acceleration is 200 g for static tests and 100 g for dynamic tests the scale transformation is according to the centrifuge scaling law as listed in table 1 chandrasekaran 2003 wang et al 2015 the maximum of the centrifuge acceleration is 30 g for all the tests representing a scaling factor n equals to 30 for data interpretations all the results presented in the following sections are in the prototype scale for consistency 2 1 model configuration four suction bucket foundations models are fabricated and tested in this study as shown in fig 1 they have the same diameter of 2 1 m the skirt lengths of the models are 0 63 m 1 05 m 1 47 m and 2 1 m respectively representing the aps of 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 the bucket models are made of steel with an identical young s modulus ep of 200 gpa the thickness of the top lid is 0 02 m and the thickness of the skirt is 0 015 m no drainage hole is placed on the top of the bucket due to the limitation of the fabrication technique and this design is beneficial for maintaining the integration of the top lid and avoid the stress concentration detail information of the buckets is summarized in table 2 the foundations are designed according to a 2 5 mw owt that installed in jiangsu china with a scale ratio of 1 16 zhang et al 2016 the thickness of the bucket skirt is determined according to several bucket models that have been used in previously reported model tests and they have a similar thickness to diameter ratio of 0 007 the skirt thickness of the bucket models is the minimum value that can be fabricated hung et al 2017 villalobos et al 2010 the models are installed in the rigid container fixed at one end of the rotation arm which has the prototype dimensions of 16 6 7 2 5 3 m length width height the width and height of the container are 3 5 times and 2 5 times of the bucket diameter and the maximum skirt length and the boundary effect is minimized 2 2 soil properties the fine grained silica sand is used in the centrifuge tests before preparing the soil the silica sand is oven dried for 24 h the dry sand is air pluviated into the rigid container with a constant height of 0 8 m layer by layer and slight compactions are applied to obtain a desired relative density wang et al 2018a the de air water is instilled slowly from the bottom of the rigid container to saturate the dry sand and vacuum is applied for 24 h for the saturation process the permeability of the sand is 5 85 10 4 m s which is calculated with the kozeny carman equation carman 1937 the relative density of the soil was carefully measured before starting the centrifuge according to the astm standard astm 2006 which was about 70 for saturated sand classified as dense sand the soil layer is prepared according to several published studies of the suction bucket foundation whose relative density of sand was 80 85 houlsby et al 2006 and 68 lian et al 2014 to ensure the identical condition for all the centrifuge tests the soil is newly prepared for each test with the same procedures the final height of the sand deposit is 4 5 m for all the tests the mechanical properties of the sand are listed in table 3 through a series of laboratory tests the grain size distribution of the silica sand is plotted in fig 2 the friction angle between the bucket surface and the sand is measured using the direct shear test the lower part of the shear box is replaced by a steel plate that is made of the same material with the bucket model and the upper part of the shear box is filled with the saturated silica sand that has been compacted to the required relative density the steel soil interface friction angle is 28 3 the silica sand has a relatively small particle size and this characteristic is preferable in centrifuge modelling since the scale effect is minimized randolph et al 1992 although the particle size is smaller the silica sand has the ability to maintain the proper internal friction angle for the bearing capacity analysis 2 3 test setup the centrifuge tests conducted in this study are load controlled the sin shape loadings are applied by the electrical actuator fixed vertically above the container a load cell is installed at the tip of the actuator and a rod is fabricated to connect the load cell and the suction bucket foundation which is helpful to position the bucket foundation a horizontal flat board is fixed at the tip of the actuator to connect the lvdt and hence the lvdt is able to move vertically simultaneously with the buckets to record the displacement to minimize the measurement errors the load cell was calibrated before each test the initial positions of the transducers and the wire length are set to be identical for each test this loading system has been used in several projects and the repeatability of the test results have been checked and reported previously wang et al 2017b 2018c it was demonstrated that the repeated test showed strong agreements compared to the original tests and the measurement error of the sensors are within an acceptable range a data acquisition system is installed in the centrifuge to record the data during the flight the test package is depicted in fig 3 a total number of eight centrifuge tests are performed including one compression test and one tension test for each suction bucket foundation the bucket foundations are installed after the saturation of the sandy soil cares are taken when installing the models to minimize the disturbances to the prepared soil the buckets are installed by jacking at 1 g and no suction installation is considered in this study which is relevant to the first stage of self weight penetration in a real site in the suction installation the upwards hydraulic gradient inside the bucket significantly affects the internal vertical stress on the contrary the buildup of excess pore water pressure is much milder in the jacking installation to furthest minimize the disturbance of sand inside the bucket during the installation the models are slowly pushed into the sand until the top lid just gets connected with the sand surface the penetration rate is about 0 3 mm s and the settlement is carefully monitored by the lvdt it was demonstrated that the penetration resistances with different scaled rates are consistent lian et al 2014 a pore water pressure transducer ppt is put adjacent to the bucket skirt to monitor the pore water pressure in real time and it illustrates no significant buildup of excess pore water pressure during the jacking installation meanwhile 12 h are allocated for the full dissipation of the possible excess pore water pressures before starting the centrifuge the soil heaving is not observed during the installation procedure the identical installation procedure is used for each centrifuge test to minimize the effects of final results subsequent to the placement of each bucket foundation the external loadings are applied until the bucket reaches failure the compressive and tensile loadings are applied slowly with a duration of 40 min to avoid piping or cavitation eid 2012 influences of the loading rate have been investigated previously in the centrifuge it is demonstrated that when the loading duration exceeds 40mins differences in the bearing capacity is minimized wang et al 2018a meanwhile the record of the ppt does not show significant pore water pressure changes in the static tests which is consistent with our previous tests wang et al 2017b according to the studies reported by houlsby et al 2005b if the external load is applied very slowly then the pore water pressures will be small and a fully drained condition is applicable they assumed their slowest test with the rate of 5 mm s to be almost drained and a very low tensile capacity is obtained due to the small value of pore water pressure houlsby et al 2005a therefore the tests are idealized as the fully drained condition for the following calculation houlsby and byrne 2005 the test id consists of two parts the bucket ap and the test feature for example the test ap3 c represents the compression test for the suction bucket foundation with the ap of 0 3 the test details are listed in table 4 3 test results and interpretations 3 1 compressive bearing capacity the typical load settlement relationships of the four suction bucket foundation models recorded from the centrifuge tests are depicted in fig 4 the tendencies of the curves are slightly different from the other shallow foundations the buckets experience the linear response initially followed by two reinforcement periods after the critical points and this phenomenon is more obvious for the buckets with larger aps at the linear stage the vertical load increases quickly while the settlement accumulates at a much lower gradient the deformation of the sand inside and outside the foundation is not obvious and it is mainly caused by the extrusion of the soil particles the resistance is mainly provided by the base bearing capacity and the skirt frictions entering the non linear stage the slopes of the load settlement curves decrease significantly with the increase of settlements the soil inside the bucket is constrained by the skirt and hence the soils work together with the foundation of bearing the external loadings with the increase of the vertical load the soils underneath and around the bucket tip start to show plastic deformations afterward the penetration depth of the bucket foundation increases continuously under the vertical loading and hence the constraint provided by the bucket skirt turns to be more effective therefore the load settlement curves demonstrate the second reinforcement stage until the inside soils reach the yielding stage under peak external loadings it is observed that the curves exhibit peaks at which vertical loadings illustrate a slight reduction with further settlements the phenomenon of the two reinforcement stages is not obvious for the buckets with aps of 0 3 and 0 5 the skirt lengths of these two buckets are smaller than the other foundations and the side wall constraints to the soil inside the bucket and the enhancements of the vertical stress are not that effective fig 5 depicts the suction bucket foundation before and after the centrifuge test to illustrate the failure mode the settlement of the foundation accumulates gradually with the increase of the vertical loading so that the local shear failure zone is formed as the external loading increases continuously a triangular wedge shaped zone of soil is pushed down and it in turn presses the surrounding soil sideway and upwards at the ultimate condition the soil is in a state of plastic equilibrium and the foundation undergoes a large settlement without further increases of vertical loadings the slip surface extends to the ground surface therefore it is observed in fig 5 that the soil around the foundation bulges after the test in dense sand the failure mode of the suction bucket foundation is the general shear failure although the bucket does not run through the soil large soil deformation is observed in the tests which is not allowed in practical engineering the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation is extracted as the vertical load corresponded to the distinct peaks of the load settlement curves eid 2012 wang et al 2018a as listed in table 5 the ap has great influence on the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation the bearing capacity tends to increase significantly with the increase of the skirt length as the penetration depth increases the contacting area with the soil is larger and hence the friction resistance is enhanced more importantly the constraint effect on the inside soil contributed by the bucket skirt is strengthened at larger penetration depth and hence the internal soil pressure is increased the inside soil settles together with the foundation and the soil is pressed more significant at the near the bucket tip the phenomenon has been observed previously lian et al 2014 meanwhile the settlement ratios corresponded to the ultimate bearing capacities of the four buckets are listed in table 5 the suction bucket foundation presents failure when the settlement ratio reaches 5 11 some researchers suggest the bearing capacity can be determined when the settlement ratio equals to 10 for simplicity eid 2012 meanwhile it is suggested in the literature that the failure point for the suction bucket foundation is 5 14 of the bucket diameter al aghbari and dutta 2008 which agrees with the test results in this study moreover it is observed that the settlement ratio at failure tends to increase with the increase of the ap 3 2 tensile bearing capacity the owts are sometimes subjected to tensile loadings in service conditions thereby the tension tests are performed in this study to predict the tensile bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation the buckets are loaded in tension after the installation without any significant compressive pre loadings the load displacement curves are presented in fig 6 the responses are very stiff at the initial stage representing the tensile loadings are not large enough to pull out the buckets after the critical points the tendencies of the curves change significantly and the buckets are pulled upwards quickly with large displacements the static friction turns into the dynamic friction and a slight decrease of the tensile loading is observed at the final stage the tension capacity of the suction bucket foundations extracted as the peak tensile loading during the tests and listed in table 6 hung et al 2017 reported a series of 1 g vertical pullout tests for bucket foundations with aps of 0 5 and 1 the results of the centrifuge tests in this study are more conservative compared to their 1 g tests and the influence of the bucket ap is more obvious in the centrifuge the silica sand is used for both of the tests however the relative density of sand in this study is higher the denser sand tends to be more sensitive to the change of aps meanwhile the bucket models are installed at a lower acceleration in the centrifuge tests and hence the subsequent stress increase due to self weight is likely to overcome the initial increase in lateral stress around the bucket due to installation which may lead to a reduction of the bucket capacity craig 1985 under rapid tensile loading the suction pressure is presented inside the bucket which may increase the tensile bearing capacity considerable the maximum capacity is obtained under fully undrained condition the dimension of the bucket the soil permeability the loading rate and the water depth are key factors that influence the tensile bearing capacity thieken et al 2014 in this study the bucket is installed slowly to the position that the lid just contacts with the soil surface and the ppt does not show significant change during the tests the tests are idealized to conduct under the drained condition and hence the suction is not considered in the calculation the bucket tensile bearing capacity is mainly provided by the internal and external skirt frictions which are assumed to be equal in calculating the pullout capacity hung et al 2017 this assumption will lead to an over estimated skirt friction from the tensile tests meanwhile the effective stresses on the annular likely to be sufficiently small that they are neglected in the analysis houlsby and byrne 2005 as expected the tension capacity of the suction bucket foundation is much smaller than the compression capacity moreover it is demonstrated that the tensile skirt friction tends to be smaller than the compressive skirt friction due to the change in mean effective stress conditions the reduction factor is suggested to be 0 55 0 85 from the previous studies de nicola and randolph 1993 1997 the influence of ap is also significant for the tension test the tensile bearing capacity increase with the ap and the increasing rate turns to be larger besides the larger contacting area the skirt constraint effect on the inner soil enhances the soil strength with the same friction coefficient between the soil and steel the friction tends to be larger by the increasing lateral effective stress 3 3 discussions of the bearing capacity during the compression test the ultimate bearing capacity consists of the base capacity and the external skirt friction and the base capacity of the suction bucket foundation is the summation of the end bearing provided by the bucket annulus and the mobilized internal skirt friction from the soil plug due to the fact that the mobilization of the two parts cannot be measured directly the proportion of the base capacity is accomplished by subtracting the curve representing the external skirt friction from the total compressive bearing capacity the external skirt friction is estimated by factoring the tensile skirt friction measured from the tensile test it has been recognized that the tensile skirt friction is lower than the compressive skirt friction due to the soil constraint effect and the reduction factor ranges from 0 55 to 0 85 de nicola and randolph 1997 in this study a consistent value of tensile to compressive skirt resistance ratio is assumed as 0 66 from the previous tests and the degradation of skirt friction during the test is not considered de nicola and randolph 1993 villalobos et al 2010 the estimated base capacity the external skirt friction and their sharing factors are listed in table 7 and they are plotted against the aps as shown in fig 7 it is demonstrated in fig 7 that the base capacity of the suction bucket foundation contributes the majority of the ultimate bearing capacity under compressive loadings and the sharing factor is larger than 90 when the ap is equal or lower than 1 the external skirt friction tends to increase with the increase of aps but the increment is relatively mild since the absolute value of the skirt friction accounts for a small portion of the total capacity however the sharing factor of friction tends to increase at larger penetration depths and hence the component of external skirt friction is likely to be more effective with the increase of aps the base capacity of the suction bucket foundation consists of the tip resistance and the plug resistance the plug resistance is proved to provide a larger portion of the base capacity since the thickness of the steel bucket is much smaller than the total diameter zhang et al 2016 the base capacity increases with the aps but with a reducing gradient thereby the sharing ratio of the base capacity decreases with the increase of embedment depth for the wide shallow bucket foundation the bearing capacity is mainly provided by the base capacity but this tendency turns to be less significant with the increase of aps 4 analysis of bearing capacity 4 1 calculation of the skirt friction and base capacity the ultimate bearing capacity fc ult of the suction bucket foundation under the compressive axial loading condition is mainly resisted by the end bearing fbase and the external skirt friction fout eq 1 the total resistance ft ult on the suction bucket under tensile loading condition is calculated as the summation of the internal skirt friction fin and the external skirt friction fout eq 2 under drained condition in this section the skirt friction and the base capacity are analyzed separately to assess the bearing capacity theoretically and the methods are calibrated with the centrifuge test results 1 f c u l t f o u t f b a s e 2 f t u l t f i n f o u t 4 1 1 skirt friction for the suction bucket foundation in sandy soil the skirt friction is calculated by factoring vertical effective stress adjacent to the foundation eq 3 and this method has been used in the analysis by several researchers byrne et al 2003 hung et al 2017 3 f s k i r t f i n f o u t γ h 2 2 k f tan δ π d where γ is the effective unit weight of the silica sand and h is the skirt length kf is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure δ is the interface friction angle between the steel and the sand being 28 3 as mentioned above and d is the bucket diameter the external skirt friction is assumed to equal to the internal skirt friction in the tensile condition and the change of vertical stress close to the bucket is not accounted for the dnv standard standard 2007 suggests a kf value of 0 8 for the bucket foundation houlsby et al houlsby and byrne 2005 reported that it is not possible to separate the effects of kf and tan δ and the term kf tan δ is suggested to be 0 7 in the calculation hung et al 2017 determine a kf tan δ value of 0 85 according to the 1 g model tests the measured skirt friction from the tensile tests is listed in table 8 together with the analytical results it is demonstrated that the factor suggested by houlsby reaches the best agreement with the measured results and hence the kf tan δ value of 0 7 is used in the following analysis the centrifuge tests are assumed to conduct under the drained condition and the suction pressures are not considered therefore the calculated ultimate tensile capacity of the suction bucket foundation tends to be less conservative afterward the compressive skirt friction is estimated by factoring the calculated tensile skirt friction as mentioned above 4 1 2 base capacity under the vertical loadings the bucket skirt forms an enclosure in which is soil is constrained strictly and the soil has no tendency to flow out of the bucket the triangular wedge zone is pushed down with the increase of penetration depths finally the soils underneath and surround the bucket reach plastic deformations at failures the soil inside the bucket works as a unit together with the overlain foundation to sustain the vertical loading therefore the failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation under vertical loadings is similar to the embedded circular footing byrne et al 2003 yun and bransby 2007 the base capacity is estimated by the terzaghi s ultimate bearing capacity equation for circular footings in sandy soil terzaghi 1951 the equation has the following form 4 f b a s e q n q 0 3 γ d n r where nq and nr are bearing capacity factors determined according to the peak friction angle of the soil and q is the uniform surcharge above the base of the footing this is regarded as the first method in predicting the base capacity in this study it is suggested by yun and bransby 2007 that the ultimate bearing capacity of the skirt foundation is reduced by the weight of soil inside the bucket when using the terzaghi s capacity equation due to the small thickness of the bucket skirt the bucket diameter is convenient to use in assessing the reduction of this end bearing resistance this method is regarded as the second method in estimating the base capacity and eq 4 is modified as 5 f b a s e q n q 0 3 γ d n r γ h π d 2 4 al aghbari 2000 proposed a modified method to estimate the bearing capacity of the skirt foundation by introducing a skirt factor fsr to the second part of the terzaghi s ultimate bearing capacity equation the skirt friction considers the surface roughness the soil characteristic and the skirt penetration depth the modified bearing capacity equation is expressed as 6 f b a s e q n q 0 3 γ d n r f s r 7 f s r f s f f s d 8 f s f 1 06 tan δ s tan δ s i where fsf is the friction ratio related to the sand steel interface friction angle in which δs is the friction angle between the bucket skirt and the soil and the δsi is the standard interface friction angle that equals to 28 fsd is the skirt depth factor that is related to aps and the factor is defined as 1 approximately regardless of the skirt length al aghbari 2000 this method is regarded as the third method to estimate the base capacity of the suction bucket foundation in sandy soil 4 1 3 ultimate bearing capacity the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation under compressive loading is the summation of the base capacity and the skirt friction as shown in eq 1 in the estimation of the base capacity the internal soil is assumed to work together with the bucket foundation and hence only the external skirt friction is considered in the calculation in the following analysis the skirt friction is estimated using the houlsby suggested factor and the base capacity is calculated using the three methods listed above the calculated ultimate bearing capacities are listed together with the test results in table 9 to demonstrate the features of these analytical methods more clearly the ultimate bearing capacities are plotted with the bucket aps in fig 8 the calculated results are extended to ap 0 representing the surface foundation without penetration of the skirt the calculated results fall well within the spread of values obtained from the centrifuge tests the analytical methods are applicable in calculating the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation to be more specific the method 1 from the terzaghi s equation tends to be conservative compared with the centrifuge tests especially when for larger aps method 2 is the modification of method 1 with a reduction of the internal soil weight however the difference is not obvious the influence of the soil self weight is not significant in the overall bearing capacity the calculated results from method 3 is larger than the other two methods due to the introduction of the skirt factor comparing with the test results the analytical results tend to be conservative especially when the ap is larger than 0 7 this is acceptable for design purpose attentions should be paid if the ap of the bucket increase continuously consequently these analytical methods provide acceptable solutions in analyzing the ultimate bearing capacity and they are more applicable for the wide shallow bucket foundation 4 2 bearing capacity of the surface foundation and the suction bucket foundation lacking of established methods in estimating the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation the flat surface foundation has been frequently used to investigate the skirted foundation in sandy soil al aghbari and dutta 2008 estimating the bearing capacity of the flat surface footing is relatively easy by using terzaghi s equation through the analysis the suction bucket foundation is regarded as an enhancement of the surface foundation by accounting for the overburden effects and the improvement is represented in terms of the bearing capacity ratio of the two foundations fult fsur this method is beneficial for estimating the overall bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation in an integrate manner instead of calculating the base capacity and the skirt friction separately which may introduce more bias the bearing capacity ratio is greatly influenced by the skirt penetration depth or the ap of the bucket foundation and the calculation procedure has been suggested by several researchers byrne dyme and houlsby 1998 suggests the value of the bearing capacity ratio by the following linear relationship 9 f u l t f s u r 1 0 89 h d if the flat footing has the same diameter with the skirted foundation then it is straight forward to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity of the bucket foundation by considering the bucket dimension it is clearly shown that the bearing capacity increases significantly with the skirt length which agrees well with the centrifuge test results hisham eid 2012 recommends a conservative approximation of the bearing capacity ratio by the following equation 10 f u l t f s u r 1 8 h d this method gives an estimation of the lower bound of the bucket foundation bearing capacity regardless of the sand shear strength and the relative density the analytical results are summarized together with the centrifuge test results in table 10 the results calculated from the two methods stated above are smaller than the test results eq 9 is derived from a series of small scale laboratory tests with very dense sand and the bucket soil interface friction coefficient is assumed to be 0 25 in the analysis which is much smaller than the results of centrifuge tests described in this study meanwhile eq 8 is proposed from a set of model tests conducted in dry sand and a conservative approximation is used to derive the equation therefore the bearing capacity ratios obtained from the centrifuge test in this study are plotted against the bucket aps in fig 9 it is demonstrated that the bearing capacity ratio increases in a linear manner with the ap and the relationship is described by the following equation 11 f u l t f s u r 1 4 09 h d eq 11 provides an expedient way to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation based on a series of centrifuge tests comparing to previously reported results this method provides a relatively less conservative estimation which is regarded as the upper bound in the analysis the bearing capacity ratio is not likely to be largely influenced by the bucket diameter since the ap is the main concern and hence this method has wider applicability for variable bucket models meanwhile this method is more applicable to the skirted foundation installed in saturated dense sand 5 conclusions a series of centrifuge tests have been performed in this study to investigate the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation for owts four bucket foundation models are fabricated by considering the influence of aps the tests are conducted in saturated sandy soil the ultimate bearing capacities are extracted from the compressive tests the base capacities as well as the skirt frictions are determined with the assistance of tensile tests several analytical methods are proposed to estimate the bearing capacity a separate estimations of the base capacity and the skirt friction b integrated calculations of the bearing capacity referring to the capacity of the surface foundation the analytical methods are compared with the centrifuge test results based on which design recommendations are put forward the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation increases continuously with the ap besides the increase of contacting area the internal soil is constrained by the bucket skirt and the soil pressure is enhanced 2 the main failure mode of the bucket foundation under vertical loadings is the general shear failure and the soil around the foundation bulges after the tests 3 the tensile capacity of the suction bucket foundation is much smaller than the compressive bearing capacity and it tends to increase with the bucket ap at an increasing gradient 4 the ultimate bearing capacity is mainly provided by the bucket lid the sharing factor of the skirt friction tends to increase with the ap representing the lid resistance is gradually transferred to the skirt resistance 5 the internal skirt friction is 4 5 times of the external skirt friction for the suction bucket foundation under compressive loadings due to the skirt constraint effect and increased internal vertical stress this factor tends to be conservative at larger aps 6 the soil inside the bucket works as a unit with the foundation to resist the vertical loading the base capacity of the bucket foundation is estimated as the embedded circular footing three analytical methods are checked with the test results and these methods are more applicable in predicting the bearing capacity of the wide shallow bucket foundation 7 the bearing capacity ratio between the bucket foundation and the corresponded surface foundation are analyzed to predict the ultimate bearing capacity the design recommendation is proposed based on the test results which is regarded as the upper bound for design purpose overall the centrifuge test results presented in this study is more adaptable to relatively small scale bucket foundations due to the limitation of model dimensions the predicted bearing capacity tend to be less conservative attentions should be paid

22850,the suction bucket foundation is turning to be an increasingly prevalent foundation for offshore wind turbines owts in this study a series of centrifuge tests are performed to investigate the vertical bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation in sandy soil under drained condition four bucket models are tested by considering the influence of aspect ratios aps the foundations are tested under compressive and tensile vertical loadings the bucket foundation is in the general shear failure mode and the ultimate bearing capacity increases with the ap the tensile bearing capacity is smaller than the compressive capacity the sharing factor of the base capacity and the skirt friction of the suction bucket foundation is determined with the assistance of the tensile test the bucket lid provides the majority of the bearing capacity the internal skirt friction is larger than the external skirt friction due to the soil constraint effect and the increased vertical stress several analytical methods are proposed to estimate the bearing capacity and the results are compared with the test data the bearing capacity equation is more applicable to the wide shallow bucket foundations the recommended design method is regarded as the upper bound when calculating the ultimate bearing capacity keywords aspect ratio centrifuge modelling offshore wind turbine sand suction bucket foundation ultimate bearing capacity 1 introduction the suction bucket foundation is believed to be an effective alternative for offshore wind turbines byrne et al 2002 the concept of the suction bucket foundation was first introduced to the offshore industry in 1982 bang et al 2000 and it was considered as the support structure for owts in 2001 byrne et al 2002 the total installation cost is expected to drop up to 30 by using the suction bucket foundation aspizua 2015 and it can be easily removed by reversing the installation procedures and the scour effect is minimized byrne and houlsby 2003 the first prototype owt with the bucket foundation was installed at frederikshavn denmark in 2003 and two suction bucket foundations were installed in the uk in 2014 leblanc bakmar 2009 nielsen 2013 recently in 2017 two steel suction bucket foundation supported owts were successfully installed in xiangshui china wang et al 2018b although the foundation has not been widely used in practical wind farms its behaviors under variable loading conditions have been investigated using model tests field tests and numerical simulations the lateral bearing behavior of the suction bucket foundation is an important aspect since the owt is subjected to large lateral loads and overturning moments liu et al 2014 conducted a series of model tests and numerical simulations to study the ultimate bearing capacity and the failure mode of the suction bucket foundation it was demonstrated that the foundation experienced large lateral displacements that resulted from the rotation under lateral loads and the rotation points are influenced by the skirt length wang et al wang et al 2017a b performed a set of centrifuge tests to investigate the bearing behavior of the suction bucket foundation under lateral loadings and a simplified analytical method is proposed to estimate the lateral ultimate bearing capacity the long term cyclic lateral response of the suction bucket foundation was studied by zhu et al 2012 the accumulated angular rotation was predicted by an empirical equation and the cyclic stiffness was found to be relatively unaffected by cycle numbers meanwhile the seismic response of the suction bucket foundation supported owt was investigated through the seismic centrifuge modelling wang et al 2017c the soil was reinforced by the bucket and the liquefaction did not occur under the suction bucket foundation during the earthquake loading moreover the installation of the suction bucket foundation has been investigated by several researchers the design procedure for installing the foundation was summarized houlsby and byrne 2005 calculations included the self weight penetration suction penetration and the limits for suction penetration afterward laboratory model tests were performed by lian et al 2014 with the focus on the difference between inner and outer earth pressures acting on bucket skirt and the design methods were put forward besides the loading conditions described above the suction bucket foundation is subjected to the vertical loading introduced by the wind turbine self weight in service conditions the vertical bearing capacity of the foundation is necessary to be assessed to ensure that the vertically applied load is smaller than the capacity the loading condition for owts is complex which is combined vertical lateral and moment loadings due to the wind wave current and man made loadings houlsby et al 2005a wang et al 2018c it was demonstrated that the lateral and moment capacity could be enhanced when the vertical loading was applied and the combined loading envelope was often scaled by the vertical bearing capacity gottardi et al 1999 liu et al 2014 therefore the assessment of the vertical bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation is imperative for owts and it is necessary to determine design procedures for more complex loading conditions the undrained vertical bearing capacity of the skirted foundation was investigated using numerical simulations and physical modellings and it was suggested that the foundation could be regarded as rigid with the embedment depth equals to the skirt length yun and bransby 2007 model tests of the suction bucket foundation were carried out under vertical loadings in clay and the behavior of a foundation model with the aspect ratio height diameter short for ap of 1 was considered villalobos et al 2010 moreover a series of laboratory tests were performed together with the numerical simulation to examine the effect of embedment depth to the bucket vertical bearing capacity in clay the bearing capacity was proved to be sensitive to the aspect ratio barari and ibsen 2011 in summary of the previous studies the vertical response of the suction bucket in clay has been investigated more than the foundation response in granular soils however many offshore wind projects require the foundation resting on sandy soils with high water tables and the suction bucket foundation is an economic choice due to the fast installation therefore investigations on the behavior of the foundation installed in sandy soils are necessary to enrich the database moreover most established design methods are developed from suction buckets with large aps since this foundation is initially used for the offshore platform the penetration depth of the bucket has great influence on its bearing capacity and hence the bucket dimension design should be considered in the study finally besides the compression loadings tensions are likely to be applied in service conditions to the offshore wind foundation which is a critical topic in the design phase consequently high quality tests are required by considering these factors to extend our understanding of the vertical bearing behavior of the suction bucket foundation centrifuge modelling is an advanced test technique to investigate the geotechnical problem by testing the reduced scale models under high gravitational accelerations to simulate the field condition in a study of bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation the strength stiffness and deformation of the surrounding soil are stress dependent thereby the small scale model test at 1 g is not applicable to reproduce the stress state of the in situ condition li et al 2019 meanwhile just a few suction bucket foundations supported owts have been installed currently and hence the field data is not easy to collect the behavior of the suction bucket foundation under vertical loading conditions have been studied through the model tests and numerical simulations as mentioned above barari and ibsen 2011 villalobos et al 2010 yun and bransby 2007 therefore the centrifuge modelling is used here to fill the gap between the low accuracy model test and the scarcely performed field tests in this study a series of centrifuge tests have been performed in sandy soil to investigate the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation for owts a total number of four bucket models are constructed with a range of aps from 0 3 to 1 aiming to demonstrate the effect of the dimensions on the response the models are tested under both compressive and tensile loadings the test results are calibrated with several calculation methods in predicting the vertical bearing capacity after which the revised design method is put forward the main contribution of this study is to present and interpret high quality experimental data and provide design considerations to accelerate the broader application of suction bucket foundation 2 centrifuge test the centrifuge tests are conducted on the 20 g ton geotechnical centrifuge with a payload capacity of 182 kg at case western reserve university figueroa et al 1998 the radius of the rotation arm during the flight is 1 37 m and the maximum acceleration is 200 g for static tests and 100 g for dynamic tests the scale transformation is according to the centrifuge scaling law as listed in table 1 chandrasekaran 2003 wang et al 2015 the maximum of the centrifuge acceleration is 30 g for all the tests representing a scaling factor n equals to 30 for data interpretations all the results presented in the following sections are in the prototype scale for consistency 2 1 model configuration four suction bucket foundations models are fabricated and tested in this study as shown in fig 1 they have the same diameter of 2 1 m the skirt lengths of the models are 0 63 m 1 05 m 1 47 m and 2 1 m respectively representing the aps of 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 the bucket models are made of steel with an identical young s modulus ep of 200 gpa the thickness of the top lid is 0 02 m and the thickness of the skirt is 0 015 m no drainage hole is placed on the top of the bucket due to the limitation of the fabrication technique and this design is beneficial for maintaining the integration of the top lid and avoid the stress concentration detail information of the buckets is summarized in table 2 the foundations are designed according to a 2 5 mw owt that installed in jiangsu china with a scale ratio of 1 16 zhang et al 2016 the thickness of the bucket skirt is determined according to several bucket models that have been used in previously reported model tests and they have a similar thickness to diameter ratio of 0 007 the skirt thickness of the bucket models is the minimum value that can be fabricated hung et al 2017 villalobos et al 2010 the models are installed in the rigid container fixed at one end of the rotation arm which has the prototype dimensions of 16 6 7 2 5 3 m length width height the width and height of the container are 3 5 times and 2 5 times of the bucket diameter and the maximum skirt length and the boundary effect is minimized 2 2 soil properties the fine grained silica sand is used in the centrifuge tests before preparing the soil the silica sand is oven dried for 24 h the dry sand is air pluviated into the rigid container with a constant height of 0 8 m layer by layer and slight compactions are applied to obtain a desired relative density wang et al 2018a the de air water is instilled slowly from the bottom of the rigid container to saturate the dry sand and vacuum is applied for 24 h for the saturation process the permeability of the sand is 5 85 10 4 m s which is calculated with the kozeny carman equation carman 1937 the relative density of the soil was carefully measured before starting the centrifuge according to the astm standard astm 2006 which was about 70 for saturated sand classified as dense sand the soil layer is prepared according to several published studies of the suction bucket foundation whose relative density of sand was 80 85 houlsby et al 2006 and 68 lian et al 2014 to ensure the identical condition for all the centrifuge tests the soil is newly prepared for each test with the same procedures the final height of the sand deposit is 4 5 m for all the tests the mechanical properties of the sand are listed in table 3 through a series of laboratory tests the grain size distribution of the silica sand is plotted in fig 2 the friction angle between the bucket surface and the sand is measured using the direct shear test the lower part of the shear box is replaced by a steel plate that is made of the same material with the bucket model and the upper part of the shear box is filled with the saturated silica sand that has been compacted to the required relative density the steel soil interface friction angle is 28 3 the silica sand has a relatively small particle size and this characteristic is preferable in centrifuge modelling since the scale effect is minimized randolph et al 1992 although the particle size is smaller the silica sand has the ability to maintain the proper internal friction angle for the bearing capacity analysis 2 3 test setup the centrifuge tests conducted in this study are load controlled the sin shape loadings are applied by the electrical actuator fixed vertically above the container a load cell is installed at the tip of the actuator and a rod is fabricated to connect the load cell and the suction bucket foundation which is helpful to position the bucket foundation a horizontal flat board is fixed at the tip of the actuator to connect the lvdt and hence the lvdt is able to move vertically simultaneously with the buckets to record the displacement to minimize the measurement errors the load cell was calibrated before each test the initial positions of the transducers and the wire length are set to be identical for each test this loading system has been used in several projects and the repeatability of the test results have been checked and reported previously wang et al 2017b 2018c it was demonstrated that the repeated test showed strong agreements compared to the original tests and the measurement error of the sensors are within an acceptable range a data acquisition system is installed in the centrifuge to record the data during the flight the test package is depicted in fig 3 a total number of eight centrifuge tests are performed including one compression test and one tension test for each suction bucket foundation the bucket foundations are installed after the saturation of the sandy soil cares are taken when installing the models to minimize the disturbances to the prepared soil the buckets are installed by jacking at 1 g and no suction installation is considered in this study which is relevant to the first stage of self weight penetration in a real site in the suction installation the upwards hydraulic gradient inside the bucket significantly affects the internal vertical stress on the contrary the buildup of excess pore water pressure is much milder in the jacking installation to furthest minimize the disturbance of sand inside the bucket during the installation the models are slowly pushed into the sand until the top lid just gets connected with the sand surface the penetration rate is about 0 3 mm s and the settlement is carefully monitored by the lvdt it was demonstrated that the penetration resistances with different scaled rates are consistent lian et al 2014 a pore water pressure transducer ppt is put adjacent to the bucket skirt to monitor the pore water pressure in real time and it illustrates no significant buildup of excess pore water pressure during the jacking installation meanwhile 12 h are allocated for the full dissipation of the possible excess pore water pressures before starting the centrifuge the soil heaving is not observed during the installation procedure the identical installation procedure is used for each centrifuge test to minimize the effects of final results subsequent to the placement of each bucket foundation the external loadings are applied until the bucket reaches failure the compressive and tensile loadings are applied slowly with a duration of 40 min to avoid piping or cavitation eid 2012 influences of the loading rate have been investigated previously in the centrifuge it is demonstrated that when the loading duration exceeds 40mins differences in the bearing capacity is minimized wang et al 2018a meanwhile the record of the ppt does not show significant pore water pressure changes in the static tests which is consistent with our previous tests wang et al 2017b according to the studies reported by houlsby et al 2005b if the external load is applied very slowly then the pore water pressures will be small and a fully drained condition is applicable they assumed their slowest test with the rate of 5 mm s to be almost drained and a very low tensile capacity is obtained due to the small value of pore water pressure houlsby et al 2005a therefore the tests are idealized as the fully drained condition for the following calculation houlsby and byrne 2005 the test id consists of two parts the bucket ap and the test feature for example the test ap3 c represents the compression test for the suction bucket foundation with the ap of 0 3 the test details are listed in table 4 3 test results and interpretations 3 1 compressive bearing capacity the typical load settlement relationships of the four suction bucket foundation models recorded from the centrifuge tests are depicted in fig 4 the tendencies of the curves are slightly different from the other shallow foundations the buckets experience the linear response initially followed by two reinforcement periods after the critical points and this phenomenon is more obvious for the buckets with larger aps at the linear stage the vertical load increases quickly while the settlement accumulates at a much lower gradient the deformation of the sand inside and outside the foundation is not obvious and it is mainly caused by the extrusion of the soil particles the resistance is mainly provided by the base bearing capacity and the skirt frictions entering the non linear stage the slopes of the load settlement curves decrease significantly with the increase of settlements the soil inside the bucket is constrained by the skirt and hence the soils work together with the foundation of bearing the external loadings with the increase of the vertical load the soils underneath and around the bucket tip start to show plastic deformations afterward the penetration depth of the bucket foundation increases continuously under the vertical loading and hence the constraint provided by the bucket skirt turns to be more effective therefore the load settlement curves demonstrate the second reinforcement stage until the inside soils reach the yielding stage under peak external loadings it is observed that the curves exhibit peaks at which vertical loadings illustrate a slight reduction with further settlements the phenomenon of the two reinforcement stages is not obvious for the buckets with aps of 0 3 and 0 5 the skirt lengths of these two buckets are smaller than the other foundations and the side wall constraints to the soil inside the bucket and the enhancements of the vertical stress are not that effective fig 5 depicts the suction bucket foundation before and after the centrifuge test to illustrate the failure mode the settlement of the foundation accumulates gradually with the increase of the vertical loading so that the local shear failure zone is formed as the external loading increases continuously a triangular wedge shaped zone of soil is pushed down and it in turn presses the surrounding soil sideway and upwards at the ultimate condition the soil is in a state of plastic equilibrium and the foundation undergoes a large settlement without further increases of vertical loadings the slip surface extends to the ground surface therefore it is observed in fig 5 that the soil around the foundation bulges after the test in dense sand the failure mode of the suction bucket foundation is the general shear failure although the bucket does not run through the soil large soil deformation is observed in the tests which is not allowed in practical engineering the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation is extracted as the vertical load corresponded to the distinct peaks of the load settlement curves eid 2012 wang et al 2018a as listed in table 5 the ap has great influence on the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation the bearing capacity tends to increase significantly with the increase of the skirt length as the penetration depth increases the contacting area with the soil is larger and hence the friction resistance is enhanced more importantly the constraint effect on the inside soil contributed by the bucket skirt is strengthened at larger penetration depth and hence the internal soil pressure is increased the inside soil settles together with the foundation and the soil is pressed more significant at the near the bucket tip the phenomenon has been observed previously lian et al 2014 meanwhile the settlement ratios corresponded to the ultimate bearing capacities of the four buckets are listed in table 5 the suction bucket foundation presents failure when the settlement ratio reaches 5 11 some researchers suggest the bearing capacity can be determined when the settlement ratio equals to 10 for simplicity eid 2012 meanwhile it is suggested in the literature that the failure point for the suction bucket foundation is 5 14 of the bucket diameter al aghbari and dutta 2008 which agrees with the test results in this study moreover it is observed that the settlement ratio at failure tends to increase with the increase of the ap 3 2 tensile bearing capacity the owts are sometimes subjected to tensile loadings in service conditions thereby the tension tests are performed in this study to predict the tensile bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation the buckets are loaded in tension after the installation without any significant compressive pre loadings the load displacement curves are presented in fig 6 the responses are very stiff at the initial stage representing the tensile loadings are not large enough to pull out the buckets after the critical points the tendencies of the curves change significantly and the buckets are pulled upwards quickly with large displacements the static friction turns into the dynamic friction and a slight decrease of the tensile loading is observed at the final stage the tension capacity of the suction bucket foundations extracted as the peak tensile loading during the tests and listed in table 6 hung et al 2017 reported a series of 1 g vertical pullout tests for bucket foundations with aps of 0 5 and 1 the results of the centrifuge tests in this study are more conservative compared to their 1 g tests and the influence of the bucket ap is more obvious in the centrifuge the silica sand is used for both of the tests however the relative density of sand in this study is higher the denser sand tends to be more sensitive to the change of aps meanwhile the bucket models are installed at a lower acceleration in the centrifuge tests and hence the subsequent stress increase due to self weight is likely to overcome the initial increase in lateral stress around the bucket due to installation which may lead to a reduction of the bucket capacity craig 1985 under rapid tensile loading the suction pressure is presented inside the bucket which may increase the tensile bearing capacity considerable the maximum capacity is obtained under fully undrained condition the dimension of the bucket the soil permeability the loading rate and the water depth are key factors that influence the tensile bearing capacity thieken et al 2014 in this study the bucket is installed slowly to the position that the lid just contacts with the soil surface and the ppt does not show significant change during the tests the tests are idealized to conduct under the drained condition and hence the suction is not considered in the calculation the bucket tensile bearing capacity is mainly provided by the internal and external skirt frictions which are assumed to be equal in calculating the pullout capacity hung et al 2017 this assumption will lead to an over estimated skirt friction from the tensile tests meanwhile the effective stresses on the annular likely to be sufficiently small that they are neglected in the analysis houlsby and byrne 2005 as expected the tension capacity of the suction bucket foundation is much smaller than the compression capacity moreover it is demonstrated that the tensile skirt friction tends to be smaller than the compressive skirt friction due to the change in mean effective stress conditions the reduction factor is suggested to be 0 55 0 85 from the previous studies de nicola and randolph 1993 1997 the influence of ap is also significant for the tension test the tensile bearing capacity increase with the ap and the increasing rate turns to be larger besides the larger contacting area the skirt constraint effect on the inner soil enhances the soil strength with the same friction coefficient between the soil and steel the friction tends to be larger by the increasing lateral effective stress 3 3 discussions of the bearing capacity during the compression test the ultimate bearing capacity consists of the base capacity and the external skirt friction and the base capacity of the suction bucket foundation is the summation of the end bearing provided by the bucket annulus and the mobilized internal skirt friction from the soil plug due to the fact that the mobilization of the two parts cannot be measured directly the proportion of the base capacity is accomplished by subtracting the curve representing the external skirt friction from the total compressive bearing capacity the external skirt friction is estimated by factoring the tensile skirt friction measured from the tensile test it has been recognized that the tensile skirt friction is lower than the compressive skirt friction due to the soil constraint effect and the reduction factor ranges from 0 55 to 0 85 de nicola and randolph 1997 in this study a consistent value of tensile to compressive skirt resistance ratio is assumed as 0 66 from the previous tests and the degradation of skirt friction during the test is not considered de nicola and randolph 1993 villalobos et al 2010 the estimated base capacity the external skirt friction and their sharing factors are listed in table 7 and they are plotted against the aps as shown in fig 7 it is demonstrated in fig 7 that the base capacity of the suction bucket foundation contributes the majority of the ultimate bearing capacity under compressive loadings and the sharing factor is larger than 90 when the ap is equal or lower than 1 the external skirt friction tends to increase with the increase of aps but the increment is relatively mild since the absolute value of the skirt friction accounts for a small portion of the total capacity however the sharing factor of friction tends to increase at larger penetration depths and hence the component of external skirt friction is likely to be more effective with the increase of aps the base capacity of the suction bucket foundation consists of the tip resistance and the plug resistance the plug resistance is proved to provide a larger portion of the base capacity since the thickness of the steel bucket is much smaller than the total diameter zhang et al 2016 the base capacity increases with the aps but with a reducing gradient thereby the sharing ratio of the base capacity decreases with the increase of embedment depth for the wide shallow bucket foundation the bearing capacity is mainly provided by the base capacity but this tendency turns to be less significant with the increase of aps 4 analysis of bearing capacity 4 1 calculation of the skirt friction and base capacity the ultimate bearing capacity fc ult of the suction bucket foundation under the compressive axial loading condition is mainly resisted by the end bearing fbase and the external skirt friction fout eq 1 the total resistance ft ult on the suction bucket under tensile loading condition is calculated as the summation of the internal skirt friction fin and the external skirt friction fout eq 2 under drained condition in this section the skirt friction and the base capacity are analyzed separately to assess the bearing capacity theoretically and the methods are calibrated with the centrifuge test results 1 f c u l t f o u t f b a s e 2 f t u l t f i n f o u t 4 1 1 skirt friction for the suction bucket foundation in sandy soil the skirt friction is calculated by factoring vertical effective stress adjacent to the foundation eq 3 and this method has been used in the analysis by several researchers byrne et al 2003 hung et al 2017 3 f s k i r t f i n f o u t γ h 2 2 k f tan δ π d where γ is the effective unit weight of the silica sand and h is the skirt length kf is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure δ is the interface friction angle between the steel and the sand being 28 3 as mentioned above and d is the bucket diameter the external skirt friction is assumed to equal to the internal skirt friction in the tensile condition and the change of vertical stress close to the bucket is not accounted for the dnv standard standard 2007 suggests a kf value of 0 8 for the bucket foundation houlsby et al houlsby and byrne 2005 reported that it is not possible to separate the effects of kf and tan δ and the term kf tan δ is suggested to be 0 7 in the calculation hung et al 2017 determine a kf tan δ value of 0 85 according to the 1 g model tests the measured skirt friction from the tensile tests is listed in table 8 together with the analytical results it is demonstrated that the factor suggested by houlsby reaches the best agreement with the measured results and hence the kf tan δ value of 0 7 is used in the following analysis the centrifuge tests are assumed to conduct under the drained condition and the suction pressures are not considered therefore the calculated ultimate tensile capacity of the suction bucket foundation tends to be less conservative afterward the compressive skirt friction is estimated by factoring the calculated tensile skirt friction as mentioned above 4 1 2 base capacity under the vertical loadings the bucket skirt forms an enclosure in which is soil is constrained strictly and the soil has no tendency to flow out of the bucket the triangular wedge zone is pushed down with the increase of penetration depths finally the soils underneath and surround the bucket reach plastic deformations at failures the soil inside the bucket works as a unit together with the overlain foundation to sustain the vertical loading therefore the failure mechanism of the suction bucket foundation under vertical loadings is similar to the embedded circular footing byrne et al 2003 yun and bransby 2007 the base capacity is estimated by the terzaghi s ultimate bearing capacity equation for circular footings in sandy soil terzaghi 1951 the equation has the following form 4 f b a s e q n q 0 3 γ d n r where nq and nr are bearing capacity factors determined according to the peak friction angle of the soil and q is the uniform surcharge above the base of the footing this is regarded as the first method in predicting the base capacity in this study it is suggested by yun and bransby 2007 that the ultimate bearing capacity of the skirt foundation is reduced by the weight of soil inside the bucket when using the terzaghi s capacity equation due to the small thickness of the bucket skirt the bucket diameter is convenient to use in assessing the reduction of this end bearing resistance this method is regarded as the second method in estimating the base capacity and eq 4 is modified as 5 f b a s e q n q 0 3 γ d n r γ h π d 2 4 al aghbari 2000 proposed a modified method to estimate the bearing capacity of the skirt foundation by introducing a skirt factor fsr to the second part of the terzaghi s ultimate bearing capacity equation the skirt friction considers the surface roughness the soil characteristic and the skirt penetration depth the modified bearing capacity equation is expressed as 6 f b a s e q n q 0 3 γ d n r f s r 7 f s r f s f f s d 8 f s f 1 06 tan δ s tan δ s i where fsf is the friction ratio related to the sand steel interface friction angle in which δs is the friction angle between the bucket skirt and the soil and the δsi is the standard interface friction angle that equals to 28 fsd is the skirt depth factor that is related to aps and the factor is defined as 1 approximately regardless of the skirt length al aghbari 2000 this method is regarded as the third method to estimate the base capacity of the suction bucket foundation in sandy soil 4 1 3 ultimate bearing capacity the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation under compressive loading is the summation of the base capacity and the skirt friction as shown in eq 1 in the estimation of the base capacity the internal soil is assumed to work together with the bucket foundation and hence only the external skirt friction is considered in the calculation in the following analysis the skirt friction is estimated using the houlsby suggested factor and the base capacity is calculated using the three methods listed above the calculated ultimate bearing capacities are listed together with the test results in table 9 to demonstrate the features of these analytical methods more clearly the ultimate bearing capacities are plotted with the bucket aps in fig 8 the calculated results are extended to ap 0 representing the surface foundation without penetration of the skirt the calculated results fall well within the spread of values obtained from the centrifuge tests the analytical methods are applicable in calculating the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation to be more specific the method 1 from the terzaghi s equation tends to be conservative compared with the centrifuge tests especially when for larger aps method 2 is the modification of method 1 with a reduction of the internal soil weight however the difference is not obvious the influence of the soil self weight is not significant in the overall bearing capacity the calculated results from method 3 is larger than the other two methods due to the introduction of the skirt factor comparing with the test results the analytical results tend to be conservative especially when the ap is larger than 0 7 this is acceptable for design purpose attentions should be paid if the ap of the bucket increase continuously consequently these analytical methods provide acceptable solutions in analyzing the ultimate bearing capacity and they are more applicable for the wide shallow bucket foundation 4 2 bearing capacity of the surface foundation and the suction bucket foundation lacking of established methods in estimating the bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation the flat surface foundation has been frequently used to investigate the skirted foundation in sandy soil al aghbari and dutta 2008 estimating the bearing capacity of the flat surface footing is relatively easy by using terzaghi s equation through the analysis the suction bucket foundation is regarded as an enhancement of the surface foundation by accounting for the overburden effects and the improvement is represented in terms of the bearing capacity ratio of the two foundations fult fsur this method is beneficial for estimating the overall bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation in an integrate manner instead of calculating the base capacity and the skirt friction separately which may introduce more bias the bearing capacity ratio is greatly influenced by the skirt penetration depth or the ap of the bucket foundation and the calculation procedure has been suggested by several researchers byrne dyme and houlsby 1998 suggests the value of the bearing capacity ratio by the following linear relationship 9 f u l t f s u r 1 0 89 h d if the flat footing has the same diameter with the skirted foundation then it is straight forward to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity of the bucket foundation by considering the bucket dimension it is clearly shown that the bearing capacity increases significantly with the skirt length which agrees well with the centrifuge test results hisham eid 2012 recommends a conservative approximation of the bearing capacity ratio by the following equation 10 f u l t f s u r 1 8 h d this method gives an estimation of the lower bound of the bucket foundation bearing capacity regardless of the sand shear strength and the relative density the analytical results are summarized together with the centrifuge test results in table 10 the results calculated from the two methods stated above are smaller than the test results eq 9 is derived from a series of small scale laboratory tests with very dense sand and the bucket soil interface friction coefficient is assumed to be 0 25 in the analysis which is much smaller than the results of centrifuge tests described in this study meanwhile eq 8 is proposed from a set of model tests conducted in dry sand and a conservative approximation is used to derive the equation therefore the bearing capacity ratios obtained from the centrifuge test in this study are plotted against the bucket aps in fig 9 it is demonstrated that the bearing capacity ratio increases in a linear manner with the ap and the relationship is described by the following equation 11 f u l t f s u r 1 4 09 h d eq 11 provides an expedient way to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation based on a series of centrifuge tests comparing to previously reported results this method provides a relatively less conservative estimation which is regarded as the upper bound in the analysis the bearing capacity ratio is not likely to be largely influenced by the bucket diameter since the ap is the main concern and hence this method has wider applicability for variable bucket models meanwhile this method is more applicable to the skirted foundation installed in saturated dense sand 5 conclusions a series of centrifuge tests have been performed in this study to investigate the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation for owts four bucket foundation models are fabricated by considering the influence of aps the tests are conducted in saturated sandy soil the ultimate bearing capacities are extracted from the compressive tests the base capacities as well as the skirt frictions are determined with the assistance of tensile tests several analytical methods are proposed to estimate the bearing capacity a separate estimations of the base capacity and the skirt friction b integrated calculations of the bearing capacity referring to the capacity of the surface foundation the analytical methods are compared with the centrifuge test results based on which design recommendations are put forward the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the ultimate bearing capacity of the suction bucket foundation increases continuously with the ap besides the increase of contacting area the internal soil is constrained by the bucket skirt and the soil pressure is enhanced 2 the main failure mode of the bucket foundation under vertical loadings is the general shear failure and the soil around the foundation bulges after the tests 3 the tensile capacity of the suction bucket foundation is much smaller than the compressive bearing capacity and it tends to increase with the bucket ap at an increasing gradient 4 the ultimate bearing capacity is mainly provided by the bucket lid the sharing factor of the skirt friction tends to increase with the ap representing the lid resistance is gradually transferred to the skirt resistance 5 the internal skirt friction is 4 5 times of the external skirt friction for the suction bucket foundation under compressive loadings due to the skirt constraint effect and increased internal vertical stress this factor tends to be conservative at larger aps 6 the soil inside the bucket works as a unit with the foundation to resist the vertical loading the base capacity of the bucket foundation is estimated as the embedded circular footing three analytical methods are checked with the test results and these methods are more applicable in predicting the bearing capacity of the wide shallow bucket foundation 7 the bearing capacity ratio between the bucket foundation and the corresponded surface foundation are analyzed to predict the

protective measure to prevent damage to the riser system when dynamic positioning dp system failure is encountered grønevik 2013 on 20 march 2006 the riser accident occurred in diamond offshore company s drilling ship resulting in the loss of 218 barrels of synthetic based drilling fluid and the accident was caused by the failure of red after dp system failure ju et al 2012 the deepwater horizon accident on 20 april 2010 which might be the largest marine catastrophe was caused partially due to the failure of red system cai et al 2013 red failure though rare is likely to cause blowout which is the most undesired and feared accident that greatly threatens human lives environment and assets the red is a sequential process with multiple stages and it can be roughly separated into four stages the operation steps and equipment involved are different in different stage and the failure probability of the equipment will change over time in practical operational conditions various factors e g human factor equipment factor time factor and operation factor are all able to cause the failure of red which could cause disastrous consequences in deepwater drilling however studies for

drilling risers however the study only focused on the overall failure analysis without analyzing the individual stages respectively and traditional analysis methods are mostly aimed at the static characteristics of equipment which can t reflect the change of equipment reliability with time and operational procedures of red in different stage are also not taken into account it is difficult to

to meet the practical engineering requirements risk analysis is an effective tool to determine the probability of accidents in offshore drilling operations it can evaluate the factors that cause the accident and formulate corresponding mitigation measures khakzad et al 2013 there are many risk analysis methods used by researchers including fault tree iman and hora 2010 reliability block diagram guo and yang 2007 petri net chang et al 2018b go methodology shen et al 2000 markov chain whittaker et al 2000 and bn khakzad et al 2011 red is a multi state and sequential systems effected by complex factors and go methodology is a superior option in the probability analysis of multi state and sequential systems it is a success oriented system analysis technique and has become an effective

proposed in section 3 in section 4 the success probability prediction model of red is established by using dbn go approach section 5 is a case study regarding the application of dbn go approach in quantitative success probability analysis of red finally summary and conclusions were provided in section 6 2 background there are three main reasons for the red fig 1 of the drilling riser system that include drift off drive off and the rapidly developing of local typhoons drift off is an event normally caused by loss of power malfunction in the power system engine breakdown or mechanical and human errors of the dp system when the dp system can no longer hold the position the increasing offset of the drilling vessel due to wind wave and current will cause large horizontal force and bending moment to the subsea wellhead by drilling riser system and the red must be activated to avoid possible accident iso 2010 a drive off is much the same as a drift off but it comes from a malfunction in the dp system causing the rig to drive off from its location this is a very critical event due to the higher velocity of the vessel and it provides a short available time to activate the red before the horizontal offset gets too large ambrose et al 2001 for local typhoons the drilling risers will disconnect from the bops before a typhoon is fully developed which is called planned disconnect however if the storm is larger than predicted or if an unanticipated rapidly developing seastate happens an unplanned emergency disconnect would be needed to secure the drilling risers and wellhead generally compared with local typhoons dp system failure is a more typical case of red which is therefore used as the event of activating red in this paper the success probability that red will be successfully completed within the well specific operational guidelines wsog watch circles was analyzed wsog were made according to marine environment and the specific conditions of drilling ship establishing alert offsets for the emergency disconnect of the vessel connected riser system through drift off analysis is used to determine the point of disconnect fig 2 in fig 2 the green region indicates that drilling can be carried out normally the yellow region indicates that the dynamic positioning has lost some of its ability to maintain position the red region is the maximum allowable drift range for the vessel before activating the emergency disconnect procedure and the red should be completed to avoid any damage to subsea equipment before the vessel reaches the physical limit there are four operation cases for red namely drilling casing cementing and logging the operation process of red under four cases is analyzed cnooc 2011 and the flow chart is established for each of them as depicted in fig 3 in fig 3 if drilling vessel enters yellow region and the drift trend is uncontrollable preparation for red should be started let us take drilling stage for example to explain the procedure for red the operations of red in drilling stage involved the following seven main steps 1 switch the mode of emergency disconnect sequence eds eds consists of the following two modes mode 1 only upper blind shear rams will close mode 2 both high pressure casing shear rams and upper blind shear ram will close 2 stop drilling operation 3 lift the drilling tool to suitable position and then shut off pumps 4 close pipe ram close the ram with full operating pressure and then reduce pressure and hang after that increase pressure to full operating pressure 5 adjust crown mounted compensator cmc to support more than 125 of landing string weight 6 clear drilling floor and moon pool area the above mentioned preparation should be completed before the vessel reaches the red region 7 when drilling vessel enters red region the driller should press the emergency disconnect button immediately and the red program is activated 3 risk analysis techniques 3 1 go methodology go methodology is mainly aimed at analyzing the success probability of the systems especially for multi state and sequential systems the analysis process of go methodology starts from the input event and determines the final probability of the system through the calculation of a go model go model is composed of signal flow and operators shen et al 2001 2003 the signal flow represents the input or output of the system unit and the correlation between the units the numbered form of operators in the go model can be represented as n i where n is an operator type and i is the signal flow of the connection operator go methodology includes 17 kinds of table operators four types of go operators are involved in this paper including types 1 5 6 and 7 as shown in fig 4 the two states of success and failure are considered in all kinds of operators s represents input signal and output signal is represented by r 3 2 dbn bn is a graphical technique that has been widely applied in the field of risk analysis known as an inference probabilistic method bn used nodes arcs and probability tables to represent a set of random variables and the conditional dependencies among them cai et al 2016 amin et al 2018 the relationship between parent and child nodes can be obtained based on conditional independence and chain rules the joint probability distribution of variables u a 1 a 2 a n can be expressed as 1 p u i 1 n p a i p a a i where pa a i is the parent set of variable a i dbn is a stochastic model with processing time series based on static bn and hidden markov model combining static network and time information the model uses directed edges to connect the static networks on different time slices in chronological order each time step in a dbn is called a time slice typically two time slices for each variable are considered in order to model the system s temporal evolution the state at time t δt is only related to the state of time t but not to the state of time before t dbn can be represented as b 0 b as shown in fig 5 where b 0 is a prior network defining joint probability distribution in the initial state b is the transfer network defining the conditional probability distribution p a t δ t a t between t and t δt 2 p a t δ t a t i 1 n p a t δ t i p a a t i where a t i is the value of the i th variable at time t p a a t i is the parent node and n is the number of variables 3 3 cream in order to obtain the success probability of red it is necessary to determine the reliability of human factors as they are the influencing factors in red but their values cannot be determined in dbn go model in this paper considering the effect of the surrounding environment operation process and personal perception on the related equipment during operation the human reliability during red operations is obtained by using cream cream is a representative second generation reliability analysis method fujita and hollnagel 2004 serwy and rantanen 2007 it focuses on the mechanism and probability of human error in specific environmental context on the basis of the first generation of human reliability analysis in order to determine the human factor probability in red analysis cognitive functions in cream are divided into four categories i e observation interpretation planning and execution and there are several failure modes for each category the most likely cognitive function mode and cognitive failure probability cfp of each cognitive activity in red is determined according to the comparison table of cognitive activity and cognitive function subsequently the level of common performance conditions cpc factors given by cram is evaluated and the expected effect on performance reliability and the weight factor corresponding to cognitive function are determined the weight factors of each cpc factor for each cognitive function are obtained and then the product of weight factors of all cpc factors under each cognitive function is obtained which is the total weight tw of the cognitive function finally by using eq 3 the modified value of failure probability corresponding to each cognitive activity is obtained that is human factor probability 3 p h f c f p t w where p hf is the probability of human factor 3 4 iahp in cream reliability analysis of multi person collaborative tasks is one of the difficulties in human reliability analysis and there is no linear relationship between the task reliability of multi person collaboration and the reliability of multiple single tasks causing the inaccuracy of the failure probability results of red in this paper iahp is used to quantitatively calculate the change in failure probability of human factors that may be caused by the above problem to modify the success probability of red obtained by using cream ahp introduced by satty saaty and vargas 2012 is a quantitative technique that structures a multi criteria multi person multi factor problem hierarchically so that solutions are facilitated tyagi 2016 despite the wealth of experience and exposure to red accidents different experts may have different preferences about each basic event which may result in significant variations of the probability values a weighting factor is adopted to distinguish the relative quality of the response of various experts based on the evaluation criteria selected for priority ranking the iahp is used to quantify the relative importance of each expert which would mitigate the subjectivity of human judgment and improve the accuracy of probability prediction as much as possible the experts are evaluated in terms of four aspects namely personal experience knowledge sources of information and evaluation objectivity shi and shuai 2014 for these four aspects their weights are 0 3913 0 3043 0 1739 and 0 1304 respectively and then a total score of 100 is assumed for each ability for each ability the score is assigned to the five experts and the experts are given weight in this ability p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 4 represent experts weights in personal experience knowledge sources of information and evaluation objectivity respectively each expert s comprehensive weight w can be derived from eq 4 4 w 0 3913 p 1 0 3043 p 2 0 1739 p 3 0 1304 p 4 experts evaluate events through five levels of fuzzy language including very low vl low l medium m high h and very high vh using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers the fuzzy language is converted into a scale and the corresponding subjective fuzzy failure probability value is obtained lavasani et al 2011 the subjective fuzzy failure probability is brought into the following formula and the expert s fuzzy judgment language is transformed into an objective fuzzy failure probability onisawa 1998 and defuzzification processing is performed ultimately 3 5 proposed approach dbn go method is a risk analysis method by using the bayesian probability formula algorithm and go methodology that can handle the complicated security analysis problems that contain multi state time series and multi time nodes more easily compared with traditional risk analysis methods go model is established according to the operation steps of red and the common operators of go methodology are mapped into bn then the related root nodes of bn are determined considering the effect of equipment failure cream are used to determine the probabilities of human factors in dbn go model and the results obtained by cream are modified by iahp furthermore considering the variation of equipment failure probability with time the transition probability tables of equipment nodes is determined in dbn model and the developed dbn go model could be used to dynamically predict the success probability of red within a drilling duration the proposed framework for success probability prediction of red in different stages using dbn go approach is shown in fig 6 4 dbn go model of red 4 1 establishment of go model the go model of red is established by connecting all the go operators with the signal flow fig 7 in which the flow chart of red is translated into go operators the number of go model corresponding to each unit in the flow chart is shown in table 1 in fig 7 taking the most typical drilling stage as an example the correspondence between each operation and the type of go operator is explained as follows the input of the system is dp system failure which is represented by type 5 operator each step needs execution action as an excitation signal that is the input signal type 5 operator is required the operation of starting pre disconnect program and the operation of observing and evaluating the situation of drift off after adjusting cmc have two states success and failure which can be represented by type 1 operator similarly the operations of switching eds mode lifting the drilling tool to suitable position clearing drilling floor and moon pool area and subsequently activating eds after the red alert appears can be represented by type 6 operator and the operations of closing pipe ram can be represented by type 7 operator 4 2 mapping the go operators into bn the bn model mapped form the go model is built using graphical network interface genie software and the mapping algorithm of go operators to bn is shown in fig 8 liu et al 2015 2018 in fig 8 p is the probability corresponding to state 1 success or state 2 failure a mapping algorithm of type 1 and type 5 operators is shown in fig 8 a and b operator 5 1 represents dp system failure operator 1 2 represents the operation of starting pre disconnect program in the bn model the probability of each state of sc2 is only affected by sp1 and the probability of each state is identical with that of sp1 the mapping algorithms of type 6 operator and type 7 operator are shown in fig 8 c and d operator 6 4 represents the operation of switching eds in mode 1 and operator 7 6 represents the operation of stopping the ongoing operation after yellow alert the corresponding bn model mapped from the go model is shown in fig 9 sci is a node corresponding to the output signal stream and spi is a node of the human factor in order to further improve the accuracy of the model the nodes representing the effect of equipment reliability and communication difficulties between groups on red is added into bn model cei is a node of the equipment failure in the corresponding operation and cd is a node of communication difficulties between groups of personnel in an emergency scenario the node ed represents the success of red in different stages finally a bn model of red is established fig 10 and the nodes corresponding to the number in the go model is shown in table 1 4 3 establishment of dbn go model the influence of dynamic node probability on red is analyzed considering the variation of equipment reliability with time the bn model can be extended to a dbn model by introducing relevant temporal dependencies that capture the dynamic behaviors of the domain variables between representations of the static network at different times it is known that the key challenge for dbn is to define transition probabilities as the status values of parent nodes will shift over time the dynamic probability of equipment is analyzed by using the degradation model in this paper and the relationship of equipment failure probability between t and t δt will be explained in section 4 4 the final established dbn go model is shown in fig 11 4 4 probability determination of nodes in dbn go model 4 4 1 human factors nodes the most likely cognitive function failure mode and cfp of each cognitive activity in red is determined according to the comparison table of cognitive activity and cognitive function according to the cpcs level and performance reliability and weight factor table the available time level is insufficient and other cpc is the best condition and the total weight of four types of cognitive function is obtained finally by using eq 3 the human factors failure probability of the bn root node spi corresponding to red was determined as listed in table 2 4 4 2 communication difficulties nodes the iahp method is used to modify the success probability of red obtained by the cream to obtain more accurate success probability of red in emergency scenario five experts in the field of offshore oil drilling were invited to quantitatively evaluate the change of human factors in emergencies such as the effect of difficult communication between groups in emergency scenario on the success probability of red and their ability weights p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 were graded their comprehensive weights w is calculated using eq 4 expert s ability weights p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 and their comprehensive weights w are listed in table 3 experts evaluated the effect of harsh environment on red by five levels of fuzzy language the fuzzy language is converted into a scale and the corresponding failure probability value of each stage is obtained the fuzzy language of experts and the result of defuzzification treatment are shown in table 4 4 4 3 equipment factors nodes given that an equipment exists two states work 1 and fault 2 the state conversion diagram of a degenerate model is shown in fig 12 where λ is the fault rate from state 1 to state 2 and μ is repair rate from state 2 to state 1 the failure and repair rates of each equipment are predicted according to offshore reliability data oreda 2002 and their failure probabilities are calculated in the 52 nd week with imperfect repair cai et al 2013 as listed in table 5 assuming that the current time is t and the time interval between two successive trials is δt then the transition relations between consecutive nodes without repair and with repair can be determined which are given in tables 6 and 7 respectively 5 case study 5 1 success probability prediction of red in different stages the bn go model is used to determine the success probability of red in each stages and identify the key steps corresponding to each stage by using the failure probability of the equipment in table 5 the success probability of red in different stages can be obtained s1 s2 s3 and s4 represent drilling casing cementing and logging stages as shown in fig 13 the success probabilities of s1 s2 s3 and s4 are 94 6 97 6 96 7 and 98 3 respectively among those the drilling stage has the lowest success probability and the reason is that more equipment and more complicated operation steps are involved in the drilling stage each step of different stages is analyzed respectively to obtain the change of success probability fig 14 the operation steps for each stage are uniformly represented by number n n 1 2 3 in fig 14 the initial input of each stage is the probability of dp system failure which is represented by 0 and n represents the nth step in each stage each step in the four stages is analyzed to determine the key steps that are most likely to lead to failure of red the growth rate of the failure probability is obtained by calculating the difference between the probability of the current step and the probability of the previous step the ratio of the growth rate to the total failure probability of this stage is defined as the influence degree of the step on the failure of red in fig 14 the n 1 th step is the previous operation of the nth step therefore the calculation formula is as follows 5 p i n p n p n 1 p s where p i n is the influence degree of step n p n is the failure probability of step n p n 1 is the failure probability of step n 1 p s is the total failure probability at the corresponding stage the influence degree of each step in the four stages are analyzed and shown in fig 15 a d respectively the key steps are determined by the influence degree and the influence degree of each step is proportional to their corresponding failure probability furthermore the failure probability of each step is determined by the reliability of equipment and human factors in drilling stage for the operation of lifting drilling tool or the operation of closing pipe ram the reliability of equipment and human factors are high which makes the success probability of these steps relatively higher for the operation of observing and evaluating the potential collision of lmrp with seabed after adjusting cmc sc12 the whole process is adjusted and judged by operators which makes the human reliability of the step much lower than that of other steps as it depends on the operators subjective judgment and consequently the failure probability of the step is higher resulting in higher influence degree of the step in drilling stage in casing stage cementing stage and logging stage human reliability is relatively high in each step the influence degree of each step is mainly affected by the reliability of equipment compared with other steps in the corresponding stage the operation of buckling casing elevator sc22 and the operation of picking up casing string and open cmc sc24 in casing stage the operation of displacing cement from landing string sc36 in cementing stage and the operation of lifting the logging tool over bops sc50 in logging stage is relatively more complex and the reliability of the equipment involved in these steps is relatively lower therefore the failure probability of these step is higher resulting in higher influence degree of these steps in corresponding stage 5 2 dynamic success probability prediction of red the dbn go model is used to analyze the dynamic success probability of red drilling wireline logging casing cementing and cementing quality logging are carried out in turn in a drilling duration in this paper the wireline logging and cementing quality logging are unified as logging for illustrative purpose 90 days could be selected as a drilling duration to analyze the success probability of red chang et al 2018a the reliability data of the relevant equipment in red with different time is calculated by formula in tables 5 and 6 assuming that the equipment is not repaired the success probability of red during a drilling duration is obtained fig 16 the lowest success probability occurs in the drilling stage with a value of 92 71 the success probability will decrease quickly given that the equipment is not repaired which means related equipment should be regularly maintained in order to improve the success probability of red the four stages of red within 10 years are analyzed respectively considering the two cases of repair and non repair fig 17 the reliability data of the relevant equipment in red with different time is calculated using formula in tables 5 7 the success probability of red without repair will decrease rapidly with time and then gradually stabilized among the stages s4 shows the slowest decrease in success probability the related equipment involved in s2 and s3 show high failure rate and consequently the success probability of s2 and s3 decrease relatively quickly the success probabilities of these stages decrease to almost 0 in 10 years given the equipment is repaired the success probabilities of the four stages decrease slightly at the beginning and then keep a fixed value 6 summary and conclusions in this work a dbn go approach is proposed to dynamically analyze the success probability of red over time the advantages of go methodology in sequential system and dbn in quantitative analysis of dynamic probability of complex system are combined compared with other risk analysis methods the proposed method can not only reflect the sequence relationship between the various steps but also can takes into account the influence of various factors such as equipment human factor and time factor on the operation it can make a more comprehensive study on the success probability analysis of red operations to meet the actual engineering requirements the analysis results obtained from this study could provide reference for risk decision making of red operations and a better vision of red safety issues the success probability of red in different stages is analyzed as well as the key steps are identified using the developed dbn go model the research showed that the red has the lowest success probability in the drilling stage and the key step of a successful red in drilling stage is the operation of observing and evaluating the potential collision of lmrp with seabed after adjusting cmc similarly the key steps in the other three stages are identified the operation of buckling casing elevator and the operation of picking up casing string and open cmc is the key step in casing stage while the operation of displacing cement from landing string is the key step in cementing stage and the operation of lifting the logging tool is the key step in logging stage additionally the success probability of key steps in red is affect by human factors and equipment factors for human factors the training and safety awareness of the operators should be strengthened to find operation errors timely by comparing the results of equipment repaired and non repaired on the success probability of red it could be concluded that equipment with repair can considerably improve the success probability of red thus the equipment should be regularly maintained and even replaced by new one to further improve the success probability of red acknowledgments thanks are given to five domain experts for their input and insight without which this research would not have been possible this project is supported by

and then shut off pumps 4 close pipe ram close the ram with full operating pressure and then reduce pressure and hang after that increase pressure to full operating pressure 5 adjust crown mounted compensator cmc to support more than 125 of landing string weight 6 clear drilling floor and moon pool area the above mentioned preparation should be completed before the vessel reaches the red region 7 when drilling vessel enters red region the driller should press the emergency disconnect button immediately and the red program is activated 3 risk analysis techniques 3 1 go methodology go methodology is mainly aimed at analyzing the success probability of the systems especially for multi state and sequential systems the analysis process of go methodology starts from the input event and determines the final probability of the system through the calculation of a go model go model is composed of signal flow and operators shen et al 2001 2003 the signal flow represents the input or output of the system unit and the correlation between the units the numbered form of operators in the go model can be represented as n i where n is an operator type and i is the signal flow of the connection operator go methodology includes 17 kinds of table operators four types of go operators are involved in this paper including types 1 5 6 and 7 as shown in fig 4 the two states of success and failure are considered in all kinds of operators s represents input signal and output signal is represented by r 3 2 dbn bn is a graphical technique that has been widely applied in the field of risk analysis known as an inference probabilistic method bn used nodes arcs and probability tables to represent a set of random variables and the conditional dependencies among them cai et al 2016 amin et al 2018 the relationship between parent and child nodes can be obtained based on conditional independence and chain rules the joint probability distribution of variables u a 1 a 2 a n can be expressed as 1 p u i 1 n p a i p a a i where pa a i is the parent set of variable a i dbn is a stochastic model with processing time series based on static bn and hidden markov model combining static network and time information the model uses directed edges to connect the static networks on different time slices in chronological order each time step in a dbn is called a time slice typically two time slices for each variable are considered in order to model the system s temporal evolution the state at time t δt is only related to the state of time t but not to the state of time before t dbn can be represented as b 0 b as shown in fig 5 where b 0 is a prior network defining joint probability distribution in the initial state b is the transfer network defining the conditional probability distribution p a t δ t a t between t and t δt 2 p a t δ t a t i 1 n p a t δ t i p a a t i where a t i is the value of the i th variable at time t p a a t i is the parent node and n is the number of variables 3 3 cream in order to obtain the success probability of red it is necessary to determine the reliability of human factors as they are the influencing factors in red but their values cannot be determined in dbn go model in this paper considering the effect of the surrounding environment operation process and personal perception on the related equipment during operation the human reliability during red operations is obtained by using cream cream is a representative second generation reliability analysis method fujita and hollnagel 2004 serwy and rantanen 2007 it focuses on the mechanism and probability of human error in specific environmental context on the basis of the first generation of human reliability analysis in order to determine the human factor probability in red analysis cognitive functions in cream are divided into four categories i e observation interpretation planning and execution and there are several failure modes for each category the most likely cognitive function mode and cognitive failure probability cfp of each cognitive activity in red is determined according to the comparison table of cognitive activity and cognitive function subsequently the level of common performance conditions cpc factors given by cram is evaluated and the expected effect on performance reliability and the weight factor corresponding to cognitive function are determined the weight factors of each cpc factor for each cognitive function are obtained and then the product of weight factors of all cpc factors under each cognitive function is obtained which is the total weight tw of the cognitive function finally by using eq 3 the modified value of failure probability corresponding to each cognitive activity is obtained that is human factor probability 3 p h f c f p t w where p hf is the probability of human factor 3 4 iahp in cream reliability analysis of multi person collaborative tasks is one of the difficulties in human reliability analysis and there is no linear relationship between the task reliability of multi person collaboration and the reliability of multiple single tasks causing the inaccuracy of the failure probability results of red in this paper iahp is used to quantitatively calculate the change in failure probability of human factors that may be caused by the above problem to modify the success probability of red obtained by using cream ahp introduced by satty saaty and vargas 2012 is a quantitative technique that structures a multi criteria multi person multi factor problem hierarchically so that solutions are facilitated tyagi 2016 despite the wealth of experience and exposure to red accidents different experts may have different preferences about each basic event which may result in significant variations of the probability values a weighting factor is adopted to distinguish the relative quality of the response of various experts based on the evaluation criteria selected for priority ranking the iahp is used to quantify the relative importance of each expert which would mitigate the subjectivity of human judgment and improve the accuracy of probability prediction as much as possible the experts are evaluated in terms of four aspects namely personal experience knowledge sources of information and evaluation objectivity shi and shuai 2014 for these four aspects their weights are 0 3913 0 3043 0 1739 and 0 1304 respectively and then a total score of 100 is assumed for each ability for each ability the score is assigned to the five experts and the experts are given weight in this ability p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 4 represent experts weights in personal experience knowledge sources of information and evaluation objectivity respectively each expert s comprehensive weight w can be derived from eq 4 4 w 0 3913 p 1 0 3043 p 2 0 1739 p 3 0 1304 p 4 experts evaluate events through five levels of fuzzy language including very low vl low l medium m high h and very high vh using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers the fuzzy language is converted into a scale and the corresponding subjective fuzzy failure probability value is obtained lavasani et al 2011 the subjective fuzzy failure probability is brought into the following formula and the expert s fuzzy judgment language is transformed into an objective fuzzy failure probability onisawa 1998 and defuzzification processing is performed ultimately 3 5 proposed approach dbn go method is a risk analysis method by using the bayesian probability formula algorithm and go methodology that can handle the complicated security analysis problems that contain multi state time series and multi time nodes more easily compared with traditional risk analysis methods go model is established according to the operation steps of red and the common operators of go methodology are mapped into bn then the related root nodes of bn are determined considering the effect of equipment failure cream are used to determine the probabilities of human factors in dbn go model and the results obtained by cream are modified by iahp furthermore considering the variation of equipment failure probability with time the transition probability tables of equipment nodes is determined in dbn model and the developed dbn go model could be used to dynamically predict the success probability of red within a drilling duration the proposed framework for success probability prediction of red in different stages using dbn go approach is shown in fig 6 4 dbn go model of red 4 1 establishment of go model the go model of red is established by connecting all the go operators with the signal flow fig 7 in which the flow chart of red is translated into go operators the number of go model corresponding to each unit in the flow chart is shown in table 1 in fig 7 taking the most typical drilling stage as an example the correspondence between each operation and the type of go operator is explained as follows the input of the system is dp system failure which is represented by type 5 operator each step needs execution action as an excitation signal that is the input signal type 5 operator is required the operation of starting pre disconnect program and the operation of observing and evaluating the situation of drift off after adjusting cmc have two states success and failure which can be represented by type 1 operator similarly the operations of switching eds mode lifting the drilling tool to suitable position clearing drilling floor and moon pool area and subsequently activating eds after the red alert appears can be represented by type 6 operator and the operations of closing pipe ram can be represented by type 7 operator 4 2 mapping the go operators into bn the bn model mapped form the go model is built using graphical network interface genie software and the mapping algorithm of go operators to bn is shown in fig 8 liu et al 2015 2018 in fig 8 p is the probability corresponding to state 1 success or state 2 failure a mapping algorithm of type 1 and type 5 operators is shown in fig 8 a and b operator 5 1 represents dp system failure operator 1 2 represents the operation of starting pre disconnect program in the bn model the probability of each state of sc2 is only affected by sp1 and the probability of each state is identical with that of sp1 the mapping algorithms of type 6 operator and type 7 operator are shown in fig 8 c and d operator 6 4 represents the operation of switching eds in mode 1 and operator 7 6 represents the operation of stopping the ongoing operation after yellow alert the corresponding bn model mapped from the go model is shown in fig 9 sci is a node corresponding to the output signal stream and spi is a node of the human factor in order to further improve the accuracy of the model the nodes representing the effect of equipment reliability and communication difficulties between groups on red is added into bn model cei is a node of the equipment failure in the corresponding operation and cd is a node of communication difficulties between groups of personnel in an emergency scenario the node ed represents the success of red in different stages finally a bn model of red is established fig 10 and the nodes corresponding to the number in the go model is shown in table 1 4 3 establishment of dbn go model the influence of dynamic node probability on red is analyzed considering the variation of equipment reliability with time the bn model can be extended to a dbn model by introducing relevant temporal dependencies that capture the dynamic behaviors of the domain variables between representations of the static network at different times it is known that the key challenge for dbn is to define transition probabilities as the status values of parent nodes will shift over time the dynamic probability of equipment is analyzed by using the degradation model in this paper and the relationship of equipment failure probability between t and t δt will be explained in section 4 4 the final established dbn go model is shown in fig 11 4 4 probability determination of nodes in dbn go model 4 4 1 human factors nodes the most likely cognitive function failure mode and cfp of each cognitive activity in red is determined according to the comparison table of cognitive activity and cognitive function according to the cpcs level and performance reliability and weight factor table the available time level is insufficient and other cpc is the best condition and the total weight of four types of cognitive function is obtained finally by using eq 3 the human factors failure probability of the bn root node spi corresponding to red was determined as listed in table 2 4 4 2 communication difficulties nodes the iahp method is used to modify the success probability of red obtained by the cream to obtain more accurate success probability of red in emergency scenario five experts in the field of offshore oil drilling were invited to quantitatively evaluate the change of human factors in emergencies such as the effect of difficult communication between groups in emergency scenario on the success probability of red and their ability weights p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 were graded their comprehensive weights w is calculated using eq 4 expert s ability weights p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 and their comprehensive weights w are listed in table 3 experts evaluated the effect of harsh environment on red by five levels of fuzzy language the fuzzy language is converted into a scale and the corresponding failure probability value of each stage is obtained the fuzzy language of experts and the result of defuzzification treatment are shown in table 4 4 4 3 equipment factors nodes given that an equipment exists two states work 1 and fault 2 the state conversion diagram of a degenerate model is shown in fig 12 where λ is the fault rate from state 1 to state 2 and μ is repair rate from state 2 to state 1 the failure and repair rates of each equipment are predicted according to offshore reliability data oreda 2002 and their failure probabilities are calculated in the 52 nd week with imperfect repair cai et al 2013 as listed in table 5 assuming that the current time is t and the time interval between two successive trials is δt then the transition relations between consecutive nodes without repair and with repair can be determined which are given in tables 6 and 7 respectively 5 case study 5 1 success probability prediction of red in different stages the bn go model is used to determine the success probability of red in each stages and identify the key steps corresponding to each stage by using the failure probability of the equipment in table 5 the success probability of red in different stages can be obtained s1 s2 s3 and s4 represent drilling casing cementing and logging stages as shown in fig 13 the success probabilities of s1 s2 s3 and s4 are 94 6 97 6 96 7 and 98 3 respectively among those the drilling stage has the lowest success probability and the reason is that more equipment and more complicated operation steps are involved in the drilling stage each step of different stages is analyzed respectively to obtain the change of success probability fig 14 the operation steps for each stage are uniformly represented by number n n 1 2 3 in fig 14 the initial input of each stage is the probability of dp system failure which is represented by 0 and n represents the nth step in each stage each step in the four stages is analyzed to determine the key steps that are most likely to lead to failure of red the growth rate of the failure probability is obtained by calculating the difference between the probability of the current step and the probability of the previous step the ratio of the growth rate to the total failure probability of this stage is defined as the influence degree of the step on the failure of red in fig 14 the n 1 th step is the previous operation of the nth step therefore the calculation formula is as follows 5 p i n p n p n 1 p s where p i n is the influence degree of step n p n is the failure probability of step n p n 1 is the failure probability of step n 1 p s is the total failure probability at the corresponding stage the influence degree of each step in the four stages are analyzed and shown in fig 15 a d respectively the key steps are determined by the influence degree and the influence degree of each step is proportional to their corresponding failure probability furthermore the failure probability of each step is determined by the reliability of equipment and human factors in drilling stage for the operation of lifting drilling tool or the operation of closing pipe ram the reliability of equipment and human factors are high which makes the success probability of these steps relatively higher for the operation of observing and evaluating the potential collision of lmrp with seabed after adjusting cmc sc12 the whole process is adjusted and judged by operators which makes the human reliability of the step much lower than that of other steps as it depends on the operators subjective judgment and consequently the failure probability of the step is higher resulting in higher influence degree of the step in drilling stage in casing stage cementing stage and logging stage human reliability is relatively high in each step the influence degree of each step is mainly affected by the reliability of equipment compared with other steps in the corresponding stage the operation of buckling casing elevator sc22 and the operation of picking up casing string and open cmc sc24 in casing stage the operation of displacing cement from landing string sc36 in cementing stage and the operation of lifting the logging tool over bops sc50 in logging stage is relatively more complex and the reliability of the equipment involved in these steps is relatively lower therefore the failure probability of these step is higher resulting in higher influence degree of these steps in corresponding stage 5 2 dynamic success probability prediction of red the dbn go model is used to analyze the dynamic success probability of red drilling wireline logging casing cementing and cementing quality logging are carried out in turn in a drilling duration in this paper the wireline logging and cementing quality logging are unified as logging for illustrative purpose 90 days could be selected as a drilling duration to analyze the success probability of red chang et al 2018a the reliability data of the relevant equipment in red with different time is calculated by formula in tables 5 and 6 assuming that the equipment is not repaired the success probability of red during a drilling duration is obtained fig 16 the lowest success probability occurs in the drilling stage with a value of 92 71 the success probability will decrease quickly given that the equipment is not repaired which means related equipment should be regularly maintained in order to improve the success probability of red the four stages of red within 10 years are analyzed respectively considering the two cases of repair and non repair fig 17 the reliability data of the relevant equipment in red with different time is calculated using formula in tables 5 7 the success probability of red without repair will decrease rapidly with time and then gradually stabilized among the stages s4 shows the slowest decrease in success probability the related equipment involved in s2 and s3 show high failure rate and consequently the success probability of s2 and s3 decrease relatively quickly the success probabilities of these stages decrease to almost 0 in 10 years given the equipment is repaired the success probabilities of the four stages decrease slightly at the beginning and then keep a fixed value 6 summary and conclusions in this work a dbn go approach is proposed to dynamically analyze the success probability of red over time the advantages of go methodology in sequential system and dbn in quantitative analysis of dynamic probability of complex system are combined compared with other risk analysis methods the proposed method can not only reflect the sequence relationship between the various steps but also can takes into account the influence of various factors such as equipment human factor and time factor on the operation it can make a more comprehensive study on the success probability analysis of red operations to meet the actual engineering requirements the analysis results obtained from this study could provide reference for risk decision making of red operations and a better vision of red safety issues the success probability of red in different stages is analyzed as well as the key steps are identified using the developed dbn go model the research showed that the red has the lowest success probability in the drilling stage and the key step of a successful red in drilling stage is the operation of observing and evaluating the potential collision of lmrp with seabed after adjusting cmc similarly the key steps in the other three stages are identified the operation of buckling casing elevator and the operation of picking up casing string and open cmc is the key step in casing stage while the operation of displacing cement from landing string is the key step in cementing stage and the operation of lifting the logging tool is the key step in logging stage additionally the success probability of key steps in red is affect by human factors and equipment factors for human factors the training and safety awareness of the operators should be strengthened to find operation errors timely by comparing the results of equipment repaired and non repaired on the success probability of red it could be concluded that equipment with repair can considerably improve the success probability of red thus the equipment should be regularly maintained and even replaced by new one to further improve the success probability of red acknowledgments thanks are given to five domain experts for their input and insight without which this research would not have been possible this project is supported by

22852,structural vibration is one of the main engineering concerns in recent decades especially in offshore structures due to the dynamic environment and accessibility among different methods applying a device within the primary system for mitigating the vibration through system damping increment is one of the most promising methods in this study a combined novel magneto rheological tuned liquid column gas damper mr tlcgd as a damping system is introduced for the first time in structural control field and the efficiency of the system is investigated on a three dimensional fixed offshore jacket platform under both wave and earthquake excitation the performance of the system is studied through considering different values of yield stress and gas pressure as of the main parameters of mr fluid and gas damper the results are compared to a previously studied tuned liquid column gas damper tlcgd system based on the results utilizing an mr tlcgd system in an offshore structure can be defined as a proper choice for reducing structural vibration it can be concluded that considering an appropriate value for yield stress and gas pressure regardless of the results limitation for this case study is of great importance in practical cases keywords structural control offshore structure magnetorheological fluid gas spring mr tlcgd liquid column gas damper 1 introduction controlling vibration in offshore structures is of great importance due to their destructive effects such as fatigue failure in the other hand the flexibility of offshore jacket platforms can be considered as the reason that causes the structures to respond to the vibration significantly and results in uncertainty increment however uncertainty arises due to different aspects of the problem which should be well treated and reduced as much as possible at least within the computer model hokmabady et al 2019 vibration can be negligible in most cases but it might even be greater than the designed safe levels in some cases causing damage to nonstructural or structural components mojtahedi et al 2018 reducing vibration which is done using structural control methods and devices are considered as a vital procedure because of the fully dynamic sea environment in the offshore structural field a tuned liquid column damper tlcd which is a vibration decrement device consists of a rigid u shaped tube with an orifice in the middle filled with a liquid the use of tlcds in offshore structures is addressed in the literature coudurier et al 2018 chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 jin et al 2007 colwell and basu 2009 vibration decrement in a structure equipped with tlcd occurs through increasing the system damping the main limitation of these devices is their best performance in a specific frequency ratio it means that these devices cannot perform properly by changing the dynamic properties of the structures including natural frequency and damping ratio covering a wide range of external loading excitations can be achieved through employing hybrid tlcd htlcd semi active tlcd stlcd or using smart material such as magneto rheological mr fluids and active actuators yalla et al 2001 ni et al 2004 wang et al 2005 traditional tlcd systems disadvantages even by considering a semi active procedure are significant enough to consider them as an inefficient device sarkar and chakraborty 2017 space limitations and more required damping through the system can be overcome by using mr fluids in the tlcd system instead of water which results in mr tlcd system an mr tlcd system is performed in a few researches recently which offers a better damping performance in comparison with other controlled tlcd systems ni et al 2004 wang et al 2005 mr fluid is well known for its unique specification that changes from a linear viscous liquid to semi solids fluid using a magnetic field the most important factor in an mr tlcd system is the adaptable yield strength of mr fluid which provides adequate damping force required for optimal control however some disadvantages such as sensitivity to temperature high density heaviness the expense of mr fluids and thickening after prolonged use which causes the shear stress reduction and a sudden variation and uncontrollability in mr transmission device are yet existed chen et al 2015 above mentioned limitations are conquered through some ideas such as liquid column vibration absorber lcva as firstly proposed by watkins and hitchcock 1991 in an lcva system different cross sectional areas are employed for the horizontal and vertical columns and pipes with the same cross section for both vertical columns these characteristics of lcva result in adjustable frequency without changing liquid columns length as traditional tlcd does hochrainer and ziegler introduce a developed lcva system called tuned liquid column gas damper tlcgd hochrainer and ziegler 2006 effects of an air spring gas spring is reflected by a tlcgd damper within the sealed columns to tune the damper frequency as of the most important weak point basically tlcgd is too similar to a tlcd system but the main difference arises from its flexibility in frequency regulation which is tuned by adjusting the gas pressure in the vertical columns tlcgd systems are studied in some offshore structures mousavi et al 2012 2013 due to offshore jacket platforms relatively low damping performances and all advantages of tlcgd increasing the system damping to higher values would help the whole system to reduce the vibration and increase the system lifetime for these reasons utilizing mr fluid instead of water in tlcgd system through an mr tlcgd system can be considered as a suitable choice to increase the system damping and gathering both mr and gas dampers features within a unit damping system in this study a developed tlcgd damper using mr fluid called mr tlcgd is introduced and implemented on a three dimension offshore jacket platform spd9 located in the persian gulf in wave and earthquake incidence for the first time in the offshore industry the efficiency of the damping system is investigated over the primary structure using wave and earthquake loads the effectiveness of mr fluid s yield stress and gas pressure in providing required damping properties and structural vibration reduction are also investigated in this paper simultaneously for the first time in structural control procedure based on the results utilizing an mr tlcgd in an offshore platform causes more reduction in structural vibration in comparison with tlcgd damping system 2 equations of motion and verification procedure 2 1 modeling an mr tlcgd before introducing the new developed mr tlcgd system a brief review of both mr tlcd and tlcgd system is required both systems are so similar to a traditional tlcd system geometrically including a u shaped liquid filled tube with an orifice opening in the horizontal length middle in an mr tlcd the system liquid is mr fluid in which the required magnetic field should be applied through a length of l p at the bottom of the horizontal tube the damping force acting on the liquid of the damper includes the effects of hydrodynamic head loss viscous interaction between the liquid and the container in motion and lastly the yield stress of mr fluid by applying a magnetic field the mr fluid yield stress and the hydrodynamic head loss of an mr tlcd system are controllable and adaptable in the other hand tlcgd includes a normal liquid such as water which two trapped air volumes are existed at the end of both vertical columns the air pressure which is adjustable can control the frequency of the damper to increase the whole system efficiency classical tlcd system is limited to frequencies up 0 5 hz in practical applications while by utilizing the passive gas spring the efficiency of tlcgd increases for the frequencies up to about 5 hz hochrainer and fotiu 2018 the mechanism of an mr tlcgd system can be defined as a combination of the performance of both mr tlcd increasing system damping and tlcgd increasing system stiffness systems simultaneously a scheme of an mr tlcgd system is shown in fig 1 in which y represents the liquid displacement in the vertical columns x is the horizontal displacement of the tlcgd of the whole system b denotes the horizontal length of the tube ρ l represents the density of mr fluid a d is the cross sectional area of the liquid column p 0 is the initial pressure of the gas in the vertical columns which changes to p 1 and p 2 after excitation h and h a denote the vertical columns length and the part of the vertical length that is occupied by gas before excitation respectively the equations of motion of mr tlcd system developed by ni et al 2004 can be written by eq 1 in which mr fluid motion modeling is done using the parallel plate theory as discussed briefly in following 1 ρ l a d l d y 1 2 ρ l a d δ y y c τ y a d l p h y y 2 ρ l a d g y ρ l a d b d x where the effects of the mr fluid yield stress are taken into account and a d l d and b d denote the cross sectional area total length and horizontal length of the damper respectively y y and y are vertical liquid displacement velocity and acceleration respectively c h δ g ρ l x and τ y are a coefficient that depends on the flow velocity and has a range from 2 07 to 3 07 ni et al 2004 sun and wang 2016 the vertical height between the two fixed magnetic poles head loss coefficient gravitational acceleration liquid density horizontal displacement of the container the yield stress developed due to the presence of magnetic field respectively the applying magnetic field on the fixed poles in the bottom of the tube can be defined by parallel plate theory yang et al 2002 the pressure drop δ p as introduced by ni et al 2004 can be considered as a summation of a field dependent component as δ p τ and a viscous component δ p η as follows 2 δ p δ p η δ p τ 12 η q l p h 3 w c τ y l p h where q is the volumetric flow rate η is the field independent viscosity and l p h and w are the flow length depth and width between the fixed poles respectively other parameters such as the pressure drop and head loss coefficient are evaluated by 3 h p δ p g ρ l 12 η q l p g ρ l h 3 w c τ y l p g ρ l h where h p is the head loss local head loss coefficient δ υ for rectangular duct is represented as follow 4 h p υ δ υ v 2 2 g 5 δ υ 48 re h 1 h w 2 l p h 6 re h 2 ρ l v w h η w h where h p υ is the head loss caused by the fluid viscosity v is the fluid velocity and re h is the reynold number lastly the liquid column total head loss h w is given by 7 h w δ v 2 2 g c τ y l p g ρ l h 8 δ 48 re h 1 h w 2 j ζ j where δ is the total head loss coefficient and ζ j is the minor head loss coefficient that includes hydrodynamic head loss coefficients of elbows and orifices the tlcd systems main design process is the consideration of the system frequency by tuning the natural frequency of the tlcd system to the main natural frequency of the primary system the most efficient control of vibration occurs in tlcd and mr tlcd systems the liquid length horizontal length is the parameter that affects the tuning ratio the fundamental frequency of a traditional tlcd and mr tlcd systems and related tuning ratio can be expressed by 9 ω d m 2 g l d 10 ω r ω d m ω s 2 g ω s 2 l d where ω d m ω s ω r and l d are the mr tlcd frequency the jacket platform frequency the frequency ratio and total length of liquid column considering the horizontal and both vertical columns respectively an mr tlcd frequency depends only on the tube geometrical properties and not the magnetic field based on eq 1 the nonlinearity of the damping term can be dealt with substituting an equivalent linearized term through equivalent linearization technique wen 1980 linearized form of eq 1 and also the equivalent damping term can be given by 11 ρ l a d l d y c d y 2 ρ l a d g y ρ l a d b d x 12 c d 2 π ρ l a d δ σ y 2 π c τ y a d l p h σ y where σ y is the standard deviation of the fluid velocity y which is needed to be calculated within an iterative process because of its unknown value the main difference between tlcd and mr tlcd systems is the damping coefficient c d which is required to be updated in every control procedure step controllable damping velocity dependent forces instead of controllable restoring stiffness dependent forces can be defined as the difference between the mr tlcd and the conventional mr dampers behavior in a tlcgd system which as mentioned is so similar to a traditional tlcd system geometrically the main difference can be defined as the two trapped gas areas in two vertical columns of the u shaped container by considering p 0 and v 0 as the initial pressure and volume of the sealed air columns in each vertical columns of the system chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 the stiffness of each gas spring can be given by 13 k d a d d p d y if the system is excited by a lateral load the liquid column oscillation leads to a pressure volume p v variation of the closed air columns p v relationship is denoted by the general polytropic relation p v n c as a constant value where n is the polytropic index in slow vibrations the gas spring performs under isothermal conditions n 1 while an adiabatic change occurs in high frequencies and the polytropic index becomes n 1 4 in all other conditions n is in the range between 1 and 1 4 2 16 in this manuscript for the mr tlcgd system n γ 1 4 is proposed considering p 0 v 0 γ p v γ at an instant of time and substituting p eq 13 can be rewritten as 14 k d a d p 0 v 0 γ d d y v γ γ a d p 0 v 0 γ v γ 1 d v d y taking v v 0 a y or d v d y a d and substituting these parameters in eq 14 the expression for the gas spring stiffness is gained as 15 k d γ a d 2 p 0 v 0 1 a y v 0 γ 1 obviously it is seen that the gas spring stiffness is nonlinear and just if the liquid displacement y t is small with respect to the air column volume v 0 the linearized stiffness of air spring may be taken as chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 16 k d γ a d 2 p 0 v 0 according to the obtained gas spring stiffness the equation of motion of the tlcgd system considering linearized stiffness of the gas spring can be given as 17 ρ l a d l d y 1 2 ρ l a d δ y y 2 ρ l a d g y 2 k d y ρ l a d b d x where all the parameters are introduced previously by normalization of eq 7 with respect to the mass of the liquid an expression is obtained for the natural frequency of the damper as follow 18 ω d g 2 g l d 1 γ p 0 h ρ l g the main equation of motion for the mr tlcgd damper which is a combination of both eqs 1 and 17 can be derived as follow 19 ρ l a d l d y 2 π ρ l a d δ σ y 2 π c τ y a d l p h σ y y 2 ρ l a d g k d y ρ l a d b d x based on the geometrical shape of the tlcgd damper the gas should be treated to be stopped from entering into the liquid according to the validity of piston theory tlcgd frequency is restricted by the relative maximum liquid velocity that should stay lower than the critical fluid velocity of about 12 m s to prevent the cavitation phenomena at the liquid gas interface by choosing a higher value for the area ratio parameter λ this limitation can be eliminated because the higher the area ratio the less the liquid displacement in the vertical columns however this limitation can be almost overcome by the mentioned method but some other problems such as the required space for the whole system in buildings or structures with limited places are yet existed in this study a novel procedure is introduced considering mr fluid as a liquid which helps the designer to limit the system speed in a specific range using the magnetic field this means that no higher values are needed to be considered for the area ratio parameter 2 2 dynamic model of the jacket platform and the mr tlcgd system the equation of motion for the whole system including an offshore jacket platform and an mr tlcgd damping system subjected to seismic and wave excitations can be written as the follows dowson 1983 20 m x c x k x f w o r f e f d 21 ρ l a d l d y 2 π ρ l a d δ σ y 2 π c τ y

and each joints of the jacket platform and n shows the degree of freedom dof of the system that is 228 considering 38 nodes each with 6 degrees of freedom and 109 elements in this paper finite element model of the jacket is performed by the matrices of mass and stiffness which is the best solution for complex space frames in the control process fourth order runge kutta method is employed for solving the equations of motion the specifications and four natural frequencies of the jacket platform are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively the first natural frequency of a system is of great importance in the engineering field vibration response of a system mainly can be damped by employing a tlcd based system only if the frequency of the damping system is matched to the first natural frequency of the primary system however this procedure is valid only for the frequency dependent damping systems such as tlcd or tld as the response frequency falls out of the mentioned natural frequency the response of the coupled system main system and the damping system would not be satisfying and the damping system would be almost inefficient in this manuscript besides tuning the main geometrical parameters of the mr tlcgd system to the first natural frequency of the system the semi active procedure is utilized employing a magnetic field in system response and considering gas spring in a passive process however different values of head loss coefficient can be chosen based on the configuration and specification of the system in this study head loss coefficient is calculated through the equation which is introduced by mousavi et al mousavi et al 2011 2013 because of the horizontal length significance horizontal length b is also taken as 0 8l which is considered equal to the horizontal length of the jacket deck length the area ratio which is the vertical to horizontal columns cross section values is taken as 2 based on the previous studies by mousavi et al mousavi et al 2011 2013 the whole damper mass ratio is also considered as 1 percent of the jacket mass in this study due to the importance of the frequency ratio and dependency of this ratio to the gas pressure in this manuscript the mr tlcgd system is investigated through different values of gas pressure the location of the considered mr tlcgd system and the finite element model of the jacket including details about the node numbers are shown in fig 2 both x and y directions of the jacket platform are illustrated in fig 3 a and b as it can be seen the jacket platform is symmetric in y direction which is perpendicular to the wave propagation direction in the sea on the other hand the x direction of the jacket is designed geometrically asymmetrical the oblique side of the jacket is the side that waves hit for this reason the u plane of the mr tlcgd systems is considered to be in x direction for evaluating the damping system performance two different lateral loading directions are supposed the excitation direction of which the jacket is studied is presented in fig 3c based on fig 3c two different excitation directions are assumed for both wave and earthquake forces the first direction direction 1 is the direction that the u plane of the damping system is considered the second direction direction 2 is considered for evaluating the performance of the damping system more comprehensively for the external forces wave and earthquake excitations are chosen in this paper hydrodynamic forces evaluation requires wave parameters based on valid wave theory in this study the well known morison equation is employed for calculating the wave forces acting on a member of the jacket based on morison s equation the wave force intensity on the structure per unit of length can be evaluated by eq 24 according to the morison equation nonlinearity a stochastic linearization technique employs for modeling the wave force lastly eq 24 can be written as eq 25 in a linear form

persian gulf sea state details based on jonswap spectrum are used for defining the water particles velocity and accelerations as listed in table 3 dastan et al 2014 stokes second order wave theory is utilized in this manuscript for calculating water particle velocity and acceleration in horizontal and vertical directions chakraborty 2005 26 u h π t cosh k y d sinh k d cos k x ω t 3 h 2 π 2 4 t λ

velocity and acceleration and also vertical water particle velocity and acceleration respectively hydrodynamic forces parameters that are used in this manuscript for implementing the wave forces are listed in table 4 based on different wave properties mr magnetic field is considered as the control force inducer for this reason the proposed controlling force can be given as follow 30 f d m d ψ 1 ψ 2 y 2 ξ d ω d y ω d 2 y 31 ξ d c d 2 ρ w a d l d ω d 1 2 π g l d δ σ y c τ y l p ρ w h σ y where ψ b d l d and all other parameters are presented previously according to the previously introduced concepts yield stress is an important parameter in devices with mr fluids besides the amount of pressure that should be considered in gas spring can affect the efficiency of the whole system due to these reasons the performance of the mr tlcgd system is investigated utilizing different gas pressure and yield stress values 2 3 verification procedure a previously modeled platform investigated by mousavi et al 2012 is considered for the verification of the current study formulation the platform is modeled as a four leg 5dof system with the same properties in both directions as illustrated in fig 5 the stiffness mass area and volume matrices are considered as follows 32 k v p 10 9 1 0 444 0 0 0 0 444 0 819 0 375 0 0 0 0 375 0 661 0 286 0 0 0 0 286 0 353 0 067 0 0 0 0 067 0 067 n m 33 m v p

technique is utilized and a value of two percent is taken as the damping ratio other specifications of the platform are considered as mousavi et al 2012 the first three natural frequency of the jacket platform is gained as 5 89 24 5 and 52 7 hz respectively the platform is investigated under three different ground motion accelerations san fernando 1971 and kern county 1952 and northridge 1994 earthquakes scaled to pga 0 3 g as studied by mousavi et al 2012 displacement time history of one of the earthquake records for comparison is shown in fig 6 the rms of the displacement time history of the uncontrolled and controlled cases are listed in table 1 for both tlcgd systems of mousavi et al 2012 and the current study according to table 5 there are no significant differences between the designed tlcgd system of current study and the tlcgd system of mousavi et al 2012 for the mentioned jacket platform the difference under san fernando and kern country is about 1 5 and 1 6 percent in comparison with the tlcgd system of mousavi et al 2012 also as noted in table 5 the controlled displacement rms of the system response under northridge earthquake is 3 66 cm for mousavi et al which is 3 81 cm for the current study there is 4 1 percent difference between the current study result and the result of mousavi et al 2012 which can be considered as an appropriate verification for the authors code 3 results and discussion vibrational control of an offshore jacket platform is investigated using an mr tlcgd system under wave and earthquake incidence for a better comparison of the new damping system s efficiency the response of the jacket is also investigated utilizing a tlcgd damping system both systems are considered at the top level of a three dimensional jacket platform in this manuscript the time history of displacement in the top node of the jacket located at the highest structural level is represented in fig 7 under wave loading the wave height with 100 years of return period is employed as of the first wave loading case case 1 and on the other hand to evaluate the performance of the system more comprehensively the response of the system is investigated under a 10 year return period wave load as of the second wave loading case case 2 the time history response of the jacket platform under the second wave load case is illustrated in fig 8 the most important parameters of the mr tlcgd which are yield stress and gas pressure are taken as τ y 100 kpa and 2 bar respectively according to fig 7 it can be seen that the uncontrolled response of the jacket is equal to 5 9 cm which is reduced to 3 5 cm by employing tlcgd system and significantly lower values equal to 1 8 cm using mr tlcgd which expresses 40 and 69 reduction percentages the details of displacement response under both wave loading are listed in table 6 based on the results using an mr tlcd system in an offshore jacket can reduce structural vibration amplitudes under wave significantly which shows the efficiency of the new introduced system according to table 6 displacement values of the system under wave loading are listed for four structural levels considering the highest and the lowest level in both excitation directions it can be seen that using both tlcgd and mr tlcgd damping systems the structural response of the system is reduced significantly in all structural levels in which the reduction is higher by using introduced mr tlcgd damping system based on the results the reduction is 40 and 69 percent in the top level of the jacket as the wave load with 100 years of return period case 1 hits the jacket also by using mr tlcgd and tlcgd damping systems the response is reduced about 44 and 49 percent by considering a 10 years return period wave load case 2 in the second direction however as the wave hit direction altered to direction 2 due to the incomplete response of the damping system the system response is increased almost significantly the efficiency of the system is also investigated using two near field ground motion accelerations including kobe and northridge earthquakes over two excitation directions zero and 45 as shown in figs 9 and 10 the system is tuned as the yield stress and gas pressure values are taken as τ y 100 kpa and 2 bar respectively as it is seen in fig 9 the top node displacement of the jacket platform is decreased using both dampers in which the value of the decrement for the mr tlcgd system is higher although displacements are reduced in most peak points using tlcgd few higher values are gained in some peaks as it can be seen in fig 9a the uncontrolled response of the jacket is 9 8 cm which is reduced to 3 5 and 1 2 cm for tlcgd and mr tlcgd systems respectively in comparison to the uncontrolled values utilizing both damping systems represents 64 and 87 percent of reduction also based on fig 9b it can be noted that the structural response is reduced from 8 9 cm to 2 6 cm and 0 27 cm utilizing tlcgd and mr tlcgd systems respectively more details of the displacement time history under earthquake are listed in table 7 as shown in fig 10 the controlled response of the system under earthquake is increased which is due to the inadequate performance of both tlcgd and mr tlcgd damping systems however the displacement response is decreased in comparison with the uncontrolled response the efficiency of the damping systems is reduced the uncontrolled response of the jacket is 9 1 cm which is reduced to 5 4 and 4 7 cm for tlcgd and mr tlcgd systems respectively although the response of the jacket by using mr tlcgd system is more efficient the response of both damping systems is nearly the same more details of the displacement response of the system are listed in table 8 for the second excitation direction direction 2 based on the listed results in table 7 the whole structural response of the coupled system is reduced in which the most reduction is for the top level using mr tlcgd the reduction is 64 percent for the top level using tlcgd and 87 percent considering mr tlcgd respectively for the kobe earthquake the mentioned reduction is 70 and 96 percent for northridge earthquake respectively according to the results in table 8 the reduction in system response is about 40 and 48 percent in comparison with the results of direction 1 the capability of the damping system is also studied considering two vital yield stress and gas pressure parameters under both wave and earthquake excitations in this paper as it is presented in fig 11 rms of the displacement time history of the system equipped with mr tlcgd is shown different values of yield stress parameter are considered in fig 11 the gas pressure is assumed to be constant 2 bar and the jacket is excited by the northridge earthquake in direction 1 it can be seen that as the yield stress increases the amount of displacement rms decreases because of yield stress parameter s limitation a range between 0 and 180 kpa is chosen based on the results presented in fig 11 a value of mid range and high range are selected for the yield stress parameters for gas pressure investigation as it is shown in fig 12 a and b different values of gas pressure are proposed by a constant yield stress values equal to 100 and 180 kpa even by considering a certain value for the yield stress gas pressure increment in a range between 2 and 500 bar results in displacement rms increment the reason for this phenomena can be expressed through the fact that the gas pressure increment causes the liquid movement to decrease which results in displacement rms increment it should be noted that the gas pressure which increases the whole system performance should be limited to a specific value based on the structure and damper specification but it seems that better performances can be obtained through lower values more details about the displacement rms in different yield stress and gas pressures under wave and earthquake are listed in tables 9 and 10 respectively as it is illustrated in fig 13 displacement rms of the coupled system utilizing different yield stress values is presented under wave loading of case 1 as the gas pressure is proposed to have a constant value equal to 2 bar it is obvious that by increasing the yield stress value up to 100 kpa displacement rms decreases significantly and then decrement occurs insignificantly regardless of the value of yield stress which can be taken up to 200 kpa choosing a suitable value results in a higher and better performance and vibration decrement of the whole system for a better comparison of the yield stress and gas pressure relationship under wave loading in figs 14 and 15 the efficiency of the damping system is investigated under a constant yield stress value of 100 and 180 kpa within different gas pressure values based on the results presented in fig 14 by considering a constant yield stress value 100 kpa the gas pressure increment results in the increment of displacement rms of the system as it is shown in fig 14b the increment value is lower for gas pressures up to 100 bar and then the value of increment rises significantly it can be due to the fact that the more the gas pressure the less the liquid movement according to fig 15 the value of displacement rms also increases by gas pressure increment even in higher yield stress values of 180 kpa this increment is insignificant in lower values of gas pressures up to 100 bar and then it gets considerable in higher pressures as it is listed in table 10 although the structural displacement response increases in most cases by the damper gas pressure increment the most decrement occurs in 60 bar of gas pressure however displacement decrement under wave loading for lower pressures are insignificant and the most decrement is gained in lower gas pressures for this case study values of 100 kpa and 2 bar can be considered as the best values of yield stress and gas pressure parameters 4 conclusion structural control of an offshore jacket platform is studied under wave and earthquake utilizing a novel mr tlcgd damping system the mr tlcgd system is employed as a combination of both mr tlcd and tlcgd dampers performances in the mentioned novel damping system the damper performs as a tlcgd system in lower liquid velocities and performs as an mr tlcd in higher liquid velocities due to the tlcgd systems limitations the performance of the whole coupled system is studied within different sea states and ground motion accelerations the wave and earthquake incidence is investigated through two various directions to evaluate the dampers effectiveness more comprehensively the directions are chosen as the parallel to damper u plane and a plane with an angle of 45 based on the results by taking an angle for the lateral excitation as it is expected the efficiency of the damping system is decreased which is due to the incomplete performance of the damper the main parameters in an mr tlcgd system are defined as the yield stress due to mr fluid existence and the gas pressure because of considering a gas damper within the system both yield stress and gas pressure parameters are studied through different values under wave and earthquake according to the results the lower the gas pressure the better the rms displacement as the yield stress parameter is still constant in the other hand by increasing the yield stress value the displacement rms of the system decreases up to a certain amount it can be concluded that considering an appropriate value is of great importance for both yield stress and gas pressure values which results in a better performance of the whole system due to the liquid movement limitations based on the results for this case study a value of 2 bar for the gas pressure and a value of 100 kpa for the yield stress parameters can be taken as the best choice however using a tlcgd is possible in an offshore structure and using an mr tlcgd damper can be defined as a highly expensive project but considering an mr tlcgd is more recommended due to significant reductions in structural response 
22852,structural vibration is one of the main engineering concerns in recent decades especially in offshore structures due to the dynamic environment and accessibility among different methods applying a device within the primary system for mitigating the vibration through system damping increment is one of the most promising methods in this study a combined novel magneto rheological tuned liquid column gas damper mr tlcgd as a damping system is introduced for the first time in structural control field and the efficiency of the system is investigated on a three dimensional fixed offshore jacket platform under both wave and earthquake excitation the performance of the system is studied through considering different values of yield stress and gas pressure as of the main parameters of mr fluid and gas damper the results are compared to a previously studied tuned liquid column gas damper tlcgd system based on the results utilizing an mr tlcgd system in an offshore structure can be defined as a proper choice for reducing structural vibration it can be concluded that considering an appropriate value for yield stress and gas pressure regardless of the results limitation for this case study is of great importance in practical cases keywords structural control offshore structure magnetorheological fluid gas spring mr tlcgd liquid column gas damper 1 introduction controlling vibration in offshore structures is of great importance due to their destructive effects such as fatigue failure in the other hand the flexibility of offshore jacket platforms can be considered as the reason that causes the structures to respond to the vibration significantly and results in uncertainty increment however uncertainty arises due to different aspects of the problem which should be well treated and reduced as much as possible at least within the computer model hokmabady et al 2019 vibration can be negligible in most cases but it might even be greater than the designed safe levels in some cases causing damage to nonstructural or structural components mojtahedi et al 2018 reducing vibration which is done using structural control methods and devices are considered as a vital procedure because of the fully dynamic sea environment in the offshore structural field a tuned liquid column damper tlcd which is a vibration decrement device consists of a rigid u shaped tube with an orifice in the middle filled with a liquid the use of tlcds in offshore structures is addressed in the literature coudurier et al 2018 chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 jin et al 2007 colwell and basu 2009 vibration decrement in a structure equipped with tlcd occurs through increasing the system damping the main limitation of these devices is their best performance in a specific frequency ratio it means that these devices cannot perform properly by changing the dynamic properties of the structures including natural frequency and damping ratio covering a wide range of external loading excitations can be achieved through employing hybrid tlcd htlcd semi active tlcd stlcd or using smart material such as magneto rheological mr fluids and active actuators yalla et al 2001 ni et al 2004 wang et al 2005 traditional tlcd systems disadvantages even by considering a semi active procedure are significant enough to consider them as an inefficient device sarkar and chakraborty 2017 space limitations and more required damping through the system can be overcome by using mr fluids in the tlcd system instead of water which results in mr tlcd system an mr tlcd system is performed in a few researches recently which offers a better damping performance in comparison with other controlled tlcd systems ni et al 2004 wang et al 2005 mr fluid is well known for its unique specification that changes from a linear viscous liquid to semi solids fluid using a magnetic field the most important factor in an mr tlcd system is the adaptable yield strength of mr fluid which provides adequate damping force required for optimal control however some disadvantages such as sensitivity to temperature high density heaviness the expense of mr fluids and thickening after prolonged use which causes the shear stress reduction and a sudden variation and uncontrollability in mr transmission device are yet existed chen et al 2015 above mentioned limitations are conquered through some ideas such as liquid column vibration absorber lcva as firstly proposed by watkins and hitchcock 1991 in an lcva system different cross sectional areas are employed for the horizontal and vertical columns and pipes with the same cross section for both vertical columns these characteristics of lcva result in adjustable frequency without changing liquid columns length as traditional tlcd does hochrainer and ziegler introduce a developed lcva system called tuned liquid column gas damper tlcgd hochrainer and ziegler 2006 effects of an air spring gas spring is reflected by a tlcgd damper within the sealed columns to tune the damper frequency as of the most important weak point basically tlcgd is too similar to a tlcd system but the main difference arises from its flexibility in frequency regulation which is tuned by adjusting the gas pressure in the vertical columns tlcgd systems are studied in some offshore structures mousavi et al 2012 2013 due to offshore jacket platforms relatively low damping performances and all advantages of tlcgd increasing the system damping to higher values would help the whole system to reduce the vibration and increase the system lifetime for these reasons utilizing mr fluid instead of water in tlcgd system through an mr tlcgd system can be considered as a suitable choice to increase the system damping and gathering both mr and gas dampers features within a unit damping system in this study a developed tlcgd damper using mr fluid called mr tlcgd is introduced and implemented on a three dimension offshore jacket platform spd9 located in the persian gulf in wave and earthquake incidence for the first time in the offshore industry the efficiency of the damping system is investigated over the primary structure using wave and earthquake loads the effectiveness of mr fluid s yield stress and gas pressure in providing required damping properties and structural vibration reduction are also investigated in this paper simultaneously for the first time in structural control procedure based on the results utilizing an mr tlcgd in an offshore platform causes more reduction in structural vibration in comparison with tlcgd damping system 2 equations of motion and verification procedure 2 1 modeling an mr tlcgd before introducing the new developed mr tlcgd system a brief review of both mr tlcd and tlcgd system is required both systems are so similar to a traditional tlcd system geometrically including a u shaped liquid filled tube with an orifice opening in the horizontal length middle in an mr tlcd the system liquid is mr fluid in which the required magnetic field should be applied through a length of l p at the bottom of the horizontal tube the damping force acting on the liquid of the damper includes the effects of hydrodynamic head loss viscous interaction between the liquid and the container in motion and lastly the yield stress of mr fluid by applying a magnetic field the mr fluid yield stress and the hydrodynamic head loss of an mr tlcd system are controllable and adaptable in the other hand tlcgd includes a normal liquid such as water which two trapped air volumes are existed at the end of both vertical columns the air pressure which is adjustable can control the frequency of the damper to increase the whole system efficiency classical tlcd system is limited to frequencies up 0 5 hz in practical applications while by utilizing the passive gas spring the efficiency of tlcgd increases for the frequencies up to about 5 hz hochrainer and fotiu 2018 the mechanism of an mr tlcgd system can be defined as a combination of the performance of both mr tlcd increasing system damping and tlcgd increasing system stiffness systems simultaneously a scheme of an mr tlcgd system is shown in fig 1 in which y represents the liquid displacement in the vertical columns x is the horizontal displacement of the tlcgd of the whole system b denotes the horizontal length of the tube ρ l represents the density of mr fluid a d is the cross sectional area of the liquid column p 0 is the initial pressure of the gas in the vertical columns which changes to p 1 and p 2 after excitation h and h a denote the vertical columns length and the part of the vertical length that is occupied by gas before excitation respectively the equations of motion of mr tlcd system developed by ni et al 2004 can be written by eq 1 in which mr fluid motion modeling is done using the parallel plate theory as discussed briefly in following 1 ρ l a d l d y 1 2 ρ l a d δ y y c τ y a d l p h y y 2 ρ l a d g y ρ l a d b d x where the effects of the mr fluid yield stress are taken into account and a d l d and b d denote the cross sectional area total length and horizontal length of the damper respectively y y and y are vertical liquid displacement velocity and acceleration respectively c h δ g ρ l x and τ y are a coefficient that depends on the flow velocity and has a range from 2 07 to 3 07 ni et al 2004 sun and wang 2016 the vertical height between the two fixed magnetic poles head loss coefficient gravitational acceleration liquid density horizontal displacement of the container the yield stress developed due to the presence of magnetic field respectively the applying magnetic field on the fixed poles in the bottom of the tube can be defined by parallel plate theory yang et al 2002 the pressure drop δ p as introduced by ni et al 2004 can be considered as a summation of a field dependent component as δ p τ and a viscous component δ p η as follows 2 δ p δ p η δ p τ 12 η q l p h 3 w c τ y l p h where q is the volumetric flow rate η is the field independent viscosity and l p h and w are the flow length depth and width between the fixed poles respectively other parameters such as the pressure drop and head loss coefficient are evaluated by 3 h p δ p g ρ l 12 η q l p g ρ l h 3 w c τ y l p g ρ l h where h p is the head loss local head loss coefficient δ υ for rectangular duct is represented as follow 4 h p υ δ υ v 2 2 g 5 δ υ 48 re h 1 h w 2 l p h 6 re h 2 ρ l v w h η w h where h p υ is the head loss caused by the fluid viscosity v is the fluid velocity and re h is the reynold number lastly the liquid column total head loss h w is given by 7 h w δ v 2 2 g c τ y l p g ρ l h 8 δ 48 re h 1 h w 2 j ζ j where δ is the total head loss coefficient and ζ j is the minor head loss coefficient that includes hydrodynamic head loss coefficients of elbows and orifices the tlcd systems main design process is the consideration of the system frequency by tuning the natural frequency of the tlcd system to the main natural frequency of the primary system the most efficient control of vibration occurs in tlcd and mr tlcd systems the liquid length horizontal length is the parameter that affects the tuning ratio the fundamental frequency of a traditional tlcd and mr tlcd systems and related tuning ratio can be expressed by 9 ω d m 2 g l d 10 ω r ω d m ω s 2 g ω s 2 l d where ω d m ω s ω r and l d are the mr tlcd frequency the jacket platform frequency the frequency ratio and total length of liquid column considering the horizontal and both vertical columns respectively an mr tlcd frequency depends only on the tube geometrical properties and not the magnetic field based on eq 1 the nonlinearity of the damping term can be dealt with substituting an equivalent linearized term through equivalent linearization technique wen 1980 linearized form of eq 1 and also the equivalent damping term can be given by 11 ρ l a d l d y c d y 2 ρ l a d g y ρ l a d b d x 12 c d 2 π ρ l a d δ σ y 2 π c τ y a d l p h σ y where σ y is the standard deviation of the fluid velocity y which is needed to be calculated within an iterative process because of its unknown value the main difference between tlcd and mr tlcd systems is the damping coefficient c d which is required to be updated in every control procedure step controllable damping velocity dependent forces instead of controllable restoring stiffness dependent forces can be defined as the difference between the mr tlcd and the conventional mr dampers behavior in a tlcgd system which as mentioned is so similar to a traditional tlcd system geometrically the main difference can be defined as the two trapped gas areas in two vertical columns of the u shaped container by considering p 0 and v 0 as the initial pressure and volume of the sealed air columns in each vertical columns of the system chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 the stiffness of each gas spring can be given by 13 k d a d d p d y if the system is excited by a lateral load the liquid column oscillation leads to a pressure volume p v variation of the closed air columns p v relationship is denoted by the general polytropic relation p v n c as a constant value where n is the polytropic index in slow vibrations the gas spring performs under isothermal conditions n 1 while an adiabatic change occurs in high frequencies and the polytropic index becomes n 1 4 in all other conditions n is in the range between 1 and 1 4 2 16 in this manuscript for the mr tlcgd system n γ 1 4 is proposed considering p 0 v 0 γ p v γ at an instant of time and substituting p eq 13 can be rewritten as 14 k d a d p 0 v 0 γ d d y v γ γ a d p 0 v 0 γ v γ 1 d v d y taking v v 0 a y or d v d y a d and substituting these parameters in eq 14 the expression for the gas spring stiffness is gained as 15 k d γ a d 2 p 0 v 0 1 a y v 0 γ 1 obviously it is seen that the gas spring stiffness is nonlinear and just if the liquid displacement y t is small with respect to the air column volume v 0 the linearized stiffness of air spring may be taken as chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 16 k d γ a d 2 p 0 v 0 according to the obtained gas spring stiffness the equation of motion of the tlcgd system considering linearized stiffness of the gas spring can be given as 17 ρ l a d l d y 1 2 ρ l a d δ y y 2 ρ l a d g y 2 k d y ρ l a d b d x where all the parameters are introduced previously by normalization of eq 7 with respect to the mass of the liquid an expression is obtained for the natural frequency of the damper as follow 18 ω d g 2 g l d 1 γ p 0 h ρ l g the main equation of motion for the mr tlcgd damper which is a combination of both eqs 1 and 17 can be derived as follow 19 ρ l a d l d y 2 π ρ l a d δ σ y 2 π c τ y a d l p h σ y y 2 ρ l a d g k d y ρ l a d b d x based on the geometrical shape of the tlcgd damper the gas should be treated to be stopped from entering into the liquid according to the validity of piston theory tlcgd frequency is restricted by the relative maximum liquid velocity that should stay lower than the critical fluid velocity of about 12 m s to prevent the cavitation phenomena at the liquid gas interface by choosing a higher value for the area ratio parameter λ this limitation can be eliminated because the higher the area ratio the less the liquid displacement in the vertical columns however this limitation can be almost overcome by the mentioned method but some other problems such as the required space for the whole system in buildings or structures with limited places are yet existed in this study a novel procedure is introduced considering mr fluid as a liquid which helps the designer to limit the system speed in a specific range using the magnetic field this means that no higher values are needed to be considered for the area ratio parameter 2 2 dynamic model of the jacket platform and the mr tlcgd system the equation of motion for the whole system including an offshore jacket platform and an mr tlcgd damping system subjected to seismic and wave excitations can be written as the follows dowson 1983 20 m x c x k x f w o r f e f d 21 ρ l a d l d y 2 π ρ l a d δ σ y 2 π c τ y

and each joints of the jacket platform and n shows the degree of freedom dof of the system that is 228 considering 38 nodes each with 6 degrees of freedom and 109 elements in this paper finite element model of the jacket is performed by the matrices of mass and stiffness which is the best solution for complex space frames in the control process fourth order runge kutta method is employed for solving the equations of motion the specifications and four natural frequencies of the jacket platform are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively the first natural frequency of a system is of great importance in the engineering field vibration response of a system mainly can be damped by employing a tlcd based system only if the frequency of the damping system is matched to the first natural frequency of the primary system however this procedure is valid only for the frequency dependent damping systems such as tlcd or tld as the response frequency falls out of the mentioned natural frequency the response of the coupled system main system and the damping system would not be satisfying and the damping system would be almost inefficient in this manuscript besides tuning the main geometrical parameters of the mr tlcgd system to the first natural frequency of the system the semi active procedure is utilized employing a magnetic field in system response and considering gas spring in a passive process however different values of head loss coefficient can be chosen based on the configuration and specification of the system in this study head loss coefficient is calculated through the equation which is introduced by mousavi et al mousavi et al 2011 2013 because of the horizontal length significance horizontal length b is also taken as 0 8l which is considered equal to the horizontal length of the jacket deck length the area ratio which is the vertical to horizontal columns cross section values is taken as 2 based on the previous studies by mousavi et al mousavi et al 2011 2013 the whole damper mass ratio is also considered as 1 percent of the jacket mass in this study due to the importance of the frequency ratio and dependency of this ratio to the gas pressure in this manuscript the mr tlcgd system is investigated through different values of gas pressure the location of the considered mr tlcgd system and the finite element model of the jacket including details about the node numbers are shown in fig 2 both x and y directions of the jacket platform are illustrated in fig 3 a and b as it can be seen the jacket platform is symmetric in y direction which is perpendicular to the wave propagation direction in the sea on the other hand the x direction of the jacket is designed geometrically asymmetrical the oblique side of the jacket is the side that waves hit for this reason the u plane of the mr tlcgd systems is considered to be in x direction for evaluating the damping system performance two different lateral loading directions are supposed the excitation direction of which the jacket is studied is presented in fig 3c based on fig 3c two different excitation directions are assumed for both wave and earthquake forces the first direction direction 1 is the direction that the u plane of the damping system is considered the second direction direction 2 is considered for evaluating the performance of the damping system more comprehensively for the external forces wave and earthquake excitations are chosen in this paper hydrodynamic forces evaluation requires wave parameters based on valid wave theory in this study the well known morison equation is employed for calculating the wave forces acting on a member of the jacket based on morison s equation the wave force intensity on the structure per unit of length can be evaluated by eq 24 according to the morison equation nonlinearity a stochastic linearization technique employs for modeling the wave force lastly eq 24 can be written as eq 25 in a linear form

persian gulf sea state details based on jonswap spectrum are used for defining the water particles velocity and accelerations as listed in table 3 dastan et al 2014 stokes second order wave theory is utilized in this manuscript for calculating water particle velocity and acceleration in horizontal and vertical directions chakraborty 2005 26 u h π t cosh k y d sinh k d cos k x ω t 3 h 2 π 2 4 t λ

velocity and acceleration and also vertical water particle velocity and acceleration respectively hydrodynamic forces parameters that are used in this manuscript for implementing the wave forces are listed in table 4 based on different wave properties mr magnetic field is considered as the control force inducer for this reason the proposed controlling force can be given as follow 30 f d m d ψ 1 ψ 2 y 2 ξ d ω d y ω d 2 y 31 ξ d c d 2 ρ w a d l d ω d 1 2 π g l d δ σ y c τ y l p ρ w h σ y where ψ b d l d and all other parameters are presented previously according to the previously introduced concepts yield stress is an important parameter in devices with mr fluids besides the amount of pressure that should be considered in gas spring can affect the efficiency of the whole system due to these reasons the performance of the mr tlcgd system is investigated utilizing different gas pressure and yield stress values 2 3 verification procedure a previously modeled platform investigated by mousavi et al 2012 is considered for the verification of the current study formulation the platform is modeled as a four leg 5dof system with the same properties in both directions as illustrated in fig 5 the stiffness mass area and volume matrices are considered as follows 32 k v p 10 9 1 0 444 0 0 0 0 444 0 819 0 375 0 0 0 0 375 0 661 0 286 0 0 0 0 286 0 353 0 067 0 0 0 0 067 0 067 n m 33 m v p

technique is utilized and a value of two percent is taken as the damping ratio other specifications of the platform are considered as mousavi et al 2012 the first three natural frequency of the jacket platform is gained as 5 89 24 5 and 52 7 hz respectively the platform is investigated under three different ground motion accelerations san fernando 1971 and kern county 1952 and northridge 1994 earthquakes scaled to pga 0 3 g as studied by mousavi et al 2012 displacement time history of one of the earthquake records for comparison is shown in fig 6 the rms of the displacement time history of the uncontrolled and controlled cases are listed in table 1 for both tlcgd systems of mousavi et al 2012 and the current study according to table 5 there are no significant differences between the designed tlcgd system of current study and the tlcgd system of mousavi et al 2012 for the mentioned jacket platform the difference under san fernando and kern country is about 1 5 and 1 6 percent in comparison with the tlcgd system of mousavi et al 2012 also as noted in table 5 the controlled displacement rms of the system response under northridge earthquake is 3 66 cm for mousavi et al which is 3 81 cm for the current study there is 4 1 percent difference between the current study result and the result of mousavi et al 2012 which can be considered as an appropriate verification for the authors code 3 results and discussion vibrational control of an offshore jacket platform is investigated using an mr tlcgd system under wave and earthquake incidence for a better comparison of the new damping system s efficiency the response of the jacket is also investigated utilizing a tlcgd damping system both systems are considered at the top level of a three dimensional jacket platform in this manuscript the time history of displacement in the top node of the jacket located at the highest structural level is represented in fig 7 under wave loading the wave height with 100 years of return period is employed as of the first wave loading case case 1 and on the other hand to evaluate the performance of the system more comprehensively the response of the system is investigated under a 10 year return period wave load as of the second wave loading case case 2 the time history response of the jacket platform under the second wave load case is illustrated in fig 8 the most important parameters of the mr tlcgd which are yield stress and gas pressure are taken as τ y 100 kpa and 2 bar respectively according to fig 7 it can be seen that the uncontrolled response of the jacket is equal to 5 9 cm which is reduced to 3 5 cm by employing tlcgd system and significantly lower values equal to 1 8 cm using mr tlcgd which expresses 40 and 69 reduction percentages the details of displacement response under both wave loading are listed in table 6 based on the results using an mr tlcd system in an offshore jacket can reduce structural vibration amplitudes under wave significantly which shows the efficiency of the new introduced system according to table 6 displacement values of the system under wave loading are listed for four structural levels considering the highest and the lowest level in both excitation directions it can be seen that using both tlcgd and mr tlcgd damping systems the structural response of the system is reduced significantly in all structural levels in which the reduction is higher by using introduced mr tlcgd damping system based on the results the reduction is 40 and 69 percent in the top level of the jacket as the wave load with 100 years of return period case 1 hits the jacket also by using mr tlcgd and tlcgd damping systems the response is reduced about 44 and 49 percent by considering a 10 years return period wave load case 2 in the second direction however as the wave hit direction altered to direction 2 due to the incomplete response of the damping system the system response is increased almost significantly the efficiency of the system is also investigated using two near field ground motion accelerations including kobe and northridge earthquakes over two excitation directions zero and 45 as shown in figs 9 and 10 the system is tuned as the yield stress and gas pressure values are taken as τ y 100 kpa and 2 bar respectively as it is seen in fig 9 the top node displacement of the jacket platform is decreased using both dampers in which the value of the decrement for the mr tlcgd system is higher although displacements are reduced in most peak points using tlcgd few higher values are gained in some peaks as it can be seen in fig 9a the uncontrolled response of the jacket is 9 8 cm which is reduced to 3 5 and 1 2 cm for tlcgd and mr tlcgd systems respectively in comparison to the uncontrolled values utilizing both damping systems represents 64 and 87 percent of reduction also based on fig 9b it can be noted that the structural response is reduced from 8 9 cm to 2 6 cm and 0 27 cm utilizing tlcgd and mr tlcgd systems respectively more details of the displacement time history under earthquake are listed in table 7 as shown in fig 10 the controlled response of the system under earthquake is increased which is due to the inadequate performance of both tlcgd and mr tlcgd damping systems however the displacement response is decreased in comparison with the uncontrolled response the efficiency of the damping systems is reduced the uncontrolled response of the jacket is 9 1 cm which is reduced to 5 4 and 4 7 cm for tlcgd and mr tlcgd systems respectively although the response of the jacket by using mr tlcgd system is more efficient the response of both damping systems is nearly the same more details of the displacement response of the system are listed in table 8 for the second excitation direction direction 2 based on the listed results in table 7 the whole structural response of the coupled system is reduced in which the most reduction is for the top level using mr tlcgd the reduction is 64 percent for the top level using tlcgd and 87 percent considering mr tlcgd respectively for the kobe earthquake the mentioned reduction is 70 and 96 percent for northridge earthquake respectively according to the results in table 8 the reduction in system response is about 40 and 48 percent in comparison with the results of direction 1 the capability of the damping system is also studied considering two vital yield stress and gas pressure parameters under both wave and earthquake excitations in this paper as it is presented in fig 11 rms of the displacement time history of the system equipped with mr tlcgd is shown different values of yield stress parameter are considered in fig 11 the gas pressure is assumed to be constant 2 bar and the jacket is excited by the northridge earthquake in direction 1 it can be seen that as the yield stress increases the amount of displacement rms decreases because of yield stress parameter s limitation a range between 0 and 180 kpa is chosen based on the results presented in fig 11 a value of mid range and high range are selected for the yield stress parameters for gas pressure investigation as it is shown in fig 12 a and b different values of gas pressure are proposed by a constant yield stress values equal to 100 and 180 kpa even by considering a certain value for the yield stress gas pressure increment in a range between 2 and 500 bar results in displacement rms increment the reason for this phenomena can be expressed through the fact that the gas pressure increment causes the liquid movement to decrease which results in displacement rms increment it should be noted that the gas pressure which increases the whole system performance should be limited to a specific value based on the structure and damper specification but it seems that better performances can be obtained through lower values more details about the displacement rms in different yield stress and gas pressures under wave and earthquake are listed in tables 9 and 10 respectively as it is illustrated in fig 13 displacement rms of the coupled system utilizing different yield stress values is presented under wave loading of case 1 as the gas pressure is proposed to have a constant value equal to 2 bar it is obvious that by increasing the yield stress value up to 100 kpa displacement rms decreases significantly and then decrement occurs insignificantly regardless of the value of yield stress which can be taken up to 200 kpa choosing a suitable value results in a higher and better performance and vibration decrement of the whole system for a better comparison of the yield stress and gas pressure relationship under wave loading in figs 14 and 15 the efficiency of the damping system is investigated under a constant yield stress value of 100 and 180 kpa within different gas pressure values based on the results presented in fig 14 by considering a constant yield stress value 100 kpa the gas pressure increment results in the increment of displacement rms of the system as it is shown in fig 14b the increment value is lower for gas pressures up to 100 bar and then the value of increment rises significantly it can be due to the fact that the more the gas pressure the less the liquid movement according to fig 15 the value of displacement rms also increases by gas pressure increment even in higher yield stress values of 180 kpa this increment is insignificant in lower values of gas pressures up to 100 bar and then it gets considerable in higher pressures as it is listed in table 10 although the structural displacement response increases in most cases by the damper gas pressure increment the most decrement occurs in 60 bar of gas pressure however displacement decrement under wave loading for lower pressures are insignificant and the most decrement is gained in lower gas pressures for this case study values of 100 kpa and 2 bar can be considered as the best values of yield stress and gas pressure parameters 4 conclusion structural control of an offshore jacket platform is studied under wave and earthquake utilizing a novel mr tlcgd damping system the mr tlcgd system is employed as a combination of both mr tlcd and tlcgd dampers performances in the mentioned novel damping system the damper performs as a tlcgd system in lower liquid velocities and performs as an mr tlcd in higher liquid velocities due to the tlcgd systems limitations the performance of the whole coupled system is studied within different sea states and ground motion accelerations the wave and earthquake incidence is investigated through two various directions to evaluate the dampers effectiveness more comprehensively the directions are chosen as the parallel to damper u plane and a plane with an angle of 45 based on the results by taking an angle for the lateral excitation as it is expected the efficiency of the damping system is decreased which is due to the incomplete performance of the damper the main parameters in an mr tlcgd system are defined as the yield stress due to mr fluid existence and the gas pressure because of considering a gas damper within the system both yield stress and gas pressure parameters are studied through different values under wave and earthquake according to the results the lower the gas pressure the better the rms displacement as the yield stress parameter is still constant in the other hand by increasing the yield stress value the displacement rms of the system decreases up to a certain amount it can be concluded that considering an appropriate value is of great importance for both yield stress and gas pressure values which results in a better performance of the whole system due to the liquid movement limitations based on the results for this case study a value of 2 bar for the gas pressure and a value of 100 kpa for the yield stress parameters can be taken as the best choice however using a tlcgd is possible in an offshore structure and using an mr tlcgd damper can be defined as a highly expensive project but considering an mr tlcgd is more recommended due to significant reductions in structural response 
22853,increase in drilling operations in the arctic region intuits to examine the suitability of platforms under ice loads this paper examines the dynamic response of triceratops under continuous ice crushing effect of ice loads on one and adjacent buoyant legs are examined under different ice velocity crushing strength and ice thickness based on the numerical investigations carried out it is seen that the response of deck in active degrees of freedom is nonlinear showing higher response with the increase in ice crushing strength ice loads cause a shift in the mean response limit ice load acting on the buoyant legs increases with the increase in the ice thickness with the increase in ice crushing strength set down increases along with the increase in the mean value of surge mean and total yaw response also increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength increased deck response under ice loads is due to transfer of translational response from buoyant legs to deck by ball joints however pitch response of the deck is lesser than that of buoyant legs verifying the restraint offered by ball joints to transfer rotation it may be an added advantage of triceratops under ice infested sea loads though this may not be the only sufficient requirement certainly no transfer of rotational response from buoyant leg to the deck enables a comfortable working environment from the analysis of triceratops under lock in ice condition it is found that the response of the deck and buoyant legs is bounded and the resonance build up is not seen in any degrees of freedom due to damping present in the structure which is an additional advantage of a triceratops 1 introduction in the recent past there is a significant increase in oil drilling in the arctic region and other ice infested waters in ultra deepwater condition in addition to the hindrance caused to normal operations ice sheets also induce dynamic effects oil and gas exploration in the arctic and temperate regions pose design challenges due to cold environmental conditions offshore platforms commissioned in ice infested water need to be assessed for the hindrance caused by ice sheet to their operability in addition to the nature of random and cyclic characteristics of ice loads that impose dynamic effects shih 1991 ice structure interaction developed by matlock et al 1971 modeled offshore structure as a mass spring dashpot system which became the fore runner for several other futuristic models developed by field data see for example maattanen s model sodhi s model and riska s model moving ice undergoes different failure modes during ice structure interaction resulting in bending crushing shear and buckling while failure mechanism depends on the geometric shape of the structure at the water level ice crushing failure tends to cause a maximum force on vertical structures sanderson 1988 during crushing failure different characteristic forms of dynamic behavior were observed in vertical fixed and slender structures and it primarily depends upon the ice velocity continuous crushing is one of the crushing modes that causes random vibration under high ice velocity an analytical model representing the ice crushing phenomenon cannot be developed using the theory of failure mechanics due to its limitations yue et al 2009 kärnä et al 2007 developed a spectral model to identify these forces which can be applied to both narrow and wide structures kärnä et al 2007 this model however oversights the feedback effect for moderate to high ice velocities improved model presented analytical ice mechanics by incorporating ice deformation yu et al 2016 a special case of intermittent ice crushing is called lock in condition where the ice load frequency matches with that of the structure at intermediate ice velocities this behavior had resulted in highly amplified responses in several offshore structures jefferies 1988 the numerical investigations on the compliant cylindrical structures also predicted higher dynamic amplification of the force at an ice force frequency equal to the natural frequency of the structure ziemer and evers 2016 the study on the dynamic model based on a physical mechanism combining forced vibration and self excited vibration also observed lock in phenomenon during ice induced vibration ji and oterkus 2016 despite the number of studies on the lock in ice condition the actual mechanism and influencing ice parameters behind lock in case has not been deciphered mccoy et al 2014 offshore triceratops is the recent addition to the set of compliant offshore platforms for ultra deepwater drilling chandrasekaran and madhuri 2015 chandrasekaran and nagavinothini 2017 triceratops shown in fig 1 consists of a deck connected to three buoyant legs by ball joints ball joints play a crucial role in extending these platforms to ultra deep waters even under extreme sea state ball joints restrain transformation of rotational degrees of freedom between the deck and buoyant legs it helps in reducing deck response in adverse environmental conditions under the combined action of wind wave and current buoyant legs are position restrained by a set of taut moored tethers which restrain the excessive rotational motion in the buoyant legs under the action of environmental loads orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shells comprising the buoyant legs resist axial force and bending moment under lateral pressure topside is designed as an integrated deck system to withstand heavy payloads recent studies confirmed the advantageous response of triceratops under the coupled action of wind and waves in extreme sea state chandrasekaran and nagavinothini 2018 a significant increase in the tether tension is observed in the stiffened triceratops which are the modified form of a triceratops with stiffened buoyant legs chandrasekaran and mayank 2017 as the offshore industry is heading towards ice infested regions with greater water depths the present study examines the adequacy of the platform for ice covered regions its dynamic response behavior the present study aims to investigate the ice induced response of triceratops ice loading time history is developed from the ice force spectrum for continuous crushing time domain analysis is then carried using ansys aqwa to investigate the suitability of the platform under ice crushing for different ice sea states the effect of ice thickness ice velocity and ice crushing strength on the response of triceratops is also investigated in detail as lock in ice condition amplifies the response of the structure numerical studies are also carried out to assess the response of triceratops under frequency lock in this study focusses only on the response of deck and buoyant legs of triceratops and the effect of ice load on tether tension variation and reliability of ball joints are excluded from the present study for future work 2 preliminary design in this study the triceratops model is developed based on the dimensions of perdido spar the buoyancy of the spar platform is distributed to three buoyant legs of triceratops while maintaining the same height and topside weight of the spar platform the diameter and height of the buoyant legs are 15 m and 174 24 m respectively the total topside weight is about 97400 kn and the shape of the deck is an equilateral triangle of side length 95 m the topside of the platform is designed with three deck levels as an integrated truss deck system the main deck flooring is designed as truss type connection and the cellar and top deck floorings are designed as beam panel arrangement in order to resist the wind load transverse tubular members stiffened with diagonal members are provided to connect the different floor levels the buoyant legs are designed as orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shells with ring frames and stiffeners each buoyant leg structure is provided with 70 stringers designed as flat bars of 300 40 mm and spaced at 3 m c c the environmental condition for which the buoyant leg is designed for is an intermediate environmental condition in the gulf of mexico with 7 9 m wave height and 9 1 s peak period the cylindrical shell is designed and checked for different types of buckling as per dnv rp c202 veritas 2010 this empirical method is taken for the preliminary design of the buoyant legs however for the detailed design stage finite element analysis is required the design details of triceratops are given in table 1 3 ice force spectrum ice drifting occurs due to several environmental factors such as wave wind or current which highly depends upon the location in offshore engineering it is commonly assumed that the ice loads are influenced highly by limit stress due to the availability of sufficient energy to cause ice failure thus it can be said that the ice force is the force required to cause ice failure in the vicinity of the structure the important factor that limits the maximum ice load acting on the structure is the ice failure mechanism which in turn depends upon the several factors such as ice velocity width and shape of the structure failure may occur by crushing splitting bending buckling and a combination of modes chandrasekaran 2017a b several researchers reported that the crushing failure of ice tends to cause maximum ice force on the offshore structures yue et al 2009 crushing ice failure occurs when a thick sheet of ice with moderate to high ice velocity impinges against a vertical sided structure the total ice force applied on the structure under crushing failure is a function of ice strength in crushing when ice interacts with compliant structure the failure modes are ductile and brittle at low and high rates of indentation respectively continuous brittle crushing at high indentation rate results in non simultaneous partial contact and non uniform pressure over the nominal contact area the ice force time history may either have constant amplitude periodic waveforms or with randomly distributed periods and amplitudes under very high ice velocity ice force can be designated as a stochastic process in such cases the ice forces can be described using a frequency spectrum as the transition between the different modes of failure under crushing is not completely known the uncoupled time dependant ice load can be used in the dynamic analysis of the structures i limit force for ice crushing the mechanical properties of sea ice are highly affected by the temperature as sea ice exist very close to their melting temperature and the presence of brine several expressions have been developed for the strength of ice form the strain rate and porosity for both crushing and flexural failure of ice ice crushing force can be obtained by multiplying the crushing pressure and the contact area the effective ice pressure depends upon the aspect ratio confinement within the ice sheet scale and degree of contact between the ice and structure sodhi and haehnel 2003 in this study the limit ice load is calculated from the korzhavin equation reddy and swamidas 2013 for ice crushing against the vertical structure it is given by f a 1 a 2 a 3 h w σ c where a1 is the shape factor 0 9 for circular members a2 is the contact factor 0 5 for moving ice a3 is the aspect ratio factor σ c is the crushing strength of ice in mpa h is the thickness of ice in m and w is the projected width of the structure in m the crushing strength of ice mainly depends upon temperature the maximum ice crushing strength in the coldest time of the year as recorded in beaufort sea is 3 mpa which can be considered as an extreme value mccoy et al 2014 under spring conditions with the temperature close to the melting point the ice crushing strength is 1 5 mpa though korzhavin s equation is one of the initial approaches it is still in use today with modification factors the local thickening of ice is taken into consideration by contact factor a2 however it should be noted that the local thickening occurs only under stationary ice load with prolonged contact periods thus the contact factor is chosen as 0 5 for moving ice the previous studies also reported that the limit force obtained from korzhavin s equation is comparable with the empirical relations derived for prediction of limit ice force at lower ice thickness but the questions exists with the applicability of other empirical formulations for prediction of ice force in compliant multi legged offshore structures thus the most initial approach from korzhavin s equation has been used in this study mccoy et al 2014 ii continuous crushing spectral model though there are several ice failure modes the crushing failure causes the maximum force in level ice action yue et al 2009 2009 continuous ice crushing occurs under high ice speed when the drifting ice interacts with the structure the horizontal crack will occur at the edge of the ice sheet then flaking divides the ice sheet into several layers a portion of the ice sheet will pile up and slide around the ice surface due to crushing and pulverization under brittle crushing the ice crushing strength will not influence the response as the crushing strength becomes constant under such conditions the feedback mechanism induced by the compliant structure shall become negligible which makes the spectral model adopted in the present study more feasible a spectral model for ice speed ranging from 0 04 m s to 0 35 m s used in the current study is given below karna et al 2007 the non dimensional spectral density function is given by g n f a f 1 k s a 1 5 f 2 where a b v 0 6 v is the ice velocity in m s b and ks are the experimental parameters and f is the frequency in hertz now the spectral density function is given by g n f σ n 2 g n f f where σ n 2 is the variance of the local force the mean ice force and standard deviation are calculated from the following set of equations σ n i n 1 k i n f n m a x f n m e a n f n m a x 1 k i n where in is an intensity parameter it varies from 0 2 to 0 5 k is the selected probability of exceedance fmean is the mean ice force and fmax is the maximum ice force spectral density plot developed from the above set of equations for ice thickness of 1 5 m and 1 5 mpa ice crushing strength is shown in fig 2 it is also seen that the peak of the spectrum varies according to the ice velocity the maximum energy is found at the lower frequencies and the variation in the spectrum due to the ice velocity is found at the frequencies below 0 3 hz thus it can be predicted that the effect of the ice velocity on time varying component on the ice force is very less and the factor that dominates the response of the structure is the mean force also several factors have to be considered in determining the ice loads on the multi legged structures evers and wessels 1986 it includes the interference and shielding effects between the legs jamming of ice between legs that depends upon the arrangement of legs and the clear spacing between the legs for the three legged structure the maximum load occurs when the ice approaches the two legs directly the maximum total load is the twice the maximum load on one leg in the case of triceratops the forces on each leg will normally act independently due to the presence of ball joints though the force model is developed to obtain the response of bottom supported structures the same shall apply to compliant platforms with large displacement it is because large displacements increase mooring stiffness due to rigidity in the vertical plane and hence behave similarly to that of bottom supported platforms as the ice spectrum model is developed based on the real time data collected from offshore structures the model automatically accounts for the formation of ice prows and ice rubble mounds during ice structure interaction the variation in the peak of the spectrum is also observed under the change in the maximum ice force acting on the structure as shown in fig 3 for 0 2 m s ice velocity the ice force time series is then developed from the spectrum for different ice load cases using inverse fourier transform the sampling frequency is taken as 20 hz the coherence function is then evaluated the total ice force is given by the sum of mean ice force and the time varying ice force the spectral density function of the total force is then given by g f t f c μ k s t g f f f c μ k s where c is used for the consideration of the angle of incidence of the local forces and s is used to consider the local shear forces by obtaining the standard deviation and the maximum peak value form the above equation the external global pressure acting on the structure can be found out the ice load time history obtained for 0 5 m ice thickness 1 5 mpa ice crushing strength and 0 2 m s ice velocity is shown in fig 4 the ice load time history for 2000 s is used for different ice load cases for the numerical analysis 4 numerical modeling and free oscillation studies in order to overcome the difficulties that arise in modeling and simulation of the offshore triceratops with six degrees of freedom the numerical model is developed using ansys aqwa three dimensional radiation theory or diffraction theory is used by this solver to simulate the linearized hydrodynamic fluid wave loading in time domain simulation the real time motion of a floating body at each time step is simulated by integrating the accelerations in the time domain by predictor corrector numerical integration scheme the buoyant legs are modeled as tube elements denoted as morison elements for which the fluid force is calculated using morison s equation the meshing of the deck is done by three dimensional panel method and it is carried out with triangular and quadrilateral panels the initial hydrostatic analysis on the free floating triceratops showed that the metacentric height of the platform lies above the centre of gravity the taut moored tethers which connect the buoyant legs to the sea floor are modeled as linear cables the initial pretension on the tethers is assigned through the stiffness and the unstretched length of the tether the numerical model of the platform is shown in fig 5 a then the dynamic analysis is carried out by solving the following equation by convolution integration technique m m a x t c x t k x t f t where x t x t x t and f t are acceleration velocity displacement and force vectors m is the structural mass matrix m a is the added mass matrix c is the damping matrix and k is the stiffness matrix after the completion of modeling of an entire triceratops with tethers the free oscillation studies are carried out in order to find out the natural period of the platform in six degrees of freedom by giving disturbing external forces logarithmic decrement method is then used to find the damping ratio from the results it is observed that the triceratops are highly compliant in the surge and sway degrees of freedom the natural frequency and damping ratio of the triceratops in six degrees of freedom are given in table 2 the psd plot of the free decay response in surge and pitch degrees of freedom are shown in fig 5 b 5 dynamic response analysis under ice forces from continuous crushing the ice force time history is obtained from the spectral model for continuous ice crushing two load cases for ice infested water is taken initially to assess the response of the triceratops under ice action the details of the sea states considered are given in table 3 the ice velocity is maintained constant for both the sea states the sea states are classified based on the ice thickness and the ice crushing strength which affects the total ice force acting on the structure the maximum ice load is calculated from korzhavin s equation the ice load time history is generated from the spectral model by using matlab the external force acting on the structure can be given as an input in ansys aqwa in xft file format however the external force will act only on the centre of gravity of the structure the centre of gravity of the buoyant legs is far below the still water level since the ice load will act at the still water level of the structure the input is given as a moment about the y axis initially the ice force is applied only on one buoyant leg as shown in fig 6 a due to the hindrance effect the crushed ice moving past the buoyant leg 3 will not have any effect on the other two buoyant legs under crushing ice failure conditions considered in the present study the size of the ice sheet is much larger than the spacing of legs of the platform this will result in a broken path of moving ice sheet as the thickness is lesser in comparison to its size as a result the trailing leg will attract comparatively very less force from ice motion hence it is not considered in the numerical analysis in multi legged structures like a triceratops the maximum ice load will occur when two buoyant legs are loaded simultaneously then the dynamic analysis is carried out by applying the ice force on two buoyant legs as shown in fig 6b the response of the triceratops under both the cases are compared it is true that the phase difference should be taken into account for the dynamic analysis of multi legged structures larger compliancy in horizontal plane causes self induced motion before the platform attains the recentering position under such oscillating conditions phase difference imposed by the geometric positioning of buoyant legs results in counteracting the encountered ice loads to a larger extent as a result deck receives lesser impact since the forces are determined independently there is no need to reduce the forces further to consider the non simultaneous ice failure of individual legs the response of triceratops under normal and extreme ice sea state is studied in all degrees of freedom under the action of ice force in the surge direction the response of the deck and the buoyant legs in sway roll and yaw degrees of freedom are found out to be negligible the response of the deck and the buoyant legs in the surge heave and pitch degrees of freedom under normal ice sea state is shown in fig 7 respectively the surge response of the deck is periodic oscillating at a mean position of 2 3465 m the drift in the surge degree of freedom is observed in the deck buoyant legs 2 3 the drift in the buoyant leg 3 is observed in the negative x axis the heave response on the buoyant leg is lesser than that of the deck the increased deck response is due to the transfer of the response from the buoyant legs to the deck by ball joints also the pitch of the deck is very low compared to that of the buoyant legs as the ball joints restrain the transfer of the rotational degree of freedom the maximum pitch response is observed in the buoyant leg 3 on which the ice load acts an increase in the response in surge heave and pitch degrees of freedom is observed under extreme ice sea state condition the statistics of response on all degrees of freedom is given in table 4 it is seen that the platform drifts in the surge degree of freedom with the mean shift under the increase in the ice load the maximum surge response in the extreme sea state is only about 9 80 of the total draft of the structure from the normal to extreme sea state the rms value increases by 3 916 times 16 217 times and 16 719 times in surge heave and pitch degrees of freedom respectively the mean shifts in the negative z direction from normal to extreme sea state however the maximum heave response is only about 13 80 of that of the surge response the power spectral density plots of the deck and buoyant legs responses in the surge heave and pitch degrees of freedom are shown in fig 8 in surge and heave degrees of freedom the peak in deck response occurs at a frequency of 0 235 rad s in surge degree of freedom the first peak occurs at a frequency of about 0 0282 rad s which is equal to the surge natural frequency it shows that the buoyant legs are excited at the natural surge frequency the second peak occurs at a frequency of 0 1225 rad s in surge degree this frequency content is found to be prominent in all degrees of freedom in buoyant leg 3 on which the ice load acts this frequency occurs in the neighborhood of 4 times of natural surge frequency at the same frequency the deck shows a higher peak in heave degree in pitch degree of freedom prominent frequency peaks occur only on the buoyant legs the deck response is very low compared to that of the buoyant legs response in pitch degree which shows the effect of the ball joint in restraining the rotational degrees of freedom when the ice force is applied on two buoyant legs a significant response in all degrees of freedom are observed in the deck and buoyant legs the response is periodic fluctuating about the mean position the response under normal ice sea state in different degrees of freedom are shown in fig 9 the surge response shows that the ball joints transfer the surge response from the buoyant legs to the deck comparing the surge response with the ice load in one buoyant leg the drift in the deck and the far end buoyant leg occurs in the positive x direction the ice load causes the drift in the negative x direction on the buoyant leg on which it acts as seen from the sway response time history the sway response of the deck is lesser than the surge response though significant sway response is observed in the buoyant legs the lesser response is observed in the deck the mean oscillating position of buoyant leg 3 lies on the positive side and the mean of the other two buoyant legs lies on the negative side it reduces the mean shift of the deck in sway degree of freedom the heave response of the deck very low which shows the operational advantage of the triceratops the heave response in the buoyant legs2 3 are less the increase heave response in the deck also shows that the heave response from the buoyant legs is transferred to the deck a shift in the mean position of the deck in the heave direction is also observed which in turn increases the tether tension when comparing the heave response with that of the heave response with ice load on one buoyant leg it can be observed that the deck and buoyant legs with ice load drift in the negative z direction causing set down in the platform the maximum response in the roll degree of freedom is observed in the buoyant leg 3 but the roll response of the deck is very low as they are restrained by the buoyant legs as seen from the pitch response time history the pitch response of the deck is remarkably low compared to that of the buoyant legs the larger response of the deck in the rotational degrees of freedom will hinder the normal operation of the crew on the topside the lesser response of deck as observed in the triceratops is mainly attributed to the unique character of the ball joints it makes the platform more advantageous compared to other common compliant platforms in the offshore industry while comparing it with the response of the platform with ice load on one buoyant leg the magnitude of pitch response in the deck and buoyant legs is slightly higher the yaw response of the deck is periodic different from the response of the buoyant legs the platform shows higher yaw response due to the displacement of the deck and buoyant legs in the surge and sway degrees of freedom simultaneously as seen from the yaw response time history the yaw response in all the buoyant legs increases in an anticlockwise direction with time however a periodic response fluctuating about the mean position is seen in the deck response in yaw degree of freedom it shows that the buoyant legs absorb the continuous yaw in the buoyant legs from transferring to the deck when ice load acts on one buoyant leg the response in all active degrees of freedom is found out be minimum at simulation time between 600 s and 1200 s however the same pattern is not observed when ice load acts on two buoyant legs in the second case where the ice load acts on two buoyant legs a beating phenomenon is observed in the response of the deck and buoyant legs thus it is evident that all degrees of freedoms are excited when the ice load acts on two buoyant legs the statistics of deck response in all degrees of freedom is given in table 4 a shift in the mean position is observed in degrees of freedom from normal to extreme ice sea state there is an increase in the response of the deck in all degrees of freedom with the increase in the ice forces which is evident from the increase in the standard deviation values the rms value increases by about 3 95 times from normal to extreme sea state in surge degree of freedom which shows the effect of increased ice force on the buoyant legs the maximum surge response in extreme sea state is only about 9 66 of the draft of the structure under extreme sea state condition a complete shift of the deck from its mean position is observed in surge roll and yaw degrees of freedom the minimum response being zero comparatively the heave response of the deck is very low an increased yaw response of the deck can be seen in the extreme ice sea state condition while comparing the deck response under the ice load action one buoyant leg with that of the load case where ice load acts on two buoyant legs a slight difference in the surge and heave degrees of freedom is observed under both normal and extreme ice sea state conditions however an abrupt increase in response in the sway roll and yaw degrees of freedom is observed in contrast the pitch response in the deck decreases when ice load acts on two buoyant legs the coupling between different degrees of freedom and the presence of ball joints affects the response of the deck and buoyant legs in all degrees of freedom making them undergo random vibration at different mean position and magnitude ice load action induces surge and pitch responses in the buoyant leg on which it acts it also invokes heave response in the buoyant leg due to the coupling between the surge and heave degrees of freedom in compliant platforms like a triceratops thus the ice load action causes a major difference in the response of the buoyant legs also the translational motion is transferred from the buoyant leg to the deck by ball joints which in turn transfers it to other buoyant legs so the response of the deck and buoyant legs are affected by each other due to the presence of the ball joints the power spectral density plots of deck and buoyant legs responses in all degrees of freedom are shown in fig 10 in surge degree of freedom the first peak occurs at a frequency of 0 028 rad s which is equal to the surge natural frequency the first peak is dominant in buoyant leg 1 the second peak occurs at a frequency of 0 123 rad s and it occurs only in the buoyant legs the third peak occurs at a frequency of 0 235 rad s in the neighborhood 1 4th of natural pitch frequency it is highly dominant in the deck response the peaks occur only at a lower frequency range where the ice force is dominant in sway response dominant peaks are observed at 0 028 rad s 0 123 rad s and 0 226 rad s the third peak is dominant in the deck and the first peaks occur at the buoyant legs unlike surge and sway responses the heave response shows only two peaks at the frequencies 0 123 rad s and 0 226 rad s the third frequency is also observed in the surge response in all the translational degrees of freedom the maximum value is observed only in the deck response which is due to the transfer of the response from the buoyant legs to the deck the maximum response in the roll degree of freedom is observed in the buoyant legs the deck response in the pitch degree of freedom is very low compared to that of the buoyant legs which again shows the efficiency of the ball joints in restraining the rotational degrees of freedom from the buoyant legs to the deck in yaw response only one peak is observed at a frequency of 0 028 rad s in the deck this shows that the natural surge frequency affects the response of the platform in the horizontal plane the dominant frequency in the vertical plane is 0 226 rad s the compliant degrees of freedom of the platform is highly affected by the action of ice forces other degrees of freedom are also activated due to the action of ice loads in two buoyant legs 6 effect of ice velocity as a significant response is observed in all degrees of freedom when ice load acts on two buoyant legs the analysis is carried out under this condition henceforth to find the effect of ice velocity on the structure the presented spectral model is valid in the ice velocity range of 0 04 m s and 0 35 m s hence the ice velocity is varied from 0 05 m s to 0 3 m s with the interval of 0 05 m s the ice thickness is taken as 0 5 m with ice crushing strength of 1 5 mpa which comes under normal ice sea state the statistics of deck response under varying velocities are given in table 5 the maximum and mean surge response of the deck decreases with the increase in the ice velocity up to 0 20 m s and then starts increasing the minimum surge response occurs at ice velocity of 0 20 m s only a slight variation in the rms value of surge response is observed under different ice velocities unlike surge response the sway response does not show any linear variation with the increase in the ice velocities the maximum sway response is observed at the lowest ice velocity of 0 05 m s the mean heave and roll response of the deck decreases with the increase in ice velocity up to 0 25 m s and then increases the maximum pitch response occurs at higher ice velocity of 0 30 m s the maximum yaw response occurs at the lowest ice velocity of 0 05 m s thus it can be seen that the ice force acting along the positive x direction leads to maximum surge heave and pitch responses at high ice velocities the sway roll and yaw responses are activated at lower ice velocities the total response of the deck in different degrees of freedom is shown in fig 11 the total response in the surge pitch and yaw degrees of freedom is minimum at an ice velocity of 0 2 m s the minimum total response in sway heave and roll degrees of freedom is observed at ice velocity of 0 25 m s the total response decreases gradually from 0 05 m s to 0 25 m s but the increase in response from 0 25 m s to 0 30 m s is very high there is only a slight change in the power spectral density plots of deck response in different degrees of freedom however a significant change in the power spectral density plots is observed in the response of the buoyant legs as shown in fig 12 the response under different ice velocities is compared prominent peaks occur at frequencies of 0 0283 rad s 0 1225 rad s and 0 2262 rad s in the surge response of the buoyant leg at natural surge frequency the maximum peak occurs at ice velocity of 0 25 m s at a frequency of 0 1225 rad s the maximum and minimum peaks occur at ice velocity of 0 30 m s and 0 10 m s respectively at the third peak maximum and minimum responses are observed at ice velocities of 0 30 m s and 0 25 m s respectively the same behavior is observed at the sway response the magnitude being comparatively smaller than the surge response the heave roll and pitch responses are found to be maximum at a frequency of 0 2262 rad s the maximum and minimum at 0 30 m s and 0 25 m s ice velocities respectively as the response of the buoyant leg in the yaw degree of freedom is not periodic the psd plot is also found out to be maximum at the low frequency of about 0 009 rad s and then decreases there are no significant peaks observed in the yaw response the surge and sway responses are maximum at a frequency of about 0 1225 rad s while the heave roll and pitch degrees of freedom are maximum at a frequency of 0 2262 rad s however at natural surge frequency only the surge and sway responses are observed in the buoyant legs thus it shows the dominance of natural pitch frequency of the buoyant leg in all degrees of freedom 7 effect of ice thickness the limit ice load acting on the buoyant legs increases with the increase in the ice thickness the thickness of level ice is site specific and it highly depends upon the sea ice salinity and temperature the maximum thickness of level ice in the arctic region is 1 m and the minimum ice thickness for crushing failure of ice is 0 2 m reddy and swamidas 2013 sodhi and haehnel 2003 hence the ice thickness is varied from 0 2 m to 1 m the increase in the limit ice load as obtained from korzhavin s equation varies linearly with the increase in the ice thickness for ice crushing strength of 1 5 mpa and ice velocity of 0 2 m s as shown in fig 13 the response of the triceratops for normal ice sea state is studied for ice thickness 0 25 m 0 50 m 0 75 m and 1 00 m the statistics of the deck response under different ice thicknesses are given in table 6 it can be seen that the surge response increases with the increase in the ice thickness the same pattern is observed in all other degrees of freedom with the increase in the ice thickness the rms value of surge response increases by 2 080 1 57 and 1 324 times at successive steps in the same way the maximum surge response increases by about 45 33 34 25 and 23 88 at successive increase of ice thickness the drift in the surge direction also increases with the increase in the ice thickness the percentage increase of the maximum sway response is higher than that of the surge response but the maximum sway response for 1 00 m ice thickness is only about 12 66 of that of surge response the rms value in heave response increased by about 4 23 2 67 and 1 59 times with the increase in the ice thickness the set down in the platform increases with the increase in the ice thickness in roll and pitch degree of freedom the maximum response increases with the increase in the ice thickness however the total roll and pitch responses observed at higher ice thickness is only about 1 804 and 1 114 respectively the maximum yaw response under higher ice thickness is found out to be 13 672 with the incccraaase in the ice thickness the rms value in yaw degrees of freedom increases by 2 08 1 647 and 1 37 times the increase in the total response in all degrees of freedom with the increase in the ice thickness is shown in fig 14 a significant increase in the response is also found in the buoyant legs the power spectral densities of the deck response in different degrees of freedom are shown in fig 15 significant peaks are observed at frequencies of 0 028 rad s and 0 226 rad s in the surge degree of freedom the magnitude of density increased at the second peak with the increase in ice thickness however the maximum density occurs at an ice thickness of 0 75 m in sway response the peaks occur only at a single frequency of about 0 226 rad s with increasing density with the increase in the ice thickness the response in the heave roll and pitch degrees of freedoms shows prominent peaks at frequencies of 0 1225 rad s and 0 226 rad s in all degrees of freedom the density increases with the increase in ice thickness a significant difference in the peak values has been observed in all degrees of freedom when the ice thickness is increased beyond 0 5 m the yaw response of the deck is found out to be similar to that of the surge response the response of the buoyant legs is also found out to be increasing with the increase in the ice thickness 8 effect of ice crushing strength the limit ice load increases with the ice crushing strength as shown in fig 16 the limit ice load values are obtained from korzhavin s equation the response of the triceratops is studied for ice crushing strength varied from 1 5 mpa to 3 00 mpa with an increment of 0 50 mpa for normal ice sea state the statistics of the deck response in different degrees of freedom under varying ice crushing strength is given in table 7 as the ice load increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength the response in the buoyant legs and the deck also increases it can be seen that the response of the deck in all degrees of freedom increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength from the statistics the maximum surge response increases by about 14 14 37 72 and 2 7 with the ice crushing strength from 1 5 mpa to 3 00 mpa the surge response increases rapidly beyond the ice crushing strength of 2 00 mpa where the rms value increases by 1 28 times the increase in the maximum surge response from 2 50 mpa to 3 00 mpa is less comparatively where the rms value increase by 1 19 times the shift in the mean value of the surge response also increases with the increase in the ice strength as observed in the previous load cases the sway response of the deck is comparatively lower than that of the surge response initially the rms value decreases with the increase in the ice crushing strength by 0 835 times and then increases by 1 95 and 1 42 times at successive increments the set down effect in the heave degree increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength the rms value increases by about 1 58 1 76 and 1 35 times with the increase in the ice crushing strength the total heave response at the maximum ice crushing strength is only about 7 of the total surge response the mean value of the roll and pitch responses are found out to be increasing in the positive and negative directions respectively the increase in the rms value of the pitch response is 1 70 1 71 and 1 38 times it is evident that the increase in the deck response beyond 2 5 mpa ice crushing strength is less compared to the responses observed under lower ice crushing strengths the yaw response in the deck shows a maximum value of 12 945 under extreme condition ice crushing strength 3 mpa the mean and the total yaw response also increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength with the increase in the rms value by 1 34 1 30 and 1 52 times that of the previous value at a successive increment of ice crushing strength the increase in the total response of the deck with the increase in the ice crushing strength is shown in fig 17 as seen from the response the total response in all degrees of freedom increases up to the ice crushing strength of 2 5 mpa and then decreases the maximum response is observed at ice crushing strength of 2 5 mpa and the increase in the response is maximum in the interval of 2 00 2 50 mpa the power spectral density plots of the deck response under varying ice crushing strengths are shown in fig 18 the power spectral density in deck surge response increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength significant peaks are observed at frequencies of about 0 028 rad s natural surge frequency and 0 226 rad s in the neighborhood of 1 4th of natural pitch frequency in sway response the peak is observed at 0 226 rad s the peak value increases rapidly beyond 2 00 mpa ice crushing strength whereas the variation in the peak value for ice crushing strengths 1 50 mpa and 2 00 mpa is found to be marginal in yaw response the peaks occur at the same frequencies as observed in the surge response the increase in the peak value is high between 2 00 mpa and 2 50 mpa the surge natural frequency is dominant in the surge sway and yaw responses in heave roll and pitch responses the peaks occur at frequencies of 0 122 rad s and 0 235 rad s the increase in the peak value follows the similar trend as that of response in other degrees of freedom the maximum response in all degrees of freedom is obtained for very high ice crushing strength 8 1 response under open water and ice covered loads the response of the triceratops in ice infested waters under extreme ice sea state condition ice thickness 0 5 m ice crushing strength 1 5 mpa and ice velocity 0 2 m s is compared with the response of the triceratops in open water condition under high sea state significant wave height 10 m zero crossing period 10 s for the representation of the wave energy distribution pierson moscowitz pm spectrum is used which is a two parameter spectrum suitable for open sea conditions neither fetch nor duration limited the ice load and wave load are applied in the positive x direction under open water load case the active degrees of freedom are found out to be a surge pitch and yaw the responses in other degrees of freedom are found out to be negligible however the ice covered load case induces a response in all degrees of freedom the response statistics on the surge heave and yaw degrees of freedom are given in table 8 in surge response the shift in the mean value is maximum in ice covered load case however the maximum response is observed under the open water load case in rms value in the ice covered load case is found out be higher than that of the open water load case it can be observed that the ice load on the buoyant legs shifts the mean oscillating position of the platform however the heave and pitch responses in both the cases are found out to be very low the total heave response of the platform is only about 0 97 and 3 96 of that of the surge response in open water load case and ice covered load case respectively the behavior of the platform under different load cases can be clearly understood from the surge response of the deck shown in fig 19 the response of deck under both the cases is periodic however the period of response is high in case of ice covered load case the power spectral density plots of the deck and buoyant leg 1 in surge degree of freedom is shown in fig 20 in the deck response the first peak occurs at the natural surge frequency where the response under open water load case is maximum the second peak occurs at1 4th of natural pitch frequency where the ice covered load case response of the deck is maximum in the response of the buoyant leg the peak at the natural surge frequency is maximum in case of ice covered load case 10 response of triceratops under lock in condition 10 1 lock in condition frequency lock in condition generally occurs at intermediate ice velocities where the structural frequency matches with the ice load frequency this behavior was experienced in many offshore structures and also resulted in a highly amplified response of the structure which is quite dangerous ice failure at a particular location in the contact zone causes a sudden increase in stress of adjacent ice leading to its failure this process continues and results in ice failure of the adjacent locations closer and closer together in time finally the continuous failure of ice gets synchronized and develops a lock in condition lock in can occur under a wide range of ice conditions however there must be a continuous motion of ice sheet during which ice is fairly homogeneous in the horizontal plane because the presence of cracks and thickness variation of the ice sheet will result in the mitigation of lock in behavior according to standard regulations the lock in condition analysis can be carried out using the ice load function developed based on the following conditions the period of the ice load time history should match the natural frequency of the structure the maximum ice force should be developed based on the ice parameters and the minimum ice force should be 0 6 times the maximum ice force mccoy et al 2014 in the present study the ice load time history for the frequency lock in condition is developed for periods equal to the surge and pitch natural periods of a triceratops analyses are carried out for both normal and extreme ice sea states with the ice load action on two buoyant legs simultaneously the ice load time history with a natural period equal to the natural surge period for normal ice sea state is shown in fig 21 10 2 response of triceratops under lock in condition with natural surge period the response of the deck and buoyant legs under normal ice state in lock in condition with natural surge period is shown in fig 22 the surge response in the deck and buoyant legs are found to be periodic the total surge response increases gradually till 2500 s and then starts decreasing till 3500 s from where the structure starts oscillating about the new position the deck oscillates around the mean position of 0 42 m the mean shift is observed in buoyant legs also and the maximum surge response is observed in buoyant leg 1 though buoyant legs show significant sway response the deck response in very less due to the mean shift of the buoyant legs in both the positive and negative axes unlike the surge response the deck sway response steadily increases up to 1500 s and then starts oscillating the heave response of the deck and buoyant legs are lesser than that of the surge response the ball joints effectively restrain the transfer of roll and pitch responses from the buoyant legs to the deck response builds up in roll and pitch degrees of freedom is also observed below 1000 s beyond which the system oscillates without sudden increases or decrease the deck shows significant yaw response which occurs due to the simultaneous surge and sway of the deck the lock in condition does not result in the amplification of the response in both deck and buoyant legs of triceratops due to the significant damping present in the system in different degrees of freedom which offsets the energy input from ice failure the statistics of deck response of triceratops under normal and extreme ice sea states in lock in condition is listed in table 9 the total response in all degrees of freedom increases from the normal to extreme ice sea state due to the increase in the limit ice forces it shows the importance of ice parameters even under the resonance condition the total deck response under extreme ice sea state is about 3 37 m the total heave response is about 2 of total surge response in extreme condition the ball joints reduced the pitch response of deck in both sea states from that of the buoyant legs however the total pitch response deck increases by about ten times form the normal to extreme ice sea state the psd plots of the deck response under normal and extreme ice sea states are shown in fig 23 the first peak in surge response occurs very close to surge natural frequency in both normal and extreme ice sea states as the lock in condition load function is developed with the natural surge period a significant peak at natural surge frequency is observed in all degrees of freedom the second peak in surge response occurs very close to one fourth of natural pitch frequency it shows the coupling between the surge and pitch degrees of freedom due to this coupling peaks are observed at one fourth of natural pitch frequency in all degrees of freedom the spectral energy is very high in extreme sea state compared to that of the normal sea state heave roll and pitch responses of the deck are very less prominent peaks are also observed at 0 114 rad s in addition to surge and pitch natural frequencies 10 3 response of triceratops under lock in condition with pitch natural period the response of the deck and buoyant legs under normal ice state in lock in condition with natural pitch period is shown in fig 24 the magnitude of response and the mean shift of deck and buoyant legs is comparatively lesser than the response under lock in with natural surge period in both normal and extreme sea state conditions however the reduced period of oscillation has resulted in a large number of cycles in the response of deck and buoyant legs in different degrees of freedom a steady decrease in the response is observed in surge degree of freedom however the deck sway response increases up to 3000 s with very less magnitude of amplification beyond the heave response of buoyant legs remains steady throughout the time history and the heave response of deck gradually decreases with time the response build up is not seen in the rotational degrees of freedom also the same behavior is observed in the extreme ice sea state condition however a comparatively larger rate of reduction in responses is observed in extreme sea state due to damping the statistics of deck response under different sea states are given in table 10 the total response and the mean shift increases from normal to extreme sea state in all degrees of freedom the psd plots of the deck response under normal and extreme ice sea states are shown in fig 25 as the ice load frequency matches with the natural pitch frequency of triceratops spectral peaks with maximum value are observed in the neighborhood of one fourth of natural pitch frequency in all degrees of freedom the spectral energy is found to be lesser than that of the responses under lock in ice condition with natural surge period due to coupling effect peaks are also observed at natural surge frequency the spectral energy is comparatively very high in the extreme ice sea state 10 4 response of triceratops under lock in condition with heave natural period the behavior of triceratops under lock in ice force with a period equal to heave natural period is found to be similar to that of the response obtained with natural pitch period the natural periods being very close to each other the statistics of the response in different sea states are given in table 11 the response increases from normal to extreme ice sea state the total response of deck and buoyant legs are slightly lesser than that of the response observed under lock in ice force with natural pitch period lock in condition is mitigated in triceratops in both stiff and flexible degrees of freedom and the compliance of the platform induces a maximum response in flexible degrees of freedom 11 conclusions triceratops being highly advantageous for ultra deepwater applications has been analyzed numerically under ice covered sea states in this study crushing failure of ice is considered with different ice parameters for investigation ice load time history is obtained from the ice force spectrum developed for crushing ice failure on vertical structures numerical analysis is carried out under different ice sea states of varying ice crushing strength and thickness it is seen that the maximum ice load occurs when a load acts on two buoyant legs simultaneously ice load acting on buoyant legs induces a response in all degrees of freedom surge response of the deck and buoyant legs are found out to be periodic with the shift in their mean position though heave response increases with the severity of the environment it is lesser in comparison to that of the surge confirming its suitability in ultra deepwater the response of the deck in roll and pitch degrees of freedom are insignificant highlighting the advantage of the presence of ball joints while yaw response of the buoyant legs increases steadily with time deck response in yaw motion is found to be periodic the response of the deck is lesser in the ice velocity ranging from 0 20 to 0 25 m s limit ice load increases linearly with the increase in ice thickness and ice crushing strength however an increase in deck response in active degrees of freedom is non linear increase in the total response is maximum when the ice thickness is increased from 0 50 m to 0 75 m a higher increase in response is observed for the increase in crushing strength from 2 0 to 2 5 mpa by comparing the response of triceratops under ice loads with that of the wave loads it is observed that the presence of ice loads causes a shift in the mean position of response in all degrees of freedom response behavior of triceratops under ice infested sea loads poses an advantage of this compliant geometry as no transfer of rotational response from buoyant leg to the deck is enabled also the lock in ice load condition does not cause significant amplification of response in the deck and buoyant legs of triceratops due to damping present in the structure which further enhances the suitability of the conceived geometry in ice covered regions 
22853,increase in drilling operations in the arctic region intuits to examine the suitability of platforms under ice loads this paper examines the dynamic response of triceratops under continuous ice crushing effect of ice loads on one and adjacent buoyant legs are examined under different ice velocity crushing strength and ice thickness based on the numerical investigations carried out it is seen that the response of deck in active degrees of freedom is nonlinear showing higher response with the increase in ice crushing strength ice loads cause a shift in the mean response limit ice load acting on the buoyant legs increases with the increase in the ice thickness with the increase in ice crushing strength set down increases along with the increase in the mean value of surge mean and total yaw response also increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength increased deck response under ice loads is due to transfer of translational response from buoyant legs to deck by ball joints however pitch response of the deck is lesser than that of buoyant legs verifying the restraint offered by ball joints to transfer rotation it may be an added advantage of triceratops under ice infested sea loads though this may not be the only sufficient requirement certainly no transfer of rotational response from buoyant leg to the deck enables a comfortable working environment from the analysis of triceratops under lock in ice condition it is found that the response of the deck and buoyant legs is bounded and the resonance build up is not seen in any degrees of freedom due to damping present in the structure which is an additional advantage of a triceratops 1 introduction in the recent past there is a significant increase in oil drilling in the arctic region and other ice infested waters in ultra deepwater condition in addition to the hindrance caused to normal operations ice sheets also induce dynamic effects oil and gas exploration in the arctic and temperate regions pose design challenges due to cold environmental conditions offshore platforms commissioned in ice infested water need to be assessed for the hindrance caused by ice sheet to their operability in addition to the nature of random and cyclic characteristics of ice loads that impose dynamic effects shih 1991 ice structure interaction developed by matlock et al 1971 modeled offshore structure as a mass spring dashpot system which became the fore runner for several other futuristic models developed by field data see for example maattanen s model sodhi s model and riska s model moving ice undergoes different failure modes during ice structure interaction resulting in bending crushing shear and buckling while failure mechanism depends on the geometric shape of the structure at the water level ice crushing failure tends to cause a maximum force on vertical structures sanderson 1988 during crushing failure different characteristic forms of dynamic behavior were observed in vertical fixed and slender structures and it primarily depends upon the ice velocity continuous crushing is one of the crushing modes that causes random vibration under high ice velocity an analytical model representing the ice crushing phenomenon cannot be developed using the theory of failure mechanics due to its limitations yue et al 2009 kärnä et al 2007 developed a spectral model to identify these forces which can be applied to both narrow and wide structures kärnä et al 2007 this model however oversights the feedback effect for moderate to high ice velocities improved model presented analytical ice mechanics by incorporating ice deformation yu et al 2016 a special case of intermittent ice crushing is called lock in condition where the ice load frequency matches with that of the structure at intermediate ice velocities this behavior had resulted in highly amplified responses in several offshore structures jefferies 1988 the numerical investigations on the compliant cylindrical structures also predicted higher dynamic amplification of the force at an ice force frequency equal to the natural frequency of the structure ziemer and evers 2016 the study on the dynamic model based on a physical mechanism combining forced vibration and self excited vibration also observed lock in phenomenon during ice induced vibration ji and oterkus 2016 despite the number of studies on the lock in ice condition the actual mechanism and influencing ice parameters behind lock in case has not been deciphered mccoy et al 2014 offshore triceratops is the recent addition to the set of compliant offshore platforms for ultra deepwater drilling chandrasekaran and madhuri 2015 chandrasekaran and nagavinothini 2017 triceratops shown in fig 1 consists of a deck connected to three buoyant legs by ball joints ball joints play a crucial role in extending these platforms to ultra deep waters even under extreme sea state ball joints restrain transformation of rotational degrees of freedom between the deck and buoyant legs it helps in reducing deck response in adverse environmental conditions under the combined action of wind wave and current buoyant legs are position restrained by a set of taut moored tethers which restrain the excessive rotational motion in the buoyant legs under the action of environmental loads orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shells comprising the buoyant legs resist axial force and bending moment under lateral pressure topside is designed as an integrated deck system to withstand heavy payloads recent studies confirmed the advantageous response of triceratops under the coupled action of wind and waves in extreme sea state chandrasekaran and nagavinothini 2018 a significant increase in the tether tension is observed in the stiffened triceratops which are the modified form of a triceratops with stiffened buoyant legs chandrasekaran and mayank 2017 as the offshore industry is heading towards ice infested regions with greater water depths the present study examines the adequacy of the platform for ice covered regions its dynamic response behavior the present study aims to investigate the ice induced response of triceratops ice loading time history is developed from the ice force spectrum for continuous crushing time domain analysis is then carried using ansys aqwa to investigate the suitability of the platform under ice crushing for different ice sea states the effect of ice thickness ice velocity and ice crushing strength on the response of triceratops is also investigated in detail as lock in ice condition amplifies the response of the structure numerical studies are also carried out to assess the response of triceratops under frequency lock in this study focusses only on the response of deck and buoyant legs of triceratops and the effect of ice load on tether tension variation and reliability of ball joints are excluded from the present study for future work 2 preliminary design in this study the triceratops model is developed based on the dimensions of perdido spar the buoyancy of the spar platform is distributed to three buoyant legs of triceratops while maintaining the same height and topside weight of the spar platform the diameter and height of the buoyant legs are 15 m and 174 24 m respectively the total topside weight is about 97400 kn and the shape of the deck is an equilateral triangle of side length 95 m the topside of the platform is designed with three deck levels as an integrated truss deck system the main deck flooring is designed as truss type connection and the cellar and top deck floorings are designed as beam panel arrangement in order to resist the wind load transverse tubular members stiffened with diagonal members are provided to connect the different floor levels the buoyant legs are designed as orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shells with ring frames and stiffeners each buoyant leg structure is provided with 70 stringers designed as flat bars of 300 40 mm and spaced at 3 m c c the environmental condition for which the buoyant leg is designed for is an intermediate environmental condition in the gulf of mexico with 7 9 m wave height and 9 1 s peak period the cylindrical shell is designed and checked for different types of buckling as per dnv rp c202 veritas 2010 this empirical method is taken for the preliminary design of the buoyant legs however for the detailed design stage finite element analysis is required the design details of triceratops are given in table 1 3 ice force spectrum ice drifting occurs due to several environmental factors such as wave wind or current which highly depends upon the location in offshore engineering it is commonly assumed that the ice loads are influenced highly by limit stress due to the availability of sufficient energy to cause ice failure thus it can be said that the ice force is the force required to cause ice failure in the vicinity of the structure the important factor that limits the maximum ice load acting on the structure is the ice failure mechanism which in turn depends upon the several factors such as ice velocity width and shape of the structure failure may occur by crushing splitting bending buckling and a combination of modes chandrasekaran 2017a b several researchers reported that the crushing failure of ice tends to cause maximum ice force on the offshore structures yue et al 2009 crushing ice failure occurs when a thick sheet of ice with moderate to high ice velocity impinges against a vertical sided structure the total ice force applied on the structure under crushing failure is a function of ice strength in crushing when ice interacts with compliant structure the failure modes are ductile and brittle at low and high rates of indentation respectively continuous brittle crushing at high indentation rate results in non simultaneous partial contact and non uniform pressure over the nominal contact area the ice force time history may either have constant amplitude periodic waveforms or with randomly distributed periods and amplitudes under very high ice velocity ice force can be designated as a stochastic process in such cases the ice forces can be described using a frequency spectrum as the transition between the different modes of failure under crushing is not completely known the uncoupled time dependant ice load can be used in the dynamic analysis of the structures i limit force for ice crushing the mechanical properties of sea ice are highly affected by the temperature as sea ice exist very close to their melting temperature and the presence of brine several expressions have been developed for the strength of ice form the strain rate and porosity for both crushing and flexural failure of ice ice crushing force can be obtained by multiplying the crushing pressure and the contact area the effective ice pressure depends upon the aspect ratio confinement within the ice sheet scale and degree of contact between the ice and structure sodhi and haehnel 2003 in this study the limit ice load is calculated from the korzhavin equation reddy and swamidas 2013 for ice crushing against the vertical structure it is given by f a 1 a 2 a 3 h w σ c where a1 is the shape factor 0 9 for circular members a2 is the contact factor 0 5 for moving ice a3 is the aspect ratio factor σ c is the crushing strength of ice in mpa h is the thickness of ice in m and w is the projected width of the structure in m the crushing strength of ice mainly depends upon temperature the maximum ice crushing strength in the coldest time of the year as recorded in beaufort sea is 3 mpa which can be considered as an extreme value mccoy et al 2014 under spring conditions with the temperature close to the melting point the ice crushing strength is 1 5 mpa though korzhavin s equation is one of the initial approaches it is still in use today with modification factors the local thickening of ice is taken into consideration by contact factor a2 however it should be noted that the local thickening occurs only under stationary ice load with prolonged contact periods thus the contact factor is chosen as 0 5 for moving ice the previous studies also reported that the limit force obtained from korzhavin s equation is comparable with the empirical relations derived for prediction of limit ice force at lower ice thickness but the questions exists with the applicability of other empirical formulations for prediction of ice force in compliant multi legged offshore structures thus the most initial approach from korzhavin s equation has been used in this study mccoy et al 2014 ii continuous crushing spectral model though there are several ice failure modes the crushing failure causes the maximum force in level ice action yue et al 2009 2009 continuous ice crushing occurs under high ice speed when the drifting ice interacts with the structure the horizontal crack will occur at the edge of the ice sheet then flaking divides the ice sheet into several layers a portion of the ice sheet will pile up and slide around the ice surface due to crushing and pulverization under brittle crushing the ice crushing strength will not influence the response as the crushing strength becomes constant under such conditions the feedback mechanism induced by the compliant structure shall become negligible which makes the spectral model adopted in the present study more feasible a spectral model for ice speed ranging from 0 04 m s to 0 35 m s used in the current study is given below karna et al 2007 the non dimensional spectral density function is given by g n f a f 1 k s a 1 5 f 2 where a b v 0 6 v is the ice velocity in m s b and ks are the experimental parameters and f is the frequency in hertz now the spectral density function is given by g n f σ n 2 g n f f where σ n 2 is the variance of the local force the mean ice force and standard deviation are calculated from the following set of equations σ n i n 1 k i n f n m a x f n m e a n f n m a x 1 k i n where in is an intensity parameter it varies from 0 2 to 0 5 k is the selected probability of exceedance fmean is the mean ice force and fmax is the maximum ice force spectral density plot developed from the above set of equations for ice thickness of 1 5 m and 1 5 mpa ice crushing strength is shown in fig 2 it is also seen that the peak of the spectrum varies according to the ice velocity the maximum energy is found at the lower frequencies and the variation in the spectrum due to the ice velocity is found at the frequencies below 0 3 hz thus it can be predicted that the effect of the ice velocity on time varying component on the ice force is very less and the factor that dominates the response of the structure is the mean force also several factors have to be considered in determining the ice loads on the multi legged structures evers and wessels 1986 it includes the interference and shielding effects between the legs jamming of ice between legs that depends upon the arrangement of legs and the clear spacing between the legs for the three legged structure the maximum load occurs when the ice approaches the two legs directly the maximum total load is the twice the maximum load on one leg in the case of triceratops the forces on each leg will normally act independently due to the presence of ball joints though the force model is developed to obtain the response of bottom supported structures the same shall apply to compliant platforms with large displacement it is because large displacements increase mooring stiffness due to rigidity in the vertical plane and hence behave similarly to that of bottom supported platforms as the ice spectrum model is developed based on the real time data collected from offshore structures the model automatically accounts for the formation of ice prows and ice rubble mounds during ice structure interaction the variation in the peak of the spectrum is also observed under the change in the maximum ice force acting on the structure as shown in fig 3 for 0 2 m s ice velocity the ice force time series is then developed from the spectrum for different ice load cases using inverse fourier transform the sampling frequency is taken as 20 hz the coherence function is then evaluated the total ice force is given by the sum of mean ice force and the time varying ice force the spectral density function of the total force is then given by g f t f c μ k s t g f f f c μ k s where c is used for the consideration of the angle of incidence of the local forces and s is used to consider the local shear forces by obtaining the standard deviation and the maximum peak value form the above equation the external global pressure acting on the structure can be found out the ice load time history obtained for 0 5 m ice thickness 1 5 mpa ice crushing strength and 0 2 m s ice velocity is shown in fig 4 the ice load time history for 2000 s is used for different ice load cases for the numerical analysis 4 numerical modeling and free oscillation studies in order to overcome the difficulties that arise in modeling and simulation of the offshore triceratops with six degrees of freedom the numerical model is developed using ansys aqwa three dimensional radiation theory or diffraction theory is used by this solver to simulate the linearized hydrodynamic fluid wave loading in time domain simulation the real time motion of a floating body at each time step is simulated by integrating the accelerations in the time domain by predictor corrector numerical integration scheme the buoyant legs are modeled as tube elements denoted as morison elements for which the fluid force is calculated using morison s equation the meshing of the deck is done by three dimensional panel method and it is carried out with triangular and quadrilateral panels the initial hydrostatic analysis on the free floating triceratops showed that the metacentric height of the platform lies above the centre of gravity the taut moored tethers which connect the buoyant legs to the sea floor are modeled as linear cables the initial pretension on the tethers is assigned through the stiffness and the unstretched length of the tether the numerical model of the platform is shown in fig 5 a then the dynamic analysis is carried out by solving the following equation by convolution integration technique m m a x t c x t k x t f t where x t x t x t and f t are acceleration velocity displacement and force vectors m is the structural mass matrix m a is the added mass matrix c is the damping matrix and k is the stiffness matrix after the completion of modeling of an entire triceratops with tethers the free oscillation studies are carried out in order to find out the natural period of the platform in six degrees of freedom by giving disturbing external forces logarithmic decrement method is then used to find the damping ratio from the results it is observed that the triceratops are highly compliant in the surge and sway degrees of freedom the natural frequency and damping ratio of the triceratops in six degrees of freedom are given in table 2 the psd plot of the free decay response in surge and pitch degrees of freedom are shown in fig 5 b 5 dynamic response analysis under ice forces from continuous crushing the ice force time history is obtained from the spectral model for continuous ice crushing two load cases for ice infested water is taken initially to assess the response of the triceratops under ice action the details of the sea states considered are given in table 3 the ice velocity is maintained constant for both the sea states the sea states are classified based on the ice thickness and the ice crushing strength which affects the total ice force acting on the structure the maximum ice load is calculated from korzhavin s equation the ice load time history is generated from the spectral model by using matlab the external force acting on the structure can be given as an input in ansys aqwa in xft file format however the external force will act only on the centre of gravity of the structure the centre of gravity of the buoyant legs is far below the still water level since the ice load will act at the still water level of the structure the input is given as a moment about the y axis initially the ice force is applied only on one buoyant leg as shown in fig 6 a due to the hindrance effect the crushed ice moving past the buoyant leg 3 will not have any effect on the other two buoyant legs under crushing ice failure conditions considered in the present study the size of the ice sheet is much larger than the spacing of legs of the platform this will result in a broken path of moving ice sheet as the thickness is lesser in comparison to its size as a result the trailing leg will attract comparatively very less force from ice motion hence it is not considered in the numerical analysis in multi legged structures like a triceratops the maximum ice load will occur when two buoyant legs are loaded simultaneously then the dynamic analysis is carried out by applying the ice force on two buoyant legs as shown in fig 6b the response of the triceratops under both the cases are compared it is true that the phase difference should be taken into account for the dynamic analysis of multi legged structures larger compliancy in horizontal plane causes self induced motion before the platform attains the recentering position under such oscillating conditions phase difference imposed by the geometric positioning of buoyant legs results in counteracting the encountered ice loads to a larger extent as a result deck receives lesser impact since the forces are determined independently there is no need to reduce the forces further to consider the non simultaneous ice failure of individual legs the response of triceratops under normal and extreme ice sea state is studied in all degrees of freedom under the action of ice force in the surge direction the response of the deck and the buoyant legs in sway roll and yaw degrees of freedom are found out to be negligible the response of the deck and the buoyant legs in the surge heave and pitch degrees of freedom under normal ice sea state is shown in fig 7 respectively the surge response of the deck is periodic oscillating at a mean position of 2 3465 m the drift in the surge degree of freedom is observed in the deck buoyant legs 2 3 the drift in the buoyant leg 3 is observed in the negative x axis the heave response on the buoyant leg is lesser than that of the deck the increased deck response is due to the transfer of the response from the buoyant legs to the deck by ball joints also the pitch of the deck is very low compared to that of the buoyant legs as the ball joints restrain the transfer of the rotational degree of freedom the maximum pitch response is observed in the buoyant leg 3 on which the ice load acts an increase in the response in surge heave and pitch degrees of freedom is observed under extreme ice sea state condition the statistics of response on all degrees of freedom is given in table 4 it is seen that the platform drifts in the surge degree of freedom with the mean shift under the increase in the ice load the maximum surge response in the extreme sea state is only about 9 80 of the total draft of the structure from the normal to extreme sea state the rms value increases by 3 916 times 16 217 times and 16 719 times in surge heave and pitch degrees of freedom respectively the mean shifts in the negative z direction from normal to extreme sea state however the maximum heave response is only about 13 80 of that of the surge response the power spectral density plots of the deck and buoyant legs responses in the surge heave and pitch degrees of freedom are shown in fig 8 in surge and heave degrees of freedom the peak in deck response occurs at a frequency of 0 235 rad s in surge degree of freedom the first peak occurs at a frequency of about 0 0282 rad s which is equal to the surge natural frequency it shows that the buoyant legs are excited at the natural surge frequency the second peak occurs at a frequency of 0 1225 rad s in surge degree this frequency content is found to be prominent in all degrees of freedom in buoyant leg 3 on which the ice load acts this frequency occurs in the neighborhood of 4 times of natural surge frequency at the same frequency the deck shows a higher peak in heave degree in pitch degree of freedom prominent frequency peaks occur only on the buoyant legs the deck response is very low compared to that of the buoyant legs response in pitch degree which shows the effect of the ball joint in restraining the rotational degrees of freedom when the ice force is applied on two buoyant legs a significant response in all degrees of freedom are observed in the deck and buoyant legs the response is periodic fluctuating about the mean position the response under normal ice sea state in different degrees of freedom are shown in fig 9 the surge response shows that the ball joints transfer the surge response from the buoyant legs to the deck comparing the surge response with the ice load in one buoyant leg the drift in the deck and the far end buoyant leg occurs in the positive x direction the ice load causes the drift in the negative x direction on the buoyant leg on which it acts as seen from the sway response time history the sway response of the deck is lesser than the surge response though significant sway response is observed in the buoyant legs the lesser response is observed in the deck the mean oscillating position of buoyant leg 3 lies on the positive side and the mean of the other two buoyant legs lies on the negative side it reduces the mean shift of the deck in sway degree of freedom the heave response of the deck very low which shows the operational advantage of the triceratops the heave response in the buoyant legs2 3 are less the increase heave response in the deck also shows that the heave response from the buoyant legs is transferred to the deck a shift in the mean position of the deck in the heave direction is also observed which in turn increases the tether tension when comparing the heave response with that of the heave response with ice load on one buoyant leg it can be observed that the deck and buoyant legs with ice load drift in the negative z direction causing set down in the platform the maximum response in the roll degree of freedom is observed in the buoyant leg 3 but the roll response of the deck is very low as they are restrained by the buoyant legs as seen from the pitch response time history the pitch response of the deck is remarkably low compared to that of the buoyant legs the larger response of the deck in the rotational degrees of freedom will hinder the normal operation of the crew on the topside the lesser response of deck as observed in the triceratops is mainly attributed to the unique character of the ball joints it makes the platform more advantageous compared to other common compliant platforms in the offshore industry while comparing it with the response of the platform with ice load on one buoyant leg the magnitude of pitch response in the deck and buoyant legs is slightly higher the yaw response of the deck is periodic different from the response of the buoyant legs the platform shows higher yaw response due to the displacement of the deck and buoyant legs in the surge and sway degrees of freedom simultaneously as seen from the yaw response time history the yaw response in all the buoyant legs increases in an anticlockwise direction with time however a periodic response fluctuating about the mean position is seen in the deck response in yaw degree of freedom it shows that the buoyant legs absorb the continuous yaw in the buoyant legs from transferring to the deck when ice load acts on one buoyant leg the response in all active degrees of freedom is found out be minimum at simulation time between 600 s and 1200 s however the same pattern is not observed when ice load acts on two buoyant legs in the second case where the ice load acts on two buoyant legs a beating phenomenon is observed in the response of the deck and buoyant legs thus it is evident that all degrees of freedoms are excited when the ice load acts on two buoyant legs the statistics of deck response in all degrees of freedom is given in table 4 a shift in the mean position is observed in degrees of freedom from normal to extreme ice sea state there is an increase in the response of the deck in all degrees of freedom with the increase in the ice forces which is evident from the increase in the standard deviation values the rms value increases by about 3 95 times from normal to extreme sea state in surge degree of freedom which shows the effect of increased ice force on the buoyant legs the maximum surge response in extreme sea state is only about 9 66 of the draft of the structure under extreme sea state condition a complete shift of the deck from its mean position is observed in surge roll and yaw degrees of freedom the minimum response being zero comparatively the heave response of the deck is very low an increased yaw response of the deck can be seen in the extreme ice sea state condition while comparing the deck response under the ice load action one buoyant leg with that of the load case where ice load acts on two buoyant legs a slight difference in the surge and heave degrees of freedom is observed under both normal and extreme ice sea state conditions however an abrupt increase in response in the sway roll and yaw degrees of freedom is observed in contrast the pitch response in the deck decreases when ice load acts on two buoyant legs the coupling between different degrees of freedom and the presence of ball joints affects the response of the deck and buoyant legs in all degrees of freedom making them undergo random vibration at different mean position and magnitude ice load action induces surge and pitch responses in the buoyant leg on which it acts it also invokes heave response in the buoyant leg due to the coupling between the surge and heave degrees of freedom in compliant platforms like a triceratops thus the ice load action causes a major difference in the response of the buoyant legs also the translational motion is transferred from the buoyant leg to the deck by ball joints which in turn transfers it to other buoyant legs so the response of the deck and buoyant legs are affected by each other due to the presence of the ball joints the power spectral density plots of deck and buoyant legs responses in all degrees of freedom are shown in fig 10 in surge degree of freedom the first peak occurs at a frequency of 0 028 rad s which is equal to the surge natural frequency the first peak is dominant in buoyant leg 1 the second peak occurs at a frequency of 0 123 rad s and it occurs only in the buoyant legs the third peak occurs at a frequency of 0 235 rad s in the neighborhood 1 4th of natural pitch frequency it is highly dominant in the deck response the peaks occur only at a lower frequency range where the ice force is dominant in sway response dominant peaks are observed at 0 028 rad s 0 123 rad s and 0 226 rad s the third peak is dominant in the deck and the first peaks occur at the buoyant legs unlike surge and sway responses the heave response shows only two peaks at the frequencies 0 123 rad s and 0 226 rad s the third frequency is also observed in the surge response in all the translational degrees of freedom the maximum value is observed only in the deck response which is due to the transfer of the response from the buoyant legs to the deck the maximum response in the roll degree of freedom is observed in the buoyant legs the deck response in the pitch degree of freedom is very low compared to that of the buoyant legs which again shows the efficiency of the ball joints in restraining the rotational degrees of freedom from the buoyant legs to the deck in yaw response only one peak is observed at a frequency of 0 028 rad s in the deck this shows that the natural surge frequency affects the response of the platform in the horizontal plane the dominant frequency in the vertical plane is 0 226 rad s the compliant degrees of freedom of the platform is highly affected by the action of ice forces other degrees of freedom are also activated due to the action of ice loads in two buoyant legs 6 effect of ice velocity as a significant response is observed in all degrees of freedom when ice load acts on two buoyant legs the analysis is carried out under this condition henceforth to find the effect of ice velocity on the structure the presented spectral model is valid in the ice velocity range of 0 04 m s and 0 35 m s hence the ice velocity is varied from 0 05 m s to 0 3 m s with the interval of 0 05 m s the ice thickness is taken as 0 5 m with ice crushing strength of 1 5 mpa which comes under normal ice sea state the statistics of deck response under varying velocities are given in table 5 the maximum and mean surge response of the deck decreases with the increase in the ice velocity up to 0 20 m s and then starts increasing the minimum surge response occurs at ice velocity of 0 20 m s only a slight variation in the rms value of surge response is observed under different ice velocities unlike surge response the sway response does not show any linear variation with the increase in the ice velocities the maximum sway response is observed at the lowest ice velocity of 0 05 m s the mean heave and roll response of the deck decreases with the increase in ice velocity up to 0 25 m s and then increases the maximum pitch response occurs at higher ice velocity of 0 30 m s the maximum yaw response occurs at the lowest ice velocity of 0 05 m s thus it can be seen that the ice force acting along the positive x direction leads to maximum surge heave and pitch responses at high ice velocities the sway roll and yaw responses are activated at lower ice velocities the total response of the deck in different degrees of freedom is shown in fig 11 the total response in the surge pitch and yaw degrees of freedom is minimum at an ice velocity of 0 2 m s the minimum total response in sway heave and roll degrees of freedom is observed at ice velocity of 0 25 m s the total response decreases gradually from 0 05 m s to 0 25 m s but the increase in response from 0 25 m s to 0 30 m s is very high there is only a slight change in the power spectral density plots of deck response in different degrees of freedom however a significant change in the power spectral density plots is observed in the response of the buoyant legs as shown in fig 12 the response under different ice velocities is compared prominent peaks occur at frequencies of 0 0283 rad s 0 1225 rad s and 0 2262 rad s in the surge response of the buoyant leg at natural surge frequency the maximum peak occurs at ice velocity of 0 25 m s at a frequency of 0 1225 rad s the maximum and minimum peaks occur at ice velocity of 0 30 m s and 0 10 m s respectively at the third peak maximum and minimum responses are observed at ice velocities of 0 30 m s and 0 25 m s respectively the same behavior is observed at the sway response the magnitude being comparatively smaller than the surge response the heave roll and pitch responses are found to be maximum at a frequency of 0 2262 rad s the maximum and minimum at 0 30 m s and 0 25 m s ice velocities respectively as the response of the buoyant leg in the yaw degree of freedom is not periodic the psd plot is also found out to be maximum at the low frequency of about 0 009 rad s and then decreases there are no significant peaks observed in the yaw response the surge and sway responses are maximum at a frequency of about 0 1225 rad s while the heave roll and pitch degrees of freedom are maximum at a frequency of 0 2262 rad s however at natural surge frequency only the surge and sway responses are observed in the buoyant legs thus it shows the dominance of natural pitch frequency of the buoyant leg in all degrees of freedom 7 effect of ice thickness the limit ice load acting on the buoyant legs increases with the increase in the ice thickness the thickness of level ice is site specific and it highly depends upon the sea ice salinity and temperature the maximum thickness of level ice in the arctic region is 1 m and the minimum ice thickness for crushing failure of ice is 0 2 m reddy and swamidas 2013 sodhi and haehnel 2003 hence the ice thickness is varied from 0 2 m to 1 m the increase in the limit ice load as obtained from korzhavin s equation varies linearly with the increase in the ice thickness for ice crushing strength of 1 5 mpa and ice velocity of 0 2 m s as shown in fig 13 the response of the triceratops for normal ice sea state is studied for ice thickness 0 25 m 0 50 m 0 75 m and 1 00 m the statistics of the deck response under different ice thicknesses are given in table 6 it can be seen that the surge response increases with the increase in the ice thickness the same pattern is observed in all other degrees of freedom with the increase in the ice thickness the rms value of surge response increases by 2 080 1 57 and 1 324 times at successive steps in the same way the maximum surge response increases by about 45 33 34 25 and 23 88 at successive increase of ice thickness the drift in the surge direction also increases with the increase in the ice thickness the percentage increase of the maximum sway response is higher than that of the surge response but the maximum sway response for 1 00 m ice thickness is only about 12 66 of that of surge response the rms value in heave response increased by about 4 23 2 67 and 1 59 times with the increase in the ice thickness the set down in the platform increases with the increase in the ice thickness in roll and pitch degree of freedom the maximum response increases with the increase in the ice thickness however the total roll and pitch responses observed at higher ice thickness is only about 1 804 and 1 114 respectively the maximum yaw response under higher ice thickness is found out to be 13 672 with the incccraaase in the ice thickness the rms value in yaw degrees of freedom increases by 2 08 1 647 and 1 37 times the increase in the total response in all degrees of freedom with the increase in the ice thickness is shown in fig 14 a significant increase in the response is also found in the buoyant legs the power spectral densities of the deck response in different degrees of freedom are shown in fig 15 significant peaks are observed at frequencies of 0 028 rad s and 0 226 rad s in the surge degree of freedom the magnitude of density increased at the second peak with the increase in ice thickness however the maximum density occurs at an ice thickness of 0 75 m in sway response the peaks occur only at a single frequency of about 0 226 rad s with increasing density with the increase in the ice thickness the response in the heave roll and pitch degrees of freedoms shows prominent peaks at frequencies of 0 1225 rad s and 0 226 rad s in all degrees of freedom the density increases with the increase in ice thickness a significant difference in the peak values has been observed in all degrees of freedom when the ice thickness is increased beyond 0 5 m the yaw response of the deck is found out to be similar to that of the surge response the response of the buoyant legs is also found out to be increasing with the increase in the ice thickness 8 effect of ice crushing strength the limit ice load increases with the ice crushing strength as shown in fig 16 the limit ice load values are obtained from korzhavin s equation the response of the triceratops is studied for ice crushing strength varied from 1 5 mpa to 3 00 mpa with an increment of 0 50 mpa for normal ice sea state the statistics of the deck response in different degrees of freedom under varying ice crushing strength is given in table 7 as the ice load increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength the response in the buoyant legs and the deck also increases it can be seen that the response of the deck in all degrees of freedom increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength from the statistics the maximum surge response increases by about 14 14 37 72 and 2 7 with the ice crushing strength from 1 5 mpa to 3 00 mpa the surge response increases rapidly beyond the ice crushing strength of 2 00 mpa where the rms value increases by 1 28 times the increase in the maximum surge response from 2 50 mpa to 3 00 mpa is less comparatively where the rms value increase by 1 19 times the shift in the mean value of the surge response also increases with the increase in the ice strength as observed in the previous load cases the sway response of the deck is comparatively lower than that of the surge response initially the rms value decreases with the increase in the ice crushing strength by 0 835 times and then increases by 1 95 and 1 42 times at successive increments the set down effect in the heave degree increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength the rms value increases by about 1 58 1 76 and 1 35 times with the increase in the ice crushing strength the total heave response at the maximum ice crushing strength is only about 7 of the total surge response the mean value of the roll and pitch responses are found out to be increasing in the positive and negative directions respectively the increase in the rms value of the pitch response is 1 70 1 71 and 1 38 times it is evident that the increase in the deck response beyond 2 5 mpa ice crushing strength is less compared to the responses observed under lower ice crushing strengths the yaw response in the deck shows a maximum value of 12 945 under extreme condition ice crushing strength 3 mpa the mean and the total yaw response also increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength with the increase in the rms value by 1 34 1 30 and 1 52 times that of the previous value at a successive increment of ice crushing strength the increase in the total response of the deck with the increase in the ice crushing strength is shown in fig 17 as seen from the response the total response in all degrees of freedom increases up to the ice crushing strength of 2 5 mpa and then decreases the maximum response is observed at ice crushing strength of 2 5 mpa and the increase in the response is maximum in the interval of 2 00 2 50 mpa the power spectral density plots of the deck response under varying ice crushing strengths are shown in fig 18 the power spectral density in deck surge response increases with the increase in the ice crushing strength significant peaks are observed at frequencies of about 0 028 rad s natural surge frequency and 0 226 rad s in the neighborhood of 1 4th of natural pitch frequency in sway response the peak is observed at 0 226 rad s the peak value increases rapidly beyond 2 00 mpa ice crushing strength whereas the variation in the peak value for ice crushing strengths 1 50 mpa and 2 00 mpa is found to be marginal in yaw response the peaks occur at the same frequencies as observed in the surge response the increase in the peak value is high between 2 00 mpa and 2 50 mpa the surge natural frequency is dominant in the surge sway and yaw responses in heave roll and pitch responses the peaks occur at frequencies of 0 122 rad s and 0 235 rad s the increase in the peak value follows the similar trend as that of response in other degrees of freedom the maximum response in all degrees of freedom is obtained for very high ice crushing strength 8 1 response under open water and ice covered loads the response of the triceratops in ice infested waters under extreme ice sea state condition ice thickness 0 5 m ice crushing strength 1 5 mpa and ice velocity 0 2 m s is compared with the response of the triceratops in open water condition under high sea state significant wave height 10 m zero crossing period 10 s for the representation of the wave energy distribution pierson moscowitz pm spectrum is used which is a two parameter spectrum suitable for open sea conditions neither fetch nor duration limited the ice load and wave load are applied in the positive x direction under open water load case the active degrees of freedom are found out to be a surge pitch and yaw the responses in other degrees of freedom are found out to be negligible however the ice covered load case induces a response in all degrees of freedom the response statistics on the surge heave and yaw degrees of freedom are given in table 8 in surge response the shift in the mean value is maximum in ice covered load case however the maximum response is observed under the open water load case in rms value in the ice covered load case is found out be higher than that of the open water load case it can be observed that the ice load on the buoyant legs shifts the mean oscillating position of the platform however the heave and pitch responses in both the cases are found out to be very low the total heave response of the platform is only about 0 97 and 3 96 of that of the surge response in open water load case and ice covered load case respectively the behavior of the platform under different load cases can be clearly understood from the surge response of the deck shown in fig 19 the response of deck under both the cases is periodic however the period of response is high in case of ice covered load case the power spectral density plots of the deck and buoyant leg 1 in surge degree of freedom is shown in fig 20 in the deck response the first peak occurs at the natural surge frequency where the response under open water load case is maximum the second peak occurs at1 4th of natural pitch frequency where the ice covered load case response of the deck is maximum in the response of the buoyant leg the peak at the natural surge frequency is maximum in case of ice covered load case 10 response of triceratops under lock in condition 10 1 lock in condition frequency lock in condition generally occurs at intermediate ice velocities where the structural frequency matches with the ice load frequency this behavior was experienced in many offshore structures and also resulted in a highly amplified response of the structure which is quite dangerous ice failure at a particular location in the contact zone causes a sudden increase in stress of adjacent ice leading to its failure this process continues and results in ice failure of the adjacent locations closer and closer together in time finally the continuous failure of ice gets synchronized and develops a lock in condition lock in can occur under a wide range of ice conditions however there must be a continuous motion of ice sheet during which ice is fairly homogeneous in the horizontal plane because the presence of cracks and thickness variation of the ice sheet will result in the mitigation of lock in behavior according to standard regulations the lock in condition analysis can be carried out using the ice load function developed based on the following conditions the period of the ice load time history should match the natural frequency of the structure the maximum ice force should be developed based on the ice parameters and the minimum ice force should be 0 6 times the maximum ice force mccoy et al 2014 in the present study the ice load time history for the frequency lock in condition is developed for periods equal to the surge and pitch natural periods of a triceratops analyses are carried out for both normal and extreme ice sea states with the ice load action on two buoyant legs simultaneously the ice load time history with a natural period equal to the natural surge period for normal ice sea state is shown in fig 21 10 2 response of triceratops under lock in condition with natural surge period the response of the deck and buoyant legs under normal ice state in lock in condition with natural surge period is shown in fig 22 the surge response in the deck and buoyant legs are found to be periodic the total surge response increases gradually till 2500 s and then starts decreasing till 3500 s from where the structure starts oscillating about the new position the deck oscillates around the mean position of 0 42 m the mean shift is observed in buoyant legs also and the maximum surge response is observed in buoyant leg 1 though buoyant legs show significant sway response the deck response in very less due to the mean shift of the buoyant legs in both the positive and negative axes unlike the surge response the deck sway response steadily increases up to 1500 s and then starts oscillating the heave response of the deck and buoyant legs are lesser than that of the surge response the ball joints effectively restrain the transfer of roll and pitch responses from the buoyant legs to the deck response builds up in roll and pitch degrees of freedom is also observed below 1000 s beyond which the system oscillates without sudden increases or decrease the deck shows significant yaw response which occurs due to the simultaneous surge and sway of the deck the lock in condition does not result in the amplification of the response in both deck and buoyant legs of triceratops due to the significant damping present in the system in different degrees of freedom which offsets the energy input from ice failure the statistics of deck response of triceratops under normal and extreme ice sea states in lock in condition is listed in table 9 the total response in all degrees of freedom increases from the normal to extreme ice sea state due to the increase in the limit ice forces it shows the importance of ice parameters even under the resonance condition the total deck response under extreme ice sea state is about 3 37 m the total heave response is about 2 of total surge response in extreme condition the ball joints reduced the pitch response of deck in both sea states from that of the buoyant legs however the total pitch response deck increases by about ten times form the normal to extreme ice sea state the psd plots of the deck response under normal and extreme ice sea states are shown in fig 23 the first peak in surge response occurs very close to surge natural frequency in both normal and extreme ice sea states as the lock in condition load function is developed with the natural surge period a significant peak at natural surge frequency is observed in all degrees of freedom the second peak in surge response occurs very close to one fourth of natural pitch frequency it shows the coupling between the surge and pitch degrees of freedom due to this coupling peaks are observed at one fourth of natural pitch frequency in all degrees of freedom the spectral energy is very high in extreme sea state compared to that of the normal sea state heave roll and pitch responses of the deck are very less prominent peaks are also observed at 0 114 rad s in addition to surge and pitch natural frequencies 10 3 response of triceratops under lock in condition with pitch natural period the response of the deck and buoyant legs under normal ice state in lock in condition with natural pitch period is shown in fig 24 the magnitude of response and the mean shift of deck and buoyant legs is comparatively lesser than the response under lock in with natural surge period in both normal and extreme sea state conditions however the reduced period of oscillation has resulted in a large number of cycles in the response of deck and buoyant legs in different degrees of freedom a steady decrease in the response is observed in surge degree of freedom however the deck sway response increases up to 3000 s with very less magnitude of amplification beyond the heave response of buoyant legs remains steady throughout the time history and the heave response of deck gradually decreases with time the response build up is not seen in the rotational degrees of freedom also the same behavior is observed in the extreme ice sea state condition however a comparatively larger rate of reduction in responses is observed in extreme sea state due to damping the statistics of deck response under different sea states are given in table 10 the total response and the mean shift increases from normal to extreme sea state in all degrees of freedom the psd plots of the deck response under normal and extreme ice sea states are shown in fig 25 as the ice load frequency matches with the natural pitch frequency of triceratops spectral peaks with maximum value are observed in the neighborhood of one fourth of natural pitch frequency in all degrees of freedom the spectral energy is found to be lesser than that of the responses under lock in ice condition with natural surge period due to coupling effect peaks are also observed at natural surge frequency the spectral energy is comparatively very high in the extreme ice sea state 10 4 response of triceratops under lock in condition with heave natural period the behavior of triceratops under lock in ice force with a period equal to heave natural period is found to be similar to that of the response obtained with natural pitch period the natural periods being very close to each other the statistics of the response in different sea states are given in table 11 the response increases from normal to extreme ice sea state the total response of deck and buoyant legs are slightly lesser than that of the response observed under lock in ice force with natural pitch period lock in condition is mitigated in triceratops in both stiff and flexible degrees of freedom and the compliance of the platform induces a maximum response in flexible degrees of freedom 11 conclusions triceratops being highly advantageous for ultra deepwater applications has been analyzed numerically under ice covered sea states in this study crushing failure of ice is considered with different ice parameters for investigation ice load time history is obtained from the ice force spectrum developed for crushing ice failure on vertical structures numerical analysis is carried out under different ice sea states of varying ice crushing strength and thickness it is seen that the maximum ice load occurs when a load acts on two buoyant legs simultaneously ice load acting on buoyant legs induces a response in all degrees of freedom surge response of the deck and buoyant legs are found out to be periodic with the shift in their mean position though heave response increases with the severity of the environment it is lesser in comparison to that of the surge confirming its suitability in ultra deepwater the response of the deck in roll and pitch degrees of freedom are insignificant highlighting the advantage of the presence of ball joints while yaw response of the buoyant legs increases steadily with time deck response in yaw motion is found to be periodic the response of the deck is lesser in the ice velocity ranging from 0 20 to 0 25 m s limit ice load increases linearly with the increase in ice thickness and ice crushing strength however an increase in deck response in active degrees of freedom is non linear increase in the total response is maximum when the ice thickness is increased from 0 50 m to 0 75 m a higher increase in response is observed for the increase in crushing strength from 2 0 to 2 5 mpa by comparing the response of triceratops under ice loads with that of the wave loads it is observed that the presence of ice loads causes a shift in the mean position of response in all degrees of freedom response behavior of triceratops under ice infested sea loads poses an advantage of this compliant geometry as no transfer of rotational response from buoyant leg to the deck is enabled also the lock in ice load condition does not cause significant amplification of response in the deck and buoyant legs of triceratops due to damping present in the structure which further enhances the suitability of the conceived geometry in ice covered regions

pneumatic breakwater two phase flow wave dissipating performance 1 introduction breakwaters are applied to reduce the intensity of wave action on the coastal structures in the past numerous types of breakwaters were used in the coastal area such as caisson breakwaters and rubble mound breakwaters however the cost of construction for these breakwaters is increased dramatically with the increasing water depth as an attractive alternative to the traditional breakwaters the pneumatic breakwater was proposed due to several advantages firstly the pneumatic breakwater is one kind of mobile breakwater with several specific advantages such as mobility temporality and low cost secondly the pneumatic barriers are easy to construct and they do not affect the maritime traffic moreover the additional circulation can improve the quality of the protected coastal areas to investigate the main mechanism of the pneumatic breakwaters many researches were conducted to improve the effectiveness of pneumatic breakwaters in damping waves including the theoretical studies and physical model tests evans 1955 attributed wave damping of pneumatic breakwaters to currents induced by ascending air

adopted the boundary element method to study the 3d bubble growth and detachment from a submerged nozzle under constant pressure conditions the numerical simulation of wave interaction with an aerial barrier is complicated zhang et al 2010 analyzed the wave dissipating performance of air bubble breakwaters with different layouts by numerical simulation and compared with experimental data paprota and sulisz 2017 derived a theoretical approach to investigate the interaction of regular waves with an air bubble curtain used as a pneumatic breakwater the previous researches are mainly focused on the performance of the pneumatic breakwaters in damping waves the aims of this study are to provide a more comprehensive information on the flow field around the aerial barriers and to optimize the parameters that will affect the wave dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwaters through numerical simulations in this study the numerical model of pneumatic breakwaters is validated by comparing with an existing experimental data paprota 2017 the current velocity field around the pneumatic breakwaters is analyzed and the waves passing through the aerial barrier is investigated in the time domain and frequency domain in addition the dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwater with double discharging pipes is also discussed to improve the efficiency of pneumatic breakwaters the current study is organized as follows section 2 presents the numerical model for analyzing the flow field around the pneumatic breakwaters and then the numerical model is validated by comparing with an existing physical model test paprota 2017 in section 3 after that the wave dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwater with different arrangements are discussed in section 4 finally some conclusions can be summarized 2 numerical method a numerical model is proposed to analyze the interaction between waves and air bubbles the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model is applied as a closure of the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations to calculate the flow field around the pneumatic breakwaters 2 1 the governing equations the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations devolder et al 2017 are adopted to calculate the flow field including the mass conservation equation eq 1 and the momentum equation eq 2 as follows continuity equation 1 u i x i 0 momentum

which the volume fraction function α is defined as the quantity of water per unit of volume in every cell the volume fraction function α is 0 for a completely dry cell and 1 for a wet cell if volume fraction function α for one cell is between 0 and 1 the cell is labeled as the interface between water and air the volume fraction is obtained by solving the following equation devolder et al 2017 9 α t u i α x i u c i α 1 α x i 0 the last term is an artificial compression term where u c i min c α u i max u i a default value of c α equal to 1 is adopted here while a larger value of c α will cause detrimental velocity gradients around the interface 2 4 numerical setup a two dimensional numerical wave tank with length of 20 m and depth of 0 5 m is adopted here and the water depth is 0 3 m the waves are generated from the inlet boundary and an active wave absorption technique higuera et al 2013 a and b is adopted to eliminate the reflected waves in the outlet boundary the aerial barrier is located 10 m away from the wave entrance i e the inlet boundary at the left side of wave tank a series of wave gauges were installed after and before the pneumatic breakwater to measure the wave elevation as is shown in fig 1 the finite volume method is applied to solve the incompressible navier stokes equations numerically in openfoam and the pressure implicit split operator piso is used to couple the pressure and velocity the euler scheme is adopted for the temporal terms and the gauss linear scheme is chosen for the gradient and laplacian terms the density and kinematic viscosity coefficient of the water are set as 1000 kg m 3 and 1 0 10 6 m2 s respectively the openfoam mesh generator blockmesh is adopted to generate the mesh as shown in fig 2 five mesh arrangements are presented in table 1 for investigating the mesh convergence the meshes around the pneumatic breakwaters and water surface are refined wave elevation is measured for comparison and the wave parameters are set as t 1 26 s and h 0 05 m i e t is the incident wave period and h is the incident wave height the wave elevations for no 1 3 meshes with different horizontal mesh sizes are presented in fig 3 indicating that the no 2 mesh with horizontal mesh size of l 280 is acceptable to simulate the waves the wave elevations for no 2 4 and 5 meshes with different vertical mesh sizes are shown in fig 4 the result indicates that the difference in wave elevation for no 2 4 and 5 meshes is small therefore the vertical mesh size is set to be h 12 in this study so the maximum mesh size of 0 69 cm is adopted along the water depth and the mesh size δ z close to the free surface is refined with the size of 0 33 cm in the stream wise direction the mesh size δ x from the inlet boundary to the aerial barrier is 0 75 cm and the mesh size δ x around the aerial barrier is refined with the minimum size of 0 23 cm which leads to a total mesh cell number equal to 0 72 million 3 model validation 3 1 bubble curtain in static water evans 1955 had indicated that the surface currents induced by ascending air bubble are the main reason for wave energy dissipation the vertical current generated by rising bubbles converted into the following and opposing near surface horizontal currents and the horizontal velocities of these currents have great influences on the performance of wave energy dissipation in this section the current velocity fields are analyzed and validated by comparing with the theoretical results the maximum horizontal current speed caused by the aerial breakwater which is calculated through the formulas provided by brevik and kristiansen 2002 in these no wave cases the parameters of the aerial barrier are modified by changing the airflow rates q 1 2 3 4 5 m 3 h fig 5 shows the current structure and the mean velocity field around the aerial barrier when the airflow rate q 5 m 3 h and x 0 m is the location of an aerial barrier it is obvious that the near surface current is directed away from the aerial barrier while the current in the close vicinity of the bottom is directed towards the curtain which leads to a water circulation behind the air curtain at about one third of the water depth distance from the free surface the vertical component of current velocity reaches its maximum then the vertical velocity rapidly decreases and finally breaks down into two opposite horizontal velocities when approaching the free surface more importantly the maximum horizontal velocity occurs near the free surface and about 0 3 m away from the aerial barrier owing to the symmetry of the current generated by ascending air bubbles the distance between the locations of the maximum horizontal velocities in front of and behind the aerial barrier d m a x is about 0 6 m in addition the horizontal velocities have little effect on wave dissipation when they decrease to 50 of the maximum horizontal velocity which means that the horizontal length d 0 of the influence range of the air curtain is considered to be 1 8 m furthermore fig 6 presents the variation of the horizontal mean flow velocities v m e a n generated by the air bubble curtain versus the water depth with different airflow rates q 1 2 3 4 5 m 3 h at which the maximum horizontal velocity has occurred in the calm water the results indicate that the absolute value of the horizontal velocity firstly increases with the increasing water depth in front of the pneumatic breakwater until reaches its maximum at the near surface area then its value starts to decrease with further increase of water depth the direction of horizontal flow velocity changes and the value of the horizontal velocity increases again and then gradually decreases to zero at the bottom more importantly the higher airflow rates generate a larger maximum horizontal velocity at the near surface area which would improve the damping performance of the pneumatic breakwater in general the horizontal velocity is zero at half water depth for different airflow rates according to brevik and kristiansen 2002 the theoretical maximum horizontal velocity u m a x was calculated by the following formula 10 u m a x 1 7 g q 0 b 1 3 1 h p 0 1 3 where h is the water depth q 0 is the volume of air per second at atmospheric pressure q 0 q 3600 p 0 is the atmosphere pressure with the unit of head of water and b is the width of the wave flume the theoretical maximum horizontal velocities of the air barrier induced currents calculated by applying eq 10 are 0 2788 m s and 0 4765 m s for the airflow rates 1 m 3 h and 5 m 3 h respectively on the other hand the maximum horizontal velocities calculated from the numerical simulation are 0 2809 m s for the lower airflow rate q 1 m 3 h and 0 5158 m s in the case of higher airflow rate q 5 m 3 h as shown in fig 6 the more detailed information about the maximum horizontal velocities is presented in table 2 the theoretical values of the maximum horizontal velocities are always lower than the numerical results which is due to the fact that the theoretical formulas deduction procedures are based on three dimensional large scale experiments which are different from the two dimensional numerical setup but the largest deviation between the numerical maximum horizontal velocities and the theoretical results is just 8 2 in general the numerical maximum horizontal velocity shows a good agreement with the theoretical results it indicates that the numerical simulation of air bubble curtain is reasonable 3 2 pneumatic breakwater in waves the interaction between the waves and the pneumatic breakwater is analyzed here to validate the numerical model by comparing with an existing physical model test paprota 2017 the basic wave parameters of the analyzed test cases in this section which are the same as the physical model tests conducted by paprota 2017 are summarized in table 3 the waves interact with the aerial barrier and the wave energy dissipation occurs around the pneumatic breakwater fig 7 shows the comparison of the measured time series of free surface elevation behind the aerial barrier in the case of the highest airflow rate in reference to the results in the absence of the aerial barrier the effect of the pneumatic breakwater on the waves is clearly visible based on the numerical simulation the wave reflection coefficient and the wave transmission coefficient could be calculated in order to evaluate the effectiveness of an aerial curtain used as a pneumatic breakwater by the formulas a 1 3 in the appendix the reflected wave heights are calculated by the two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 and in order to decrease the distraction of re reflected waves only a part of time histories are adopted to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients figs 8 and 9 present the comparisons of the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients versus different airflow rates between present numerical simulations and physical model tests figs 8 and 9 indicate that the performance of a pneumatic breakwater is closely related to wave periods and airflow rates the results confirm that the single aerial barrier has little effect on long period waves and a significant effect on short period waves furthermore wave damping properties of the pneumatic breakwater may be improved by increasing the airflow rates the reflection and transmission coefficients obtained from numerical simulation are compared with the experimental data from paprota 2017 and the agreement is good with the largest difference less than 5 it indicates that investigating the performance of pneumatic breakwater through numerical simulations is feasible 4 results and discussion 4 1 pneumatic breakwater with single air discharging pipe the incident wave propagates on the opposing current generated by ascending air bubbles and interacts with the air curtain as a result part of the wave energy is dissipated and only the remaining energy is transmitted to the downstream area based on the numerical simulations of these processes the time series of the free surface elevations and their corresponding spectrums are analyzed and then the factors that influence the wave dissipating capabilities of the pneumatic breakwater are studied in this section including different wave heights wave periods and airflow rates referring to paprota 2017 the wave parameters of the numerical simulations are presented in table 4 4 1 1 free surface elevation pneumatic breakwater with single air discharging pipe is simulated with different wave periods wave heights and airflow rates as shown in table 4 time histories of free surface elevation and the corresponding spectrums in front of and behind the aerial barrier compared with the results of the tests conducted without the air curtains are presented in figs 10 12 the results indicate that the pneumatic breakwater has a significant influence on damping the waves with short periods while the influences on long period waves are becoming weak the wave amplitude decreases behind the pneumatic breakwater and an apparent phase shift occurs because of the interactions between the incident waves and the currents generated by the aerial barrier furthermore some higher harmonic components are observed in the reflected waves and the transmitted waves due to nonlinear energy transfer and the wave profiles become irregular behind the aerial barrier in front of the air barrier the wave reflection is negligible and the wave amplitude of high frequency wave is relatively small but it tends to increase with the decrease of the wave periods as for the transmitted waves behind the aerial curtain the amplitude of the main peak in the spectrum decreases significantly and some high frequency waves appear however with the decrease of wave periods there is no evident sub peak in the spectrum and the strong nonlinearity appears on the transmitted waves it is worth mentioning that the experimental studies in paprota 2017 have also presented similar results 4 1 2 incident wave periods the quantitative effect of the wave periods on the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients is shown in fig 13 the results indicate that the performance of a pneumatic breakwater is closely related with the wave periods for longer incident waves w1 and w2 whose wave lengths are larger than the length d 0 1 8 m of the influence area of the aerial breakwater the aerial barrier has little effect on the propagating waves two reasons for the high transmission rate at long periods exist firstly the influence area of the aerial barrier is much smaller than the wave length of long period waves and thus the interaction between the incident waves and the aerial barrier is weak secondly the wave celerity for long period waves is obviously larger than the horizontal current velocities caused by the aerial breakwater therefore it is incompetent to reduce the wave energy of long period waves on the contrary for shorter incident waves whose wave lengths are smaller than the length of the influence area of an aerial barrier the transmission coefficients decrease significantly the decrease of the wave height of shorter waves w4 and w5 may reach even 50 75 in the case of the highest airflow rate compared to only 1 10 for longer waves w1 and w2 this means that the wave dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwater with an appropriate airflow rate is good for the short period incident waves 4 1 3 incident wave heights three different incident wave heights w5 w6 and w7 as shown in table 4 are analyzed to evaluate the influence of wave heights on the dissipating performance of the single pipe aerial breakwater fig 14 shows the variations of the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients with the increase of the airflow rate for different wave heights the results indicate that the smaller incident wave height leads to a smaller transmission coefficient the attenuation of wave height equal to 60 occurs in the case of w7 while only 50 in the case of w5 when the airflow rate is 5 m 3 h it confirms that the wave dissipating performance of a pneumatic breakwater is weakened when the wave heights become much higher 4 1 4 airflow rates the pneumatic breakwater performance is closely related with the efficiency of an air compressor in this section the different airflow rates are taken into consideration to analyze how the airflow rates affect the damping performance of the single pipe aerial breakwater fig 15 presents the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients at different wave periods for increasing airflow rates the results indicate that the reflection coefficient increases and the transmission coefficient decreases significantly with the increase of the airflow rates it is easy to identify that for no w5 waves the transmission coefficient is only about 0 3 when the airflow rate reaches to 5 m 3 h comparing to 0 7 in the case of the lowest airflow rate the results indicate that the wave damping properties of the pneumatic breakwater can be improved by increasing the airflow rate so while the other conditions of the pneumatic breakwater are constant it is an effective method to increase attenuation of transmitted waves by increasing airflow rates but in the case of a longer wave increasing airflow rates have almost no effect on wave damping and it is infeasible to improve the dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwater by increasing air bubble supply thus it is essential to take some other measures such as increasing the number of air discharging pipes to expand the influence area of aerial curtains for improving the damping performance of longer waves of pneumatic breakwater 4 2 pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes the single pipe aerial breakwater is incapable to damp long period waves in order to find a possible way to dissipate long period waves the performance of the double pipe aerial breakwater is analyzed in this section 4 2 1 arrangement of air discharging pipes the schematic diagram of the pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes is shown in fig 16 considering different spacing between two aerial barriers d s 0 4 m and d s 1 m and different airflow rates q t 1 2 3 4 5 m 3 h particularly the total airflow rates q t in the case of double air discharging pipes are equal to that in the case of single air discharging pipe the numerical wave tank is 24 m long 0 5 m high and the water depth is equal to 0 3 m analogously six wave gauges are applied to measure the free surface elevations around the pneumatic breakwater the same boundary conditions and discrete methods used in previous studies are adopted in the section regular waves of fixed wave period and wave height are generated according to table 4 4 2 2 pneumatic breakwater in static water the near surface horizontal current are the main mechanisms of wave dissipation for a pneumatic breakwater fig 17 shows the mean velocity field around the aerial barrier for different spacing d s 0 4 m and 1 m between two aerial barriers in the case of the highest airflow rate in static water the black arrows in fig 17 denote the locations of aerial barriers and the directions of corresponding bubble movements fig 17 a indicates that two vertical currents gradually move together until they merge into one vertical flow which then divides into two opposite horizontal currents near free surface for the spacing d s of 0 4 m the results indicate that the current velocity field and the pattern of circulation flow produced by ascending air bubbles from double air discharging pipes are similar to those of single air discharging pipe it can be inferred that pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes have similar effects on wave dissipating performance when the spacing d s is smaller than d m a x d m a x is the length between the locations of the maximum horizontal velocities in front of and behind the aerial barrier as shown in section3 1 when the spacing d s is larger than d m a x fig 17 b indicates that two opposite vortexes appear between two aerial barriers firstly the horizontal influence range of the aerial breakwater with double air discharging pipes is increased to 2 6 m which is significantly larger than the horizontal influence range 1 8 m of the aerial breakwater with single air discharging pipe it means that the aerial breakwater with double air discharging pipes may be more efficient in damping the long period incident waves comparing with the single aerial barrier secondly two opposite vortexes between the aerial barriers will enhance the dissipation of incident waves fig 18 shows the comparison of the horizontal current velocities between double and single air discharging pipes along the water depth for different spacing d s 0 4 m and 1 m fig 18 a indicates that the maximum horizontal flow velocity generated by two air bubble curtains for the spacing d s 0 4 m is almost the same as that of single air bubble curtain and fig 18 b indicates that when the spacing is 1 m the near surface horizontal flow velocity for double air discharging pipes is larger than that of the single air discharging pipe it means that the double pipe aerial breakwater may have similar effect on damping waves to the single pipe aerial breakwater in the case of small spacing however while the spacing d s is larger than d m a x two vortexes generate between two aerial barriers and the wave energy dissipation may be more efficient 4 2 3 pneumatic breakwater performance fig 19 shows the measured time histories of free surface elevation and the corresponding spectrums in front of and behind two aerial barriers comparing to the results in the absence of the aerial barrier and the spacing between two aerial barriers is 1 m a significant wave damping is observed for the aerial breakwater with double air discharging pipes the sub peak exists in the reflected wave spectrum and there is an obvious high frequency wave component for the reflected waves figs 20 and 21 present the comparison of the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients between single pipe and double pipe pneumatic breakwaters for short period waves w5 considering different pipe spacing d s 0 4 m and 1 m fig 20 indicates that reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients between single pipe and double pipe pneumatic breakwaters have little difference when the spacing d s is equal to 0 4 m it indicates that when the spacing d s between two aerial barriers is smaller than d m a x the length between the locations of the maximum horizontal current velocity before and after the aerial barrier there is no significant difference in wave energy dissipation between single pipe and double pipe pneumatic breakwaters fig 21 indicates that when the spacing d s is larger than d m a x the transmission coefficient of the double pipe pneumatic breakwater is larger than that of the single pipe pneumatic breakwater which means that increasing the number of air discharging pipes cannot improve the wave dissipating performance when the airflow rate is smaller than 3 m 3 h while the airflow rate is larger than 3 m 3 h the transmission coefficients for the double pipe pneumatic breakwater is smaller than that for the single pipe pneumatic breakwater it indicates that the difference in the wave dissipating performance between the single pipe and double pipe pneumatic breakwaters depends on airflow rates when the airflow rate is small the dissipating performance of aerial breakwater cannot be improved by increasing the number of discharging pipes which is similar with the results of zhang et al 2010 however if the airflow rate is large enough increasing the number of discharging pipes is feasible to improve the damping performance of the aerial breakwater it can infer that the double pipe pneumatic breakwater would be a good choice to protect the marine structures when the air bubble supply is sufficient fig 22 shows the comparison of the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients between single pipe and double pipe pneumatic breakwaters for long period waves w2 when the spacing between two aerial barriers is 1 m the previous studies indicate that the single pipe pneumatic breakwater has no evident effect on dissipating long period waves in the case of the highest airflow rates the attenuation of the wave height was doubled rising from 8 for the single pipe pneumatic breakwater to 15 for the double pipe pneumatic breakwater in addition if the airflow rates of each pipe of the double pipe pneumatic breakwater are the same as the airflow rates of the single pipe pneumatic breakwater the transmission coefficient of the double pipe pneumatic breakwater is greatly smaller than that for the single pipe pneumatic breakwater it means that the aerial breakwater with double air discharging pipes is an effective way to damp long period waves 5 conclusions a numerical model is developed to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of pneumatic breakwater in damping waves an existing physical model test is applied to validate the numerical model indicating that the numerical model proposed in this study is appropriate to investigate the wave damping performance of pneumatic breakwater the horizontal length d 0 of the influence area of the pneumatic breakwater is 1 8 m and the waves can be defined as long period waves when the wave length is larger than d 0 the pneumatic breakwater can significantly dissipate short period waves whose wave lengths are smaller than d 0 and has small influence on longer waves in addition two opposite vortexes can be observed for the pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes when the distance between two air barriers is equal to 1 m and the vortexes can significantly dissipate the incident waves in general the pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes can improve the wave damping performance when the airflow rate is sufficient especially for long period waves acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfc1404200 the national natural science foundation nsfc

rates and layout patterns the results indicate that the airflow rates wave periods and wave heights have significant influences on the wave dissipation capacity of pneumatic breakwater for the pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes an appropriate distance between two rows of aerial curtains could improve the wave dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwater keywords pneumatic breakwater two phase flow wave dissipating performance 1 introduction breakwaters are applied to reduce the intensity of wave action on the coastal structures in the past numerous types of breakwaters were used in the coastal area such as caisson breakwaters and rubble mound breakwaters however the cost of construction for these breakwaters is increased dramatically with the increasing water depth as an attractive alternative to the traditional breakwaters the pneumatic breakwater was proposed due to several advantages firstly the pneumatic breakwater is one kind of mobile breakwater with several specific advantages such as mobility temporality and low cost secondly the pneumatic barriers are easy to construct and they do not affect the maritime traffic moreover the additional circulation can improve the quality of the protected coastal areas to investigate the main mechanism of the pneumatic breakwaters many researches were conducted to improve the effectiveness

and sulisz 2017 derived a theoretical approach to investigate the interaction of regular waves with an air bubble curtain used as a pneumatic breakwater the previous researches are mainly focused on the performance of the pneumatic breakwaters in damping waves the aims of this study are to provide a more comprehensive information on the flow field around the aerial barriers and to optimize the parameters that will affect the wave dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwaters through numerical simulations in this study the numerical model of pneumatic breakwaters is validated by comparing with an existing experimental data paprota 2017 the current velocity field around the pneumatic breakwaters is analyzed and the waves passing through the aerial barrier is investigated in the time domain and frequency domain in addition the dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwater with double discharging pipes is also discussed to improve the efficiency of pneumatic breakwaters the current study is organized as follows section 2 presents the numerical model for analyzing the flow field around the pneumatic breakwaters and then the numerical model is validated by comparing with an existing physical model test paprota 2017 in section 3 after that the wave dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwater with different arrangements are discussed in section 4 finally some conclusions can be summarized 2 numerical method a numerical model is proposed to analyze the interaction between waves and air bubbles the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model is applied as a closure of the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations to calculate the flow field around the pneumatic breakwaters 2 1 the governing equations the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans

which the volume fraction function α is defined as the quantity of water per unit of volume in every cell the volume fraction function α is 0 for a completely dry cell and 1 for a wet cell if volume fraction function α for one cell is between 0 and 1 the cell is labeled as the interface between water and air the volume fraction is obtained by solving the following equation devolder et al 2017 9 α

detrimental velocity gradients around the interface 2 4 numerical setup a two dimensional numerical wave tank with length of 20 m and depth of 0 5 m is adopted here and the water depth is 0 3 m the waves are generated from the inlet boundary and an active wave absorption technique higuera et al 2013 a and b is adopted to eliminate the reflected waves in the outlet boundary the aerial barrier is located 10 m away from the wave entrance i e the inlet boundary at the left side of wave tank a series of wave gauges were installed after and before the pneumatic breakwater to measure the wave elevation as is shown in fig 1 the finite volume method is applied to solve the incompressible navier stokes equations numerically in openfoam and the pressure implicit split operator piso is used to couple the pressure and velocity the euler scheme is adopted for the temporal terms and the gauss linear scheme is chosen for the gradient and laplacian terms the density and kinematic viscosity coefficient of the water are set as 1000 kg m 3 and 1 0 10 6 m2 s respectively the openfoam mesh generator blockmesh is adopted to generate the mesh as shown in fig 2 five mesh arrangements are presented in table 1 for investigating the mesh convergence the meshes around the pneumatic breakwaters and water surface are refined wave elevation is measured for comparison and the wave parameters are set as t 1 26 s and h 0 05 m i e t is the incident wave period and h is the incident wave height the wave elevations for no 1 3 meshes with different horizontal mesh sizes are presented in fig 3 indicating that the no 2 mesh with horizontal mesh size of l 280 is acceptable to simulate the waves the wave elevations for no 2 4 and 5 meshes with different vertical mesh sizes are shown in fig 4 the result indicates that the difference in wave elevation for no 2 4 and 5 meshes is small therefore the vertical mesh size is set to be h 12 in this study so the maximum mesh size of 0 69 cm is adopted along the water depth and the mesh size δ z close to the free surface is refined with the size of 0 33 cm in the stream wise direction the mesh size δ x from the inlet boundary to the aerial barrier is 0 75 cm and the mesh size δ x around the aerial barrier is refined with the minimum size of 0 23 cm which leads to a total mesh cell number equal to 0 72 million 3 model validation 3 1 bubble curtain in static water evans 1955 had indicated that the surface currents induced by ascending air bubble are the main reason for wave energy dissipation the vertical current generated by rising bubbles converted into the following and opposing near surface horizontal currents and the horizontal velocities of these currents have great influences on the performance of wave energy dissipation in this section the current velocity fields are analyzed and validated by comparing with the theoretical results the maximum horizontal current speed caused by the aerial breakwater which is calculated through the formulas provided by brevik and kristiansen 2002 in these no wave cases the parameters of the aerial barrier are modified by changing the airflow rates q 1 2 3 4 5 m 3 h fig 5 shows the current structure and the mean velocity field around the aerial barrier when the airflow rate q 5 m 3 h and x 0 m is the location of an aerial barrier it is obvious that the near surface current is directed away from the aerial barrier while the current in the close vicinity of the bottom is directed towards the curtain which leads to a water circulation behind the air curtain at about one third of the water depth distance from the free surface the vertical component of current velocity reaches its maximum then the vertical velocity rapidly decreases and finally breaks down into two opposite horizontal velocities when approaching the free surface more importantly the maximum horizontal velocity occurs near the free surface and about 0 3 m away from the aerial barrier owing to the symmetry of the current generated by ascending air bubbles the distance between the locations of the maximum horizontal velocities in front of and behind the aerial barrier d m a x is about 0 6 m in addition the horizontal velocities have little effect on wave dissipation when they decrease to 50 of the maximum horizontal velocity which means that the horizontal length d 0 of the influence range of the air curtain is considered to be 1 8 m furthermore fig 6 presents the variation of the horizontal mean flow velocities v m e a n generated by the air bubble curtain versus the water depth with different airflow rates q 1 2 3 4 5 m 3 h at which the maximum horizontal velocity has occurred in the calm water the results indicate that the absolute value of the horizontal velocity firstly increases with the increasing water depth in front of the pneumatic breakwater until reaches its maximum at the near surface area then its value starts to decrease with further increase of water depth the direction of horizontal flow velocity changes and the value of the horizontal velocity increases again and then gradually decreases to zero at the bottom more importantly the higher airflow rates generate a larger maximum horizontal velocity at the near surface area which would improve the damping performance of the pneumatic breakwater in general the horizontal velocity is zero at half water depth for different airflow rates according to brevik and kristiansen 2002 the theoretical maximum horizontal velocity u m a x was calculated by the following formula 10 u m a x 1 7 g q 0 b 1 3 1 h p 0 1 3 where h is the water depth q 0 is the volume of air per second at atmospheric pressure q 0 q 3600 p 0 is the atmosphere pressure with the unit of head of water and b is the width of the wave flume the theoretical maximum horizontal velocities of the air barrier induced currents calculated by applying eq 10 are 0 2788 m s and 0 4765 m s for the airflow rates 1 m 3 h and 5 m 3 h respectively on the other hand the maximum horizontal velocities calculated from the numerical simulation are 0 2809 m s for the lower airflow rate q 1 m 3 h and 0 5158 m s in the case of higher airflow rate q 5 m 3 h as shown in fig 6 the more detailed information about the maximum horizontal velocities is presented in table 2 the theoretical values of the maximum horizontal velocities are always lower than the numerical results which is due to the fact that the theoretical formulas deduction procedures are based on three dimensional large scale experiments which are different from the two dimensional numerical setup but the largest deviation between the numerical maximum horizontal velocities and the theoretical results is just 8 2 in general the numerical maximum horizontal velocity shows a good agreement with the theoretical results it indicates that the numerical simulation of air bubble curtain is reasonable 3 2 pneumatic breakwater in waves the interaction between the waves and the pneumatic breakwater is analyzed here to validate the numerical model by comparing with an existing physical model test paprota 2017 the basic wave parameters of the analyzed test cases in this section which are the same as the physical model tests conducted by paprota 2017 are summarized in table 3 the waves interact with the aerial barrier and the wave energy dissipation occurs around the pneumatic breakwater fig 7 shows the comparison of the measured time series of free surface elevation behind the aerial barrier in the case of the highest airflow rate in reference to the results in the absence of the aerial barrier the effect of the pneumatic breakwater on the waves is clearly visible based on the numerical simulation the wave reflection coefficient and the wave transmission coefficient could be calculated in order to evaluate the effectiveness of an aerial curtain used as a pneumatic breakwater by the formulas a 1 3 in the appendix the reflected wave heights are calculated by the two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 and in order to decrease the distraction of re reflected waves only a part of time histories are adopted to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients figs 8 and 9 present the comparisons of the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients versus different airflow rates between present numerical simulations and physical model tests figs 8 and 9 indicate that the performance of a pneumatic breakwater is closely related to wave periods and airflow rates the results confirm that the single aerial barrier has little effect on long period waves and a significant effect on short period waves furthermore wave damping properties of the pneumatic breakwater may be improved by increasing the airflow rates the reflection and transmission coefficients obtained from numerical simulation are compared with the experimental data from paprota 2017 and the agreement is good with the largest difference less than 5 it indicates that investigating the performance of pneumatic breakwater through numerical simulations is feasible 4 results and discussion 4 1 pneumatic breakwater with single air discharging pipe the incident wave propagates on the opposing current generated by ascending air bubbles and interacts with the air curtain as a result part of the wave energy is dissipated and only the remaining energy is transmitted to the downstream area based on the numerical simulations of these processes the time series of the free surface elevations and their corresponding spectrums are analyzed and then the factors that influence the wave dissipating capabilities of the pneumatic breakwater are studied in this section including different wave heights wave periods and airflow rates referring to paprota 2017 the wave parameters of the numerical simulations are presented in table 4 4 1 1 free surface elevation pneumatic breakwater with single air discharging pipe is simulated with different wave periods wave heights and airflow rates as shown in table 4 time histories of free surface elevation and the corresponding spectrums in front of and behind the aerial barrier compared with the results of the tests conducted without the air curtains are presented in figs 10 12 the results indicate that the pneumatic breakwater has a significant influence on damping the waves with short periods while the influences on long period waves are becoming weak the wave amplitude decreases behind the pneumatic breakwater and an apparent phase shift occurs because of the interactions between the incident waves and the currents generated by the aerial barrier furthermore some higher harmonic components are observed in the reflected waves and the transmitted waves due to nonlinear energy transfer and the wave profiles become irregular behind the aerial barrier in front of the air barrier the wave reflection is negligible and the wave amplitude of high frequency wave is relatively small but it tends to increase with the decrease of the wave periods as for the transmitted waves behind the aerial curtain the amplitude of the main peak in the spectrum decreases significantly and some high frequency waves appear however with the decrease of wave periods there is no evident sub peak in the spectrum and the strong nonlinearity appears on the transmitted waves it is worth mentioning that the experimental studies in paprota 2017 have also presented similar results 4 1 2 incident wave periods the quantitative effect of the wave periods on the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients is shown in fig 13 the results indicate that the performance of a pneumatic breakwater is closely related with the wave periods for longer incident waves w1 and w2 whose wave lengths are larger than the length d 0 1 8 m of the influence area of the aerial breakwater the aerial barrier has little effect on the propagating waves two reasons for the high transmission rate at long periods exist firstly the influence area of the aerial barrier is much smaller than the wave length of long period waves and thus the interaction between the incident waves and the aerial barrier is weak secondly the wave celerity for long period waves is obviously larger than the horizontal current velocities caused by the aerial breakwater therefore it is incompetent to reduce the wave energy of long period waves on the contrary for shorter incident waves whose wave lengths are smaller than the length of the influence area of an aerial barrier the transmission coefficients decrease significantly the decrease of the wave height of shorter waves w4 and w5 may reach even 50 75 in the case of the highest airflow rate compared to only 1 10 for longer waves w1 and w2 this means that the wave dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwater with an appropriate airflow rate is good for the short period incident waves 4 1 3 incident wave heights three different incident wave heights w5 w6 and w7 as shown in table 4 are analyzed to evaluate the influence of wave heights on the dissipating performance of the single pipe aerial breakwater fig 14 shows the variations of the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients with the increase of the airflow rate for different wave heights the results indicate that the smaller incident wave height leads to a smaller transmission coefficient the attenuation of wave height equal to 60 occurs in the case of w7 while only 50 in the case of w5 when the airflow rate is 5 m 3 h it confirms that the wave dissipating performance of a pneumatic breakwater is weakened when the wave heights become much higher 4 1 4 airflow rates the pneumatic breakwater performance is closely related with the efficiency of an air compressor in this section the different airflow rates are taken into consideration to analyze how the airflow rates affect the damping performance of the single pipe aerial breakwater fig 15 presents the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients at different wave periods for increasing airflow rates the results indicate that the reflection coefficient increases and the transmission coefficient decreases significantly with the increase of the airflow rates it is easy to identify that for no w5 waves the transmission coefficient is only about 0 3 when the airflow rate reaches to 5 m 3 h comparing to 0 7 in the case of the lowest airflow rate the results indicate that the wave damping properties of the pneumatic breakwater can be improved by increasing the airflow rate so while the other conditions of the pneumatic breakwater are constant it is an effective method to increase attenuation of transmitted waves by increasing airflow rates but in the case of a longer wave increasing airflow rates have almost no effect on wave damping and it is infeasible to improve the dissipating performance of pneumatic breakwater by increasing air bubble supply thus it is essential to take some other measures such as increasing the number of air discharging pipes to expand the influence area of aerial curtains for improving the damping performance of longer waves of pneumatic breakwater 4 2 pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes the single pipe aerial breakwater is incapable to damp long period waves in order to find a possible way to dissipate long period waves the performance of the double pipe aerial breakwater is analyzed in this section 4 2 1 arrangement of air discharging pipes the schematic diagram of the pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes is shown in fig 16 considering different spacing between two aerial barriers d s 0 4 m and d s 1 m and different airflow rates q t 1 2 3 4 5 m 3 h particularly the total airflow rates q t in the case of double air discharging pipes are equal to that in the case of single air discharging pipe the numerical wave tank is 24 m long 0 5 m high and the water depth is equal to 0 3 m analogously six wave gauges are applied to measure the free surface elevations around the pneumatic breakwater the same boundary conditions and discrete methods used in previous studies are adopted in the section regular waves of fixed wave period and wave height are generated according to table 4 4 2 2 pneumatic breakwater in static water the near surface horizontal current are the main mechanisms of wave dissipation for a pneumatic breakwater fig 17 shows the mean velocity field around the aerial barrier for different spacing d s 0 4 m and 1 m between two aerial barriers in the case of the highest airflow rate in static water the black arrows in fig 17 denote the locations of aerial barriers and the directions of corresponding bubble movements fig 17 a indicates that two vertical currents gradually move together until they merge into one vertical flow which then divides into two opposite horizontal currents near free surface for the spacing d s of 0 4 m the results indicate that the current velocity field and the pattern of circulation flow produced by ascending air bubbles from double air discharging pipes are similar to those of single air discharging pipe it can be inferred that pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes have similar effects on wave dissipating performance when the spacing d s is smaller than d m a x d m a x is the length between the locations of the maximum horizontal velocities in front of and behind the aerial barrier as shown in section3 1 when the spacing d s is larger than d m a x fig 17 b indicates that two opposite vortexes appear between two aerial barriers firstly the horizontal influence range of the aerial breakwater with double air discharging pipes is increased to 2 6 m which is significantly larger than the horizontal influence range 1 8 m of the aerial breakwater with single air discharging pipe it means that the aerial breakwater with double air discharging pipes may be more efficient in damping the long period incident waves comparing with the single aerial barrier secondly two opposite vortexes between the aerial barriers will enhance the dissipation of incident waves fig 18 shows the comparison of the horizontal current velocities between double and single air discharging pipes along the water depth for different spacing d s 0 4 m and 1 m fig 18 a indicates that the maximum horizontal flow velocity generated by two air bubble curtains for the spacing d s 0 4 m is almost the same as that of single air bubble curtain and fig 18 b indicates that when the spacing is 1 m the near surface horizontal flow velocity for double air discharging pipes is larger than that of the single air discharging pipe it means that the double pipe aerial breakwater may have similar effect on damping waves to the single pipe aerial breakwater in the case of small spacing however while the spacing d s is larger than d m a x two vortexes generate between two aerial barriers and the wave energy dissipation may be more efficient 4 2 3 pneumatic breakwater performance fig 19 shows the measured time histories of free surface elevation and the corresponding spectrums in front of and behind two aerial barriers comparing to the results in the absence of the aerial barrier and the spacing between two aerial barriers is 1 m a significant wave damping is observed for the aerial breakwater with double air discharging pipes the sub peak exists in the reflected wave spectrum and there is an obvious high frequency wave component for the reflected waves figs 20 and 21 present the comparison of the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients between single pipe and double pipe pneumatic breakwaters for short period waves w5 considering different pipe spacing d s 0 4 m and 1 m fig 20 indicates that reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients between single pipe and double pipe pneumatic breakwaters have little difference when the spacing d s is equal to 0 4 m it indicates that when the spacing d s between two aerial barriers is smaller than d m a x the length between the locations of the maximum horizontal current velocity before and after the aerial barrier there is no significant difference in wave energy dissipation between single pipe and double pipe pneumatic breakwaters fig 21 indicates that when the spacing d s is larger than d m a x the transmission coefficient of the double pipe pneumatic breakwater is larger than that of the single pipe pneumatic breakwater which means that increasing the number of air discharging pipes cannot improve the wave dissipating performance when the airflow rate is smaller than 3 m 3 h while the airflow rate is larger than 3 m 3 h the transmission coefficients for the double pipe pneumatic breakwater is smaller than that for the single pipe pneumatic breakwater it indicates that the difference in the wave dissipating performance between the single pipe and double pipe pneumatic breakwaters depends on airflow rates when the airflow rate is small the dissipating performance of aerial breakwater cannot be improved by increasing the number of discharging pipes which is similar with the results of zhang et al 2010 however if the airflow rate is large enough increasing the number of discharging pipes is feasible to improve the damping performance of the aerial breakwater it can infer that the double pipe pneumatic breakwater would be a good choice to protect the marine structures when the air bubble supply is sufficient fig 22 shows the comparison of the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients between single pipe and double pipe pneumatic breakwaters for long period waves w2 when the spacing between two aerial barriers is 1 m the previous studies indicate that the single pipe pneumatic breakwater has no evident effect on dissipating long period waves in the case of the highest airflow rates the attenuation of the wave height was doubled rising from 8 for the single pipe pneumatic breakwater to 15 for the double pipe pneumatic breakwater in addition if the airflow rates of each pipe of the double pipe pneumatic breakwater are the same as the airflow rates of the single pipe pneumatic breakwater the transmission coefficient of the double pipe pneumatic breakwater is greatly smaller than that for the single pipe pneumatic breakwater it means that the aerial breakwater with double air discharging pipes is an effective way to damp long period waves 5 conclusions a numerical model is developed to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of pneumatic breakwater in damping waves an existing physical model test is applied to validate the numerical model indicating that the numerical model proposed in this study is appropriate to investigate the wave damping performance of pneumatic breakwater the horizontal length d 0 of the influence area of the pneumatic breakwater is 1 8 m and the waves can be defined as long period waves when the wave length is larger than d 0 the pneumatic breakwater can significantly dissipate short period waves whose wave lengths are smaller than d 0 and has small influence on longer waves in addition two opposite vortexes can be observed for the pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes when the distance between two air barriers is equal to 1 m and the vortexes can significantly dissipate the incident waves in general the pneumatic breakwater with double air discharging pipes can improve the wave damping performance when the airflow rate is sufficient especially for long period waves acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the national key r d program of china 2017yfc1404200 the national natural science foundation nsfc

could be calculated by the following formula a 1 r c h r h i a 2 t c h t h i where h i is the incident wave height h r is the reflected wave height and h t is transmitted wave height the two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 is applied to calculate the reflection coefficients after the waves start to interact with the pneumatic curtain the wave profiles become irregular behind the aerial barrier in order to calculate more accurate transmission coefficient the first harmonic wave components and the second harmonic wave components are extracted based on the fourier transformation thus the transmission coefficient t c is redefined as follows a 3 t c j 1 n h t j 2 h i 2 where h t j is the j th harmonic component of the transmitted wave
