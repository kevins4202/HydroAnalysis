20030,prediction of bathing water quality is recommended by the world health organization who the european union eu and the united states environmental protection agency usepa and is an established element in bathing water management designed to protect public health most commonly historical regulatory compliance data are used for model calibration and provide the dependent variable for modelling independent or predictor variables e g rainfall river flow and received irradiance measured over some antecedent period are used to deliver prediction of the faecal indicator concentration measured on the day of the regulatory sample collection the implied linked assumptions of this approach are therefore that i the independent variables accurately predict the bathing day water quality which is ii accurately characterized by the single regulatory sample assumption ii will not be the case where significant within day variability in water quality is evident this study built a detailed record of water quality change through 60 days at a uk coastal bathing water in 2011 using half hourly samples each subjected to triplicate filtration designed to enhance enumeration precision on average the mean daily variation in fio concentrations exceeded 1 log10 order with the largest daily variations exceeding 2 log10 orders significant diurnality was observed at this bathing water which would determine its eu directive compliance category if the regulatory samples were collected at the same time each day a sampling programme of this intensity has not been reported elsewhere to date and if this pattern is proven to be characteristic of other bathing waters world wide it has significance for a the design of regulatory sampling programmes b the use of historical data to assess compliance which often comprises a single sample taken at the compliance point on a regular often weekly basis and c the use of regulatory compliance data to build predictive models of water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords bathing water variability faecal indicators 1 background prediction of bathing water quality initially to characterise the bathing day was first suggested as a bathing water management tool by a who expert group which developed the annapolis protocol who 1999 this was later incorporated into the first who guidelines for recreational water environments who 2003 and received its first regulatory application in the european union eu bathing water directive eu 2006 which sets legal compliance limits for over 20 000 european bathing waters these criteria using faecal indicator organism fio measurements are the basis of international bathing beach award and accreditation systems such as the blue flag awarded by the foundation for environmental education fee 2018 parallel development of this broad approach is evident world wide usepa 2010a b the purpose of predicting water quality on the bathing day is to protect public health by giving beachgoers informed choice on days when adverse water quality is predicted and communicated through beach signage and internet resources who 1999 also in the eu if this warning was in force on a day when the regulatory sample was taken then the adverse result on that day can be excluded from the 95th or 90th percentile calculations which determine legal compliance for an eu bathing water this can also result in significant improvements in bathing water compliance valued at several billion uk in benefits to uk communities dependent on tourism eftec 2002 to date historical compliance data has provided the principal data resource for predictive model development and calibration in the uk rapid and significant faecal indicator organism fio variability in recreational waters has been reported in seminal studies by boehm et al 2002 boehm 2007 and usepa 2010a b the first centred on huntington beach in california it was suggested that the observed variability invalidated the utility of single spot determinations of faecal indicators as regulatory tools given the observed changes over minutes and hours i e within the bathing day more recently lusic et al 2017 reported significant diurnality in fio concentrations at five croatian bathing waters which were sampled at four hourly intervals between 02 00 and 20 00 local time suggesting that the highest fio concentrations occurred in the 06 00 samples possibly driven by lower bactericidal solar irradiance in the preceding night time period in two reports the usepa have summarised the drivers of variability in fio concentrations across riverine lacustrine and marine bathing waters and the implication for regulatory sampling usepa 2010a b they note the impacts of tidal status and hydrograph events and comment on apparent diurnality where early morning samples are expected to exhibit the highest fio concentrations usepa 2010a page 3 exhibit 2 and page 11 section 2 2 interestingly they cite the work of boehm et al 2002 page 3891 right column paragraph 3 lines 7 15 to suggest regulatory monitoring of bathing waters exhibiting this pattern should at a minimum focus on early morning sampling to produce a precautionary approach to health risk management usepa 2010b page 13 section 2 2 3 this is an understandable regulatory response but perhaps it indicates a science need to facilitate more detailed modelling that can adequately predict the observed within day patterns to furnish health risk predictions to beach management organisations and the public these international observations are consistent and of policy relevance because they reduce confidence in two foundations of current regulatory monitoring practice namely i that a regulatory sample taken on the bathing day can characterise the day s water quality and hence health risk which is related to the faecal indicator organism fio concentration that is used to characterise the pollution exposure level experienced by bathing beach users who 2003 or indeed the confidence that a single check sample can be used to indicate the end of a short term pollution episode as is the case in current eu practice and ii that prediction models advocated by who who 1999 2003 eu 2006 usepa 2012 and incorporated into legally enforced standard systems e g eu 2006 and award schemes fee 2018 which use the bathing day as the unit of prediction and are often calibrated using historical compliance data or dedicated survey data both being based on one or possibly two spot determinations assumed to characterise the bathing day may not characterise relatively infrequent but important conditions producing non compliance crowther et al 2001 francy et al 2013 mcphail and stidson 2009 nevers and whitman 2005 olyphant 2005 seis et al 2018 stidson et al 2012 thoe et al 2014 usepa 2012 2018 such an approach would be expected to produce relatively low explained variance e g for us marine bathing waters an average adjusted r 2 of 0 39 has been reported by usepa 2010a vol ii page xiii however overall model evaluation should be based on a broader set of tests than r 2 alone such as the percentage misclassification of acceptable water quality when it was in fact poor presenting an unpredicted health risk to bathers many other workers have reported on the fio response to hydrological events at regulated bathing waters stidson et al 2012 but there have been few detailed reports describing modelling of sub diurnal patterns in fio concentration which may present significant regulatory and prediction challenges one exception is bedri et al 2016 who applied a hydrodynamic modelling approach to deliver within day prediction 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this paper reports on observed within day patterns in fio concentrations at swansea bay in south wales uk fig 1 this study site was selected because its bathing water had been considered an at risk site by the uk authorities i e at risk of non compliance with european union eu standards leading to a poor classification against the eu bathing water directive eu 2006 and hence potential permanent closure the bathing water compliance point is in the approximate centre of the urban frontage of the bay which has significant freshwater inputs from three major rivers with diverse land use ranging from industrial and domestic urban areas total population exceeding 250 000 through intensive livestock farming to upland mountain areas used for water gathering grounds forestry and sheep grazing these rivers drain a combined catchment area of approximately 600 km2 there are also two treated effluent discharges entering the sea by long sea outfalls from treatment works serving swansea ultra violet uv disinfected and neath port talbot secondary treated in addition there are multiple small urban streams some of which receive intermittent discharges of untreated but dilute sewage effluent when rainfall on the urban catchment results in the operation of combined sewer overflows streams also drain the urban infrastructure and may be impacted by what in the uk are termed cross connections i e the improper and unlicensed connection of domestic foul drainage i e toilets and grey water from bathrooms kitchens and washing machines etc into the non foul surface water urban drainage system this complex pattern of land use and drainage is the principal reason why this bathing water has remained in the at risk category despite expenditures on sewage treatment and disposal exceeding 100 million uk over the past 20 years dcww 2018 including uv disinfection of the sewage effluent from the city of swansea itself 2 2 study design the overall driver for this investigation was to generate the best possible model calibration data to effect bathing water prediction the full study spanned 2010 to 2015 and investigated both black box statistical and hydrodynamic water quality modelling approaches and a back to back comparison of these two methods the prediction modelling aspects are the basis of a current operational model deployed by swansea council and a scientific paper reporting this is in preparation this paper centres on the within day variability in faecal indicator concentrations at this uk at risk bathing water aseptic water quality sampling was undertaken at the swansea bay regulatory designated sampling point dsp within the defined bathing water polygon fig 1 at approximately half hourly intervals between 07 00 gmt and 16 00 gmt during three days of each week typically monday to wednesday throughout the 20 week bathing season in 2011 16 05 2011 to 28 09 2011 samplers followed the tidal transect along a line perpendicular to the foreshore as would be the case for regulatory sampling fig 1 in tidal environments which characterise uk coastal bathing waters samples were collected in sterile 1 l plastic containers aurora scientific by wading to a safe depth between thigh and waist depth and using a sampling pole to hold the container thus avoiding any local disturbance from the sampler entering the water and at approximately 30 cm below the surface this was the safest and most consistent sampling approach achievable at low water accounting for the characteristics of the site the maximum tidal range here is large 10 m and the beach gradient extremely shallow towards low water leading to maximum offshore sample collection distances in excess of 1 4 km during the largest spring tide samples were collected during 60 days in the uk bathing season may to september each day generating at least 19 water samples this represents 43 of the 140 day bathing season and nearly as many samples were collected on individual sampling days as were collected during once weekly routine compliance monitoring at swansea dsp in the entire 2011 bathing season 20 weekly samples the within day sampling period was extended to 19 00 gmt for 24 days between 18 07 2011 and 07 09 2011 yielding 25 samples per day over this part of the bathing season this sampling regime allowed coverage of a wide range of tidal meteorological and hydrometric conditions for example discharge data from a local river monitoring site operated by swansea council were available for the clyne river fig 1 to assess changes in the local freshwater input adjacent to the dsp 2 3 laboratory analysis samples were immediately refrigerated and analyzed in a dedicated microbiology laboratory within 24 h of collection as required by uk regulations mean 10 77 h standard deviation sd 8 12 h the fios analyzed were escherichia coli e coli and confirmed intestinal enterococci cie using standard membrane filtration techniques e coli were enumerated using membrane lactose glucoronide agar mlga oxoid glycosynth sca 2009 2011 membranes were incubated for 4 h at 30 c followed by 14 h at 44 c 0 5 c all green colonies were counted as e coli enterococci were isolated using membrane enterococcus agar mea oxoid by incubation for 4 h at 37 c followed by 44 h at 44 c 0 5 c sca 2012 all maroon colonies were counted as presumptive intestinal enterococci ie membranes were then transferred to kanamycin aesculin azide agar kaaa oxoid and incubated for 6 h at 44 c 0 5 c all colonies that developed black halos were counted as confirmed cie all microbiological analyses were undertaken in triplicate to reduce measurement imprecision fleisher and mcfadden 1980 which is significant for enumerations based on single filtrations employing an initial 10 fold dilution which are generally used for uk bathing water regulatory compliance samples sca 2009 2011 2012 resulting concentrations were expressed as colony forming units per 100 ml cfu 100 ml serial dilutions generally two or three per sample were made using sterile ringer s solution in order to capture the appropriate range of fio concentrations and limit censored data values i e and values the lower limit of detection lld for e coli was 3 cfu 100 ml the theoretical lld for cie was 1 cfu 100 ml due to the two stage incubation all samples were analyzed within 24 h of collection samples were also analyzed for turbidity and salinity 2 4 statistical analysis and data preparation statistical analyses were performed using the spss statistical software package version 19 spss 2010 the parametricity of distributions was assessed using the shapiro wilk s w normality test and skewness statistic general descriptive statistics included the mean sd range and the 95 confidence interval for the mean student s t test was used to compare means between two groups the outcome of the corresponding levene test for homogeneity of variances was used to determine the appropriate type of t test based on either i separate or ii pooled variance estimates robust analysis of variance anova was employed to examine the significance of differences between more than two mean values here the significance of the anova is judged on i the levene test for homogeneity of group variances and ii whether the numbers of observations n in groups can be considered equal where variances can be considered homogenous and n values are equal the significance p of the f statistic is used where n values are equal but variances are not homogenous then the brown forsyth statistic p value is used finally when n values are unequal and variances not homogeneous the significance of the welch statistic is employed the levene test also drives the selection of an appropriate post hoc test to explore the significance of multiple paired comparisons between means where variances are homogenous the tukey test is used whilst the tamhane test is employed when variances cannot be considered homogenous bivariate linear regression was used to examine relationships between parameters where appropriate the fitted function taking the form 1 y b x a u where y is the dependent variable x is the independent predictor variable a is the intercept y at x 0 b is the slope coefficient and u is the standard error of the estimate the strength of the relationship proportion of variance in y explained by x was measured using the coefficient of determination r 2 adjusted for degrees of freedom the statistical significance of b provides an assessment of whether the slope is significantly different from zero the statistical significance of all tests was evaluated at the 95 confidence level 3 results 3 1 designated sampling point monitoring a total of 1303 samples were collected and analyzed from the 60 sampling days two results one for each fio parameter were not reported due to analytical errors no e coli were recovered from 48 samples 3 7 and no cie from 116 samples 8 9 detection limit values were assigned to these samples for the purpose of statistical analysis descriptive statistics and normality tests showed that the raw fio concentration distributions were positively skewed skewness 6 and demonstrated statistically significant departures from normality s w p 0 05 log10 transformation reduced skewness appreciably 0 2 though the distributions still showed statistically significant departure from normality s w p 0 05 given the reduction in skewness the fio data were log10 transformed prior to further statistical analysis treating the log10 transformed fio concentration data as parametric also allowed comparisons with classification systems such as the eu directive eu 2006 and who guidelines who 2003 the fio results for individual samples are shown in fig 2 a and b e coli single sample concentrations ranged from 3 cfu 100 ml to 3100 cfu 100 ml geometric mean gm 51 cfu 100 ml whilst cie single sample concentrations ranged from 2 cfu 100 ml to 4300 cfu 100 ml gm 31 cfu 100 ml the striking feature of this data set is the variation in fio concentrations within individual days a pattern that was continually repeated throughout the study period for e coli the mean range of daily log10 concentrations was 1 34 ranging between 0 60 and 2 67 the corresponding mean range of daily log10 cie concentrations was 1 43 and ranged between 0 48 and 3 08 thus on average the mean daily variation in fio concentrations exceeded 1 log10 order with the largest daily variations exceeding 2 log10 orders the plots also show the discharge record from the clyne river to the west of the dsp transect fig 1 for comparison there appears to be a general pattern of increased fio concentrations and thus a decline in water quality following hydrograph event conditions fig 2a and b fig 3 a and b although the size of the within day variability in log10 fio concentrations were consistently independent of antecedent rainfall and or river flow i e the principal predictor variables in short term pollution models deployed by uk and other regulatory agencies supplementary material fig s1 contains detailed plots of fio concentrations for the 60 days of sampling whilst fig s2 presents results of corresponding turbidity and salinity analyses 3 2 variations in daily water quality and probability of gastrointestinal illness the mean and sd for log10 fio concentrations were calculated for each sampling day the results are shown as gm values in fig 3a and b for e coli and cie which also shows the corresponding 95 confidence intervals for each geometric mean the plots show that the daily gm fio concentrations varied considerably between days but that the 95 confidence intervals expressed as log10 values remained similar and perhaps surprisingly appear independent of antecedent rainfall or river flow this is further explored statistically and in figs 4 and 5 the plots also show the 90th and 95th percentile values used for comparison with eu directive water quality standards which were used to classify each day in terms of the percentile values employed in the eu 2006 standards table 1 at this monitoring site the daily eu water quality classification is largely driven by cie concentrations with e coli driving only three of the 23 poor overall outcomes the results also demonstrate an apparent polarization of daily outcomes at swansea bay with similar numbers of days in the eu excellent 42 and poor 38 categories of the remaining 12 days six i e 10 of 60 days were classed as good and a further six were classed as sufficient table 1 the overall compliance outcome of this pattern is that swansea bay is considered at risk of failing to comply with the eu 2006 standards with associated provisions for prohibition of bathing activities it is thus critical to understand the factors affecting these observed daily eu directive 2006 outcomes which have been uncovered by the intensive sampling undertaken in this study the daily mean and sd of log10 cie concentrations were also used to calculate the daily probability of gastroenteritis pgi values fig 3c as outlined in wyer et al 1999 kay et al 2004 and who 2003 table 4 7 page 70 the daily pgi values were then compared with the thresholds defined in the world health organization who guidelines for recreational waters namely 1 5 and 10 pgi daily pgi values were variable with 45 of days exceeding the upper pgi 0 1 i e 10 threshold with a corresponding high risk of water associated gi table 2 it should be noted that compliance with the eu standards and the associated who pgi thresholds do not correspond exactly in the current study there were four more days with pgi 0 1 than poor days classified using the eu 2006 standards this is because i the eu compliance assessment is based on both e coli and cie criteria and ii the original who percentile threshold values were derived assuming an sd of 0 8103 for log10 cie concentrations kay et al 2004 the data presented for swansea bay demonstrate that the daily sd can be much lower than this assumed value the daily results were split into two groups based on pgi days with values 0 1 n 27 and days with pgi 0 1 n 33 this split was chosen to facilitate exploration of any differences in variability or mean values for the fio values on high and low health risk days this pgi threshold is shown in fig 3c the results are shown in fig 4 which presents box in this case 95 confidence intervals for the mean value and whisker presenting the range of values plots unsurprisingly the daily geometric mean fio concentration associated with days with pgi 10 showed a clear elevation when compared to the days with pgi 10 with such an obvious visual elevation i e the lack of overlap in the 95 confidence intervals in fig 4a and statistical significance testing may not furnish additional insight but in this case it was significant student s t tests p 0 05 the average daily sds for all 60 sampling days were log10 e coli 0 37 and log10 cie 0 40 thus on average the daily sd is approximately 0 4 log10 orders of magnitude regardless of the grouping however it is also apparent that the absolute variability in concentrations will increase as the daily gm concentration increases for example taking the cie results in fig 4a and applying a 0 4 log10 order of magnitude around the gm concentration would yield a range of 5 33 cfu 100 ml for the days with pgi 0 1 and 35 to 221 cfu 100 ml for the days with pgi 0 1 the relationships between daily mean log10 concentrations and corresponding daily sds were further explored using regression analyses fig 5 which models the change in within day sd of log10 fio concentrations y against the mean daily log10 fio concentrations x both fio plots exhibit a slight negative trend i e y decreases as x increases although the slope is not significantly different from zero in the case of cie fig 5b these findings regarding the daily sd of log10 fio concentrations if they apply at other beaches could be of potential interest with respect to water quality classification systems which use the sd of log10 transformed fio concentrations in their compliance calculations e g eu 2006 directive and who 2003 guidelines criteria fig 6 a and b presents gm fio concentrations their 95 confidence intervals and range for predominantly morning 07 00 to 11 00 gmt and afternoon sample groups 11 30 to 16 00 gmt for i all 60 sampling days ii the 34 days when pgi 10 and iii the 26 days when pgi 10 in all cases the predominantly afternoon samples have statistically significantly lower gms than the predominantly morning samples fig 6c and d provide a similar analysis using data from the 24 days during which sampling was extended to 19 00 comparing three time periods of 07 00 to 11 00 11 30 to 15 00 and 15 30 to 19 00 again reported for the all 24 days and the days in the two pgi risk categories in all cases the early afternoon period exhibits the lowest gm concentration for both e coli and cie despite the relatively small number of sampling days available for the comparisons the early afternoon gm is significantly different to the morning period gm for all comparisons except the comparison of gm e coli concentrations for the days when pgi was 10 fig 6c in the case of cie the early afternoon gm is significantly lower than the gms for both other periods when comparing data for all 24 days and the 13 days with pgi 0 1 fig 6d fig 7 presents the gm fio concentrations in samples taken at each half hour time point through the full study the pattern for all days shows a steady decline through the morning and early afternoon with the gm concentrations steadily increasing again in the late afternoon and evening from 16 00 onwards however it must be noted that the post 16 00 values are based on smaller numbers of sample results as indicated by the wider confidence intervals shown in fig 7 on the days with pgi 10 this diurnal pattern is more subdued for example the daily maxima and minima for the cie gm half hourly concentrations during the morning early afternoon decline fig 7 d e and f are i all data maximum 07 00 69 cfu 100 ml minimum 14 00 19 cfu 100 ml ii days with pgi 0 1 maximum 07 00 30 cfu 100 ml minimum 13 00 7 cfu 100 ml iii days with pgi 0 1 maximum 07 00 199 cfu 100 ml minimum 15 00 51 cfu 100 ml fig 7 presents the full season s data and there is of course considerable variability in this diurnal pattern for individual days where for example rainfall events increase bacterial inputs and or spring neap tidal cycles vary the intertidal swept area of beach which is a likely source of avian and possibly canine fio loadings to the beach surface thus a high between group i e pgi 10 vs pgi 10 variability is to be expected as indicated in fig 3a and this exceeds the within day variability for the full data set 3 3 compliance implications of the daily patterns in microbial water quality this apparent diurnal pattern has a major impact on the compliance level achieved over the bathing season during each hour table 3 a presents the compliance levels for the two periods in fig 6a and b the three periods in fig 6c and d are presented in table 3b and for each hour of the day from 07 00 to 19 00 in table 3c one implication of the results in table 3c is that on average a poor classification results from sampling before 11 00 or after 17 00 with compliance at the minimum eu sufficient or better level between 11 00 and 17 00 and a good classification if regulatory samples were taken between 14 00 and 15 00 however the conclusions regarding the post 16 00 time period in table 3c should be regarded tentatively due to the reduced number of sample results available for the 90th and 95th percentile calculations the principal parameter driving the classifications in table 3 is cie which tends to be a common observation at uk coastal bathing waters it should be noted that these projected classifications use average data over the full 60 day and 20 week study period and within specific hourly time intervals a range of compliance outcomes will be experienced due to changes in fio influx following for example storm hydrograph events 4 discussion the empirical data collected in this study at the designated bathing water monitoring site in swansea bay uk i e half hourly samples through 60 bathing days in 2011 fully supports the us assessments of boehm et al 2002 wymer et al 2007 and the usepa 2010a b that there is considerable within day variability in fio concentrations at compliance monitoring sites both on days when antecedent weather produces increased fio flux to the bathing water but also surprisingly when antecedent meteorological conditions are more quiescent in the study reported above this typically spanned 1 2 log10 orders within each day of sampling it is clear therefore that a single compliance sample should not be treated as representative of the bathing day water quality even on the day of sample collection the application of consistent compliance sampling times through the bathing season could drive the compliance outcome at any bathing water that exhibits this type of diurnal pattern of water quality see table 3c however at present it is not clear whether this observed and extreme within day variability is a generic observation for all bathing waters or is a characteristic of swansea bay and similar urbanized uk bathing waters an alternative compliance sampling approach worth attention would be to vary the time of sampling ideally randomized through adjustment of sampling runs where they cover multiple bathing waters this approach should provide data more representative of the bathing day there is therefore an urgent need to both assess i within day variability at other sites and importantly ii to explore within day prediction modelling 5 conclusions 1 significant within day variability has been observed in this urbanized uk bathing water which suggests that a single compliance sample should not be used to characterise bathing water quality on the bathing day it remains to be seen whether similar conclusions can be made for other uk bathing waters particularly more rural resorts and indeed whether these observations have wider international application 2 thus the use of compliance data to build and calibrate prediction models which forecast a single value for water quality on the bathing day and are used as a means of public health protection for bathers should be examined to ensure that the predicted water quality provides an adequate representation of health risk throughout the bathing day 3 where bathing water fio concentration exhibits the extreme variability reported in this paper research and management attention should focus on delivery of accurate within day prediction of bathing water microbial quality this could allow warnings for potentially short time periods as is commonly done for adverse tidal conditions which are often marked in the uk by red flags erected by lifeguards at the water s edge 4 such an approach would require intensive sampling to drive model building and testing whilst this would be relatively expensive it could improve both regulatory compliance and public health protection in addition it could also offer a cost effective solution for many at risk in eu directive terms sufficient bathing waters like swansea bay in wales which has not improved over many years despite expenditures of sewerage and other improvements of over 100 m uk 5 if the diurnal pattern observed at swansea bay is a generic observation it would be wholly inappropriate for compliance sampling programme design to be directed to achieve higher compliance levels by choosing the most beneficial time of day for sample collection we would hope that regulatory authorities would choose either the precautionary approach of boehm et al 2002 and usepa 2010b of early morning sampling or seek to characterise the bathing day when most bathers are present in the water by more nearly random sampling during this period allowing for tidal factors and sample transport logistics declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work under the

quality and hence health risk which is related to the faecal indicator organism fio concentration that is used to characterise the pollution exposure level experienced by bathing beach users who 2003 or indeed the confidence that a single check sample can be used to indicate the end of a short term pollution episode as is the case in current eu practice and ii that prediction models advocated by who who 1999 2003 eu 2006 usepa 2012 and incorporated into legally enforced standard systems e g eu 2006 and award schemes fee 2018 which use the bathing day as the unit of prediction and are often calibrated using historical compliance data or dedicated survey data both being based on one or possibly two spot determinations assumed to characterise the bathing day may not characterise relatively infrequent but important conditions producing non compliance crowther et al 2001 francy et al 2013 mcphail and stidson 2009 nevers and whitman 2005 olyphant 2005 seis et al 2018 stidson et al 2012 thoe et al 2014 usepa 2012 2018 such an approach would be expected to produce relatively low explained variance e g for us marine bathing waters an average adjusted r 2 of 0 39 has been reported by usepa 2010a vol ii page xiii however overall model evaluation should be based on a broader set of tests than r 2 alone such as the percentage misclassification of acceptable water quality when it was in fact poor presenting an unpredicted health risk to bathers many other workers have reported on the fio response to hydrological events at regulated bathing waters stidson et al 2012 but there have been few detailed reports describing modelling of sub diurnal patterns in fio concentration which may present significant regulatory and prediction challenges one exception is bedri et al 2016 who applied a hydrodynamic modelling approach to deliver within day prediction 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this paper reports on observed within day patterns in fio concentrations at swansea bay in south wales uk fig 1 this study site was selected because its bathing water had been considered an at risk site by the uk authorities i e at risk of non compliance with european union eu standards leading to a poor classification against the eu bathing water directive eu 2006 and hence potential permanent closure the bathing water compliance point is in the approximate centre of the urban frontage of the bay which has significant freshwater inputs from three major rivers with diverse land use ranging from industrial and domestic urban areas total population exceeding 250 000 through intensive livestock farming to upland mountain areas used for water gathering grounds forestry and sheep grazing these rivers drain a combined catchment area of approximately 600 km2 there are also two treated effluent discharges entering the sea by long sea outfalls from treatment works serving swansea ultra violet uv disinfected and neath port talbot secondary treated in addition there are multiple small urban streams some of which receive intermittent discharges of untreated but dilute sewage effluent when rainfall on the urban catchment results in the operation of combined sewer overflows streams also drain the urban infrastructure and may be impacted by what in the uk are termed cross connections i e the improper and unlicensed connection of domestic foul drainage i e toilets and grey water from bathrooms kitchens and washing machines etc into the non foul surface water urban drainage system this complex pattern of land use and drainage is the principal reason why this bathing water has remained in the at risk category despite expenditures on sewage treatment and disposal exceeding 100 million uk over the past 20 years dcww 2018 including uv disinfection of the sewage effluent from the city of swansea itself 2 2 study design the overall driver for this investigation was to generate the best possible model calibration data to effect bathing water prediction the full study spanned 2010 to 2015 and investigated both black box statistical and hydrodynamic water quality modelling approaches and a back to back comparison of these two methods the prediction modelling aspects are the basis of a current operational model deployed by swansea council and a scientific paper reporting this is in preparation this paper centres on the within day variability in faecal indicator concentrations at this uk at risk bathing water aseptic water quality sampling was undertaken at the swansea bay regulatory designated sampling point dsp within the defined bathing water polygon fig 1 at approximately half hourly intervals between 07 00 gmt and 16 00 gmt during three days of each week typically monday to wednesday throughout the 20 week bathing season in 2011 16 05 2011 to 28 09 2011 samplers followed the tidal transect along a line perpendicular to the foreshore as would be the case for regulatory sampling fig 1 in tidal environments which characterise uk coastal bathing waters samples were collected in sterile 1 l plastic containers aurora scientific by wading to a safe depth between thigh and waist depth and using a sampling pole to hold the container thus avoiding any local disturbance from the sampler entering the water and at approximately 30 cm below the surface this was the safest and most consistent sampling approach achievable at low water accounting for the characteristics of the site the maximum tidal range here is large 10 m and the beach gradient extremely shallow towards low water leading to maximum offshore sample collection distances in excess of 1 4 km during the largest spring tide samples were collected during 60 days in the uk bathing season may to september each day generating at least 19 water samples this represents 43 of the 140 day bathing season and nearly as many samples were collected on individual sampling days as were collected during once weekly routine compliance monitoring at swansea dsp in the entire 2011 bathing season 20 weekly samples the within day sampling period was extended to 19 00 gmt for 24 days between 18 07 2011 and 07 09 2011 yielding 25 samples per day over this part of the bathing season this sampling regime allowed coverage of a wide range of tidal meteorological and hydrometric conditions for example discharge data from a local river monitoring site operated by swansea council were available for the clyne river fig 1 to assess changes in the local freshwater input adjacent to the dsp 2 3 laboratory analysis samples were immediately refrigerated and analyzed in a dedicated microbiology laboratory within 24 h of collection as required by uk regulations mean 10 77 h standard deviation sd 8 12 h the fios analyzed were escherichia coli e coli and confirmed intestinal enterococci cie using standard membrane filtration techniques e coli were enumerated using membrane lactose glucoronide agar mlga oxoid glycosynth sca 2009 2011 membranes were incubated for 4 h at 30 c followed by 14 h at 44 c 0 5 c all green colonies were counted as e coli enterococci were isolated using membrane enterococcus agar mea oxoid by incubation for 4 h at 37 c followed by 44 h at 44 c 0 5 c sca 2012 all maroon colonies were counted as presumptive intestinal enterococci ie membranes were then transferred to kanamycin aesculin azide agar kaaa oxoid and incubated for 6 h at 44 c 0 5 c all colonies that developed black halos were counted as confirmed cie all microbiological analyses were undertaken in triplicate to reduce measurement imprecision fleisher and mcfadden 1980 which is significant for enumerations based on single filtrations employing an initial 10 fold dilution which are generally used for uk bathing water regulatory compliance samples sca 2009 2011 2012 resulting concentrations were expressed as colony forming units per 100 ml cfu 100 ml serial dilutions generally two or three per sample were made using sterile ringer s solution in order to capture the appropriate range of fio concentrations and limit censored data values i e and values the lower limit of detection lld for e coli was 3 cfu 100 ml the theoretical lld for cie was 1 cfu 100 ml due to the two stage incubation all samples were analyzed within 24 h of collection samples were also analyzed for turbidity and salinity 2 4 statistical analysis and data preparation statistical analyses were performed using the spss statistical software package version 19 spss 2010 the parametricity of distributions was assessed using the shapiro wilk s w normality test and skewness statistic general descriptive statistics included the mean sd range and the 95 confidence interval for the mean student s t test was used to compare means between two groups the outcome of the corresponding levene test for homogeneity of variances was used to determine the appropriate type of t test based on either i separate or ii pooled variance estimates robust analysis of variance anova was employed to examine the significance of differences between more than two mean values here the significance of the anova is judged on i the levene test for homogeneity of group variances and ii whether the numbers of observations n in groups can be considered equal where variances can be considered homogenous and n values are equal the significance p of the f statistic is used where n values are equal but variances are not homogenous then the brown forsyth statistic p value is used finally when n values are unequal and variances not homogeneous the significance of the welch statistic is employed the levene test also drives the selection of an appropriate post hoc test to explore the significance of multiple paired comparisons between means where variances are homogenous the tukey test is used whilst the tamhane test is employed when variances cannot be considered homogenous bivariate linear regression was used to examine relationships between parameters where appropriate the fitted function taking the form 1 y b x a u where y is the dependent variable x is the independent predictor variable a is the intercept y at x 0 b is the slope coefficient and u is the standard error of the estimate the strength of the relationship proportion of variance in y explained by x was measured using the coefficient of determination r 2 adjusted for degrees of freedom the statistical significance of b provides an assessment of whether the slope is significantly different from zero the statistical significance of all tests was evaluated at the 95 confidence level 3 results 3 1 designated sampling point monitoring a total of 1303 samples were collected and analyzed from the 60 sampling days two results one for each fio parameter were not reported due to analytical errors no e coli were recovered from 48 samples 3 7 and no cie from 116 samples 8 9 detection limit values were assigned to these samples for the purpose of statistical analysis descriptive statistics and normality tests showed that the raw fio concentration distributions were positively skewed skewness 6 and demonstrated statistically significant departures from normality s w p 0 05 log10 transformation reduced skewness appreciably 0 2 though the distributions still showed statistically significant departure from normality s w p 0 05 given the reduction in skewness the fio data were log10 transformed prior to further statistical analysis treating the log10 transformed fio concentration data as parametric also allowed comparisons with classification systems such as the eu directive eu 2006 and who guidelines who 2003 the fio results for individual samples are shown in fig 2 a and b e coli single sample concentrations ranged from 3 cfu 100 ml to 3100 cfu 100 ml geometric mean gm 51 cfu 100 ml whilst cie single sample concentrations ranged from 2 cfu 100 ml to 4300 cfu 100 ml gm 31 cfu 100 ml the striking feature of this data set is the variation in fio concentrations within individual days a pattern that was continually repeated throughout the study period for e coli the mean range of daily log10 concentrations was 1 34 ranging between 0 60 and 2 67 the corresponding mean range of daily log10 cie concentrations was 1 43 and ranged between 0 48 and 3 08 thus on average the mean daily variation in fio concentrations exceeded 1 log10 order with the largest daily variations exceeding 2 log10 orders the plots also show the discharge record from the clyne river to the west of the dsp transect fig 1 for comparison there appears to be a general pattern of increased fio concentrations and thus a decline in water quality following hydrograph event conditions fig 2a and b fig 3 a and b although the size of the within day variability in log10 fio concentrations were consistently independent of antecedent rainfall and or river flow i e the principal predictor variables in short term pollution models deployed by uk and other regulatory agencies supplementary material fig s1 contains detailed plots of fio concentrations for the 60 days of sampling whilst fig s2 presents results of corresponding turbidity and salinity analyses 3 2 variations in daily water quality and probability of gastrointestinal illness the mean and sd for log10 fio concentrations were calculated for each sampling day the results are shown as gm values in fig 3a and b for e coli and cie which also shows the corresponding 95 confidence intervals for each geometric mean the plots show that the daily gm fio concentrations varied considerably between days but that the 95 confidence intervals expressed as log10 values remained similar and perhaps surprisingly appear independent of antecedent rainfall or river flow this is further explored statistically and in figs 4 and 5 the plots also show the 90th and 95th percentile values used for comparison with eu directive water quality standards which were used to classify each day in terms of the percentile values employed in the eu 2006 standards table 1 at this monitoring site the daily eu water quality classification is largely driven by cie concentrations with e coli driving only three of the 23 poor overall outcomes the results also demonstrate an apparent polarization of daily outcomes at swansea bay with similar numbers of days in the eu excellent 42 and poor 38 categories of the remaining 12 days six i e 10 of 60 days were classed as good and a further six were classed as sufficient table 1 the overall compliance outcome of this pattern is that swansea bay is considered at risk of failing to comply with the eu 2006 standards with associated provisions for prohibition of bathing activities it is thus critical to understand the factors affecting these observed daily eu directive 2006 outcomes which have been uncovered by the intensive sampling undertaken in this study the daily mean and sd of log10 cie concentrations were also used to calculate the daily probability of gastroenteritis pgi values fig 3c as outlined in wyer et al 1999 kay et al 2004 and who 2003 table 4 7 page 70 the daily pgi values were then compared with the thresholds defined in the world health organization who guidelines for recreational waters namely 1 5 and 10 pgi daily pgi values were variable with 45 of days exceeding the upper pgi 0 1 i e 10 threshold with a corresponding high risk of water associated gi table 2 it should be noted that compliance with the eu standards and the associated who pgi thresholds do not correspond exactly in the current study there were four more days with pgi 0 1 than poor days classified using the eu 2006 standards this is because i the eu compliance assessment is based on both e coli and cie criteria and ii the original who percentile threshold values were derived assuming an sd of 0 8103 for log10 cie concentrations kay et al 2004 the data presented for swansea bay demonstrate that the daily sd can be much lower than this assumed value the daily results were split into two groups based on pgi days with values 0 1 n 27 and days with pgi 0 1 n 33 this split was chosen to facilitate exploration of any differences in variability or mean values for the fio values on high and low health risk days this pgi threshold is shown in fig 3c the results are shown in fig 4 which presents box in this case 95 confidence intervals for the mean value and whisker presenting the range of values plots unsurprisingly the daily geometric mean fio concentration associated with days with pgi 10 showed a clear elevation when compared to the days with pgi 10 with such an obvious visual elevation i e the lack of overlap in the 95 confidence intervals in fig 4a and statistical significance testing may not furnish additional insight but in this case it was significant student s t tests p 0 05 the average daily sds for all 60 sampling days were log10 e coli 0 37 and log10 cie 0 40 thus on average the daily sd is approximately 0 4 log10 orders of magnitude regardless of the grouping however it is also apparent that the absolute variability in concentrations will increase as the daily gm concentration increases for example taking the cie results in fig 4a and applying a 0 4 log10 order of magnitude around the gm concentration would yield a range of 5 33 cfu 100 ml for the days with pgi 0 1 and 35 to 221 cfu 100 ml for the days with pgi 0 1 the relationships between daily mean log10 concentrations and corresponding daily sds were further explored using regression analyses fig 5 which models the change in within day sd of log10 fio concentrations y against the mean daily log10 fio concentrations x both fio plots exhibit a slight negative trend i e y decreases as x increases although the slope is not significantly different from zero in the case of cie fig 5b these findings regarding the daily sd of log10 fio concentrations if they apply at other beaches could be of potential interest with respect to water quality classification systems which use the sd of log10 transformed fio concentrations in their compliance calculations e g eu 2006 directive and who 2003 guidelines criteria fig 6 a and b presents gm fio concentrations their 95 confidence intervals and range for predominantly morning 07 00 to 11 00 gmt and afternoon sample groups 11 30 to 16 00 gmt for i all 60 sampling days ii the 34 days when pgi 10 and iii the 26 days when pgi 10 in all cases the predominantly afternoon samples have statistically significantly lower gms than the predominantly morning samples fig 6c and d provide a similar analysis using data from the 24 days during which sampling was extended to 19 00 comparing three time periods of 07 00 to 11 00 11 30 to 15 00 and 15 30 to 19 00 again reported for the all 24 days and the days in the two pgi risk categories in all cases the early afternoon period exhibits the lowest gm concentration for both e coli and cie despite the relatively small number of sampling days available for the comparisons the early afternoon gm is significantly different to the morning period gm for all comparisons except the comparison of gm e coli concentrations for the days when pgi was 10 fig 6c in the case of cie the early afternoon gm is significantly lower than the gms for both other periods when comparing data for all 24 days and the 13 days with pgi 0 1 fig 6d fig 7 presents the gm fio concentrations in samples taken at each half hour time point through the full study the pattern for all days shows a steady decline through the morning and early afternoon with the gm concentrations steadily increasing again in the late afternoon and evening from 16 00 onwards however it must be noted that the post 16 00 values are based on smaller numbers of sample results as indicated by the wider confidence intervals shown in fig 7 on the days with pgi 10 this diurnal pattern is more subdued for example the daily maxima and minima for the cie gm half hourly concentrations during the morning early afternoon decline fig 7 d e and f are i all data maximum 07 00 69 cfu 100 ml minimum 14 00 19 cfu 100 ml ii days with pgi 0 1 maximum 07 00 30 cfu 100 ml minimum 13 00 7 cfu 100 ml iii days with pgi 0 1 maximum 07 00 199 cfu 100 ml minimum 15 00 51 cfu 100 ml fig 7 presents the full season s data and there is of course considerable variability in this diurnal pattern for individual days where for example rainfall events increase bacterial inputs and or spring neap tidal cycles vary the intertidal swept area of beach which is a likely source of avian and possibly canine fio loadings to the beach surface thus a high between group i e pgi 10 vs pgi 10 variability is to be expected as indicated in fig 3a and this exceeds the within day variability for the full data set 3 3 compliance implications of the daily patterns in microbial water quality this apparent diurnal pattern has a major impact on the compliance level achieved over the bathing season during each hour table 3 a presents the compliance levels for the two periods in fig 6a and b the three periods in fig 6c and d are presented in table 3b and for each hour of the day from 07 00 to 19 00 in table 3c one implication of the results in table 3c is that on average a poor classification results from sampling before 11 00 or after 17 00 with compliance at the minimum eu sufficient or better level between 11 00 and 17 00 and a good classification if regulatory samples were taken between 14 00 and 15 00 however the conclusions regarding the post 16 00 time period in table 3c should be regarded tentatively due to the reduced number of sample results available for the 90th and 95th percentile calculations the principal parameter driving the classifications in table 3 is cie which tends to be a common observation at uk coastal bathing waters it should be noted that these projected classifications use average data over the full 60 day and 20 week study period and within specific hourly time intervals a range of compliance outcomes will be experienced due to changes in fio influx following for example storm hydrograph events 4 discussion the empirical data collected in this study at the designated bathing water monitoring site in swansea bay uk i e half hourly samples through 60 bathing days in 2011 fully supports the us assessments of boehm et al 2002 wymer et al 2007 and the usepa 2010a b that there is considerable within day variability in fio concentrations at compliance monitoring sites both on days when antecedent weather produces increased fio flux to the bathing water but also surprisingly when antecedent meteorological conditions are more quiescent in the study reported above this typically spanned 1 2 log10 orders within each day of sampling it is clear therefore that a single compliance sample should not be treated as representative of the bathing day water quality even on the day of sample collection the application of consistent compliance sampling times through the bathing season could drive the compliance outcome at any bathing water that exhibits this type of diurnal pattern of water quality see table 3c however at present it is not clear whether this observed and extreme within day variability is a generic observation for all bathing waters or is a characteristic of swansea bay and similar urbanized uk bathing waters an alternative compliance sampling approach worth attention would be to vary the time of sampling ideally randomized through adjustment of sampling runs where they cover multiple bathing waters this approach should provide data more representative of the bathing day there is therefore an urgent need to both assess i within day variability at other sites and importantly ii to explore within day prediction modelling 5 conclusions 1 significant within day variability has been observed in this urbanized uk bathing water which suggests that a single compliance sample should not be used to characterise bathing water quality on the bathing day it remains to be seen whether similar conclusions can be made for other uk bathing waters particularly more rural resorts and indeed whether these observations have wider international application 2 thus the use of compliance data to build and calibrate prediction models which forecast a single value for water quality on the bathing day and are used as a means of public health protection for bathers should be examined to ensure that the predicted water quality provides an adequate representation of health risk throughout the bathing day 3 where bathing water fio concentration exhibits the extreme variability reported in this paper research and management attention should focus on delivery of accurate within day prediction of bathing water microbial quality this could allow warnings for potentially short time periods as is commonly done for adverse tidal conditions which are often marked in the uk by red flags erected by lifeguards at the water s edge 4 such an approach would require intensive sampling to drive model building and testing whilst this would be relatively expensive it could improve both regulatory compliance and public health protection in addition it could also offer a cost effective solution for many at risk in eu directive terms sufficient bathing waters like swansea bay in wales which has not improved over many years despite expenditures of sewerage and other improvements of over 100 m uk 5 if the diurnal pattern observed at swansea bay is a generic observation it would be wholly inappropriate for compliance sampling programme design to be directed to achieve higher compliance levels by choosing the most beneficial time of day for sample collection we would hope that regulatory authorities would choose either the precautionary approach of boehm et al 2002 and usepa 2010b of early morning sampling or seek to characterise the bathing day when most bathers are present in the water by more nearly random sampling during this period allowing for tidal factors and sample transport logistics declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work under the

20031,in densely populated areas surface waters are affected by many sources of pollution besides classical pollutants like nutrients and organic matter that lead to eutrophication micropollutants from various point and non point sources are getting more attention by water quality managers for cost effective management an integrated assessment is needed that takes into account all relevant pollutants and all sources of pollution within a catchment due to the difficulty of identifying and quantifying sources of pollution and the need for considering long term changes in boundary conditions typically substantial uncertainty exists about the consequences of potential management alternatives to improve surface water quality we therefore need integrated assessment methods that are able to deal with multiple objectives and account for various sources of uncertainty this paper aims to contribute to integrated prospective water management by combining a multi criteria decision support methods to structure the decision process and quantify preferences b integrated water quality modelling to predict consequences of management alternatives accounting for uncertainty and c scenario planning to consider uncertainty from potential future climate and socio economic developments to evaluate the future cost effectiveness of water quality management alternatives at the catchment scale it aims to demonstrate the usefulness of multi attribute value functions for water quality assessment to i propagate uncertainties throughout the entire assessment procedure ii facilitate the aggregation of multiple objectives while avoiding discretization errors when using categories for sub objectives iii transparently communicate the results we show how to use such multi attribute value functions for model based decision support in water quality management we showcase the procedure for the mönchaltorfer aa catchment on the swiss plateau we evaluate ten different water quality management alternatives including current practice that tackle macro and micropollutants from a wide spectrum of agricultural and urban sources we evaluate costs and water quality effects of the alternatives under four different socio economic scenarios for the horizon 2050 under present and future climate projections and visualize their uncertainty while the performance of alternatives is catchment specific the methods can be transferred to other places and other management situations results confirm the need for cross sectoral coordination of different management actions and interdisciplinary collaboration to support the development of prospective strategies to improve water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords integrated assessment uncertainty water quality modelling scenario analysis cost effectiveness analysis micropollutants 1 introduction water quality issues in surface waters are caused by many different point and non point sources from urban and agricultural areas howarth et al 2005 conley et al 2009 wittmer et al 2010 pollution of surface waters is caused by various substances including nutrients heavy metals and organic micropollutants ippolito et al 2015 destouni et al 2017 munz et al 2017 spycher et al 2018 as surface waters can only be efficiently managed on the catchment scale and in an integrative manner agarwal et al 2000 all polluting sources and substances should be considered to make cost effective decisions in water quality management such decisions require a catchment scale perspective and need to account for future changes due to factors that are out of scope of water quality management like climate change and socio economic development in the catchment ideally management alternatives would be chosen according to their contribution for improving the overall water quality in the catchment their costs and perhaps other relevant societal objectives multi criteria decision analysis mcda offers numerous methods to support structured decision making and to combine multiple criteria to an overall assessment belton and stewart 2002 gregory et al 2012 these methods are increasingly used to support environmental management decisions kiker et al 2005 the aims of such applications are manifold and include a facilitating participation and a mutual learning process b identifying pros and cons of different management alternatives c identification of consensus solutions that fulfill the management objectives as good as possible major challenges in applying such methods in real world cases include the prediction of consequences of management alternatives regarding their fulfillment of objectives and the quantification of preferences of decision makers stakeholders or the public regarding the different objectives reichert et al 2015 in the field of water quality management a current review documents large variability in the effectiveness of different management alternatives liu et al 2017 that are largely context dependent to quantify the current state of knowledge about their expected effectiveness integrated water quality models are needed honti et al 2017 because such predictions may yield high uncertainty the decision support framework needs to account for these uncertainties and provide guidance how to deal with them to support rational decision making in environmental management wardekker et al 2008 sigel et al 2010 warmink et al 2010 uncertainty assessment was identified as one of the key issues for integrated assessment and modelling hamilton et al 2015 and several typologies for the description of different aspects of uncertainty assessment have been developed e g walker et al 2003 warmink et al 2010 in this paper we introduce a model based decision support framework for water quality management that combines the assessment of water quality management alternatives with uncertain consequences regarding multiple objectives with scenario planning to account for impacts of future developments that are out of scope of water quality management we therefore explicitly deal here with two major sources of uncertainty the future development of external boundary conditions climate and socio economic development and uncertainty of model predictions about the consequences of management alternatives conditional on the boundary conditions honti et al 2017 we use multi attribute value theory dyer and sarin 1979 eisenfuehr et al 2010 to formulate a value function that describes the preferences regarding the fulfillment of the objectives including trade offs between objectives unlike in standard examples for decision support the preferences regarding water quality do not reflect subjective preferences of decision makers or stakeholders but should reflect the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of different substances on ecosystem and human health they have to account for legal provisions and will be based on existing water quality assessment procedures these assessment procedures are based on immission standards i e they assess the water quality in the receiving water and therefore allow integrated assessment of different sources of impairment in contrast emission standards assess each point source separately freni et al 2010 which is helpful for source control but does not consider the combined effects of different sources of pollution we illustrate the framework with an application to a catchment on the densely populated swiss plateau that is affected by urban and agricultural point and non point source pollution honti et al 2017 in this case study we aim for evaluating costs and effects of multiple water management alternatives to reduce the input of nutrients and micropollutants in surface waters under four different scenarios of socio economic development under current and future climate conditions with a time horizon of 2050 the ten management alternatives considered include a business as usual alternative and a combination of measures that tackles all sources of pollution while the outcomes of this case study will be very case specific and context dependent the decision support framework and assessment methods accounting for uncertainties of model predictions and of changing boundary conditions are largely independent of the application case and therefore transferable to other cases with this study we aim for demonstrating how to facilitate a cross sectoral coordination of long term water quality management in face of large uncertainties with the help of multi criteria decision theory 2 methods 2 1 multi criteria decision analysis concept the general decision support framework we use here consists of 8 steps fig 1 and is based on the concept of value focused thinking keeney 1996 in this section we briefly outline these steps which will be illustrated in more detail by means of a concrete application below the first step consists of a definition of the decision context and the scope of the decision this includes a clarification of people to be involved in the decision making process and their roles as well as important boundary conditions e g regarding the spatial and temporal scale in the next step the fundamental objectives are identified that should be fulfilled by the management alternatives these should include all important decision criteria to be considered the objectives are structured in form of a hierarchy to facilitate the discussion among stakeholders and the quantification of preferences the next steps can be carried out in different orders or even in parallel they consist of the selection of management alternatives that should be assessed and on the quantification of preferences in this case the definition of a so called measurable value function dyer and sarin 1979 that describes the degree of fulfillment of objectives based on measurable attributes such a value function maps the attribute levels to an interval scale between 0 and 1 which reflects 0 100 fulfillment of the objective a value of zero corresponds to the worst case level of the attribute and 1 to the best level that the attribute can take see fig s1 for examples in general apart from these two anchor points the value function can take any form that represents the preferences of the decision maker and is not restricted to any formal assumption e g linearity or monotonicity if different stakeholders should be involved in the decision support process we can elicit a value function for each person or stakeholder group applying the value function s to the current state allows identifying current deficits regarding the fulfilment of objectives the identification of sub objectives that are currently not fulfilled can inspire the creation of management alternatives reichert et al 2015 especially at the lowest level of the objectives hierarchy where the objectives are very concrete for example the identification of specific substances that currently exceed the legal thresholds may help identifying potential management alternatives if they can be linked to specific sources of pollution in some cases the quantification of preferences may be easier if the prediction of consequences is already available in this case sensitivity analyses can help to focus the elicitation of preferences on the most relevant parts of the value function scholten et al 2015 the prediction of consequences of any given alternative should be based on the current state of knowledge and be done as objective as possible whereas the quantification of preferences usually reflects the subjective values of the decision maker or stakeholders if the fulfillment of the objectives monotonically increases or decreases with the measurable attributes i e the more the better or the less the better a dominance analysis can reveal if there are any alternatives that are equal or inferior to others in all aspects and inferior in at least one aspect even without knowing the full preference structure eisenfuehr et al 2010 however conflicting objectives are typical for environmental decision making for example alternatives might be either more effective or less costly in this case the trade off that people are willing to make between costs and effects decides which alternative is preferred the cheaper or the more effective one in the last step all alternatives are evaluated based on the prediction of consequences and the quantified preferences of all stakeholders this step reveals how well the different alternatives fulfill the objectives and if there are consensus solutions that satisfy all stakeholders or strong conflicts the analysis of deficits of certain alternatives may also stimulate the creation of new alternatives which would lead to an iterative procedure hostmann et al 2005a 2005b 2 2 water quality modelling concept to predict future consequences of management alternatives regarding costs and water quality we need to account also for future changes in boundary conditions that are out of scope of local water quality management these include climate change that will affect hydrological conditions as well as socio economic changes that may affect management costs and sources of pollution since it is difficult to predict the local effects of both climate change and socio economic changes for a time horizon of several decades we use scenarios that try to cover different realizations of the future without specifying how probable they are lienert et al 2015 we use these scenarios as inputs into hydrological and water quality models as well as for cost estimates quantifying conditional probabilities for cost and effects conditional on these scenarios fig 2 according to the terminology of warmink et al 2010 the locations of uncertainty which are quantified by the water quality model cover input model structure and parameter uncertainty honti et al 2017 the levels of uncertainty can be classified into scenario uncertainty regarding external socio economic and climate conditions and statistical uncertainty regarding the water quality model outcomes and costs the nature of uncertainty is dominated by epistemic uncertainty imperfect knowledge but also includes natural variability of the system aleatory uncertainty 2 3 introduction to case study we concretize these concepts with a case study in the mönchaltorfer aa catchment at the densely populated swiss plateau the goal of this case study is to assess the performance of different water quality management strategies to improve water quality at the outlet of the mönchaltorfer aa catchment with a time horizon of 2050 the catchment has an extent of 43 km2 with currently 24000 inhabitants living in five municipalities intensive agriculture 57 forest 15 and urban settlements 11 are most important land uses geostat 1997 see fig 3 the lowest point of the case study area is at 440 m above sea level the fraction of treated wastewater in the mönchaltorfer aa is 30 50 of the mean river discharge of 1 1 m3 s the mönchaltorfer aa flows into greifensee a eutrophic lake with a surface of 8 5 km2 and an average depth of 18 m bundesamt für umwelt bafu 2016 1 1 swisstopo 2015 vector200 tlm dv 5704 000 000 reproduced with permission of swisstopo ja100119 eawag 2014 wwtp of

fundamental objectives in this decision context are a good water quality and low costs sub objectives regarding water quality include natural nutrient concentrations and no pollution by organic micropollutants and heavy metals here we present the objectives hierarchy restricted to objectives regarding nutrients and pesticides for which the attributes could be predicted within this study fig 4 honti et al 2017 to account for mixture toxicity of pesticides the different pesticides are grouped according to their toxic modes of action which are photosynthesis inhibition influence on auxin activity very long chain fatty acid synthesis inhibition and acetylcholinesterase inhibition the objectives are formulated accordingly an alternative approach suggests to group the micropollutants according to the most sensitive target organism groups which would be straight forward to implement as well junghans et al 2013 2 5 quantification of preferences preferences regarding different objectives are generally subjective they may differ between decision makers and stakeholder groups and depend on the context of the decision situation as described above we can derive them by eliciting multi attribute value functions from the stakeholders in face to face interviews eisenfuehr et al 2010 or in combination with online questionnaires scholten et al 2015 however in the context of water quality management it makes sense to use existing water quality assessment procedures that were developed to describe the water quality based on substance concentrations since it should reflect legislative constraints and potential effects of the different pollutants on the ecosystem existing immission oriented water quality assessment methods in switzerland and the eu are usually based on 5 color coded water quality classes european union 2000 table 1 we show here that it is useful to translate the existing water quality assessment procedures into so called measurable value functions that describe the degree of the fulfillment of the objectives from 0 to 100 langhans et al 2013 this ensures a consistent approach for a continuous evaluation instead of only discrete classes that avoids the propagation of discretization errors furthermore it facilitates the propagation of uncertainties through all levels of the objectives hierarchy the identification of appropriate methods to aggregate the values of sub objectives to higher level objectives langhans et al 2014 haag et al 2018 and a transparent and consistent communication of the results for nutrients we used a translation of the nutrient module of the swiss modular concept for stream assessment bundi et al 2000 liechti 2010 expressed as a value function see fig s1 the assessment procedure for pesticides is based on a method used by the cantonal authority in charge of water quality management in the case study region awel 2006 pesticides are grouped according to their mode of action and compared to their chronic and acute environmental quality standards eqs table s2 to derive a risk quotient that takes into account the toxic potency of each substance the establishment of environmental quality standards for pesticides in switzerland are currently in the political consultation and the development of a national assessment procedure based on biweekly composite samples is currently under development the attributes for all water quality parameters range from a concentration of 0 unpolluted water corresponding to 1 on the value scale to the worst case to be expected in swiss rivers corresponding to 0 on the value scale the legal thresholds as defined by the swiss water protection legislation correspond to a value of 0 6 on the value scale table 1 on the higher levels of the objectives hierarchy fig 4 we have to find aggregation functions that describe how the fulfillment of each higher level objective depends on its sub objectives for ecological assessments the most often used aggregation functions are the additive aggregation i e weighted arithmetic mean and minimum aggregation also called worst case or one out all out table 2 fig 5 while additive aggregation allows for full compensation between good and bad sub objectives the minimum aggregation reflects the value of the worst sub objective only and is insensitive to improvements or deteriorations if they do not affect the worst sub objective since neither properties are satisfactory in this context langhans et al 2014 haag et al 2018 we propose here two other aggregation functions that are a compromise between these extremes the additive minimum and the geometric offset aggregation table 2 fig 5 both aggregation functions allow only partial compensation between good and bad sub objectives but are able to reflect changes in all sub objectives according to their weights and parameters haag et al 2018 most pronounced differences between the aggregation functions exist when one of the sub objectives is very good and the other is very bad for the examples given in fig 5 assuming equal weights of both sub objectives α 0 5 and δ 0 1 respectively for v n u t r i e n t s 0 and v p e s t i c i d e s 1 the aggregated values would be v m i n 0 v a d d 0 5 v a d d m i n 0 25 and v g e o o f f 0 23 we considered four possibilities for confronting water quality effects and costs 1 to elicit a case specific value function for costs and the trade offs between costs and water quality effects from stakeholders and decision makers eisenfuehr et al 2010 haag et al 2018 2 to optimize water quality under given budget constraints 3 to minimize costs for a certain water quality target and 4 to visualize costs and water quality in trade off diagrams under the current policy system in switzerland it is unrealistic to expect that water quality managers will have a combined budget from which they can choose the most suitable management alternative in each catchment usually for each type of management alternative e g addressing agriculture or urban wastewater there is a separate often national policy which defines targets budget constraints and financing instruments however even in this situation an integrated water quality assessment is needed because these sectoral policies still usually require a spatial prioritization of measures which profits from cross sectoral coordination and because the managers should be informed about the effects they can expect which requires an overview about changes regarding all sources of pollution we therefore consider the fourth option the most interesting for our case study however depending on the policy process the other three options might be suitable as well and would be straightforward to implement the value function was implemented in r r development core team 2017 using the packages utility reichert et al 2013 and ecoval schuwirth and reichert 2014 2 6 management alternatives the management alternatives were chosen to tackle all important sources of pollution by at least one alternative in the catchment table 3 point sources include wastewater treatment plants and combined or separated storm water sewers non point sources include losses from agricultural areas via run off spray drift or drainage systems the management alternatives include a current practice or business as usual alternative as well as a combination of several measures to tackle all known sources of pollution at once a more detailed description can be found in honti et al 2017 2 7 socio economic scenarios we adapted four socio economic scenarios which were developed for the time horizon of 2050 in a workshop with stakeholders from four municipalities in the catchment of the mönchaltorfer aa lienert et al 2015 and extrapolated them to the whole catchment table 4 the scenarios are defined in terms of a change in the mean taxable income of the inhabitants in the catchment based on assumptions about the future economic growth in switzerland a change in population and urban area within the catchment lienert et al 2015 the status quo scenario serves as a baseline while the exploding growth and decline scenarios cover rather extreme changes which the stakeholders considered possible 2 8 climate scenario we took the a1b emission scenario from the ipcc 4th assessment report considering more emission scenarios did not make sense as the time horizon of predictions lies in the range where cross scenario differences are still negligible ten global and regional climate model gcm rcm couplings were used from the ensembles data archive to train weather generators for the study site honti et al 2017 the divergence of predictions of the 10 gcm rcm chains represents climatic uncertainty for the future which was propagated through the model as described below 2 9 prediction of consequences 2 9 1 water quality predictions a detailed description of the water quality model used for predicting the effects of management alternatives under future scenarios is given in honti et al 2017 in short the model covers traditional water quality parameters and a wide set of organic micropollutants out of the physical and water quality parameters handled by the model only nutrients and certain pesticides are considered here the model provides a parsimonious conceptual description of all major pollutant pathways in the urban and agricultural environment including point and non point sources and a simplified representation of the urban water infrastructure simplicity was an intentional development objective to allow for a full propagation of input observation and model uncertainty through all calculations and to make scenario development feasible the model was calibrated and run for the same catchment the mönchaltorfer aa model performance during calibration was excellent for traditional pollutants mediocre for pesticides and just acceptable for biocides honti et al 2017 prediction uncertainty varied accordingly and is therefore very important to consider predictions covered 30 years of continuous daily step time series out of which artificial grab samples were taken to mimic the current monitoring procedure and apply the water quality assessment thus for all combinations of management alternatives climate and socio economic scenarios the output of the model was a sample for each attribute derived by monte carlo simulations this sample was propagated to the multi attribute value function to derive a sample at the value scale that describes the degree of fulfillment of each management objective from this we derived the median and the 5 and 95 quantiles to visualize the assessment results and their uncertainty 2 9 2 cost estimation for the purpose of estimating the costs of management alternatives under different socio economic scenarios it is assumed that specific management alternatives are declared mandatory within the mönchaltorfer aa study area a detailed description of the cost estimation procedure for each management alternative is provided in the supplementary material the costs of urban management alternatives are expressed on an annual basis for each urban management alternative we use the most reliable existing data or market prices and provide the minimum maximum and best cost estimate the minimum and maximum cost estimates can be considered as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals around the best estimate and are used for the uncertainty analysis the costs of the agricultural management alternatives can occur due to i a decrease in agricultural income and in workload or ii an increase in workload which reduces the productivity of farming in the former case the cost of an alternative represents the difference between the contribution margin under the current conditions and the contribution margin under the new conditions in the latter case the costs are estimated as the loss in agricultural income earned per working hour for any workload that exceeds that of the reference situation 3 results and discussion in the following sections we present the consequences of the management alternatives on water quality 3 1 costs 3 2 and trade offs between water quality effects and costs 3 3 in addition we discuss the prerequisites to transfer the approach to other management cases 3 4 3 1 water quality 3 1 1 current state deficit analysis a deficit analysis for the current state reveals that all sites that are influenced by wastewater treatment plants m00 m02 m03 m05 are affected by nitrate and phosphate pollution fig 6 in addition most sites in the catchment all but m11 are impaired by photosynthesis inhibitors the uncertainty assessment for the catchment outlet fig 7 for current practice present climate and status quo scenario reveals that the large uncertainties in pesticides predictions honti et al 2017 lead to large uncertainty regarding the assessment class especially for auxin activity and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors the 90 uncertainty interval covers all five water quality classes from bad to high the two different aggregation techniques additive minimum and geometric offset lead to minor differences in both cases the overall water quality and pesticide assessment indicates a poor state the nutrient assessment a moderate state since results were similar in the following we only show the results from additive minimum aggregation 3 1 2 evaluation of alternatives we first compare the assessment results for the different management alternatives for the present climate and the status quo scenario at the catchment outlet fig 8 only the alternative all that tackles all sources of pollution has a high probability to reach a good water quality the pesticides sub objectives achei and auxinact are already in good to high state for current practice but with large uncertainty only the alternatives orgfarm natpark and all are effective in further improving them the sub objective vlcfasi is similar but less uncertain the worst sub objective of pesticides are the photosynthesis inhibitors photosynthi which have a bad mean state but large uncertainty from the single alternatives only banbioc can improve it to a mean good state and only all leads to very good state with high certainty regarding the aggregated pesticides assessment banbioc is the only effective single measure which leads to a good state but with high uncertainty and only the combined alterntive all leads to a certain high state for nutrients nh4 is already good to high under current practice and is unaffected by the management alternatives the sub objective po4 has poor to good state under current practice but is unaffected by the management alternatives no3 is bad to moderate under current practice and significantly improved only by wwtp and all to a good state while natpark leads to a minor improvement similarly the overall nutrient assessment has a poor to moderate state for current practice and is significantly improved by wwtp and all to a moderate to good state the overall water quality assessment is poor to moderate for current practice the alternatives storevol permpav rainret bufzone show no effect the alternatives banbioc and also wwtp orgfarm and natpark lead to minor improvements and only all leads to significant improvement to a good state because the respective measures are linked to different policy and management fields agriculture urban water management restrictions on biocide use etc this result supports the need for cross sectorial coordination to achieve a good water quality status the tools presented here can help communicating expected outcomes including the respective uncertainties in a transparent manner to stakeholders of the different sectors next we compare the influence of climate and socio economic scenarios on the effects of the management alternatives on the overall water quality assessment fig 9 both climate and socio economic scenarios have rather minor influences on the overall water quality assessment but may affect the ranking of management alternatives based on median values due to the small differences between some of the alternatives in general under future climate the results are expected to be slightly worse than under present climate while the moderate growth and decline scenarios lead to very similar results compared to the status quo the exponential growth scenario reduces the chance of reaching moderate or good state for all single management alternatives while the combined alternative all performs similarly to the other socio economic scenarios in general the effectiveness of the management measures appears fairly robust against the potential socio economic and climate changes considered in this study fig 9 3 2 costs the relevance of absolute costs depends on the overall economic situation and the population size which is reflected in the different socio economic scenarios therefore the costs presented here fig 10 are expressed per inhabitant and in relative terms that is as of the mean taxable income which is assumed to differ between socio economic scenarios table 4 such an approach is expected to better reflect the implications of implementing a management alternative for tax payers under specific socio economic conditions the absolute costs are presented in the supplementary material table s16 the influence of the socio economic scenarios on the costs is much larger than on the water quality the higher the assumed economic and population growth the lower the relative costs the most expensive single alternative under the scenarios statquo modgro and decline is natpark due to the loss in agricultural income under expgro it is banbioc but under this scenario all costs are comparably low due to the expected growth of the taxable income at an annual rate of 4 3 3 trade offs between costs and effects while the combination of single alternatives that tackle all sources of pollution all is the only alternative that can be expected to lead to a good water quality i e median v 0 6 in all future scenarios it comes with comparably high costs fig 11 only the nature park alternative natpark comes with similarly high costs but is much less effective since it only tackles agricultural sources while the effects of the management alternatives on water quality can be expected to be rather robust against the future climate and socio economic scenarios the costs relative to the mean income vary substantially between socio economic scenarios fig 11 right panel from the single alternatives only the banning of biocides in facades banbioc shows a significant improvement compared to current practice and it comes with comparably low costs 3 4 transferability of the water quality management framework from a conceptual point of view the suggested water quality management framework can be applied to other places and or other management questions however this requires a consideration of each step of the decision support process fig 1 as described in sections 2 1 and 2 2 in collaboration with the decision makers and potentially an adaptation compared to our case study since each case may be different we only briefly discuss here some recommendations for the water quality assessment step the existing water quality assessment methods differ between countries and we consider here only approaches based on immission standards within the eu they usually provide an assessment based on 5 color coded quality classes according to the water framework directive wfd annex v 1 2 in this case the translation into a continuous function may just require a piecewise linear interpolation between class boundaries similar to our case study see table s1 and fig s1 a definition of the concentration that corresponds to a value of 1 best case e g concentration of 0 for synthetic pollutants or natural background values for geogenic substances and the worst case concentration that corresponds to a value of 0 in other cases where only binary pass fail criteria exist a continuous value function could be derived based on three anchor points for the concentrations corresponding to a value of 0 and 1 worst and best case see above and the value of 0 6 that corresponds to the legal threshold if perceived as appropriate if the development of a 5 class assessment procedure does not seem to be appropriate only two color coded classes could be introduced e g red for failing and green for passing the criteria to visualize the results see fig s6 for an example however this approach would then lead to less detailed information alternatively the value functions could be elicited from experts using standard elicitation procedures from multi criteria decision science e g eisenfuehr et al 2010 the hierarchical aggregation could be done as in the presented case study in any case if the procedure should inform the decision making process in practice it requires a consensus about the assessment procedure with decision makers and stakeholders if such a consensus cannot be achieved alternative assessment procedures can be developed e g one for each stakeholder group and their implications to the results visualized for practical applications the objective hierarchy and the value function can be implemented with the r package utility reichert et al 2013 with other decision support software or just with a simple spreadsheet an example for the implementation of value functions in r is provided in the supplementary material si section 6 4 conclusions water quality management is a typical example for environmental decision making that has to deal with multiple objectives many different alternatives large uncertainties in the prediction of their consequences and has to account for fairly long term changes in boundary conditions that cannot directly be influenced by local management such as socio economic development or changing climate conditions for water quality management decisions it is important to be informed about the changes in substance concentrations that can be expected from different management alternatives however since usually many different substances have to be considered that stem from various sources of pollution an integrated assessment is necessary that helps dealing with the multi objective nature of the decision problem and helps propagating and visualizing the associated uncertainties since the decisions affect many stakeholders a transparent communication of the decision basis is of particular importance with this study we introduced a framework to combine the use of multi attribute value functions for integrated assessment with water quality modelling and scenario planning we illustrated its suitability to help informing stakeholders policy makers and the public about the decision problem with a full account of the uncertainties of expected outcomes a central element of the presented framework is to use a continuous value scale for each sub objective this avoids the propagation of discretization errors from the lowest to the highest level of the objectives hierarchy but still allows translating the values into color coded quality classes which have a familiar meaning to the decision makers at all levels of the objectives hierarchy this allows choosing the appropriate level of detail for a transparent discussion of the effects of different management alternatives with stakeholders policy makers or the public while the methods and visualizations used are generalizable to other water quality management decisions the outcomes of the case study are very catchment specific because they depend on the local conditions and the contributions of the different sources of pollution which may vary substantially between catchments our results show that especially when uncertainty at the lowest level of the objectives hierarchy is large and varies between alternatives it is very insightful to propagate the uncertainty to the value scale and translate it into water quality classes that have a clear meaning for policy makers and managers the combination with scenario planning for boundary conditions that are hard to predict allows evaluating the robustness of the performance of different management alternatives to future changes this study confirms the need for a cross sectoral coordination between different management actions to achieve larger ecological effects smiley et al 2009 paillex et al 2017 even if the funding instruments and implementation strategies depend on sectoral policies declarations of interest none acknowledgement this study was

20031,in densely populated areas surface waters are affected by many sources of pollution besides classical pollutants like nutrients and organic matter that lead to eutrophication micropollutants from various point and non point sources are getting more attention by water quality managers for cost effective management an integrated assessment is needed that takes into account all relevant pollutants and all sources of pollution within a catchment due to the difficulty of identifying and quantifying sources of pollution and the need for considering long term changes in boundary conditions typically substantial uncertainty exists about the consequences of potential management alternatives to improve surface water quality we therefore need integrated assessment methods that are able to deal with multiple objectives and account for various sources of uncertainty this paper aims to contribute to integrated prospective water management by combining a multi criteria decision support methods to structure the decision process and quantify preferences b integrated water quality modelling to predict consequences of management alternatives accounting for uncertainty and c scenario planning to consider uncertainty from potential future climate and socio economic developments to evaluate the future cost effectiveness of water quality management alternatives at the catchment scale it aims to demonstrate the usefulness of multi attribute value functions for water quality assessment to i propagate uncertainties throughout the entire assessment procedure ii facilitate the aggregation of multiple objectives while avoiding discretization errors when using categories for sub objectives iii transparently communicate the results we show how to use such multi attribute value functions for model based decision support in water quality management we showcase the procedure for the mönchaltorfer aa catchment on the swiss plateau we evaluate ten different water quality management alternatives including current practice that tackle macro and micropollutants from a wide spectrum of agricultural and urban sources we evaluate costs and water quality effects of the alternatives under four different socio economic scenarios for the horizon 2050 under present and future climate projections and visualize their uncertainty while the performance of alternatives is catchment specific the methods can be transferred to other places and other management situations results confirm the need for cross sectoral coordination of different management actions and interdisciplinary collaboration to support the development of prospective strategies to improve water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords integrated assessment uncertainty water quality modelling scenario analysis cost effectiveness analysis micropollutants 1 introduction water quality issues in surface waters are caused by many different point and non point sources from urban and agricultural areas howarth et al 2005 conley et al 2009 wittmer et al 2010 pollution of surface waters is caused by various substances including nutrients heavy metals and organic micropollutants ippolito et al 2015 destouni et al 2017 munz et al 2017 spycher et al 2018 as surface waters can only be efficiently managed on the catchment scale and in an integrative manner agarwal et al 2000 all polluting sources and substances should be considered to make cost effective decisions in water quality management such decisions require a catchment scale perspective and need to account for future changes due to factors that are out of scope of water quality management like climate change and socio economic development in the catchment ideally management alternatives would be chosen according to their contribution for improving the overall water quality in the catchment their costs and perhaps other relevant societal objectives multi criteria decision analysis mcda offers numerous methods to support structured decision making and to combine multiple criteria to an overall assessment belton and stewart 2002 gregory et al 2012 these methods are increasingly used to support environmental management decisions kiker et al 2005 the aims of such applications are manifold and include a facilitating participation and a mutual learning process b identifying pros and cons of different management alternatives c identification of consensus solutions that fulfill the management objectives as good as possible major challenges in applying such methods in real world cases include the prediction of consequences of management alternatives regarding their fulfillment of objectives and the quantification of preferences of decision makers stakeholders or the public regarding the different objectives reichert et al 2015 in the field of water quality management a current review documents large variability in the effectiveness of different management alternatives liu et al 2017 that are largely context dependent to quantify the current state of knowledge about their expected effectiveness integrated water quality models are needed honti et al 2017 because such predictions may yield high uncertainty the decision support framework needs to account for these uncertainties and provide guidance how to deal with them to support rational decision making in environmental management wardekker et al 2008 sigel et al 2010 warmink et al 2010 uncertainty assessment was identified as one of the key issues for integrated assessment and modelling hamilton et al 2015 and several typologies for the description of different aspects of uncertainty assessment have been developed e g walker et al 2003 warmink et al 2010 in this paper we introduce a model based decision support framework for water quality management that combines the assessment of water quality management alternatives with uncertain consequences regarding multiple objectives with scenario planning to account for impacts of future developments that are out of scope of water quality management we therefore explicitly deal here with two major sources of uncertainty the future development of external boundary conditions climate and socio economic development and uncertainty of model predictions about the consequences of management alternatives conditional on the boundary conditions honti et al 2017 we use multi attribute value theory dyer and sarin 1979 eisenfuehr et al 2010 to formulate a value function that describes the preferences regarding the fulfillment of the objectives including trade offs between objectives unlike in standard examples for decision support the preferences regarding water quality do not reflect subjective preferences of decision makers or stakeholders but should reflect the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of different substances on ecosystem and human health they have to account for legal provisions and will be based on existing water quality assessment procedures these assessment procedures are based on immission standards i e they assess the water quality in the receiving water and therefore allow integrated assessment of different sources of impairment in contrast emission standards assess each point source separately freni et al 2010 which is helpful for source control but does not consider the combined effects of different sources of pollution we illustrate the framework with an application to a catchment on the densely populated swiss plateau that is affected by urban and agricultural point and non point source pollution honti et al 2017 in this case study we aim for evaluating costs and effects of multiple water management alternatives to reduce the input of nutrients and micropollutants in surface waters under four different scenarios of socio economic development under current and future climate conditions with a time horizon of 2050 the ten management alternatives considered include a business as usual alternative and a combination of measures that tackles all sources of pollution while the outcomes of this case study will be very case specific and context dependent the decision support framework and assessment methods accounting for uncertainties of model predictions and of changing boundary conditions are largely independent of the application case and therefore transferable to other cases with this study we aim for demonstrating how to facilitate a cross sectoral coordination of long term water quality management in face of large uncertainties with the help of multi criteria decision theory 2 methods 2 1 multi criteria decision analysis concept the general decision support framework we use here consists of 8 steps fig 1 and is based on the concept of value focused thinking keeney 1996 in this section we briefly outline these steps which will be illustrated in more detail by means of a concrete application below the first step consists of a definition of the decision context and the scope of the decision this includes a clarification of people to be involved in the decision making process and their roles as well as important boundary conditions e g regarding the spatial and temporal scale in the next step the fundamental objectives are identified that should be fulfilled by the management alternatives these should include all important decision criteria to be considered the objectives are structured in form of a hierarchy to facilitate the discussion among stakeholders and the quantification of preferences the next steps can be carried out in different orders or even in parallel they consist of the selection of management alternatives that should be assessed and on the quantification of preferences in this case the definition of a so called measurable value function dyer and sarin 1979 that describes the degree of fulfillment of objectives based on measurable attributes such a value function maps the attribute levels to an interval scale between 0 and 1 which reflects 0 100 fulfillment of the objective a value of zero corresponds to the worst case level of the attribute and 1 to the best level that the attribute can take see fig s1 for examples in general apart from these two anchor points the value function can take any form that represents the preferences of the decision maker and is not restricted to any formal assumption e g linearity or monotonicity if different stakeholders should be involved in the decision support process we can elicit a value function for each person or stakeholder group applying the value function s to the current state allows identifying current deficits regarding the fulfilment of objectives the identification of sub objectives that are currently not fulfilled can inspire the creation of management alternatives reichert et al 2015 especially at the lowest level of the objectives hierarchy where the objectives are very concrete for example the identification of specific substances that currently exceed the legal thresholds may help identifying potential management alternatives if they can be linked to specific sources of pollution in some cases the quantification of preferences may be easier if the prediction of consequences is already available in this case sensitivity analyses can help to focus the elicitation of preferences on the most relevant parts of the value function scholten et al 2015 the prediction of consequences of any given alternative should be based on the current state of knowledge and be done as objective as possible whereas the quantification of preferences usually reflects the subjective values of the decision maker or stakeholders if the fulfillment of the objectives monotonically increases or decreases with the measurable attributes i e the more the better or the less the better a dominance analysis can reveal if there are any alternatives that are equal or inferior to others in all aspects and inferior in at least one aspect even without knowing the full preference structure eisenfuehr et al 2010 however conflicting objectives are typical for environmental decision making for example alternatives might be either more effective or less costly in this case the trade off that people are willing to make between costs and effects decides which alternative is preferred the cheaper or the more effective one in the last step all alternatives are evaluated based on the prediction of consequences and the quantified preferences of all stakeholders this step reveals how well the different alternatives fulfill the objectives and if there are consensus solutions that satisfy all stakeholders or strong conflicts the analysis of deficits of certain alternatives may also stimulate the creation of new alternatives which would lead to an iterative procedure hostmann et al 2005a 2005b 2 2 water quality modelling concept to predict future consequences of management alternatives regarding costs and water quality we need to account also for future changes in boundary conditions that are out of scope of local water quality management these include climate change that will affect hydrological conditions as well as socio economic changes that may affect management costs and sources of pollution since it is difficult to predict the local effects of both climate change and socio economic changes for a time horizon of several decades we use scenarios that try to cover different realizations of the future without specifying how probable they are lienert et al 2015 we use these scenarios as inputs into hydrological and water quality models as well as for cost estimates quantifying conditional probabilities for cost and effects conditional on these scenarios fig 2 according to the terminology of warmink et al 2010 the locations of uncertainty which are quantified by the water quality model cover input model structure and parameter uncertainty honti et al 2017 the levels of uncertainty can be classified into scenario uncertainty regarding external socio economic and climate conditions and statistical uncertainty regarding the water quality model outcomes and costs the nature of uncertainty is dominated by epistemic uncertainty imperfect knowledge but also includes natural variability of the system aleatory uncertainty 2 3 introduction to case study we concretize these concepts with a case study in the mönchaltorfer aa catchment at the densely populated swiss plateau the goal of this case study is to assess the performance of different water quality management strategies to improve water quality at the outlet of the mönchaltorfer aa catchment with a time horizon of 2050 the catchment has an extent of 43 km2 with currently 24000 inhabitants living in five municipalities intensive agriculture 57 forest 15 and urban settlements 11 are most important land uses geostat 1997 see fig 3 the lowest point of the case study area is at 440 m above sea level the fraction of treated wastewater in the mönchaltorfer aa is 30 50 of the mean river discharge of 1 1 m3 s the mönchaltorfer aa flows into greifensee a eutrophic lake with a surface of 8 5 km2 and an average depth of 18 m bundesamt für umwelt bafu 2016 1 1 swisstopo 2015 vector200 tlm dv 5704 000 000 reproduced with permission of swisstopo ja100119 eawag 2014 wwtp of

fundamental objectives in this decision context are a good water quality and low costs sub objectives regarding water quality include natural nutrient concentrations and no pollution by organic micropollutants and heavy metals here we present the objectives hierarchy restricted to objectives regarding nutrients and pesticides for which the attributes could be predicted within this study fig 4 honti et al 2017 to account for mixture toxicity of pesticides the different pesticides are grouped according to their toxic modes of action which are photosynthesis inhibition influence on auxin activity very long chain fatty acid synthesis inhibition and acetylcholinesterase inhibition the objectives are formulated accordingly an alternative approach suggests to group the micropollutants according to the most sensitive target organism groups which would be straight forward to implement as well junghans et al 2013 2 5 quantification of preferences preferences regarding different objectives are generally subjective they may differ between decision makers and stakeholder groups and depend on the context of the decision situation as described above we can derive them by eliciting multi attribute value functions from the stakeholders in face to face interviews eisenfuehr et al 2010 or in combination with online questionnaires scholten et al 2015 however in the context of water quality management it makes sense to use existing water quality assessment procedures that were developed to describe the water quality based on substance concentrations since it should reflect legislative constraints and potential effects of the different pollutants on the ecosystem existing immission oriented water quality assessment methods in switzerland and the eu are usually based on 5 color coded water quality classes european union 2000 table 1 we show here that it is useful to translate the existing water quality assessment procedures into so called measurable value functions that describe the degree of the fulfillment of the objectives from 0 to 100 langhans et al 2013 this ensures a consistent approach for a continuous evaluation instead of only discrete classes that avoids the propagation of discretization errors furthermore it facilitates the propagation of uncertainties through all levels of the objectives hierarchy the identification of appropriate methods to aggregate the values of sub objectives to higher level objectives langhans et al 2014 haag et al 2018 and a transparent and consistent communication of the results for nutrients we used a translation of the nutrient module of the swiss modular concept for stream assessment bundi et al 2000 liechti 2010 expressed as a value function see fig s1 the assessment procedure for pesticides is based on a method used by the cantonal authority in charge of water quality management in the case study region awel 2006 pesticides are grouped according to their mode of action and compared to their chronic and acute environmental quality standards eqs table s2 to derive a risk quotient that takes into account the toxic potency of each substance the establishment of environmental quality standards for pesticides in switzerland are currently in the political consultation and the development of a national assessment procedure based on biweekly composite samples is currently under development the attributes for all water quality parameters range from a concentration of 0 unpolluted water corresponding to 1 on the value scale to the worst case to be expected in swiss rivers corresponding to 0 on the value scale the legal thresholds as defined by the swiss water protection legislation correspond to a value of 0 6 on the value scale table 1 on the higher levels of the objectives hierarchy fig 4 we have to find aggregation functions that describe how the fulfillment of each higher level objective depends on its sub objectives for ecological assessments the most often used aggregation functions are the additive aggregation i e weighted arithmetic mean and minimum aggregation also called worst case or one out all out table 2 fig 5 while additive aggregation allows for full compensation between good and bad sub objectives the minimum aggregation reflects the value of the worst sub objective only and is insensitive to improvements or deteriorations if they do not affect the worst sub objective since neither properties are satisfactory in this context langhans et al 2014 haag et al 2018 we propose here two other aggregation functions that are a compromise between these extremes the additive minimum and the geometric offset aggregation table 2 fig 5 both aggregation functions allow only partial compensation between good and bad sub objectives but are able to reflect changes in all sub objectives according to their weights and parameters haag et al 2018 most pronounced differences between the aggregation functions exist when one of the sub objectives is very good and the other is very bad for the examples given in fig 5 assuming equal weights of both sub objectives α 0 5 and δ 0 1 respectively for v n u t r i e n t s 0 and v p e s t i c i d e s 1 the aggregated values would be v m i n 0 v a d d 0 5 v a d d m i n 0 25 and v g e o o f f 0 23 we considered four possibilities for confronting water quality effects and costs 1 to elicit a case specific value function for costs and the trade offs between costs and water quality effects from stakeholders and decision makers eisenfuehr et al 2010 haag et al 2018 2 to optimize water quality under given budget constraints 3 to minimize costs for a certain water quality target and 4 to visualize costs and water quality in trade off diagrams under the current policy system in switzerland it is unrealistic to expect that water quality managers will have a combined budget from which they can choose the most suitable management alternative in each catchment usually for each type of management alternative e g addressing agriculture or urban wastewater there is a separate often national policy which defines targets budget constraints and financing instruments however even in this situation an integrated water quality assessment is needed because these sectoral policies still usually require a spatial prioritization of measures which profits from cross sectoral coordination and because the managers should be informed about the effects they can expect which requires an overview about changes regarding all sources of pollution we therefore consider the fourth option the most interesting for our case study however depending on the policy process the other three options might be suitable as well and would be straightforward to implement the value function was implemented in r r development core team 2017 using the packages utility reichert et al 2013 and ecoval schuwirth and reichert 2014 2 6 management alternatives the management alternatives were chosen to tackle all important sources of pollution by at least one alternative in the catchment table 3 point sources include wastewater treatment plants and combined or separated storm water sewers non point sources include losses from agricultural areas via run off spray drift or drainage systems the management alternatives include a current practice or business as usual alternative as well as a combination of several measures to tackle all known sources of pollution at once a more detailed description can be found in honti et al 2017 2 7 socio economic scenarios we adapted four socio economic scenarios which were developed for the time horizon of 2050 in a workshop with stakeholders from four municipalities in the catchment of the mönchaltorfer aa lienert et al 2015 and extrapolated them to the whole catchment table 4 the scenarios are defined in terms of a change in the mean taxable income of the inhabitants in the catchment based on assumptions about the future economic growth in switzerland a change in population and urban area within the catchment lienert et al 2015 the status quo scenario serves as a baseline while the exploding growth and decline scenarios cover rather extreme changes which the stakeholders considered possible 2 8 climate scenario we took the a1b emission scenario from the ipcc 4th assessment report considering more emission scenarios did not make sense as the time horizon of predictions lies in the range where cross scenario differences are still negligible ten global and regional climate model gcm rcm couplings were used from the ensembles data archive to train weather generators for the study site honti et al 2017 the divergence of predictions of the 10 gcm rcm chains represents climatic uncertainty for the future which was propagated through the model as described below 2 9 prediction of consequences 2 9 1 water quality predictions a detailed description of the water quality model used for predicting the effects of management alternatives under future scenarios is given in honti et al 2017 in short the model covers traditional water quality parameters and a wide set of organic micropollutants out of the physical and water quality parameters handled by the model only nutrients and certain pesticides are considered here the model provides a parsimonious conceptual description of all major pollutant pathways in the urban and agricultural environment including point and non point sources and a simplified representation of the urban water infrastructure simplicity was an intentional development objective to allow for a full propagation of input observation and model uncertainty through all calculations and to make scenario development feasible the model was calibrated and run for the same catchment the mönchaltorfer aa model performance during calibration was excellent for traditional pollutants mediocre for pesticides and just acceptable for biocides honti et al 2017 prediction uncertainty varied accordingly and is therefore very important to consider predictions covered 30 years of continuous daily step time series out of which artificial grab samples were taken to mimic the current monitoring procedure and apply the water quality assessment thus for all combinations of management alternatives climate and socio economic scenarios the output of the model was a sample for each attribute derived by monte carlo simulations this sample was propagated to the multi attribute value function to derive a sample at the value scale that describes the degree of fulfillment of each management objective from this we derived the median and the 5 and 95 quantiles to visualize the assessment results and their uncertainty 2 9 2 cost estimation for the purpose of estimating the costs of management alternatives under different socio economic scenarios it is assumed that specific management alternatives are declared mandatory within the mönchaltorfer aa study area a detailed description of the cost estimation procedure for each management alternative is provided in the supplementary material the costs of urban management alternatives are expressed on an annual basis for each urban management alternative we use the most reliable existing data or market prices and provide the minimum maximum and best cost estimate the minimum and maximum cost estimates can be considered as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals around the best estimate and are used for the uncertainty analysis the costs of the agricultural management alternatives can occur due to i a decrease in agricultural income and in workload or ii an increase in workload which reduces the productivity of farming in the former case the cost of an alternative represents the difference between the contribution margin under the current conditions and the contribution margin under the new conditions in the latter case the costs are estimated as the loss in agricultural income earned per working hour for any workload that exceeds that of the reference situation 3 results and discussion in the following sections we present the consequences of the management alternatives on water quality 3 1 costs 3 2 and trade offs between water quality effects and costs 3 3 in addition we discuss the prerequisites to transfer the approach to other management cases 3 4 3 1 water quality 3 1 1 current state deficit analysis a deficit analysis for the current state reveals that all sites that are influenced by wastewater treatment plants m00 m02 m03 m05 are affected by nitrate and phosphate pollution fig 6 in addition most sites in the catchment all but m11 are impaired by photosynthesis inhibitors the uncertainty assessment for the catchment outlet fig 7 for current practice present climate and status quo scenario reveals that the large uncertainties in pesticides predictions honti et al 2017 lead to large uncertainty regarding the assessment class especially for auxin activity and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors the 90 uncertainty interval covers all five water quality classes from bad to high the two different aggregation techniques additive minimum and geometric offset lead to minor differences in both cases the overall water quality and pesticide assessment indicates a poor state the nutrient assessment a moderate state since results were similar in the following we only show the results from additive minimum aggregation 3 1 2 evaluation of alternatives we first compare the assessment results for the different management alternatives for the present climate and the status quo scenario at the catchment outlet fig 8 only the alternative all that tackles all sources of pollution has a high probability to reach a good water quality the pesticides sub objectives achei and auxinact are already in good to high state for current practice but with large uncertainty only the alternatives orgfarm natpark and all are effective in further improving them the sub objective vlcfasi is similar but less uncertain the worst sub objective of pesticides are the photosynthesis inhibitors photosynthi which have a bad mean state but large uncertainty from the single alternatives only banbioc can improve it to a mean good state and only all leads to very good state with high certainty regarding the aggregated pesticides assessment banbioc is the only effective single measure which leads to a good state but with high uncertainty and only the combined alterntive all leads to a certain high state for nutrients nh4 is already good to high under current practice and is unaffected by the management alternatives the sub objective po4 has poor to good state under current practice but is unaffected by the management alternatives no3 is bad to moderate under current practice and significantly improved only by wwtp and all to a good state while natpark leads to a minor improvement similarly the overall nutrient assessment has a poor to moderate state for current practice and is significantly improved by wwtp and all to a moderate to good state the overall water quality assessment is poor to moderate for current practice the alternatives storevol permpav rainret bufzone show no effect the alternatives banbioc and also wwtp orgfarm and natpark lead to minor improvements and only all leads to significant improvement to a good state because the respective measures are linked to different policy and management fields agriculture urban water management restrictions on biocide use etc this result supports the need for cross sectorial coordination to achieve a good water quality status the tools presented here can help communicating expected outcomes including the respective uncertainties in a transparent manner to stakeholders of the different sectors next we compare the influence of climate and socio economic scenarios on the effects of the management alternatives on the overall water quality assessment fig 9 both climate and socio economic scenarios have rather minor influences on the overall water quality assessment but may affect the ranking of management alternatives based on median values due to the small differences between some of the alternatives in general under future climate the results are expected to be slightly worse than under present climate while the moderate growth and decline scenarios lead to very similar results compared to the status quo the exponential growth scenario reduces the chance of reaching moderate or good state for all single management alternatives while the combined alternative all performs similarly to the other socio economic scenarios in general the effectiveness of the management measures appears fairly robust against the potential socio economic and climate changes considered in this study fig 9 3 2 costs the relevance of absolute costs depends on the overall economic situation and the population size which is reflected in the different socio economic scenarios therefore the costs presented here fig 10 are expressed per inhabitant and in relative terms that is as of the mean taxable income which is assumed to differ between socio economic scenarios table 4 such an approach is expected to better reflect the implications of implementing a management alternative for tax payers under specific socio economic conditions the absolute costs are presented in the supplementary material table s16 the influence of the socio economic scenarios on the costs is much larger than on the water quality the higher the assumed economic and population growth the lower the relative costs the most expensive single alternative under the scenarios statquo modgro and decline is natpark due to the loss in agricultural income under expgro it is banbioc but under this scenario all costs are comparably low due to the expected growth of the taxable income at an annual rate of 4 3 3 trade offs between costs and effects while the combination of single alternatives that tackle all sources of pollution all is the only alternative that can be expected to lead to a good water quality i e median v 0 6 in all future scenarios it comes with comparably high costs fig 11 only the nature park alternative natpark comes with similarly high costs but is much less effective since it only tackles agricultural sources while the effects of the management alternatives on water quality can be expected to be rather robust against the future climate and socio economic scenarios the costs relative to the mean income vary substantially between socio economic scenarios fig 11 right panel from the single alternatives only the banning of biocides in facades banbioc shows a significant improvement compared to current practice and it comes with comparably low costs 3 4 transferability of the water quality management framework from a conceptual point of view the suggested water quality management framework can be applied to other places and or other management questions however this requires a consideration of each step of the decision support process fig 1 as described in sections 2 1 and 2 2 in collaboration with the decision makers and potentially an adaptation compared to our case study since each case may be different we only briefly discuss here some recommendations for the water quality assessment step the existing water quality assessment methods differ between countries and we consider here only approaches based on immission standards within the eu they usually provide an assessment based on 5 color coded quality classes according to the water framework directive wfd annex v 1 2 in this case the translation into a continuous function may just require a piecewise linear interpolation between class boundaries similar to our case study see table s1 and fig s1 a definition of the concentration that corresponds to a value of 1 best case e g concentration of 0 for synthetic pollutants or natural background values for geogenic substances and the worst case concentration that corresponds to a value of 0 in other cases where only binary pass fail criteria exist a continuous value function could be derived based on three anchor points for the concentrations corresponding to a value of 0 and 1 worst and best case see above and the value of 0 6 that corresponds to the legal threshold if perceived as appropriate if the development of a 5 class assessment procedure does not seem to be appropriate only two color coded classes could be introduced e g red for failing and green for passing the criteria to visualize the results see fig s6 for an example however this approach would then lead to less detailed information alternatively the value functions could be elicited from experts using standard elicitation procedures from multi criteria decision science e g eisenfuehr et al 2010 the hierarchical aggregation could be done as in the presented case study in any case if the procedure should inform the decision making process in practice it requires a consensus about the assessment procedure with decision makers and stakeholders if such a consensus cannot be achieved alternative assessment procedures can be developed e g one for each stakeholder group and their implications to the results visualized for practical applications the objective hierarchy and the value function can be implemented with the r package utility reichert et al 2013 with other decision support software or just with a simple spreadsheet an example for the implementation of value functions in r is provided in the supplementary material si section 6 4 conclusions water quality management is a typical example for environmental decision making that has to deal with multiple objectives many different alternatives large uncertainties in the prediction of their consequences and has to account for fairly long term changes in boundary conditions that cannot directly be influenced by local management such as socio economic development or changing climate conditions for water quality management decisions it is important to be informed about the changes in substance concentrations that can be expected from different management alternatives however since usually many different substances have to be considered that stem from various sources of pollution an integrated assessment is necessary that helps dealing with the multi objective nature of the decision problem and helps propagating and visualizing the associated uncertainties since the decisions affect many stakeholders a transparent communication of the decision basis is of particular importance with this study we introduced a framework to combine the use of multi attribute value functions for integrated assessment with water quality modelling and scenario planning we illustrated its suitability to help informing stakeholders policy makers and the public about the decision problem with a full account of the uncertainties of expected outcomes a central element of the presented framework is to use a continuous value scale for each sub objective this avoids the propagation of discretization errors from the lowest to the highest level of the objectives hierarchy but still allows translating the values into color coded quality classes which have a familiar meaning to the decision makers at all levels of the objectives hierarchy this allows choosing the appropriate level of detail for a transparent discussion of the effects of different management alternatives with stakeholders policy makers or the public while the methods and visualizations used are generalizable to other water quality management decisions the outcomes of the case study are very catchment specific because they depend on the local conditions and the contributions of the different sources of pollution which may vary substantially between catchments our results show that especially when uncertainty at the lowest level of the objectives hierarchy is large and varies between alternatives it is very insightful to propagate the uncertainty to the value scale and translate it into water quality classes that have a clear meaning for policy makers and managers the combination with scenario planning for boundary conditions that are hard to predict allows evaluating the robustness of the performance of different management alternatives to future changes this study confirms the need for a cross sectoral coordination between different management actions to achieve larger ecological effects smiley et al 2009 paillex et al 2017 even if the funding instruments and implementation strategies depend on sectoral policies declarations of interest none acknowledgement this study was

20032,current groundwater treatment facilities mostly relying on aeration filtration configurations aim at the removal of iron fe ammonia nh4 and manganese mn however recently water companies expressed the ambition to also reduce arsenic as concentrations in these rapid sand filters the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the fe oxidation state entering a biological filter bed on as removal by varying supernatant water level either fe ii or fe iii in the form of hydrous ferric oxides hfo could be stimulated to enter the filter bed at alkaline groundwater ph 7 6 the experimental pilot column filters showed that once the as iii oxidation stabilised in the top layer of the filter sand as removal reached its maximum 75 at 120 cm supernatant level and 1 5 m h filtration velocity the increase in supernatant level from 5 to 120 cm resulted in additional hfo production prior to rapid filtration 1 5 5 and 10 m h i e homogeneous fe ii oxidation and flocculation and subsequently hfo ending up deeper into the filter bed 120 cm filter depth at a low supernatant water level of 5 cm fe ii oxidised heterogeneously and was removed within the top 20 cm of the filter bed consequently filters with high supernatant levels removed as to lower levels by 20 than in filters with low supernatant water levels the benefits of fe ii oxidation prior to filtration for as removal was confirmed by comparing fe iii to fe ii additions in the supernatant water or in the filter bed overall it is concluded that in biological groundwater filters the combination of a higher supernatant level and or fe iii addition with biological as iii oxidation in the top of the filter bed promotes as removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic removal supernatant water level fe ii fe iii additions rapid sand filtration 1 introduction current groundwater treatment facilities mostly relying on aeration filtration configurations aim at the removal of iron fe ammonia nh4 and manganese mn however recently water companies have expressed the ambition to reduce arsenic as concentrations to below 1 μg l to exclude potential undesired health effects middleton et al 2016 van halem et al 2009 who 2011 in belgium and the netherlands as levels in groundwater are generally low 10 μg l though at some pumping stations concentrations as high as 70 μg l are observed as a consequence the existing drinking water treatment infrastructure frequently in good condition needs upgrading for the removal of several μg as l for water companies optimisation of existing treatment processes for as removal is preferred over implementation of new treatment steps e g adsorbents membrane filtration or introduction of invasive chemicals e g strong oxidants in groundwater filters rapid oxidation of as iii to as v is crucial for effective as removal previous research has found as iii oxidation to occur in the top of the filter bed bissen and frimmel 2003 gude et al 2016 facilitated by bacteria gude et al 2018b katsoyiannis et al 2004 kumari and jagadevan 2016 the oxidised as v is subsequently removed by adsorption onto hydrous ferric oxides hfo that originate from oxidised and subsequently flocculated or adsorbed fe ii dixit and hering 2003 gude et al 2017 sharma et al 2001 van beek et al 2015 hfo is either produced in the supernatant water or in the filter bed which is determined to a large extent by the supernatant water level swl but also on water quality e g ph filter design e g filter material and operational conditions e g flow rate stumm and lee 1961 vries et al 2017 therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the fe oxidation state entering the biological filter bed on as removal the fe oxidation state entering the filter bed can be controlled by adjusting the swl the supernatant water can be regarded as a completely stirred tank reactor vries et al 2017 therefore the major difference between high and low swl is residence time of the aerated groundwater mn ii nh4 and as iii do not homogeneously oxidise in the timespan of 1 h diem and stumm 1984 kim and nriagu 2000 tatari et al 2016 which can be considered the practical maximum residence time however depending on o2 concentrations and ph part of the fe ii will homogeneously oxidise and form hfo flocs de ridder and van halem 2017 sharma et al 2001 stumm and lee 1961 the produced hfo typically adsorbs about 20 40 as iii depending on among other parameters as fe ratio and residence time dixit and hering 2003 gude et al 2017 2016 qiao et al 2012 the fe ii that reaches the filter bed can heterogeneously or at ph 7 5 partly biologically de vet et al 2011 oxidise on the filter grains kinetics of heterogeneous fe ii oxidation are faster than homogenous tamura et al 1980 the hfo formed is less voluminous and causes less filter resistance than hfo floc filtration sharma et al 2001 and could have a lower sorption site density as was observed by dixit and hering 2003 for different fe oxides minerals hfo goethite and magnetite where the site density on the mineral surface increased as the density of the mineral decreased also confirmed by senn et al 2018 where aging hfo at 40 c caused a release of as v impact of swl on the oxidation can only be expected at alkaline groundwater which guarantee a sufficiently high homogeneous fe ii oxidation rate see fig 1 to test the effect of swl and thus the fe oxidation state on the removal of as during rapid sand filtration two pilot scale sand columns with a filter bed height of 1 4 m were operated for a period of nine months the filter columns were fed with aerated natural alkaline ph 7 6 groundwater containing 13 μg l as iii 2 mg l fe ii 0 6 mg l nh4 and 20 μg l mn ii one column was operated with high 1 m swl while the other was operated with low swl 0 05 m in addition to have a direct comparison on the influence of either fe iii or fe ii entering the filter bed on the removal of as iii an experiment was included by dosing 1 mg l fe ii or fe iii at equal swl to observe as iii oxidation and fe hfo mobility in the filter bed water samples were measured over the height of the filter bed during start up of the sand filters i e ripening as well as during stable operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater quality the pilot experiments were performed at drinking water production plant hoogstraten in belgium pidpa the groundwater quality is depicted in table 1 2 2 experimental column set up the experimental set up consisted of two columns with a diameter of 300 mm fig 2 both columns were filled with sand to 140 cm bed height where one column was 2 m in height and one column was 3 m in height to allow for a high swl for equal flow distribution and spray aeration raw groundwater was increased in pressure with a centrifugal pump at the intake and manually set reduced in pressure to the desired flow just before the columns aeration was achieved by spraying in the columns with a fall height of 30 cm into the supernatant water resulting in an average dissolved oxygen do concentration of 6 6 mg l with a standard deviation of 1 1 mg l the calculated do demand of the fe ii mn ii nh4 and as iii combined is 2 78 mg l o2 the additional 1 mg l fe ii adds 0 14 mg l making the total do demand 2 92 mg l o2 the applied aeration sufficed to ensure oxic conditions in the filter bed the swl was maintained constant throughout the runtime with a control valve compensating for the increased pressure drop due to clogging of the filter bed the columns were filled with 1 4 m quartz filter sand of size 0 70 1 25 mm before starting the experiment the columns were intensively backwashed with tap water to remove all fines over the course of the experiment the filtrate of the columns was collected and used as backwash water throughout the seven months experiment the columns were continuously fed with aerated groundwater and were situated in a location deprived of sun light 2 3 experimental conditions the experiment started with virgin sand which was ripened with aerated groundwater for nine weeks at a velocity of 1 5 m h with 5 cm swl and 120 cm swl for column 1 and 2 respectively once the biological processes sufficiently progressed only mn was not completely removed the filtration velocity was increased the first three weeks to 5 m h and the subsequent four weeks it was increased to 10 m h afterwards the filtration velocity was set back to 5 m h and subsequently reduced to 1 5 m h for a complete overview of the experimental conditions is referred to table 2 in week 22 the swl was set to 50 cm in both columns for a period of three weeks to stabilise conditions in both columns at this point two identical pvc fe ii fe iii dosing unit were installed the outlet of the first was installed in the top of the filter bed of column 1 at a depth of 30 cm fig 2 and the second in the swl of column 2 10 of the anaerobic groundwater was pumped through the dosing units right before the centrifugal pump the fecl was dosed with a peristaltic pump watson marlow u120 to ensure proper mixing successively 1 mg l fe ii was dosed in the filter bed in column 1 and 1 mg l fe ii in the swl of column 2 samples throughout the complete installation were taken at 3 and 7 days of chemical injection and were averaged the same experiment was repeated for fe iii dosing finally the columns were disinfected to confirm the biological nature of the processes by pumping chlorinated water of 1 5 times the reactor volume into the columns and allowed a reaction time of 24 h after 24 h the columns were backwashed and operated as before 2 4 chemicals sampling and analytical methods fe was obtained from sigma aldrich fecl2 4h2o mw 198 81 g mol 99 99 and fecl3 6h2o mw 270 30 g mol 99 15 stock solution naocl was diluted to 150 mg l with drinking water 10 of the anoxic main flow was diverted and injected with the undiluted fecl2 fecl3 the chemicals were continuously pumped into a pvc dosing unit placed just above the filter bed in the supernatant water and at 30 cm depth from the top in the sand bed the dosing unit consisted of a cross with 5 small holes per arm to enhance the mixing of the fe the default sample frequency was once per week and while sampling the sample water flow remained always below 10 of the main flow to prevent large changes in filtration velocity samples were processed via three methods 1 direct 2 filtered over 0 45 μm and 3 filtered over 0 45 μm and anionic resin for the purpose of as speciation as speciation was done according the method proposed by karori et al 2006 here 150 ml sample is passed through an anionic resin 80 ml amberlite ira 400 chlorite form resin in a 100 ml syringe that retains only the charged as v species the filtrate from the resin is considered to be as iii as v is then calculated by subtracting as iii from the measured total as concentration the first 50 ml was always discarded the remaining 100 ml was collected and analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms this is considered to be a robust method however at neutral ph the resin unavoidably retains 14 of

and nh4 in fig 3 the speciation of the dissolved as in the two filter columns with different swl is depicted in the supernatant water and over the height of the filter bed at day 1 8 15 and 36 the gradually increased as v concentrations over the filter bed profile illustrates the onset of biological as iii oxidation after 36 days before nh4 and mn started fig 4 as in the filtrate was completely in the as v form both in the 5 and 120 cm swl columns over the first 5 weeks the as iii conversion gradually moved upwards in the filter bed as a result of filter ripening this process only slowed down until the major part was oxidised in the top 20 cm of the filter bed while as iii oxidation occurred higher in the filter bed total as removal efficiencies increased in the filtrate it was observed that even though within 2 3 weeks complete oxidation was achieved in the filtrate the removal efficiency in the 120 cm swl column gradually increased until week 5 6 apparently the biological as iii oxidation occurring in the top of the filter bed contributes to increased as removal apart from as iii conversion other biological processes also started in the ripening stage of groundwater filters the nh4 and mn concentration profile over the filter bed are depicted in fig 4 during the first 63 days of operation nh4 oxidation commenced and was almost complete in the filtrate at day 49 and like as iii climbed to the top of the filter bed at least until day 63 although nh4 oxidation started at day 36 for both 5 and 120 cm swl by day 49 and 63 more was oxidised in the 120 cm swl column and oxidation occurred higher in the filter bed mn ii removal did not fully develop during the ripening stage as only 29 and 45 was removed in the 5 and 120 cm swl columns respectively however similar to both nh4 and as iii the 120 cm swl column removed more mn than the 5 cm swl column at day 63 which suggests that biological processes benefit from fe ii oxidation prior to filtration the development of biomass for as iii conversion was fastest followed by nh4 and subsequently mn which is in line with results from ripening experiments with other natural groundwaters containing as iii mn ii and nh4 gude et al 2018a 2018b the results in fig 4 suggest that specific as iii oxidising bacteria were accumulated in sand filters since as iii oxidation developed prior to nh4 and mn ii oxidation this is in line with observations in gude et al 2018b which showed that as iii oxidising bacteria accumulated rapidly on as iii substrate in an environment of nh4 without no3 and vise versa in both these systems no mno2 minerals were present on the filter sand the results of increasing the filter loading e g filtration velocity are depicted in fig 5 here as iii and as v concentration profiles are shown after 1 week of increasing the flow from 1 5 m h to 5 m h as iii concentrations throughout both columns increased as a result of an increased loading apparently the biological oxidation was in equilibrium with the loading of 1 5 m h and the columns could not directly cope with the more than tripling of as iii loading at 5 m h the elevated as iii concentrations were accompanied by a decrease in as removal efficiency to confirm that as iii conversion was a biological process in the columns the columns were disinfected with cl2 at the end of seven months of experiments fig 6 depicts the arsenic speciation in the columns after returning to regular operational mode at 5 m h for a period of 24 h after disinfection the as iii as v profile over the filter bed closely resembled the profile of the first measurement at day 1 hence as iii oxidation stopped almost completely after disinfection this confirms that the as iii oxidation during these experiments was of biological nature although not measured over the height of the filter bed nh4 concentrations in the filtrate 0 60 mg l remained identical to the influent concentrations 0 61 mg l indicating that the disinfection inactivated the nitrifiers as well also observed by gagnon et al 2005 on the other hand fe removal was just as effective after chlorination as before chlorination with fe concentrations in both columns below 0 01 mg l therefore although biological fe ii oxidation in the filter bed could have occurred de vet et al 2011 van beek et al 2015 it is demonstrated that for these columns with alkaline groundwater homogeneous and heterogeneous fe ii oxidation sufficed for fe removal however it is clear that the nature of as iii oxidation was predominantly biological as after disinfection the majority of the as in the filtrate was in the as iii form minerals present on the filter sand potentially potent for as iii oxidation like mno2 gude et al 2017 jones et al 2012 apparently did not oxidise as iii while the bacteria were inactivated 3 2 swl and as removal extending residence times in the supernatant water results in increased homogeneous hfo production and reduces the contribution of heterogeneous fe ii oxidation in the filter bed fe removal over the filter bed height both total fe and 0 45 μm filtered fe are depicted in fig 7 together with dissolved and adsorbed as the profiles of the columns with 5 and 120 cm swl were distinctly different for as and fe at 5 cm swl fe removal was rapid and efficient since 98 6 was removed in the first measuring interval at 20 cm from the top of the filter bed in this system the majority of the fe enters the filter bed as fe ii 82 was not retained by a 0 45 μm filter and apparently this was efficiently removed the rapid fe removal resulted in a low level of as adsorption throughout the filter bed 5 μg l as total was removed in the first 20 cm of the filter bed whereas in the rest of the 120 cm sand filter only 1 μg l as was removed in the 120 cm swl column the fe ii was allowed to be homogenously oxidised for 45 min at 5 mg l o2 and ph 7 6 the retention time caused 53 of the 1 93 mg l fe ii to be retained by a 0 45 μm filter apparently being oxidised and flocculated into hfo flocs these flocs were observed throughout the filter bed and were only completely removed after 120 cm of sand filtration deep bed filtration apparently homogeneously formed hfo in the supernatant water was more mobile in sand filters than dissolved fe ii as was also observed by sharma et al 2001 this deep bed filtration of hfo changed the as profile compared to the profile in the 5 cm swl column in terms of as removal the 120 cm swl column outperformed the 5 cm swl column in the first 20 cm of the filter bed an additional decrease of 2 μg l dissolved as and an additional 2 5 μg l adsorbed as was observed the adsorbed as to the mobile hfo was subsequently removed in the filter bed this observation is in line with an as removal profile in a full scale rapid filter which was operated with a high supernatant level and a naoh injection gude et al 2016 an additional observation is that after 20 cm of the sand filter the dissolved as remained steady for the rest of the filter bed probably the hfo deeper in the filter bed had already reached equilibrium sorption and or further flocculation of the hfo prevented additional adsorption of the produced as v overall increased swl at a ph high enough for homogeneous fe ii oxidation to occur resulted in increased hfo production prior to filtration which was beneficial to as adsorption onto hfo and subsequent removal in the filter bed 3 3 supernatant level and filtration velocity increasing the filtration velocity reduces the homogeneous oxidation time in the supernatant water and therefore the hfo production to observe whether the positive effect of a high swl is maintained at higher filtration velocities the results of the as removal at different velocities are depicted in fig 8 1 5 5 and 10 m h independent of the filtration velocity 120 cm swl resulted in an increased as removal compared to 5 cm swl throughout the filter bed the increase in as removal in the filtrate was 10 12 and 12 respectively for 1 5 5 and 10 m h the minor differences are more likely to be explained by the variations in water quality than in process conditions at an increased filtration velocity as removal moved deeper into the filter bed at 1 5 m h as removal occurred in the upper layer of the filter bed and no additional removal was observed further in the filter bed while at 5 m h and even more pronounced at 10 m h as removal was occurring deeper in the filter bed apparently the increased filter loading and or the decreased contact time caused the process to acquire additional surface area at higher filtration rates in this experiment however although the removal occurred deeper in the filter bed no effect on the total as removal in the complete filter bed was observed 3 4 fe ii fe iii addition in supernatant water to have a direct comparison of the influence of either fe iii or fe ii entering the filter bed on the removal of as an experiment was included adding 1 mg l fe ii or fe iii fig 9 depicts either fe ii or fe iii additions as well as the natural groundwater composition with process conditions of 50 cm swl and 5 m h filtration velocity both fe ii and fe iii additions resulted in a more effective removal of as than was the case for natural groundwater without addition indicating that additional formation of hfo resulted in increased as removal as also previously observed by qiao et al 2012 where as v removal percentages increased at lower as v fe iii ratios chiew et al 2009 observed more as removal in filters where more fe was present however fe iii addition in the supernatant water was more effective in decreasing as compared to fe ii addition evidently fe iii entering the filter bed is more effective at removing as than fe ii which is in line with the swl experiments presented earlier the 1 μg l increase in removal was obtained in the upper layer of the filter bed and remained more or less stable further throughout the filter bed the mechanism involved here is that the hfo flocs formed by fe iii are not accumulating on the surface of the top of the filter bed where the as iii is oxidised observed at 120 cm swl in fig 7 and by sharma et al 2001 but in majority passing them in the pore volume of the filter bed and subsequently absorbed the produced as v more effectively 3 5 fe ii fe iii addition in filter bed to obtain hfo in the zone of the filter bed where as v is present in order to better adsorb as in rapid filters also fe ii and fe iii were dosed in the filter bed at 30 cm under the top of the filter bed and compared to an equal fe addition in the supernatant water the results for dissolved as and fe are depicted in fig 10 as removal as a result of fe addition in the supernatant causes the majority of the as removal to take place in the upper layer of the filter bed this in contrast to the fe addition at 30 cm in the filter bed here the removal was achieved over a larger filter bed height and remained constant after 60 cm of sand filtration the fe addition in the supernatant water caused the overall as removal to be more effective than fe addition in the filter bed for fe iii addition in the supernatant 1 2 μg l additional as was removed in the filter bed where the fe was dosed a drop of 1 0 μg l is observed however this did not result in the desired effect since the dissolved as concentration remained higher than in the same sampling point while dosing in the supernatant water for fe ii a similar trend is observed fe ii dosed in the filter bed caused some additional removal compared to highest sampling point in the filter bed however it did not result in increased removal compared to the fe ii added in the supernatant water the fe profile as a result of fe iii additions was clearly different for dosing in the supernatant and dosing in the filter bed additions in the supernatant water effectively caused a maximum 1 mg l increased fe concentrations over the first 90 cm of the filter bed on the other hand while adding the same concentration fe in the filter bed almost no additional fe was observed in the filter bed apparently adding in the filter bed the flocs were more effectively locally retained due to improper mixing and direct availability of sand surfaces potentially explaining the reduced as removal compared to the well mixed dosing in the supernatant water similar to observations of sharma et al 2001 here fe iii entering the filter bed resulted in 2 5 times high filter resistance rapidly clogging a filter bed by voluminous flocs the fe profile for fe ii addition in the filter bed and in the supernatant was similar apart from 2 outliers which was in both experiments dominated by rapid heterogeneous oxidation hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2007 tamura et al 1980 and thus similarly to previous experiments not resulting in better as removal than when adding fe iii conclusions the research aimed at establishing an as iii oxidising biomass in the top of the filter bed and investigating the role of fe oxidation state prior to rapid filtration for this purpose the swl was varied and fe ii and fe iii additions were compared in a pilot plant using alkaline groundwater ph 7 6 with naturally containing as iii from the experiments it may be concluded that as iii oxidation gradually moved upward in the filter columns during ripening of biological sand filters similar to nh4 but more rapidly once the biomass established itself in the top of the filter bed as removal efficiency stabilised at its maximum disinfection by chlorine caused the as iii as v profile to return to its initial values confirming the biological nature of this process as removal greatly benefitted from increasing the swl from 5 cm to 120 cm for all tested filtration velocities 1 5 5 and 10 m h a closer look in the filter bed revealed that hfo penetrated the filter bed further and seemed to be more efficiently used as an adsorbent at a higher swl the beneficial properties of hfo formed prior to rapid filtration were confirmed by the increased as adsorption by fe iii addition in the supernatant water compared to fe

20032,current groundwater treatment facilities mostly relying on aeration filtration configurations aim at the removal of iron fe ammonia nh4 and manganese mn however recently water companies expressed the ambition to also reduce arsenic as concentrations in these rapid sand filters the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the fe oxidation state entering a biological filter bed on as removal by varying supernatant water level either fe ii or fe iii in the form of hydrous ferric oxides hfo could be stimulated to enter the filter bed at alkaline groundwater ph 7 6 the experimental pilot column filters showed that once the as iii oxidation stabilised in the top layer of the filter sand as removal reached its maximum 75 at 120 cm supernatant level and 1 5 m h filtration velocity the increase in supernatant level from 5 to 120 cm resulted in additional hfo production prior to rapid filtration 1 5 5 and 10 m h i e homogeneous fe ii oxidation and flocculation and subsequently hfo ending up deeper into the filter bed 120 cm filter depth at a low supernatant water level of 5 cm fe ii oxidised heterogeneously and was removed within the top 20 cm of the filter bed consequently filters with high supernatant levels removed as to lower levels by 20 than in filters with low supernatant water levels the benefits of fe ii oxidation prior to filtration for as removal was confirmed by comparing fe iii to fe ii additions in the supernatant water or in the filter bed overall it is concluded that in biological groundwater filters the combination of a higher supernatant level and or fe iii addition with biological as iii oxidation in the top of the filter bed promotes as removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic removal supernatant water level fe ii fe iii additions rapid sand filtration 1 introduction current groundwater treatment facilities mostly relying on aeration filtration configurations aim at the removal of iron fe ammonia nh4 and manganese mn however recently water companies have expressed the ambition to reduce arsenic as concentrations to below 1 μg l to exclude potential undesired health effects middleton et al 2016 van halem et al 2009 who 2011 in belgium and the netherlands as levels in groundwater are generally low 10 μg l though at some pumping stations concentrations as high as 70 μg l are observed as a consequence the existing drinking water treatment infrastructure frequently in good condition needs upgrading for the removal of several μg as l for water companies optimisation of existing treatment processes for as removal is preferred over implementation of new treatment steps e g adsorbents membrane filtration or introduction of invasive chemicals e g strong oxidants in groundwater filters rapid oxidation of as iii to as v is crucial for effective as removal previous research has found as iii oxidation to occur in the top of the filter bed bissen and frimmel 2003 gude et al 2016 facilitated by bacteria gude et al 2018b katsoyiannis et al 2004 kumari and jagadevan 2016 the oxidised as v is subsequently removed by adsorption onto hydrous ferric oxides hfo that originate from oxidised and subsequently flocculated or adsorbed fe ii dixit and hering 2003 gude et al 2017 sharma et al 2001 van beek et al 2015 hfo is either produced in the supernatant water or in the filter bed which is determined to a large extent by the supernatant water level swl but also on water quality e g ph filter design e g filter material and operational conditions e g flow rate stumm and lee 1961 vries et al 2017 therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the fe oxidation state entering the biological filter bed on as removal the fe oxidation state entering the filter bed can be controlled by adjusting the swl the supernatant water can be regarded as a completely stirred tank reactor vries et al 2017 therefore the major difference between high and low swl is residence time of the aerated groundwater mn ii nh4 and as iii do not homogeneously oxidise in the timespan of 1 h diem and stumm 1984 kim and nriagu 2000 tatari et al 2016 which can be considered the practical maximum residence time however depending on o2 concentrations and ph part of the fe ii will homogeneously oxidise and form hfo flocs de ridder and van halem 2017 sharma et al 2001 stumm and lee 1961 the produced hfo typically adsorbs about 20 40 as iii depending on among other parameters as fe ratio and residence time dixit and hering 2003 gude et al 2017 2016 qiao et al 2012 the fe ii that reaches the filter bed can heterogeneously or at ph 7 5 partly biologically de vet et al 2011 oxidise on the filter grains kinetics of heterogeneous fe ii oxidation are faster than homogenous tamura et al 1980 the hfo formed is less voluminous and causes less filter resistance than hfo floc filtration sharma et al 2001 and could have a lower sorption site density as was observed by dixit and hering 2003 for different fe oxides minerals hfo goethite and magnetite where the site density on the mineral surface increased as the density of the mineral decreased also confirmed by senn et al 2018 where aging hfo at 40 c caused a release of as v impact of swl on the oxidation can only be expected at alkaline groundwater which guarantee a sufficiently high homogeneous fe ii oxidation rate see fig 1 to test the effect of swl and thus the fe oxidation state on the removal of as during rapid sand filtration two pilot scale sand columns with a filter bed height of 1 4 m were operated for a period of nine months the filter columns were fed with aerated natural alkaline ph 7 6 groundwater containing 13 μg l as iii 2 mg l fe ii 0 6 mg l nh4 and 20 μg l mn ii one column was operated with high 1 m swl while the other was operated with low swl 0 05 m in addition to have a direct comparison on the influence of either fe iii or fe ii entering the filter bed on the removal of as iii an experiment was included by dosing 1 mg l fe ii or fe iii at equal swl to observe as iii oxidation and fe hfo mobility in the filter bed water samples were measured over the height of the filter bed during start up of the sand filters i e ripening as well as during stable operation 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater quality the pilot experiments were performed at drinking water production plant hoogstraten in belgium pidpa the groundwater quality is depicted in table 1 2 2 experimental column set up the experimental set up consisted of two columns with a diameter of 300 mm fig 2 both columns were filled with sand to 140 cm bed height where one column was 2 m in height and one column was 3 m in height to allow for a high swl for equal flow distribution and spray aeration raw groundwater was increased in pressure with a centrifugal pump at the intake and manually set reduced in pressure to the desired flow just before the columns aeration was achieved by spraying in the columns with a fall height of 30 cm into the supernatant water resulting in an average dissolved oxygen do concentration of 6 6 mg l with a standard deviation of 1 1 mg l the calculated do demand of the fe ii mn ii nh4 and as iii combined is 2 78 mg l o2 the additional 1 mg l fe ii adds 0 14 mg l making the total do demand 2 92 mg l o2 the applied aeration sufficed to ensure oxic conditions in the filter bed the swl was maintained constant throughout the runtime with a control valve compensating for the increased pressure drop due to clogging of the filter bed the columns were filled with 1 4 m quartz filter sand of size 0 70 1 25 mm before starting the experiment the columns were intensively backwashed with tap water to remove all fines over the course of the experiment the filtrate of the columns was collected and used as backwash water throughout the seven months experiment the columns were continuously fed with aerated groundwater and were situated in a location deprived of sun light 2 3 experimental conditions the experiment started with virgin sand which was ripened with aerated groundwater for nine weeks at a velocity of 1 5 m h with 5 cm swl and 120 cm swl for column 1 and 2 respectively once the biological processes sufficiently progressed only mn was not completely removed the filtration velocity was increased the first three weeks to 5 m h and the subsequent four weeks it was increased to 10 m h afterwards the filtration velocity was set back to 5 m h and subsequently reduced to 1 5 m h for a complete overview of the experimental conditions is referred to table 2 in week 22 the swl was set to 50 cm in both columns for a period of three weeks to stabilise conditions in both columns at this point two identical pvc fe ii fe iii dosing unit were installed the outlet of the first was installed in the top of the filter bed of column 1 at a depth of 30 cm fig 2 and the second in the swl of column 2 10 of the anaerobic groundwater was pumped through the dosing units right before the centrifugal pump the fecl was dosed with a peristaltic pump watson marlow u120 to ensure proper mixing successively 1 mg l fe ii was dosed in the filter bed in column 1 and 1 mg l fe ii in the swl of column 2 samples throughout the complete installation were taken at 3 and 7 days of chemical injection and were averaged the same experiment was repeated for fe iii dosing finally the columns were disinfected to confirm the biological nature of the processes by pumping chlorinated water of 1 5 times the reactor volume into the columns and allowed a reaction time of 24 h after 24 h the columns were backwashed and operated as before 2 4 chemicals sampling and analytical methods fe was obtained from sigma aldrich fecl2 4h2o mw 198 81 g mol 99 99 and fecl3 6h2o mw 270 30 g mol 99 15 stock solution naocl was diluted to 150 mg l with drinking water 10 of the anoxic main flow was diverted and injected with the undiluted fecl2 fecl3 the chemicals were continuously pumped into a pvc dosing unit placed just above the filter bed in the supernatant water and at 30 cm depth from the top in the sand bed the dosing unit consisted of a cross with 5 small holes per arm to enhance the mixing of the fe the default sample frequency was once per week and while sampling the sample water flow remained always below 10 of the main flow to prevent large changes in filtration velocity samples were processed via three methods 1 direct 2 filtered over 0 45 μm and 3 filtered over 0 45 μm and anionic resin for the purpose of as speciation as speciation was done according the method proposed by karori et al 2006 here 150 ml sample is passed through an anionic resin 80 ml amberlite ira 400 chlorite form resin in a 100 ml syringe that retains only the charged as v species the filtrate from the resin is considered to be as iii as v is then calculated by subtracting as iii from the measured total as concentration the first 50 ml was always discarded the remaining 100 ml was collected and analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms this is considered to be a robust method however at neutral ph the resin unavoidably retains 14 of

and nh4 in fig 3 the speciation of the dissolved as in the two filter columns with different swl is depicted in the supernatant water and over the height of the filter bed at day 1 8 15 and 36 the gradually increased as v concentrations over the filter bed profile illustrates the onset of biological as iii oxidation after 36 days before nh4 and mn started fig 4 as in the filtrate was completely in the as v form both in the 5 and 120 cm swl columns over the first 5 weeks the as iii conversion gradually moved upwards in the filter bed as a result of filter ripening this process only slowed down until the major part was oxidised in the top 20 cm of the filter bed while as iii oxidation occurred higher in the filter bed total as removal efficiencies increased in the filtrate it was observed that even though within 2 3 weeks complete oxidation was achieved in the filtrate the removal efficiency in the 120 cm swl column gradually increased until week 5 6 apparently the biological

ii fe iii addition in filter bed to obtain hfo in the zone of the filter bed where as v is present in order to better adsorb as in rapid filters also fe ii and fe iii were dosed in the filter bed at 30 cm under the top of the filter bed and compared to an equal fe addition in the supernatant water the results for dissolved as and fe are depicted in fig 10 as removal as a result of fe addition in the supernatant causes the majority of the as removal to take place in the upper layer of the filter bed this in contrast to the fe addition at 30 cm in the filter bed here the removal was achieved over a larger filter bed height and remained constant after 60 cm of sand filtration the fe addition in the supernatant water caused the overall as removal to be more effective than fe addition in the filter bed for fe iii addition in the supernatant 1 2 μg l additional as was removed in the filter bed where the fe was dosed a drop of 1 0 μg l is observed however this did not result in the desired effect since the dissolved as concentration remained higher than in the same sampling point while dosing in the supernatant water for fe ii a similar trend is observed fe ii dosed in the filter bed caused some additional removal compared to highest sampling point in the filter bed however it did not result in increased removal compared to the fe ii added in the supernatant water the fe profile as a result of fe iii additions was clearly different for dosing in the supernatant and dosing in the filter bed additions in the supernatant water effectively caused a maximum 1 mg l increased fe concentrations over the first 90 cm of the filter bed on the other hand while adding the same concentration fe in the filter bed almost no additional fe was observed in the filter bed apparently adding in the filter bed the flocs were more effectively locally retained due to improper mixing and direct availability of sand surfaces potentially explaining the reduced as removal compared to the well mixed dosing in the supernatant water similar to observations of sharma et al 2001 here fe iii entering the filter bed resulted in 2 5 times high filter resistance rapidly clogging a filter bed by voluminous flocs the fe profile for fe ii addition in the filter bed and in the supernatant was similar apart from 2 outliers which was in both experiments dominated by rapid heterogeneous oxidation hiemstra and van riemsdijk 2007 tamura et al 1980 and thus similarly to previous experiments not resulting in better as removal than when adding fe iii conclusions the research aimed at establishing an as iii oxidising biomass in the top of the filter bed and investigating the role of fe oxidation state prior to rapid filtration for this purpose the swl was varied and fe ii and fe iii additions were compared in a pilot plant using alkaline groundwater ph 7 6 with naturally containing as iii from the experiments it may be concluded that as iii oxidation gradually moved upward in the filter columns during ripening of biological sand filters similar to nh4 but more rapidly once the biomass established itself in the top of the filter bed as removal efficiency stabilised at its maximum disinfection by chlorine caused the as iii as v profile to return to its initial values confirming the biological nature of this process as removal greatly benefitted from increasing the swl from 5 cm to 120 cm for all tested filtration velocities 1 5 5 and 10 m h a closer look in the filter bed revealed that hfo penetrated the filter bed further and seemed to be more efficiently used as an adsorbent at a higher swl the beneficial properties of hfo formed prior to rapid filtration were confirmed by the increased as adsorption by fe iii addition in the supernatant water compared to fe ii addition and or fe injection into the filter bed declaration of interests none acknowledgements this research is supported by a dutch technology foundation nwo ttw grant part of the netherlands

20033,discontinuing application of pre filter chlorine is a common water treatment plant practice to permit a bioactive filtration process for the removal of soluble mn however soluble mn desorption has sometimes been observed following cessation of chlorine addition where filter effluent mn concentration exceeds the influent mn concentration in this paper it is hypothesized that mn reducing bacteria present in a biofilm on the filter media may be a factor in this mn release phenomenon the primary objective of this research was to assess the role of mn reducing microorganisms in the release of soluble mn from mnox s coated filter media following interruption of pre filtration chlorination bench scale filter column studies were inoculated with shewanella oneidensis mr 1 to investigate the impacts of a known mn reducing bacterium on release of soluble mn from mnox s coatings in situ vial assays were developed to gain insight into the impacts of mnox s age on bioavailability to mn reducing microorganisms and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr method was developed to quantify gene copies of the mtrb gene which is involved in mn reduction results demonstrated that microbially mediated mn release was possible above a threshold equivalent of 2 102 s oneidensis mr 1 cfu per gram of mnox s coated media and that those organisms contributed to mn desorption and release further detectable mtrb gene copies were associated with observed mn desorption lastly mnox s age appeared to play a role in mn reduction and subsequent release where mnox s solids of greater age indicated lower bioavailability these findings can help inform means of preventing soluble mn release from drinking water treatment plant filters graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water treatment manganese removal media filtration manganese oxides manganese reducing bacteria 1 introduction mn is a challenging drinking water contaminant owing to its widespread natural occurrence and multiple oxidation states e g mn ii mn iii mn iv in water elevated mn concentrations smcl 0 05 mg l in u s can present a significant aesthetic concern as the water travels through the distribution system and into a consumer s home plumbing upon entering the consumer s home water that contains oxidized mn is often characterized by a blackish brownish color which can lead to water discoloration complaints sly et al 1990 and an undesirable metallic taste sain et al 2014 microbial metal reduction is central to the geochemical cycling of fe mn and c in redox stratified waters johnson 2006 yet little is known about the microbial metabolic mechanisms by which the mn reduction process takes place in contrast to reduction of iron the current state of understanding mn reduction is that it does not provide energy to the cell lin et al 2012 under neutral ph conditions mn oxides are highly insoluble and can be crystalline in nature yang et al 2013 for reduction to occur microorganisms are required to transfer electrons to mn oxides that are external to the cell wall or membrane since contact with a localized inner membrane electron transport chain is not possible lovley et al 2004 it is generally thought that mn iv reduction occurs directly at the outer membrane via single two electron successive transfers resulting in mn ii as the final product thamdrup 2000 the first electron transfer forms soluble mn iii as a temporary intermediate before a final electron transfer and reduction to mn ii the first electron transfer step increases the bioavailability of mn by reductive solubilization while the second step is coupled to the production of inorganic carbon lin et al 2012 shewanella has been used as a model metal reducing bacterium due to its ability to utilize a wide variety of electron acceptors and its capacity to transfer electrons to solid metal oxide compounds osterman et al 2008 the electron transport chain of s oneidensis is made up of several different interacting proteins which allow the utilization of extracellular electron acceptors for mn reduction szeinbaum et al 2014 the main outer membrane protein complex is mtrcba an electron channel that allows their passage to extracellular metal hydroxide complexes burnes 2000 mtrcba is mainly associated with the reduction of mn iv an outer membrane β barrel protein mtrb allows interaction and electron transfer to extracellular metal hydroxide complexes and has been shown to be required for mn iv and mn iii reduction lin et al 2012 one of the more common methods of soluble mn removal in water treatment facilities is through adsorption onto mnox s coated filtration media knocke et al 1991 tobiason et al 2008 this process has been referred to as the natural greensand effect and is a self regenerating process that continues to remove additional soluble mn brandhuber et al 2013 in a few water treatment plants wtps where adsorption of soluble mn to oxide coated filtration media is the main method utilized for soluble mn removal mn desorption and release from the media has been observed upon cessation of pre filter free chlorine addition islam 2010 in certain cases effluent mn exceeded the influent mn concentration for extended periods of time e g 1 2 weeks after chlorine application ceased gabelich et al 2006 this desorption phenomenon has specifically been documented at the aquarion water company awc stamford wtp stamford ct tobiason et al 2008 and at the henry j mills wtp riverside ca gabelich et al 2006 mn desorption from coated filter media has also been observed in the laboratory using filtration media from the awc lantern hill wtp stonington ct islam 2010 mn release appeared to be due to biologically mediated desorption from the anthracite filtration media in addition islam 2010 indicated that mn reducing populations were only capable of growth on filtration media and reduction of mn in the absence of chlorine consistent with the above observations cerrato et al 2010 were able to isolate mn reducing bacteria from the media of wtps operating in virginia and north carolina notably some of these bacteria mainly bacillus were capable of both oxidizing and reducing mn further recent studies have revealed that a wide diversity of microbes inhabit wtp media even under chlorinated conditions chiao et al 2014 the overall goal of this research was to evaluate the potential for biologically mediated mn reduction from mnox s coated filtration media during drinking water treatment the specific objectives were to 1 characterize mn release from columns with varying extent of mnox s coating on the media under conditions of reduced microbial activity 2 compare mn desorption from laboratory scale filter columns containing porous media with and without inoculation of s oneidensis mr 1 a known mn reducing microorganism 3 develop and apply a molecular assay for the quantification of the mtrb marker gene associated with biological mn reduction and 4 investigate the effects of mnox s age on bioavailability and mn reduction capacity the goal was to generate information to inform improved operation of media filters at wtps to optimize biological benefits of removing organic carbon via biofiltration while minimizing potential concerns related to mn release 2 experimental methods and materials the following text describes the experimental and analytical methods applicable to this study more detailed information may be found in swain 2016 2 1 laboratory bench scale filter column experimental and analytical procedures bench scale filter columns were set up to produce mn breakthrough curves as well as replicate mn removal and desorption trends observed in full scale wtps each laboratory bench scale filter contained a filter media sand or anthracite received an influent that contained soluble mn and aluminum al primarily as al oh 3 s and had free chlorine applied for a defined initial amount of time to promote formation of mnox s coating on the media and active site regeneration for the consistent uptake of soluble mn particulate al oh 3 s was added at a low concentration approximately 200 μg l as al to mimic the presence of carryover floc from sedimentation basins in real world surface wtps jones 2012 during each study free chlorine application ceased after a set amount of time and the column influent and effluent were measured to evaluate the amount of soluble mn passing through the column media glass columns were 24 inches in height and had a 7 16 inch inner diameter plastic tubing was employed to transfer feed solutions to each column and transport filtered effluent away from the column six inches of media depth was used in each column experiment influent feed solutions were prepared with deionized water in five gallon increments and stored in larger plastic reservoirs each column had two influent feed solutions that were mixed just prior to entering the filter column the primary feed solution contained dissolved mn alkalinity dissolved and particulate al the second feed solution always contained alkalinity and contained free chlorine during the time period when an experiment required the presence of free chlorine in the filter applied water once mixed together the resulting influent feed solution characteristics of the water for each experiment were achieved columns were backwashed as needed when excessive head loss occurred or at least once daily backwashing was performed by pumping 1 l of deionized water in an upflow direction through the column at a rate of 25 gpm ft2 this flow rate corresponded to an approximate 30 media expansion there were two distinct sets of filter column experiments on two different mnox s coated filter medias to assess the potential role of mn reducing bacteria on mn release those procedures are provided in the following text 2 1 1 abiotic studies for assessing potential soluble mn release from media an initial set of experiments were designed to assess the potential for soluble mn release from filter media under abiotic conditions these served as a control to determine whether soluble mn release would occur from mnox s coated media purely by chemical means e g cessation of pre filter chlorine addition these experiments employed the use of new filtersil sand uniformity coefficient 2 65 effective size 0 5 mm which initially had no mnox s coating present the media was autoclaved prior to the start of mnox s coating and laboratory experiments to minimize microbial activity an initial mnox s coating was generated on the sand media through application of soluble mn 200 μg l and free chlorine 1 2 mg l for a defined period either 5 or 15 days extraction of the media coating by hydroxylamine sulfate addition indicated an mnox s coating level of 1 5 mg mn g media and 4 9 mg mn g media after 5 and 15 days of free chlorine application respectively this insured the presence of ample mnox s coating for evaluating the potential for mn reduction and release after free chlorine addition ceased in these experiments additional influent water characteristics to the sand media were ph 7 0 to 7 3 alkalinity 2 meq l total al 200 μg l and toc 0 5 mg l influent feed solutions were pumped into the column to yield a total hydraulic loading rate of 4 gpm ft2 following the initial period 5 or 15 days of mnox s coating deposition on the sand the free chlorine was eliminated from the feed water column effluent was monitored for the presence of soluble mn to evaluate the potential for actual release of mn from the media coating 2 1 2 experiments employing mn reducing bacteria to assess potential for mn release from media coatings a second set of experiments sought to assess the potential role of mn reducing bacteria in promoting mn release from mnox s coated media these experiments employed anthracite coal media uniformity coefficient 1 4 effective size 0 9 1 0 mm obtained from the harwood mills waterworks wtp newport news va the harwoods mill media was chosen for use due to its significant 28 30 mg mn g media mnox s coating that was present this wtp employs free chlorine addition to the filter applied water for soluble mn control the influent characteristics for the anthracite media experiment were as follows ph 6 3 to 6 6 alkalinity 2 meq l soluble mn 50 μg l and total al 200 μg l the slightly lower ph condition employed in relation to the abiotic study was due to the fact that the typical filter applied ph at the harwoods mill wtp is between 6 0 and 6 5 as such it was desired to use a ph application similar to what the media experienced in the wtp a free chlorine concentration of 0 5 1 0 mg l again comparable to harwoods mill wtp practice was present in both columns for the initial five day period of the test after which chlorine was no longer fed to the column whereas the abiotic study had no toc added to the filter applied water this experiment incorporated a small amount of sodium acetate influent toc 0 5 mg l as c to serve as a readily degradable organic substrate one of the columns in this study was inoculated with s oneidensis mr 1 a well characterized mn reducing bacterium while the other column had no microbes applied to the filter media s oneidensis mr 1 was obtained courtesy of dr kenneth nealson from the university of southern california to prepare the s oneidensis mr 1 inoculum a 10 μl sterile loop full of culture from an r2a agar bd difco plate was transferred to 100 ml of r2a broth bd difco the flask was incubated for 48 h in a shaking water bath at 30 c s oneidensis mr 1 was then used to inoculate a 1 l volume of r2a broth and again incubated for 48 h in a shaking water bath at 30 c the entire volume of culture was further allowed to acclimate to room temperature for an additional 24 h the culture was centrifuged at 5 000 g for 20 min to concentrate the pellet the pellet was suspended into a 200 ml volume of modified mn reduction broth which contained per liter of 10 mm hepes buffer ph 7 4 0 2 g yeast extract and 2 g sodium acetate the modified mn reduction broth with concentrated s oneidensis mr 1 inoculum was poured over the anthracite media in the column the culture was allowed to flow through the column for a short time and then was used to fill the column above the media level the column was left undisturbed for 24 h after which it was lightly backwashed additional culture was added to the column and was again subject to a short duration of flow culture filled the column above the media height and was left undisturbed for an additional 24 h after the period of column inoculation influent flow was introduced to the filter these two columns were monitored for effluent mn concentrations before and after the cessation of pre filter chlorine to evaluate whether the presence of the mn reducing bacteria potential led to mn release from the media coatings 2 1 3 analytical methods for filter column studies the ph of the influent feed solutions to the filter columns was monitored and adjusted with concentrated hydrochloric acid hcl as needed a hach hq40d ph meter was calibrated daily before measurements were taken a hach reagent set dpd method was utilized for the measurement of free chlorine influent and effluent bench scale column samples for mn analysis were preserved in 2 trace metal grade nitric acid and were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms a description of the term soluble mn is provided for clarity the influent solution to any media column contained only dissolved manganous mn ii ion likewise the relatively brief less than 2 min contact time between the dissolved mn ii and free chlorine prior to application to the coated media was too short to promote any significant mn ii oxidation and formation of particulate mnox s in the water applied to the media brandhuber et al 2013 preliminary testing with 0 45 μm membrane filtration of column effluent samples showed no significant presence of particulate oxidized mnox s being present which is consistent with practical experience when soluble mn is the only source in the feed as such the protocol for experimental testing did not involve 0 45 μm filtration of the column effluent samples and assumed that mn present in the column effluent was in the soluble form 2 2 molecular detection of mn reducing microorganisms 2 2 1 sample collection for molecular analyses dna was isolated from standard pure culture suspensions laboratory samples and environmental samples using the powersoil kit from mobio laboratories inc solon oh for use in quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr for extraction from anthracite media 0 25 g of each sample was measured and transferred to each extraction kit vial for liquid samples and standards suspensions were mixed and 250 μl was added into the extraction kit vials samples and standards were stored at 20 c until extraction 2 2 2 s oneidensis mr 1 qpcr the s oneidensis mr 1 16s rrna gene rt qpcr methods described by schicklberger et al 2011 were modified for qpcr ssofast evagreen supermix bio rad hercules ca was used with a reaction volume of 10 μl the mastermix contained 5 μl of ssofast evagreen supermix 0 8 μl of the forward and reverse primers 2 4 μl molecular grade water and 1 μl dna template the dna template was quantified using a qubit fluorometer bio rad and diluted to a concentration where 5 15 ng μl was added to each well before use in qpcr the optimal melting temperature was determined by a temperature gradient and melt curve ranging from 57 0 c to 51 0 c where 57 0 c was chosen as the optimal melting temperature for this protocol a standard curve was developed using dna extracts from suspensions of s oneidensis mr 1 culture of known colony forming units per ml density to quantify this organism from laboratory samples and bench scale filter column studies 2 2 3 mtrb gene detection multiple sequence comparison by log expectation muscle alignment edgar 2004 was chosen as the method to aid in design of the mtrb primer set from the ncbi genbank website 10 mtrb protein sequences were chosen for gene alignment based off the targeted sequence description table s1 the final mtrb primers obtained from the alignment is as follows forward 5 csttcaacvacatggccg 3 and reverse 5 sgagatctcsagcaggtc 3 for a 10 μl qpcr reaction volume the mastermix contained 5 μl of ssofast evagreen supermix 0 8 μl of the forward and reverse primers 2 4 μl of molecular grade water and 1 μl of dna template dna template was added into the reaction wells at a concentration between 5 and 15 ng μl annealing temperature ranges were tested between 50 0 c and 58 0 c where 50 0 c was chosen as optimal to validate the assay strains of bacillus spp that were verified not to have the capability to reduce mn were analyzed as a phylogenetically related negative control this validation confirmed non detect levels of the mtrb gene for the negative control strains 2 3 in situ mn reduction vial assay an in situ vial assay was developed to semi quantitatively evaluate the bioavailability to s oneidensis mr 1 of various aged mnox s samples various modifications detailed in the following sections were made from the protocol established by nealson et al 1991 a total of five mnox s samples were examined using the vial assay developed three of the mnox s samples were prepared by adding potassium permanganate kmno4 at a stoichiometric dosage to waters containing soluble mn obtained by dissolving manganous chloride mncl2 once the reaction was complete the mnox s formed was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 5 min to form a pellet and remove excess water the mnox s samples were washed by resuspension in nanopure water and re centrifuged to form a new pellet three times these solids were precipitated approximately one to seven months prior to use in the vial assay and were identified according to synthesis date 7 28 15 11 18 15 and 1 11 16 a fourth mnox s sample 2008 was a purchased mno2 s oxide from sigma that had been stored in the laboratory for approximately 7 years the fifth mnox s sample 7 8 15 was artificially aged by drying the formed mnox s at 103 c for 24 h an attempt was made to inactivate any microbes possibly present on the mnox s by exposure to an extremely strong free chlorine environment chlorine inactivation of the mnox s samples was completed by soaking the samples in a strong chlorine solution for sufficient time to yield a ct product of 10 000 mg l min after the desired ct of 10 000 mg l min was reached the mnox s samples were washed three times using sterile deionized water a semisolid manganese reduction agar contained the following per liter of 10 mm hepes buffer ph 7 4 0 2 g yeast extract 2 g sodium acetate and 3 g agar 0 3 the media was autoclaved on a 20 min liquid cycle and was allowed to cool before the addition of mnox s to determine the responsive range of the assay percent transmission at 540 nm was measured for lab synthesized mnox s solids 1 11 16 and 2008 samples over the range of 0 1 0 g l percent transmission versus mnox s solids concentration fit a polynomial curve with an r2 0 95 based on this a target initial mnox s sample addition of 0 7 or 0 35 g l was selected in order to maintain the assay within a measurable range over the duration of the assay as noted above the commercial mno2 s solids and the dried at 103 c mnox s solids were much darker in color and thus were added at the lower initial concentration 0 35 g l to achieve a comparable initial transmittance measurement of 4 8 across the vial assays a volume of 10 ml of the mn reduction agar with mnox s added was placed into glass vials for inoculation with the s oneidensis mr 1 bacteria vials were inoculated with fresh s oneidensis mr 1 cultures from r2a agar plates which were incubated overnight at 30 c cultures were removed from the agar plate with a sterile loop and suspended in 1 5 ml of sterile deionized water and subject to serial dilution a 100 μl aliquot of the desired s oneidensis mr 1 suspension was added into each vial and was vortexed each inoculum was enumerated using standard heterotrophic pour plate methods on r2a agar before the addition into vials a volume of 100 μl of sterile deionized water was added into the negative uninoculated control vials percent transmittance of light at 540 nm was used as a comparative surrogate parameter for semi quantitatively estimating the degree of mn reduction occurring within the vial as mnox s was reduced to soluble mn the percent transmittance of the suspension in the vial increased percent light transmittance was measured frequently a minimum of every 1 2 days using a spectrophotometer coleman junior model 6a maywood il that was calibrated at the 540 nm wavelength before each use gerhardt et al 1981 abiotically reduced positive control vials were prepared by adding 0 020 g of hydroxylamine sulfate suspended in 100 μl of sterile deionized water was added into a parallel set of vials for each type of mnox s sample this allowed for an estimate of the percent transmittance of a sample wherein essentially 100 of the mnox s added was reduced to soluble mn 3 results and discussion 3 1 abiotic filter media study mn sorption and release from mnox s coated virgin sand an initial experiment involved an abiotic study of the potential reduction of mnox s media coatings mnox s coatings were deposited onto autoclaved sand by interaction between soluble mn and free chlorine on the media for an initial period of either 5 or 15 days the longer time led to greater mnox s deposition on the sand after the prescribed period had elapsed the free chlorine was removed from the filter applied water and only soluble mn loading continued results from this abiotic study are shown in fig 1 time zero was set as the time chlorine addition ceased for each column soluble mn breakthrough occurred more quickly when the media in the columns had been coated for only five days the rate of soluble mn removal is known to be directly associated with surface mnox s concentration which impacts the amount of available active sites on a filter media knocke et al 1991 faster breakthrough from the 5 day coated columns would be expected as the mnox s coating level was only 1 5 mg mn g media whereas 4 9 mg mn g media of mnox s coating was found on the 15 day coated media knocke et al 1991 demonstrated that the number of mnox s active sites positively correlate with the degree of mnox s coating therefore the column with the 15 day mnox s coating had increased adsorption capacity on the media surface which resulted in slower mn breakthrough importantly the concentration of mn passing through the media depth never exceeded influent mn concentrations for either the 5 day or 15 day coated columns the breakthrough trends from this column experiment can be explained by the loss of mn uptake capacity on the media sites due to mn uptake becoming saturated given that regeneration with free chlorine was no longer taking place the cessation of free chlorine to filters in some full scale wtp gabelich et al 2006 and laboratory studies islam 2010 have shown mn desorption that results in effluent mn concentrations exceeding the influent for a period of several hours up to 1 2 weeks apparently due to reduction of mn from media coatings and release to the filter effluent these abiotic column studies did not yield situations where the column effluent mn concentration exceeded the influent mn level of 0 2 mg l as such operation of the columns under abiotic conditions did not yield evidence of mn reduction in the available mnox s media coatings suggesting a lack of purely chemical mechanisms for promoting mn reduction on the media 3 2 laboratory bench scale filter study mn release from harwood mills anthracite media with and without inoculum data related to the passage of soluble mn through the anthracite media filter depth for both the inoculated column s oneidensis mr 1 inoculum and uninoculated column are presented in fig 2 during the initial five days when free chlorine was applied the mn breakthrough in the inoculated column was consistently greater when compared to the uninoculated column likewise after free chlorine addition ceased the release of soluble mn was much greater for the inoculated column experimental conditions e g ph applied mn concentration applied free chlorine concentration chlorine demand across the media depth time of chlorine feed cessation etc between both columns remained the same through the duration of the experiment as such it is hypothesized that the difference in mn breakthrough observed could be attributed to the mn reduction activity of the s oneidensis mr 1 inoculum lovley and phillips 1988 showed that s oneidensis mr 1 coupled the oxidation of electron donors similar to the acetate supplied in the feed to these two columns to mn reduction in this specific experiment acetate was supplied as a readily oxidized substrate that could have been coupled with the reduction of mnox s from the media surface by the mn reducing microorganisms this result compares well to islam 2010 who were able to demonstrate a relationship between applied acetate concentration to mnox s coated media and subsequent soluble mn release from that media 3 2 1 s oneidensis mr 1 quantification relative abundances of s oneidensis mr 1 occurring in the top middle and bottom two inch sections of the inoculated and uninoculated columns were measured by qpcr after the completion of column operation detection of s oneidensis mr 1 was confirmed at all depths in the inoculated column at an average density across the three layers of 3 9 0 89 102 cfu ml s oneidensis mr 1 was not detected at any depth in the uninoculated column these results indicate that the process used to inoculate s oneidensis mr 1 on the anthracite media was successful and supports the hypothesis that the presence of these mn reducing bacteria contributed to the additional observed mn release to the authors knowledge no prior study has specifically confirmed the presence of s oneidensis specifically on wtp media though other species of mn reducers have been identified cerrato et al 2010 in this specific study s oneidensis mr 1 was selected as a well known and highly characterized model with well defined gene targets for monitoring and thus served well in its purpose of representing conditions with confirmed mn reducers inoculated relative abundances of mtrb genes in the top middle and bottom two inch sections of the inoculated and uninoculated columns were also measured by qpcr results indicated that the s oneidensis mr 1 inoculated columns contained more mtrb gene copies the average ct value for the s oneidensis mr 1 inoculated columns was 27 0 26 compared to uninoculated column which had an average ct value of 38 0 21 where ct values are inversely proportional to target gene copy numbers these findings further support the conclusion that there were far more microorganisms that had the ability to reduce mn in the inoculated column 3 2 2 potential effects of aging on the bioavailability of mn in mnox s coatings fig 3 presents normalized transmittance values equivalent to a 1 g l mnox s agar vial normalization of transmittance measurements to that of a 1 g l mnox s agar vial enabled relative comparisons of mn reduction capacities notably the 2008 and 7 8 15 solids were characterized by the least extent of mn reduction over the duration of the study all the other mnox s solids evaluated in this study were comparable in the observed extent of mn reduction and corresponding increase in sample percent transmittance average s oneidensis mr 1 cell counts were compared among triplicate vials via qpcr over the course of the mnox s incubations fig 4 an anova test confirmed that mean cell concentrations were highly similar across all the mnox s agar vials throughout the experiment f fcrit p 0 05 nonetheless differences in mn reduction among the vials were clearly observed fig 3 indicating that variances in s oneidensis mr 1 populations between vials were not responsible for the differences further for the 2008 and 7 8 15 mnox s samples even though the s oneidensis mr 1 count increased over time mn reduction rates were slower than observed for the other samples the 7 28 15 11 18 15 and 1 11 16 mnox s samples had the same density of s oneidensis mr 1 but could reduce more mnox s because the 2008 and 7 8 15 vials had similar s oneidensis mr 1 counts but lower extent of observed mn reduction this pointed to a reduced bioavailability of the mnox s present in these two more aged samples the ability of microbes to reduce freshly precipitated mnox s when coupled with the oxidation of various organic compounds has been reported by a wide variety of authors with one of the seminal papers being published by lovley and phillips 1988 aging has been shown to produce chemical and structural changes in the forms of mnox s present cui et al 2010 hinkle et al 2016 likewise variations in mnox s crystalline structure affect mn reactivity stone 1987 burdige et al 1992 showed that s oneidensismr 1 could reduce amorphous more recently precipitated forms of mnox s δ mno2 s and birnessite much more readily than occurred when trying to reduce highly crystalline pyrolusite mno2 s it is possible to speculate how mnox s aging and potential reduced bioavailability to mn reducing bacteria could be related to observed mn release occurring in wtps with mnox s coated media typical anthracite or sand filtration media have a long service life often well over ten years due to media durability edzwald 2011 in wtps employing free chlorine addition to the filter promotes soluble mn removal leading to mnox s deposition on the media and results in a significant amount of mnox s accumulation over years tobiason et al 2008 showed that mnox s coatings on anthracite media from surface wtps addressing seasonal elevated mn concentration issues often had a tree ring like structures with many bands of high mnox s placed throughout the coating such deposition over many years would provide opportunity for chemical aging and structural changes in the mnox s present that could decrease mn bioavailability from the coatings this would correspond with the observation knocke published data that significant residual mnox s coating may be present on filter media following an observed mn release event from the filter the presumption would be that only the more recently deposited mnox s coating was available for microbial reduction due to its less crystalline structure 4 conclusions bench scale filter column studies served to demonstrate the potential of mn reducing microorganisms specifically s oneidensis mr 1 to contribute to the mn desorption phenomenon occasionally seen in wtps when pre filtration free chlorine is removed specific conclusions that can be derived from this study include

20033,discontinuing application of pre filter chlorine is a common water treatment plant practice to permit a bioactive filtration process for the removal of soluble mn however soluble mn desorption has sometimes been observed following cessation of chlorine addition where filter effluent mn concentration exceeds the influent mn concentration in this paper it is hypothesized that mn reducing bacteria present in a biofilm on the filter media may be a factor in this mn release phenomenon the primary objective of this research was to assess the role of mn reducing microorganisms in the release of soluble mn from mnox s coated filter media following interruption of pre filtration chlorination bench scale filter column studies were inoculated with shewanella oneidensis mr 1 to investigate the impacts of a known mn reducing bacterium on release of soluble mn from mnox s coatings in situ vial assays were developed to gain insight into the impacts of mnox s age on bioavailability to mn reducing microorganisms and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr method was developed to quantify gene copies of the mtrb gene which is involved in mn reduction results demonstrated that microbially mediated mn release was possible above a threshold equivalent of 2 102 s oneidensis mr 1 cfu per gram of mnox s coated media and that those organisms contributed to mn desorption and release further detectable mtrb gene copies were associated with observed mn desorption lastly mnox s age appeared to play a role in mn reduction and subsequent release where mnox s solids of greater age indicated lower bioavailability these findings can help inform means of preventing soluble mn release from drinking water treatment plant filters graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water treatment manganese removal media filtration manganese oxides manganese reducing bacteria 1 introduction mn is a challenging drinking water contaminant owing to its widespread natural occurrence and multiple oxidation states e g mn ii mn iii mn iv in water elevated mn concentrations smcl 0 05 mg l in u s can present a significant aesthetic concern as the water travels through the distribution system and into a consumer s home plumbing upon entering the consumer s home water that contains oxidized mn is often characterized by a blackish brownish color which can lead to water discoloration complaints sly et al 1990 and an undesirable metallic taste sain et al 2014 microbial metal reduction is central to the geochemical cycling of fe mn and c in redox stratified waters johnson 2006 yet little is known about the microbial metabolic mechanisms by which the mn reduction process takes place in contrast to reduction of iron the current state of understanding mn reduction is that it does not provide energy to the cell lin et al 2012 under neutral ph conditions mn oxides are highly insoluble and can be crystalline in nature yang et al 2013 for reduction to occur microorganisms are required to transfer electrons to mn oxides that are external to the cell wall or membrane since contact with a localized inner membrane electron transport chain is not possible lovley et al 2004 it is generally thought that mn iv reduction occurs directly at the outer membrane via single two electron successive transfers resulting in mn ii as the final product thamdrup 2000 the first electron transfer forms soluble mn iii as a temporary intermediate before a final electron transfer and reduction to mn ii the first electron transfer step increases the bioavailability of mn by reductive solubilization while the second step is coupled to the production of inorganic carbon lin et al 2012 shewanella has been used as a model metal reducing bacterium due to its ability to utilize a wide variety of electron acceptors and its capacity to transfer electrons to solid metal oxide compounds osterman et al 2008 the electron transport chain of s oneidensis is made up of several different interacting proteins which allow the utilization of extracellular electron acceptors for mn reduction szeinbaum et al 2014 the main outer membrane protein complex is mtrcba an electron channel that allows their passage to extracellular metal hydroxide complexes burnes 2000 mtrcba is mainly associated with the reduction of mn iv an outer membrane β barrel protein mtrb allows interaction and electron transfer to extracellular metal hydroxide complexes and has been shown to be required for mn iv and mn iii reduction lin et al 2012 one of the more common methods of soluble mn removal in water treatment facilities is through adsorption onto mnox s coated filtration media knocke et al 1991 tobiason et al 2008 this process has been referred to as the natural greensand effect and is a self regenerating process that continues to remove additional soluble mn brandhuber et al 2013 in a few water treatment plants wtps where adsorption of soluble mn to oxide coated filtration media is the main method utilized for soluble mn removal mn desorption and release from the media has been observed upon cessation of pre filter free chlorine addition islam 2010 in certain cases effluent mn exceeded the influent mn concentration for extended periods of time e g 1 2 weeks after chlorine application ceased gabelich et al 2006 this desorption phenomenon has specifically been documented at the aquarion water company awc stamford wtp stamford ct tobiason et al 2008 and at the henry j mills wtp riverside ca gabelich et al 2006 mn desorption from coated filter media has also been observed in the laboratory using filtration media from the awc lantern hill wtp stonington ct islam 2010 mn release appeared to be due to biologically mediated desorption from the anthracite filtration media in addition islam 2010 indicated that mn reducing populations were only capable of growth on filtration media and reduction of mn in the absence of chlorine consistent with the above observations cerrato et al 2010 were able to isolate mn reducing bacteria from the media of wtps operating in virginia and north carolina notably some of these bacteria mainly bacillus were capable of both oxidizing and reducing mn further recent studies have revealed that a wide diversity of microbes inhabit wtp media even under chlorinated conditions chiao et al 2014 the overall goal of this research was to evaluate the potential for biologically mediated mn reduction from mnox s coated filtration media during drinking water treatment the specific objectives were to 1 characterize mn release from columns with varying extent of mnox s coating on the media under conditions of reduced microbial activity 2 compare mn desorption from laboratory scale filter columns containing porous media with and without inoculation of s oneidensis mr 1 a known mn reducing microorganism 3 develop and apply a molecular assay for the quantification of the mtrb marker gene associated with biological mn reduction and 4 investigate the effects of mnox s age on bioavailability and mn reduction capacity the goal was to generate information to inform improved operation of media filters at wtps to optimize biological benefits of removing organic carbon via biofiltration while minimizing potential concerns related to mn release 2 experimental methods and materials the following text describes the experimental and analytical methods applicable to this study more detailed information may be found in swain 2016 2 1 laboratory bench scale filter column experimental and analytical procedures bench scale filter columns were set up to produce mn breakthrough curves as well as replicate mn removal and desorption trends observed in full scale wtps each laboratory bench scale filter contained a filter media sand or anthracite received an influent that contained soluble mn and aluminum al primarily as al oh 3 s and had free chlorine applied for a defined initial amount of time to promote formation of mnox s coating on the media and active site regeneration for the consistent uptake of soluble mn particulate al oh 3 s was added at a low concentration approximately 200 μg l as al to mimic the presence of carryover floc from sedimentation basins in real world surface wtps jones 2012 during each study free chlorine application ceased after a set amount of time and the column influent and effluent were measured to evaluate the amount of soluble mn passing through the column media glass columns were 24 inches in height and had a 7 16 inch inner diameter plastic tubing was employed to transfer feed solutions to each column and transport filtered effluent away from the column six inches of media depth was used in each column experiment influent feed solutions were prepared with deionized water in five gallon increments and stored in larger plastic reservoirs each column had two influent feed solutions that were mixed just prior to entering the filter column the primary feed solution contained dissolved mn alkalinity dissolved and particulate al the second feed solution always contained alkalinity and contained free chlorine during the time period when an experiment required the presence of free chlorine in the filter applied water once mixed together the resulting influent feed solution characteristics of the water for each experiment were achieved columns were backwashed as needed when excessive head loss occurred or at least once daily backwashing was performed by pumping 1 l of deionized water in an upflow direction through the column at a rate of 25 gpm ft2 this flow rate corresponded to an approximate 30 media expansion there were two distinct sets of filter column experiments on two different mnox s coated filter medias to assess the potential role of mn reducing bacteria on mn release those procedures are provided in the following text 2 1 1 abiotic studies for assessing potential soluble mn release from media an initial set of experiments were designed to assess the potential for soluble mn release from filter media under abiotic conditions these served as a control to determine whether soluble mn release would occur from mnox s coated media purely by chemical means e g cessation of pre filter chlorine addition these experiments employed the use of new filtersil sand uniformity coefficient 2 65 effective size 0 5 mm which initially had no mnox s coating present the media was autoclaved prior to the start of mnox s coating and laboratory experiments to minimize microbial activity an initial mnox s coating was generated on the sand media through application of soluble mn 200 μg l and free chlorine 1 2 mg l for a defined period either 5 or 15 days extraction of the media coating by hydroxylamine sulfate addition indicated an mnox s coating level of 1 5 mg mn g media and 4 9 mg mn g media after 5 and 15 days of free chlorine application respectively this insured the presence of ample mnox s coating for evaluating the potential for mn reduction and release after free chlorine addition ceased in these experiments additional influent water characteristics to the sand media were ph 7 0 to 7 3 alkalinity 2 meq l total al 200 μg l and toc 0 5 mg l influent feed solutions were pumped into the column to yield a total hydraulic loading rate of 4 gpm ft2 following the initial period 5 or 15 days of mnox s coating deposition on the sand the free chlorine was eliminated from the feed water column effluent was monitored for the presence of soluble mn to evaluate the potential for actual release of mn from the media coating 2 1 2 experiments employing mn reducing bacteria to assess potential for mn release from media coatings a second set of experiments sought to assess the potential role of mn reducing bacteria in promoting mn release from mnox s coated media these experiments employed anthracite coal media uniformity coefficient 1 4 effective size 0 9 1 0 mm obtained from the harwood mills waterworks wtp newport news va the harwoods mill media was chosen for use due to its significant 28 30 mg mn g media mnox s coating that was present this wtp employs free chlorine addition to the filter applied water for soluble mn control the influent characteristics for the anthracite media experiment were as follows ph 6 3 to 6 6 alkalinity 2 meq l soluble mn 50 μg l and total al 200 μg l the slightly lower ph condition employed in relation to the abiotic study was due to the fact that the typical filter applied ph at the harwoods mill wtp is between 6 0 and 6 5 as such it was desired to use a ph application similar to what the media experienced in the wtp a free chlorine concentration of 0 5 1 0 mg l again comparable to harwoods mill wtp practice was present in both columns for the initial five day period of the test after which chlorine was no longer fed to the column whereas the abiotic study had no toc added to the filter applied water this experiment incorporated a small amount of sodium acetate influent toc 0 5 mg l as c to serve as a readily degradable organic substrate one of the columns in this study was inoculated with s oneidensis mr 1 a well characterized mn reducing bacterium while the other column had no microbes applied to the filter media s oneidensis mr 1 was obtained courtesy of dr kenneth nealson from the university of southern california to prepare the s oneidensis mr 1 inoculum a 10 μl sterile loop full of culture from an r2a agar bd difco plate was transferred to 100 ml of r2a broth bd difco the flask was incubated for 48 h in a shaking water bath at 30 c s oneidensis mr 1 was then used to inoculate a 1 l volume of r2a broth and again incubated for 48 h in a shaking water bath at 30 c the entire volume of culture was further allowed to acclimate to room temperature for an additional 24 h the culture was centrifuged at 5 000 g for 20 min to concentrate the pellet the pellet was suspended into a 200 ml volume of modified mn reduction broth which contained per liter of 10 mm hepes buffer ph 7 4 0 2 g yeast extract and 2 g sodium acetate the modified mn reduction broth with concentrated s oneidensis mr 1 inoculum was poured over the anthracite media in the column the culture was allowed to flow through the column for a short time and then was used to fill the column above the media level the column was left undisturbed for 24 h after which it was lightly backwashed additional culture was added to the column and was again subject to a short duration of flow culture filled the column above the media height and was left undisturbed for an additional 24 h after the period of column inoculation influent flow was introduced to the filter these two columns were monitored for effluent mn concentrations before and after the cessation of pre filter chlorine to evaluate whether the presence of the mn reducing bacteria potential led to mn release from the media coatings 2 1 3 analytical methods for filter column studies the ph of the influent feed solutions to the filter columns was monitored and adjusted with concentrated hydrochloric acid hcl as needed a hach hq40d ph meter was calibrated daily before measurements were taken a hach reagent set dpd method was utilized for the measurement of free chlorine influent and effluent bench scale column samples for mn analysis were preserved in 2 trace metal grade nitric acid and were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms a description of the term soluble mn is provided for clarity the influent solution to any media column contained only dissolved manganous mn ii ion likewise the relatively brief less than 2 min contact time between the dissolved mn ii and free chlorine prior to application to the coated media was too short to promote any significant mn ii oxidation and formation of particulate mnox s in the water applied to the media brandhuber et al 2013 preliminary testing with 0 45 μm membrane filtration of column effluent samples showed no significant presence of particulate oxidized mnox s being present which is consistent with practical experience when soluble mn is the only source in the feed as such the protocol for experimental testing did not involve 0 45 μm filtration of the column effluent samples and assumed that mn present in the column effluent was in the soluble form 2 2 molecular detection of mn reducing microorganisms 2 2 1 sample collection for molecular analyses dna was isolated from standard pure culture suspensions laboratory samples and environmental samples using the powersoil kit from mobio laboratories inc solon oh for use in quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr for extraction from anthracite media 0 25 g of each sample was measured and transferred to each extraction kit vial for liquid samples and standards suspensions were mixed and 250 μl was added into the extraction kit vials samples and standards were stored at 20 c until extraction 2 2 2 s oneidensis mr 1 qpcr the s oneidensis mr 1 16s rrna gene rt qpcr methods described by schicklberger et al 2011 were modified for qpcr ssofast evagreen supermix bio rad hercules ca was used with a reaction volume of 10 μl the mastermix contained 5 μl of ssofast evagreen supermix 0 8 μl of the forward and reverse primers 2 4 μl molecular grade water and 1 μl dna template the dna template was quantified using a qubit fluorometer bio rad and diluted to a concentration where 5 15 ng μl was added to each well before use in qpcr the optimal melting temperature was determined by a temperature gradient and melt curve ranging from 57 0 c to 51 0 c where 57 0 c was chosen as the optimal melting temperature for this protocol a standard curve was developed using dna extracts from suspensions of s oneidensis mr 1 culture of known colony forming units per ml density to quantify this organism from laboratory samples and bench scale filter column studies 2 2 3 mtrb gene detection multiple sequence comparison by log expectation muscle alignment edgar 2004 was chosen as the method to aid in design of the mtrb primer set from the ncbi genbank website 10 mtrb protein sequences were chosen for gene alignment based off the targeted sequence description table s1 the final mtrb primers obtained from the alignment is as follows forward 5 csttcaacvacatggccg 3 and reverse 5 sgagatctcsagcaggtc 3 for a 10 μl qpcr reaction volume the mastermix contained 5 μl of ssofast evagreen supermix 0 8 μl of the forward and reverse primers 2 4 μl of molecular grade water and 1 μl of dna template dna template was added into the reaction wells at a concentration between 5 and 15 ng μl annealing temperature ranges were tested between 50 0 c and 58 0 c where 50 0 c was chosen as optimal to validate the assay strains of bacillus spp that were verified not to have the capability to reduce mn were analyzed as a phylogenetically related negative control this validation confirmed non detect levels of the mtrb gene for the negative control strains 2 3 in situ mn reduction vial assay an in situ vial assay was developed to semi quantitatively evaluate the bioavailability to s oneidensis mr 1 of various aged mnox s samples various modifications detailed in the following sections were made from the protocol established by nealson et al 1991 a total of five mnox s samples were examined using the vial assay developed three of the mnox s samples were prepared by adding potassium permanganate kmno4 at a stoichiometric dosage to waters containing soluble mn obtained by dissolving manganous chloride mncl2 once the reaction was complete the mnox s formed was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 5 min to form a pellet and remove excess water the mnox s samples were washed by resuspension in nanopure water and re centrifuged to form a new pellet three times these solids were precipitated approximately one to seven months prior to use in the vial assay and were identified according to synthesis date 7 28 15 11 18 15 and 1 11 16 a fourth mnox s sample 2008 was a purchased mno2 s oxide from sigma that had been stored in the laboratory for approximately 7 years the fifth mnox s sample 7 8 15 was artificially aged by drying the formed mnox s at 103 c for 24 h an attempt was made to inactivate any microbes possibly present on the mnox s by exposure to an extremely strong free chlorine environment chlorine inactivation of the mnox s samples was completed by soaking the samples in a strong chlorine solution for sufficient time to yield a ct product of 10 000 mg l min after the desired ct of 10 000 mg l min was reached the mnox s samples were washed three times using sterile deionized water a semisolid manganese reduction agar contained the following per liter of 10 mm hepes buffer ph 7 4 0 2 g yeast extract 2 g sodium acetate and 3 g agar 0 3 the media was autoclaved on a 20 min liquid cycle and was allowed to cool before the addition of mnox s to determine the responsive range of the assay percent transmission at 540 nm was measured for lab synthesized mnox s solids 1 11 16 and 2008 samples over the range of 0 1 0 g l percent transmission versus mnox s solids concentration fit a polynomial curve with an r2 0 95 based on this a target initial mnox s sample addition of 0 7 or 0 35 g l was selected in order to maintain the assay within a measurable range over the duration of the assay as noted above the commercial mno2 s solids and the dried at 103 c mnox s solids were much darker in color and thus were added at the lower initial concentration 0 35 g l to achieve a comparable initial transmittance measurement of 4 8 across the vial assays a volume of 10 ml of the mn reduction agar with mnox s added was placed into glass vials for inoculation with the s oneidensis mr 1 bacteria vials were inoculated with fresh s oneidensis mr 1 cultures from r2a agar plates which were incubated overnight at 30 c cultures were removed from the agar plate with a sterile loop and suspended in 1 5 ml of sterile deionized water and subject to serial dilution a 100 μl aliquot of the desired s oneidensis mr 1 suspension was added into each vial and was vortexed each inoculum was enumerated using standard heterotrophic pour plate methods on r2a agar before the addition into vials a volume of 100 μl of sterile deionized water was added into the negative uninoculated control vials percent transmittance of light at 540 nm was used as a comparative surrogate parameter for semi quantitatively estimating the degree of mn reduction occurring within the vial as mnox s was reduced to soluble mn the percent transmittance of the suspension in the vial increased percent light transmittance was measured frequently a minimum of every 1 2 days using a spectrophotometer coleman junior model 6a maywood il that was calibrated at the 540 nm wavelength before each use gerhardt et al 1981 abiotically reduced positive control vials were prepared by adding 0 020 g of hydroxylamine sulfate suspended in 100 μl of sterile deionized water was added into a parallel set of vials for each type of mnox s sample this allowed for an estimate of the percent transmittance of a sample wherein essentially 100 of the mnox s added was reduced to soluble mn 3 results and discussion 3 1 abiotic filter media study mn sorption and release from mnox s coated virgin sand an initial experiment involved an abiotic study of the potential reduction of mnox s media coatings mnox s coatings were deposited onto autoclaved sand by interaction between soluble mn and free chlorine on the media for an initial period of either 5 or 15 days the longer time led to greater mnox s deposition on the sand after the prescribed period had elapsed the free chlorine was removed from the filter applied water and only soluble mn loading continued results from this abiotic study are shown in fig 1 time zero was set as the time chlorine addition ceased for each column soluble mn breakthrough occurred more quickly when the media in the columns had been coated for only five days the rate of soluble mn removal is known to be directly associated with surface mnox s concentration which impacts the amount of available active sites on a filter media knocke et al 1991 faster breakthrough from the 5 day coated columns would be expected as the mnox s coating level was only 1 5 mg mn g media whereas 4 9 mg mn g media of mnox s coating was found on the 15 day coated media knocke et al 1991 demonstrated that the number of mnox s active sites positively correlate with the degree of mnox s coating therefore the column with the 15 day mnox s coating had increased adsorption capacity on the media surface which resulted in slower mn breakthrough importantly the concentration of mn passing through the media depth never exceeded influent mn concentrations for either the 5 day or 15 day coated columns the breakthrough trends from this column experiment can be explained by the loss of mn uptake capacity on the media sites due to mn uptake becoming saturated given that regeneration with free chlorine was no longer taking place the cessation of free chlorine to filters in some full scale wtp gabelich et al 2006 and laboratory studies islam 2010 have shown mn desorption that results in effluent mn concentrations exceeding the influent for a period of several hours up to 1 2 weeks apparently due to reduction of mn from media coatings and release to the filter effluent these abiotic column studies did not yield situations where the column effluent mn concentration exceeded the influent mn level of 0 2 mg l as such operation of the columns under abiotic conditions did not yield evidence of mn reduction in the available mnox s media coatings suggesting a lack of purely chemical mechanisms for promoting mn reduction on the media 3 2 laboratory bench scale filter study mn release from harwood mills anthracite media with and without inoculum data related to the passage of soluble mn through the anthracite media filter depth for both the inoculated column s oneidensis mr 1 inoculum and uninoculated column are presented in fig 2 during the initial five days when free chlorine was applied the mn breakthrough in the inoculated column was consistently greater when compared to the uninoculated column likewise after free chlorine addition ceased the release of soluble mn was much greater for the inoculated column experimental conditions e g ph applied mn concentration applied free chlorine concentration chlorine demand across the media depth time of chlorine feed cessation etc between both columns remained the same through the duration of the experiment as such it is hypothesized that the difference in mn breakthrough observed could be attributed to the mn reduction activity of the s oneidensis mr 1 inoculum lovley and phillips 1988 showed that s oneidensis mr 1 coupled the oxidation of electron donors similar to the acetate supplied in the feed to these two columns to mn reduction in this specific experiment acetate was supplied as a readily oxidized substrate that could have been coupled with the reduction of mnox s from the media surface by the mn reducing microorganisms this result compares well to islam 2010 who were able to demonstrate a relationship between applied acetate concentration to mnox s coated media and subsequent soluble mn release from that media 3 2 1 s oneidensis mr 1 quantification relative abundances of s oneidensis mr 1 occurring in the top middle and bottom two inch sections of the inoculated and uninoculated columns were measured by qpcr after the completion of column operation detection of s oneidensis mr 1 was confirmed at all depths in the inoculated column at an average density across the three layers of 3 9 0 89 102 cfu ml s oneidensis mr 1 was not detected at any depth in the uninoculated column these results indicate that the process used to inoculate s oneidensis mr 1 on the anthracite media was successful and supports the hypothesis that the presence of these mn reducing bacteria contributed to the additional observed mn release to the authors knowledge no prior study has specifically confirmed the presence of s oneidensis specifically on wtp media though other species of mn reducers have been identified cerrato et al 2010 in this specific study s oneidensis mr 1 was selected as a well known and highly characterized model with well defined gene targets for monitoring and thus served well in its purpose of representing conditions with confirmed mn reducers inoculated relative abundances of mtrb genes in the top middle and bottom two inch sections of the inoculated and uninoculated columns were also measured by qpcr results indicated that the s oneidensis mr 1 inoculated columns contained more mtrb gene copies the average ct value for the s oneidensis mr 1 inoculated columns was 27 0 26 compared to uninoculated column which had an average ct value of 38 0 21 where ct values are inversely proportional to target gene copy numbers these findings further support the conclusion that there were far more microorganisms that had the ability to reduce mn in the inoculated column 3 2 2 potential effects of aging on the bioavailability of mn in mnox s coatings fig 3 presents normalized transmittance values equivalent to a 1 g l mnox s agar vial normalization of transmittance measurements to that of a 1 g l mnox s agar vial enabled relative comparisons of mn reduction capacities notably the 2008 and 7 8 15 solids were characterized by the least extent of mn reduction over the duration of the study all the other mnox s solids evaluated in this study were comparable in the observed extent of mn reduction and corresponding increase in sample percent transmittance average s oneidensis mr 1 cell counts were compared among triplicate vials via qpcr over the course of the mnox s incubations fig 4 an anova test confirmed that mean cell concentrations were highly similar across all the mnox s agar vials throughout the experiment f fcrit p 0 05 nonetheless differences in mn reduction among the vials were clearly observed fig 3 indicating that variances in s oneidensis mr 1 populations between vials were not responsible for the differences further for the 2008 and 7 8 15 mnox s samples even though the s oneidensis mr 1 count increased over time mn reduction rates were slower than observed for the other samples the 7 28 15 11 18 15 and 1 11 16 mnox s samples had the same density of s oneidensis mr 1 but could reduce more mnox s because the 2008 and 7 8 15 vials had similar s oneidensis mr 1 counts but lower extent of observed mn reduction this pointed to a reduced bioavailability of the mnox s present in these two more aged samples the ability of microbes to reduce freshly precipitated mnox s when coupled with the oxidation of various organic compounds has been reported by a wide variety of authors with one of the seminal papers being published by lovley and phillips 1988 aging has been shown to produce chemical and structural changes in the forms of mnox s present cui et al 2010 hinkle et al 2016 likewise variations in mnox s crystalline structure affect mn reactivity stone 1987 burdige et al 1992 showed that s oneidensismr 1 could reduce amorphous more recently precipitated forms of mnox s δ mno2 s and birnessite much more readily than occurred when trying to reduce highly crystalline pyrolusite mno2 s it is possible to speculate how mnox s aging and potential reduced bioavailability to mn reducing bacteria could be related to observed mn release occurring in wtps with mnox s coated media typical anthracite or sand filtration media have a long service life often well over ten years due to media durability edzwald 2011 in wtps employing free chlorine addition to the filter promotes soluble mn removal leading to mnox s deposition on the media and results in a significant amount of mnox s accumulation over years tobiason et al 2008 showed that mnox s coatings on anthracite media from surface wtps addressing seasonal elevated mn concentration issues often had a tree ring like structures with many bands of high mnox s placed throughout the coating such deposition over many years would provide opportunity for chemical aging and structural changes in the mnox s present that could decrease mn bioavailability from the coatings this would correspond with the observation knocke published data that significant residual mnox s coating may be present on filter media following an observed mn release event from the filter the presumption would be that only the more recently deposited mnox s coating was available for microbial reduction due to its less crystalline structure 4 conclusions bench scale filter column studies served to demonstrate the potential of mn reducing microorganisms specifically s oneidensis mr 1 to contribute to the mn desorption phenomenon occasionally seen in wtps when pre filtration free chlorine is removed specific conclusions that can be derived from this study include inoculation of column media with the mn reducer s oneidensis mr 1 was associated with increased rates of mn desorption s oneidensis mr 1 residing on the mnox s surface was able to remain viable and reduce mn after sustained up to five days contact with free chlorine mnox s age and crystalline structure could play an important role in the bioavailability of mn to mn reducing organisms declaration

applied field trap nitrate ions we then set the cell voltage to a constant value to regenerate these electrodes resulting in an inverted capacitive deionization i cdi operation unlike resins we avoid use of concentrated chemicals for regeneration we measure the selectivity of nitrate versus chloride ions as a function of regeneration voltage and initial chloride concentration we experimentally demonstrate up to about 6 5 fold observable selectivity in a cycle with a regeneration voltage of 0 4 v we also demonstrate a novel multi pass air flush i cdi operation to selectively enrich nitrate

used for sea water desalination and often have significantly high salt rejection 98 or higher chekli et al 2016 jamaly et al 2014 subramani and jacangelo 2015 zhao et al 2017 however such technologies are not readily optimized for treatment of lower salinity streams such as brackish water or in applications targeted towards removal of specific ions in the solution werber et al 2016 ion exchange resins are one alternative method charged groups on the surface of the resins are initially electrostatically shielded by low affinity ions e g cl but can then adsorb higher affinity ions e g no3 via ion exchange this affinity is currently not sufficiently well understood for first principles predictions of quantitative affinity but adsorption kinetics are known to be influenced by ion size and electronic structure and the associated interaction with ionic surface groups harland 1994 although use of ion exchange resins is promising for selective ion removal it suffers from significant drawbacks most notably are the requirement for high concentration chemicals used during regeneration and the disposal of these chemicals after regeneration capacitive deionization cdi and sub categories such as inverted capacitive deionization i cdi and membrane capacitive deionization mcdi are electrochemical techniques which use electrosorption to adsorb desorb ions onto from high surface area electrodes specifically in cdi a potential is applied to electrostatically adsorb ions while in i cdi native surface charges on porous electrodes are used to adsorb ions e g with no applied potential and an external potential is then applied to regenerate the electrode s cdi and i cdi have been mainly focused on reduction of salinity but recent efforts have explored removal of specific ionic contaminants from water farmer et al 1996 oren 2008 seo et al 2010 cdi and i cdi offer advantages over ion exchange resins in that they require no highly concentrated chemicals for regeneration in i cdi an electric field is applied to regenerate the cell and this also implies the possibility of energy recovery during the adsorption step gao et al 2015 selective ion removal has been an active area of research in cdi community in recent years the selectivity of adsorption has been attributed mainly to ion valence and steric effects han et al 2014 hou et al 2008 hou and huang 2013 li et al 2016 seo et al 2010 and the interaction between nanoporous size and hydrated radius also seems to play a significant role han et al 2014 hou et al 2008 hou and huang 2013 li et al 2016 nie et al 2011 selectivity has been demonstrated experimentally for lithium lee et al 2017 siekierka et al 2017a b siekierka and bryjak 2017 nitrate tang et al 2016a 2016b and fluoride removal lado et al 2017 tang et al 2015 yeo and choi 2013 however these studies relied on the intrinsic selectivity of pristine activated carbon surfaces han et al 2014 hou and huang 2013 seo et al 2010 other studies kim et al 2013 kim and choi 2012 coated the surface of the activated carbon electrodes with an anion exchange resin which then served as an ion selective barrier this is discussed further below in previous work we used nitrate selective moieties of a type shown to be effective for nitrate selective extraction using ion exchange resin absorbents oyarzun et al 2018 palko et al 2017 wheaton and bauman 1951 the physical mechanism for adsorption of these moieties relies on the ionic exchange of the selective surface group a quaternary ammonium such surface groups are initially weakly bound to a low affinity counter charged ion i e chloride upon exposure to a solution containing a high affinity ion i e nitrate there is an exchange between the low affinity chloride with the high affinity nitrate the system of palko et al 2017 was very limited in practicality and energy efficiency since only a single electrode was functionalized and the counter electrode sustained a faradaic reaction to drive overall current in the cell this significant drawback was addressed by oyarzun et al 2018 who functionalized one electrode with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and the second with sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs hence a more complete i cdi cell despite this the latter study was also limited in several ways first the measurements quantifying adsorption and desorption were for pure sodium nitrate solutions and so no selectivity was demonstrated second the study presented no theory capable of predicting the dynamic steady state of the multi species adsorption and desorption dynamics third the study provided no way to continuously enrich selectively adsorbed nitrate in multiple cycles or air flushing of any kind these three shortcomings are addressed in the current work we note that the current functionalization differs significantly from the work of kim et al 2013 kim and choi 2012 in that we here use no anion exchange barrier or membrane or absorbance medium of any kind to treat the activated carbon instead we adsorb to the surface of ctab and sdbs to the electrodes to achieve a selective adsorption function in our approach ions neither cross a membrane barrier nor are absorbed into any medium but instead are adsorbed directly to a treated surface as mentioned above we also address shortcomings of the work of palko et al 2017 and oyarzun et al 2018 by providing a theoretical framework to model the competition of adsorption desorption of multispecies by quantifying the simultaneous and competitive adsorption of chloride versus nitrate ions and by exploring a novel recirculation method to selectively preconcentrate species to this end we explore the competition between the low affinity ion chloride and the high affinity ion nitrate onto the ctab functionalized electrode ctab has been used for the selective removal of nitrate over chloride in permeable ion exchange membranes barron and fritz 1984 but not in i cdi we study experimentally the effect of regeneration voltage and inlet concentrations on ion removal using species specific ion chromatography ic quantification of the outlet stream species as we shall see we achieve high values of selectivity and demonstrate an dynamic model useful to selectively remove ions and reduce ion concentrations below regulations limits world health organization 2011 we also present a model to guide our design and optimize our system a number of models have been presented to explain selectivity and these have focused on either ion size effects compared to pore structure suss 2017 or on ion valence and its effect on electrostatics zhao et al 2012 the latter models lack a detailed treatment including competitive selectivity of the differing affinity of surface groups of the activated carbon surface we here expand on the steady state model presented by hemmatifar et al 2017 to model and study the effect of surface treatment on ion adsorption additionally we perform experiments and develop time dependent predictions of the dynamics of ion selective desalination our model combines a donnan treatment for electric double layers and electrosorption langmuir type equilibria our electrostatics treatment includes chemical surface charge for functionalized activated carbon which we incorporate as a first order species specific equilibrium reaction model for adsorption we model transport through the cell using a well mixed reactor model 2 theory 2 1 equilibrium model for ion selectivity we recently developed a weak electrolyte equilibria model for activated carbons with charged functional groups and showed effect of ph on carbon s surface charge and its ability to adsorb in the absence of applied electric fields hemmatifar et al 2017 this is in contrast with contributions where chemical adsorption has been modeled using a constant surface charge biesheuvel et al 2015 dykstra et al 2017 he et al 2018 mubita et al 2018 we here show a modification of such a model and demonstrate competitive adsorption selectivity of ions onto the surfactant treated carbon surfaces we make the following assumptions 1 moderate ph range 4 10 persat et al 2009 such that salt concentration is considerably larger than that of hydronium and hydroxide ions and 2 surfactant functional groups dominate the native weak electrolyte surface charge groups associated with the bare carbon hemmatifar et al 2017 the latter assumption implies that the chemical surface charge on the electrode is primarily due to strong electrolyte behavior of the surfactants in section 4 2 we show validity of these two assumptions for the current study a more general formulation of the model which includes ph effects is presented in section s1 of the supplementary information next we model the intrinsic affinity of anionic species i e chloride and nitrate ions to ctab treated activated carbon electrode cta ac with equilibrium reactions of the form 1 ctacl k cl cta cl 2 ctano 3 k no 3 cta no 3 and intrinsic affinity of cationic species i e sodium ions to sdbs treated electrode dbs ac as 3 dbsna k na dbs na where k cl k no 3 and k na are equilibrium constants for adsorption of chloride nitrate and sodium ions respectively and can be written as 4 k cl c cta c m cl a c ctacl 5 k no 3 c cta c m no 3 a c ctano 3 6 k na c dbs c m na c c dbsna here c cta c ctacl c ctano 3 c dbs and c dbsna are the concentrations of the respective surfactant species in units of moles per micropore volume and c m cl a c m no 3 a and c m na c are micropore concentrations of chloride and nitrate ions in cta ac and sodium ions in dbs ac respectively the subscript m denotes micropore and a and c denote active and counter electrode the micropore vs macropore treatment of electrodes is discussed at the start of the next section species conservation can be written in terms of the analytical concentrations of surfactant groups on cta ac electrode c cta 0 and dbs ac electrode c dbs 0 as 7 c cta 0 n cta 0 v m c cta c ctacl c ctano 3 8 c dbs 0 n dbs 0 v m c dbs c dbsna where n cta 0 and n dbs 0 are net amount moles of surfactant on cta ac and dbs ac electrodes and v m is the micropore volume note cta ac and dbs ac electrodes have positive and negative chemical charge respectively the chemical charge density of surfactants on the electrodes can then be written as 9 σ c h e m a f c cta f c cta 0 1 c m cl k cl c m no 3 k no 3 1 10 σ c h e m c f c dbs f c dbs 0 1 c m na k na 1 where f is faraday s constant 2 2 electric double layer model we use a donnan model for description of electronic double layer edl where the micropore edls are treated as strongly overlapping biesheuvel et al 2011 hemmatifar et al 2015 a detailed description of this model is given in our recent work hemmatifar et al 2017 so we here summarize the important results concentration of ions within the micropores can be related to that of macropores outside edls with a boltzmann distribution of the form 11 c m i j c i e x p z i δ ϕ d j v t with i cl no 3 na and j a c where c m i j is micropore concentration of ion i chloride nitrate or sodium ions in the electrode j a for anode and c for cathode c i and z i are the corresponding macropore concentration and valence of ion i and δ ϕ d j is donnan potential in the electrode j the chemical ionic and electronic charge density add up to zero in each electrode i e net neutral charge compensation as in 12 σ c h e m j σ i o n i c j σ e l e c j 0 with j a c where σ i o n i c j f i z i c m i j is the ionic and σ e l e c j c m δ ϕ m j is the electronic charge density of electrode j respectively c m and δ ϕ m j being volumetric capacitance and micropore potential drop we also assume that the electronic charges applied to the electrodes are antisymmetric hence we write 13 v m a σ e l e c a v m c σ e l e c c 0 where v m a and v m c are respectively the micropore volumes for the anode and cathode respectively and we assume v m a v m c 2 3 mass transport equations we here assume an open loop i cdi system with continuous flow from reservoir to the cell with constant feed concentration we assume a well mixed reactor model with first order kinetics for functional groups on cta ac and dbs ac electrode as described in section 4 1 for our multi species system the mass transport equations for chloride and nitrate ions can thus be written as 14 v c e l l d c cl d t q c cl 0 c cl v m d d t c m cl a c ctacl c m cl c 15 v c e l l d c no 3 d t q c no 3 0 c no 3 v m d d t c m no 3 a c ctano 3 c m no 3 c where c cl and c no 3 are the effluent concentrations of chloride and nitrate ions v c e l l is cell volume and q is the flow rate for the third species here sodium we invoke electroneutrality condition and relate concentration of na to that of cl and no 3 as 16 c na c cl c no 3 2 4 external circuit we now couple mass transport equations above with the external circuit first the external applied voltage v e x t can be related to anode and cathode potentials v a and v c as 17 v e x t t i e x t r s v a v c with v a v c δ ϕ d a δ ϕ m a δ ϕ d c δ ϕ m c here i e x t is the external current measured with a sourcemeter and r s is the net series resistance in the system including resistance of wires electrode current collector contact resistance and resistance of solution in spacers for simplicity we model the resistance r s as sum of electronic resistance r s e l e c and ionic resistance r s i o n i c we model the latter as 18 r s i o n i c λ 0 λ na c na λ cl c cl λ no 3 c no 3 where λ 0 λ na λ cl and λ no 3 are constants that relate ionic concentrations to ionic resistance of the cell finally the applied voltage v to the two electrode i cdi system can be written as 19 v c e l l i e x t r s δ ϕ d a δ ϕ m a δ ϕ d c δ ϕ m c 2 5 intrinsic and cycle selectivity in the ion exchange resin literature the selectivity of an ion relative to another is often characterized using a selectivity coefficient defined as the ratio of enrichment factors for the two ions of interest or equivalently ratio of equilibrium constants by enrichment factor we mean ratio of concentration on the exchanger stationary phase over concentration in the external solution mobile phase hasnat and juvekar 1996 helfferich 1962 this parameter is measurable only in controlled and near equilibrium conditions and so we hereafter refer to this coefficient as the intrinsic selectivity coefficient for example this intrinsic parameter is strictly only valid and observable in the absence of an applied voltage to the cell as an example the intrinsic selectivity coefficient of nitrate with respect to chloride on ctab treated electrode can be written as 20 k i n t k no 3 k cl c ctano 3 c no 3 c ctacl c cl where c cl and c no 3 are concentrations in external solution in the case of no applied voltage note in general this is different from zero voltage the external voltage can alter this intrinsic selectivity towards higher or lower selectivity coefficient values the set of equations in sections 2 1 to 2 3 can be solved to calculate the modified selectivity coefficient due to applied voltage for which we here propose the following definition 21 k i n t c ctano 3 δ c no 3 c no 3 c ctacl δ c cl c cl or equivalently using mass conservation equations 15 and 16 as 22 k i n t c no 3 0 c no 3 c no 3 c cl 0 c cl c cl where δ c no 3 and δ c cl are excess micropore concentrations increase in concentrations with respect to external solution due to applied voltage and can be written as δ c i c m i a c m i c 2 c i for i cl no 3 note that in the absence of external voltage micropore and external solution concentrations are equal i e c m i j c i for i cl no 3 and j a c so δ c i 0 and k i n t is recovered we note that intrinsic selectivity coefficients k i n t and k i n t solely quantify preferential adsorption by chemical affinity in cdi applications however the observable in effluent selective adsorption of one species versus others is determined by the dynamics of the coupled effects of this chemical affinity with electrosorption and mass transport for example cdi requires a regeneration or desorption step for cyclic operation so that the achievable selectivity of both the adsorption and regeneration steps is influenced by the operational parameters of the cdi cell in this work we chose an operation scheme wherein surfactant treated electrodes is used for selective adsorption of nitrate ions and this is then followed by a non selective regeneration step to quantify the preference of the cdi cell for nitrate ions in the voltage window v r e g regeneration voltage to v a d s adsorption voltage we define the new parameter we term the cycle selectivity coefficient k c y c l e for a closed loop system we define cycle selectivity coefficient as 23 k c y l c e c no 3 v r e g c no 3 v a d s c no 3 0 c cl v r e g c cl v a d s c cl 0 where numerator is relative change in concentration of nitrate in the external solution measured at the end of adsorption and regeneration steps a brief analytical development of this expression is given in the si note the denominator is the relative change for chloride ions for open loop systems cycle selectivity coefficient can be calculated as 24 k c y l c e c cl 0 c no 3 0 0 t a d s c no 3 0 c no 3 t d t 0 t a d s c cl 0 c cl t d t where c no 3 t and c cl t are time varying effluent concentration of nitrate and chloride and t a d s is duration of adsorption step note that k c y c l e can attain values very different and significantly larger than the intrinsic selectivity for example we will show in section 4 2 that for small voltage window the equilibrium concentration of chloride in the external solution in adsorption step is very close to that of the regeneration step this results in very large cycle selectivity but as we shall see this is at the cost of low salt adsorption capacity 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials we used commercially available activated carbon electrodes material methods llc pacmm 203 irvine ca and modified the surface charge of the activated carbon with anionic and cationic surfactants half of the pristine electrodes were functionalized with cetrimonium bromide ctab ch3 ch2 15n ch3 3br cationic surfactant in order to enhance their anion adsorption capacity the electrodes were soaked in 500 ml solution of 10 mm ctab for 12 h thoroughly rinsed with deionized di water and dried we refer to this ctab treated activated carbon as cta ac from this point forward the rest of the pristine electrodes were functionalized with sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs ch3 ch2 11c6h4so3na anionic surfactant to increase their cation adsorption capacity similarly the electrodes were soaked in 500 ml of 10 mm sdbs solution for 12 h rinsed with deionized di water and dried we refer to sdbs treated activated carbon as dbs ac the uptake of ctab and sdbs by electrodes was approximately 446 and 489 mg 1 2 and 1 4 mmol per g of electrodes measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l autoanalyzer shimadzu kyoto japan 3 2 experimental setup 3 2 1 intrinsic selectivity experiment to calculate the intrinsic selectivity of the cta ac electrode for nitrate with respect to chloride we performed the following adsorption equilibrium experiment first a sample of cta ac electrode was soaked in 150 mm nacl for 24 h in order for cl to replace br that was originally on the electrode surface the process was repeated for a second time to exchange as much br as possible with cl the total of exchanged bromide was 1 14 mmol per g of electrodes which is 95 of the initial ctab uptake activated carbon electrodes were then washed with di water and dried next eight containers were filled with 24 ml of sodium nitrate solution with concentrations between 0 3 and 3 mm and 50 mg of activated carbon was added to each container the containers were sealed and gently agitated for 24 h and the equilibrium concentration of nitrate and chloride was measured with ic 3 2 2 i cdi experiments fig 1 shows the schematic of the i cdi cell our i cdi cell utilizes a radial inflow geometry wherein feed solution is injected into the system from the periphery of the stack of circular electrodes the solution then flows radially inward between the electrode layers through separators and electrosorption or desorption occurs the desalted brine solution then exits the system from the center of the porous electrode stack in a direction normal to the planes of the electrodes see hemmatifar et al 2017 oyarzun et al 2018 and palko et al 2017 for descriptions of similar cdi cell architectures we fabricated a flow between i cdi cell using a single pair of surfactant treated electrodes with 3 5 cm diameter 300 μm thickness and a total dry mass of 0 28 g we used 50 μm thick titanium sheets as current collectors and a 300 μm thick woven plastic mesh mcmaster carr los angeles ca as a spacer between the electrodes our i cdi experimental setup consisted of the i cdi cell a 3 l reservoir a sourcemeter keithley 2400 cleveland oh and a peristaltic pump watson marlow 120u dv falmouth cornwall uk to exchange the bromide initially on cta ac electrode we applied 0 v to the cell and maintained a continuous 0 23 ml min 1 flow of 2 mm nano3 and 2 mm nacl for 12 h we then applied voltages of 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 and 1 2 v for cell regeneration and 0 v short circuit for ion adsorption in a separate set of experiments we fixed the regeneration voltage and used different nitrate to chloride inlet concentrations to this end we applied 1 v in regeneration and 0 v in adsorption steps with a feed solution of 2 mm nano3 mixed with 2 4 or 8 mm nacl the duration of each regeneration or adsorption step in all experiments was 2 h we collected effluent in aliquots accumulated over 10 min intervals and saved into separate containers using a fraction collector model 2128 bio rad ca the ionic content of each sample was then measured using ion chromatography dionex dx 500 dionex ca at the stanford icp ms tims facility 3 2 3 up concentration experiment to demonstrate ion selective capacitive desalination we fabricated a second higher capacity cell this second cell was similar to that in section 3 2 2 but featured three pairs of electrodes three cta ac and three dbs ac electrodes with a total dry mass of 0 84 g we use this cell to demonstrate and study a multi pass air flush mode which we term up concentration operation of our cta ac dbs ac system the up concentration experiments were as follows first in the adsorption step we fed a solution of 2 mm nano3 and 2 mm nacl at a 4 ml min 1 flow rate for 4 h and applied 0 v to the cell a single pass flow was used in this adsorption step i e the solution passed through the cell once and effluent was collected in a reservoir after the adsorption step the cell was emptied of solution by pumping air into the system while a voltage of 0 v was applied to the cell next we performed a closed loop circulation step by connecting the cell to a second reservoir which we herein call brine reservoir ﬂow at 8 ml min 1 from the brine reservoir to the cell and back to the brine reservoir this brine reservoir was initially filled with 154 ml of di water during regeneration a voltage of 1 v was applied to the cell negative lead to cta ac and positive lead to dbs ac electrode for 4 h to desorb the nitrate and chloride ions into the brine reservoir to minimize cross contamination the solution in the cell and tubing was then emptied to the brine reservoir by flowing air into the system at this point we collected an 0 4 ml sample from the reservoir for the ic measurement we repeated this process eight times and measured the nitrate and chloride content of the brine reservoir using ic we show the results of this selective up concentration experiment in section 4 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 quantification of intrinsic selectivity as described in section 3 2 1 we exchanged bromide initially on a sample of cta ac electrode with chloride we then placed 50 mg pieces of treated electrodes into 8 containers filled with 24 ml nano 3 of various concentrations 0 3 3 mm nitrate and chloride content of the solutions was then measured with ic after 24 h equilibration time fig 2 shows adsorption equilibrium of nitrate and chloride in the micropores c ctano 3 c ctacl on the ordinate versus that of nitrate and chloride in the solution phase c no 3 c cl on the abscissa final concentrations of nitrate and chloride in the solution phase c no 3 and c cl were directly and independently measured using ic micropore concentration of nitrate and chloride was calculated indirectly using the following relation 25 c ctano 3 c ctacl n no 3 v s o l c no 3 n br v s o l c cl where n no 3 is amount moles of nitrate ions added to the solution and n br is amount moles of released bromide initially bound to cta ac electrode the latter is approximately equal to amount of exchanged chloride we measured this quantity in section 3 2 1 in fig 2 markers show experimental results and solid line is linear regression based on the mean squared error r 2 0 9952 based on slope of regression line the intrinsic selectivity coefficient of nitrate with respect to chloride is approximately 7 7 we will use this measured intrinsic selectivity coefficient in the model as k i n t k cl k no 3 7 7 4 2 selective ion removal in i cdi operation 4 2 1 dynamic ion adsorption fig 3 shows the dynamic model prediction for nitrate and chloride and measurements at the outlet of our i cdi cell discussed in section 3 2 2 for the case of 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 v regeneration and 0 v adsorption with 2 mm nano3 and 2 mm nacl feed solution markers are experimental data measured by ic during regeneration step a portion of chemically and electrically adsorbed chloride and nitrate are expelled from cta ac electrode and are flushed from the cell similarly sodium ions are expelled from dbs ac counter electrode also the regeneration phase for nitrate has longer duration than that of the chloride in order to account for the higher affinity of quaternary ammonium groups towards nitrate higher affinity implies a larger number of moles of nitrate in the functional groups as discussed in our previous work oyarzun et al 2018 palko et al 2017 the anionic surfactant on dbs ac counter electrode provides an electrostatic shield against re adsorption of nitrate and chloride we stress that this treatment is thus a critical component of our desalination system in the adsorption step at 0 v chloride and nitrate are removed from the solution at different rates consistent with mass transport dynamics coupling with the different intrinsic anion selectivity of cta ac at the beginning of adsorption nitrate and chloride concentration both drop rapidly at longer times however chloride concentration approaches the inlet value noticeably faster than nitrate moreover chloride concentration increases beyond the inlet value shortly after start of adsorption step while nitrate concentration stays below the inlet value during the adsorption step this behavior is strong evidence of ion exchange on cta ac surface a similar phenomenon is also observed in adsorption of cations of different valence and hydrated radii such as na mg 2 and ca 2 in traditional cdi operation dykstra et al 2016 seo et al 2010 suss 2017 zhao et al 2012 in fig 3 solid lines are the model predictions using k na 10 m o l m 3 and k no 3 77 m o l m 3 as fitting parameters k cl is determined using the measured intrinsic selectivity k i n t 7 7 as k cl k no 3 k i n t eq 20 parameters and other constants used are listed in table s1 of the si the model predictions of selectivity agree well with ic measurements of effluent concentrations particularly during the adsorption step the model further captures the ionic exchange between chloride and nitrate ions during adsorption at higher regeneration voltages the model predictions for effluent chloride dynamics during the regeneration phase deviate somewhat from the respective measurements we hypothesize that this discrepancy at higher voltages is due to a competition with a third species hydroxide which may be generated by faradaic reactions 4 2 2 effect of regeneration voltage and ratio of concentrations in cycle selectivity fig 4 a and b summarize nitrate and chloride adsorption capacity of our cell μmol of anions as a function of respectively regeneration voltage and ratio of feed nitrate concentration over chloride concentration nitrate concentration was fixed 2 mm in all the experiments and chloride concentration varied between 2 and 8 mm markers are experimental measurements for each species fig 4c shows cycle selectivity for feed chloride concentration from 2 to 8 mm at fixed 2 mm feed nitrate concentration and regeneration voltage of 1 v cycle selectivity slightly increases with high feed chloride concentration fig 4d shows cycle selectivity at regeneration voltages from 0 4 to 1 2 v at 0 v adsorption cycle selectivity approaches the intrinsic selectivity value as expected experiments show cycle selectivity defined in eq 24 decreases with regeneration voltage magnitude the applied electronic charge during regeneration at the carbon surface is sufficient to electrostatically repel both anionic species from the surface with no observable preference i e fraction of desorbed ions is proportional to total moles present on the ac this implies that the estimated ions released into the stream during regeneration is a strong function of applied voltage and a weak function of the current cell ion concentration this non selective desorption mechanism produces available sites proportional to the initial ratio of species on the porous at the beginning of the regeneration step a higher desorption voltage produces more available sites on the cta ac electrode for both nitrate and chloride however due to the presence of quaternary ammonium functional groups on the cta ac electrode nitrate is simultaneously re adsorbed to the cta ac electrode further in fig 3 we observe a net deficit of chloride at the effluent during the regeneration concentration bellow the inlet concentration of chloride this suggests re adsorption of chloride ions on the dbs ac counter electrode during the regeneration selectivity data shown in fig 4d as discussed in section 3 2 2 corresponds to 2 h charge and 2 h discharge time according to fig 3 for high regeneration voltages cases exchange of chloride with nitrate is incomplete nitrate and chloride concentrations are far from baseline at the end of adsorption step we believe that a longer cycle time will lead to a complete exchange which in turn can increase cycle selectivity in those cases 4 3 up concentration a high water recovery method for selective ion removal using i cdi high water recovery wr is beneficial for water treatment processes however wr in cdi applications is usually around 50 in this section we present an operation method for cdi i cdi to increase wr and simultaneously concentrate the high affinity ion in a fixed volume of regenerated brine the method we present here can be used to concentrate rare species in our approach the brine reservoir volume was chosen to be much smaller than the volume of the electrode fig 5 shows concentration of chloride and nitrate in brine reservoir at the end of first eight cycles markers are measured values and lines are least square regressions with r 2 0 97 for chloride and 0 99 for nitrate concentration of ions in the reservoir linearly increases up to respectively 1 7 and 3 mm for chloride and nitrate by the end of last 8th cycle this is equivalent to an average increase of about 2 1 mg g 1 37 μmol g 1 nacl and 5 9 mg g 1 70 μmol g 1 nano3 per cycle based on dry mass of all electrodes the molar cycle selectivity of nitrate with respect to chloride is thus about 1 9 smaller than 7 7 intrinsic selectivity and even 3 0 cycle selectivity in i cdi experiment in section 5 2 at similar 1 v voltage level we hypothesize this decline in cycle selectivity in part is due to incomplete air flush step solution is partially removed from tubing and the cell interior this is particularly true for the smallest pores which have the highest capillary pressure moreover the partially wet macropores of the electrode after the air flush step have similar nitrate and chloride concentrations this increase mixing with the brine reservoir solution during the subsequent regeneration step and thus reduces the nitrate selectivity but nonetheless fig 5 shows successful selective removal of nitrate from feed solution and storage in a brine reservoir since we use a fixed brine volume and an open cycle to remove ions wr increases from 86 at the end of first cycle to 98 at the end of the eighth cycle we observe a linear relationship up to the eighth cycle however we expect a deviation from linear after more cycles due to concentration equilibrium between microporous and brine concentration 5 conclusions we showed a nitrate selective i cdi system with simple functionalization of electrodes with surfactants the active electrode was functionalized with ctab and the counter electrode with sdbs we first measured the intrinsic selectivity of cta ac for nitrate over chloride to be 7 7 using a controlled ex situ experiment we defined cycle selectivity as a parameter which takes into consideration the coupling of electrostatics and mass transport limitations our experiments showed that an increase in regeneration voltage magnitude decreases cycle selectivity in the limiting case at 0 v cycle selectivity approaches intrinsic selectivity as expected we developed a dynamic model to predict the dynamic steady state of adsorption regeneration of a i cdi system with functionalized electrodes our model assumes a predominant effect of surface groups over native weak electrolyte surface charge groups on the ac surface our model presents good agreement with ic measurements of dynamic steady state for the low affinity cl and high affinity no3 ion we explored a method of increasing water recovery while increasing the concentration of the high affinity species here nitrate over that of lower affinity species chloride to this end we implemented a novel multi pass air flush i cdi operation of our functionalized cell design we showed nitrate ions are preferentially adsorbed to the positive electrode from the feed solution during adsorption step subsequently we used an air flush step to minimize cross contamination and then desorbed the ions into a small 154 ml brine reservoir we showed a successful selective nitrate separation from the feed solution to brine reservoir with cyclic selectivity of about 1 9 declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

20034,capacitive deionization cdi is a promising technique for salt removal and may have potential for highly selective removal of ion species in this work we take advantage of functional groups usually used with ionic exchange resins and apply these to cdi to this end we functionalize activated carbon with a quaternary amines surfactant and use this surface to selectively and passively no applied field trap nitrate ions we then set the cell voltage to a constant value to regenerate these electrodes resulting in an inverted capacitive deionization i cdi operation unlike resins we avoid use of concentrated chemicals for regeneration we measure the selectivity of nitrate versus chloride ions as a function of regeneration voltage and initial chloride concentration we experimentally demonstrate up to about 6 5 fold observable selectivity in a cycle with a regeneration voltage of 0 4 v we also demonstrate a novel multi pass air flush i cdi operation to selectively enrich nitrate with high water recovery we further present a dynamic multi species electrosorption and equilibrium solution to surface chemical reaction model and validate the model with detailed measurements our i cdi system exhibits higher nitrate selectivity at lower voltages making it possible to reduce nano3 concentrations from 170 ppm to below the limit of maximum allowed values for nitrate in drinking water of about 50 ppm nano3 graphical abstract image 1 keywords ion selectivity capacitive deionization nitrate surface charge surfactant treatment 1 introduction lack of accessible clean water is a growing concern worldwide selective ion removal can play a crucial role for the extraction of ionic contaminants and or rare metal ions from aqueous solutions and reduce the cost of treating water nitrate is an example of a common potentially toxic anion in brackish water bouchard et al 1992 inoue choi et al 2014 jones et al 2016 thus highly selective desalination is relevant for point of use water purification systems and industrial applications widely used techniques for removal of organic and inorganic contaminants include reverse osmosis ro richards et al 2011 xie et al 2012 forward osmosis fo kumar and pal 2015 electrodialysis ed nanofiltration nf ghaemi et al 2018 and ionic exchange resins samatya et al 2006 xu et al 2012 membrane technologies such as ro or fo are predominantly used for sea water desalination and often have significantly high salt rejection 98 or higher chekli et al 2016 jamaly et al 2014 subramani and jacangelo 2015 zhao et al 2017 however such technologies are not readily optimized for treatment of lower salinity streams such as brackish water or in applications targeted towards removal of specific ions in the solution werber et al 2016 ion exchange resins are one alternative method charged groups on the surface of the resins are initially electrostatically shielded by low affinity ions e g cl but can then adsorb higher affinity ions e g no3 via ion exchange this affinity is currently not sufficiently well understood for first principles predictions of quantitative affinity but adsorption kinetics are known to be influenced by ion size and electronic structure and the associated interaction with ionic surface groups harland 1994 although use of ion exchange resins is promising for selective ion removal it suffers from significant drawbacks most notably are the requirement for high concentration chemicals used during regeneration and the disposal of these chemicals after regeneration capacitive deionization cdi and sub categories such as inverted capacitive deionization i cdi and membrane capacitive deionization mcdi are electrochemical techniques which use electrosorption to adsorb desorb ions onto from high surface area electrodes specifically in cdi a potential is applied to electrostatically adsorb ions while in i cdi native surface charges on porous electrodes are used to adsorb ions e g with no applied potential and an external potential is then applied to regenerate the electrode s cdi and i cdi have been mainly focused on reduction of salinity but recent efforts have explored removal of specific ionic contaminants from water farmer et al 1996 oren 2008 seo et al 2010 cdi and i cdi offer advantages over ion exchange resins in that they require no highly concentrated chemicals for regeneration in i cdi an electric field is applied to regenerate the cell and this also implies the possibility of energy recovery during the adsorption step gao et al 2015 selective ion removal has been an active area of research in cdi community in recent years the selectivity of adsorption has been attributed mainly to ion valence and steric effects han et al 2014 hou et al 2008 hou and huang 2013 li et al 2016 seo et al 2010 and the interaction between nanoporous size and hydrated radius also seems to play a significant role han et al 2014 hou et al 2008 hou and huang 2013 li et al 2016 nie et al 2011 selectivity has been demonstrated experimentally for lithium lee et al 2017 siekierka et al 2017a b siekierka and bryjak 2017 nitrate tang et al 2016a 2016b and fluoride removal lado et al 2017 tang et al 2015 yeo and choi 2013 however these studies relied on the intrinsic selectivity of pristine activated carbon surfaces han et al 2014 hou and huang 2013 seo et al 2010 other studies kim et al 2013 kim and choi 2012 coated the surface of the activated carbon electrodes with an anion exchange resin which then served as an ion selective barrier this is discussed further below in previous work we used nitrate selective moieties of a type shown to be effective for nitrate selective extraction using ion exchange resin absorbents oyarzun et al 2018 palko et al 2017 wheaton and bauman 1951 the physical mechanism for adsorption of these moieties relies on the ionic exchange of the selective surface group a quaternary ammonium such surface groups are initially weakly bound to a low affinity counter charged ion i e chloride upon exposure to a solution containing a high affinity ion i e nitrate there is an exchange between the low affinity chloride with the high affinity nitrate the system of palko et al 2017 was very limited in practicality and energy efficiency since only a single electrode was functionalized and the counter electrode sustained a faradaic reaction to drive overall current in the cell this significant drawback was addressed by oyarzun et al 2018 who functionalized one electrode with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and the second with sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs hence a more complete i cdi cell despite this the latter study was also limited in several ways first the measurements quantifying adsorption and desorption were for pure sodium nitrate solutions and so no selectivity was demonstrated second the study presented no theory capable of predicting the dynamic steady state of the multi species adsorption and desorption dynamics third the study provided no way to continuously enrich selectively adsorbed nitrate in multiple cycles or air flushing of any kind these three shortcomings are addressed in the current work we note that the current functionalization differs significantly from the work of kim et al 2013 kim and choi 2012 in that we here use no anion exchange barrier or membrane or absorbance medium of any kind to treat the activated carbon instead we adsorb to the surface of ctab and sdbs to the electrodes to achieve a selective adsorption function in our approach ions neither cross a membrane barrier nor are absorbed into any medium but instead are adsorbed directly to a treated surface as mentioned above we also address shortcomings of the work of palko et al 2017 and oyarzun et al 2018 by providing a theoretical framework to model the competition of adsorption desorption of multispecies by quantifying the simultaneous and competitive adsorption of chloride versus nitrate ions and by exploring a novel recirculation method to selectively preconcentrate species to this end we explore the competition between the low affinity ion chloride and the high affinity ion nitrate onto the ctab functionalized electrode ctab has been used for the selective removal of nitrate over chloride in permeable ion exchange membranes barron and fritz 1984 but not in i cdi we study experimentally the effect of regeneration voltage and inlet concentrations on ion removal using species specific ion chromatography ic quantification of the outlet stream species as we shall see we achieve high values of selectivity and demonstrate an dynamic model useful to selectively remove ions and reduce ion concentrations below regulations limits world health organization 2011 we also present a model to guide our design and optimize our system a number of models have been presented to explain selectivity and these have focused on either ion size effects compared to pore structure suss 2017 or on ion valence and its effect on electrostatics zhao et al 2012 the latter models lack a detailed treatment including competitive selectivity of the differing affinity of surface groups of the activated carbon surface we here expand on the steady state model presented by hemmatifar et al 2017 to model and study the effect of surface treatment on ion adsorption additionally we perform experiments and develop time dependent predictions of the dynamics of ion selective desalination our model combines a donnan treatment for electric double layers and electrosorption langmuir type equilibria our electrostatics treatment includes chemical surface charge for functionalized activated carbon which we incorporate as a first order species specific equilibrium reaction model for adsorption we model transport through the cell using a well mixed reactor model 2 theory 2 1 equilibrium model for ion selectivity we recently developed a weak electrolyte equilibria model for activated carbons with charged functional groups and showed effect of ph on carbon s surface charge and its ability to adsorb in the absence of applied electric fields hemmatifar et al 2017 this is in contrast with contributions where chemical adsorption has been modeled using a constant surface charge biesheuvel et al 2015 dykstra et al 2017 he et al 2018 mubita et al 2018 we here show a modification of such a model and demonstrate competitive adsorption selectivity of ions onto the surfactant treated carbon surfaces we make the following assumptions 1 moderate ph range 4 10 persat et al 2009 such that salt concentration is considerably larger than that of hydronium and hydroxide ions and 2 surfactant functional groups dominate the native weak electrolyte surface charge groups associated with the bare carbon hemmatifar et al 2017 the latter assumption implies that the chemical surface charge on the electrode is primarily due to strong electrolyte behavior of the surfactants in section 4 2 we show validity of these two assumptions for the current study a more general formulation of the model which includes ph effects is presented in section s1 of the supplementary information next we model the intrinsic affinity of anionic species i e chloride and nitrate ions to ctab treated activated carbon electrode cta ac with equilibrium reactions of the form 1 ctacl k cl cta cl 2 ctano 3 k no 3 cta no 3 and intrinsic affinity of cationic species i e sodium ions to sdbs treated electrode dbs ac as 3 dbsna k na dbs na where k cl k no 3 and k na are equilibrium constants for adsorption of chloride nitrate and sodium ions respectively and can be written as 4 k cl c cta c m cl a c ctacl 5 k no 3 c cta c m no 3 a c ctano 3 6 k na c dbs c m na c c dbsna here c cta c ctacl c ctano 3 c dbs and c dbsna are the concentrations of the respective surfactant species in units of moles per micropore volume and c m cl a c m no 3 a and c m na c are micropore concentrations of chloride and nitrate ions in cta ac and sodium ions in dbs ac respectively the subscript m denotes micropore and a and c denote active and counter electrode the micropore vs macropore treatment of electrodes is discussed at the start of the next section species conservation can be written in terms of the analytical concentrations of surfactant groups on cta ac electrode c cta 0 and dbs ac electrode c dbs 0 as 7 c cta 0 n cta 0 v m c cta c ctacl c ctano 3 8 c dbs 0 n dbs 0 v m c dbs c dbsna where n cta 0 and n dbs 0 are net amount moles of surfactant on cta ac and dbs ac electrodes and v m is the micropore volume note cta ac and dbs ac electrodes have positive and negative chemical charge respectively the chemical charge density of surfactants on the electrodes can then be written as 9 σ c h e m a f c cta f c cta 0 1 c m cl k cl c m no 3 k no 3 1 10 σ c h e m c f c dbs f c dbs 0 1 c m na k na 1 where f is faraday s constant 2 2 electric double layer model we use a donnan model for description of electronic double layer edl where the micropore edls are treated as strongly overlapping biesheuvel et al 2011 hemmatifar et al 2015 a detailed description of this model is given in our recent work hemmatifar et al 2017 so we here summarize the important results concentration of ions within the micropores can be related to that of macropores outside edls with a boltzmann distribution of the form 11 c m i j c i e x p z i δ ϕ d j v t with i cl no 3 na and j a c where c m i j is micropore concentration of ion i chloride nitrate or sodium ions in the electrode j a for anode and c for cathode c i and z i are the corresponding macropore concentration and valence of ion i and δ ϕ d j is donnan potential in the electrode j the chemical ionic and electronic charge density add up to zero in each electrode i e net neutral charge compensation as in 12 σ c h e m j σ i o n i c j σ e l e c j 0 with j a c where σ i o n i c j f i z i c m i j is the ionic and σ e l e c j c m δ ϕ m j is the electronic charge density of electrode j respectively c m and δ ϕ m j being volumetric capacitance and micropore potential drop we also assume that the electronic charges applied to the electrodes are antisymmetric hence we write 13 v m a σ e l e c a v m c σ e l e c c 0 where v m a and v m c are respectively the micropore volumes for the anode and cathode respectively and we assume v m a v m c 2 3 mass transport equations we here assume an open loop i cdi system with continuous flow from reservoir to the cell with constant feed concentration we assume a well mixed reactor model with first order kinetics for functional groups on cta ac and dbs ac electrode as described in section 4 1 for our multi species system the mass transport equations for chloride and nitrate ions can thus be written as 14 v c e l l d c cl d t q c cl 0 c cl v m d d t c m cl a c ctacl c m cl c 15 v c e l l d c no 3 d t q c no 3 0 c no 3 v m d d t c m no 3 a c ctano 3 c m no 3 c where c cl and c no 3 are the effluent concentrations of chloride and nitrate ions v c e l l is cell volume and q is the flow rate for the third species here sodium we invoke electroneutrality condition and relate concentration of na to that of cl and no 3 as 16 c na c cl c no 3 2 4 external circuit we now couple mass transport equations above with the external circuit first the external applied voltage v e x t can be related to anode and cathode potentials v a and v c as 17 v e x t t i e x t r s v a v c with v a v c δ ϕ d a δ ϕ m a δ ϕ d c δ ϕ m c here i e x t is the external current measured with a sourcemeter and r s is the net series resistance in the system including resistance of wires electrode current collector contact resistance and resistance of solution in spacers for simplicity we model the resistance r s as sum of electronic resistance r s e l e c and ionic resistance r s i o n i c we model the latter as 18 r s i o n i c λ 0 λ na c na λ cl c cl λ no 3 c no 3 where λ 0 λ na λ cl and λ no 3 are constants that relate ionic concentrations to ionic resistance of the cell finally the applied voltage v to the two electrode i cdi system can be written as 19 v c e l l i e x t r s δ ϕ d a δ ϕ m a δ ϕ d c δ ϕ m c 2 5 intrinsic and cycle selectivity in the ion exchange resin literature the selectivity of an ion relative to another is often characterized using a selectivity coefficient defined as the ratio of enrichment factors for the two ions of interest or equivalently ratio of equilibrium constants by enrichment factor we mean ratio of concentration on the exchanger stationary phase over concentration in the external solution mobile phase hasnat and juvekar 1996 helfferich 1962 this parameter is measurable only in controlled and near equilibrium conditions and so we hereafter refer to this coefficient as the intrinsic selectivity coefficient for example this intrinsic parameter is strictly only valid and observable in the absence of an applied voltage to the cell as an example the intrinsic selectivity coefficient of nitrate with respect to chloride on ctab treated electrode can be written as 20 k i n t k no 3 k cl c ctano 3 c no 3 c ctacl c cl where c cl and c no 3 are concentrations in external solution in the case of no applied voltage note in general this is different from zero voltage the external voltage can alter this intrinsic selectivity towards higher or lower selectivity coefficient values the set of equations in sections 2 1 to 2 3 can be solved to calculate the modified selectivity coefficient due to applied voltage for which we here propose the following definition 21 k i n t c ctano 3 δ c no 3 c no 3 c ctacl δ c cl c cl or equivalently using mass conservation equations 15 and 16 as 22 k i n t c no 3 0 c no 3 c no 3 c cl 0 c cl c cl where δ c no 3 and δ c cl are excess micropore concentrations increase in concentrations with respect to external solution due to applied voltage and can be written as δ c i c m i a c m i c 2 c i for i cl no 3 note that in the absence of external voltage micropore and external solution concentrations are equal i e c m i j c i for i cl no 3 and j a c so δ c i 0 and k i n t is recovered we note that intrinsic selectivity coefficients k i n t and k i n t solely quantify preferential adsorption by chemical affinity in cdi applications however the observable in effluent selective adsorption of one species versus others is determined by the dynamics of the coupled effects of this chemical affinity with electrosorption and mass transport for example cdi requires a regeneration or desorption step for cyclic operation so that the achievable selectivity of both the adsorption and regeneration steps is influenced by the operational parameters of the cdi cell in this work we chose an operation scheme wherein surfactant treated electrodes is used for selective adsorption of nitrate ions and this is then followed by a non selective regeneration step to quantify the preference of the cdi cell for nitrate ions in the voltage window v r e g regeneration voltage to v a d s adsorption voltage we define the new parameter we term the cycle selectivity coefficient k c y c l e for a closed loop system we define cycle selectivity coefficient as 23 k c y l c e c no 3 v r e g c no 3 v a d s c no 3 0 c cl v r e g c cl v a d s c cl 0 where numerator is relative change in concentration of nitrate in the external solution measured at the end of adsorption and regeneration steps a brief analytical development of this expression is given in the si note the denominator is the relative change for chloride ions for open loop systems cycle selectivity coefficient can be calculated as 24 k c y l c e c cl 0 c no 3 0 0 t a d s c no 3 0 c no 3 t d t 0 t a d s c cl 0 c cl t d t where c no 3 t and c cl t are time varying effluent concentration of nitrate and chloride and t a d s is duration of adsorption step note that k c y c l e can attain values very different and significantly larger than the intrinsic selectivity for example we will show in section 4 2 that for small voltage window the equilibrium concentration of chloride in the external solution in adsorption step is very close to that of the regeneration step this results in very large cycle selectivity but as we shall see this is at the cost of low salt adsorption capacity 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials we used commercially available activated carbon electrodes material methods llc pacmm 203 irvine ca and modified the surface charge of the activated carbon with anionic and cationic surfactants half of the pristine electrodes were functionalized with cetrimonium bromide ctab ch3 ch2 15n ch3 3br cationic surfactant in order to enhance their anion adsorption capacity the electrodes were soaked in 500 ml solution of 10 mm ctab for 12 h thoroughly rinsed with deionized di water and dried we refer to this ctab treated activated carbon as cta ac from this point forward the rest of the pristine electrodes were functionalized with sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs ch3 ch2 11c6h4so3na anionic surfactant to increase their cation adsorption capacity similarly the electrodes were soaked in 500 ml of 10 mm sdbs solution for 12 h rinsed with deionized di water and dried we refer to sdbs treated activated carbon as dbs ac the uptake of ctab and sdbs by electrodes was approximately 446 and 489 mg 1 2 and 1 4 mmol per g of electrodes measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc l autoanalyzer shimadzu kyoto japan 3 2 experimental setup 3 2 1 intrinsic selectivity experiment to calculate the intrinsic selectivity of the cta ac electrode for nitrate with respect to chloride we performed the following adsorption equilibrium experiment first a sample of cta ac electrode was soaked in 150 mm nacl for 24 h in order for cl to replace br that was originally on the electrode surface the process was repeated for a second time to exchange as much br as possible with cl the total of exchanged bromide was 1 14 mmol per g of electrodes which is 95 of the initial ctab uptake activated carbon electrodes were then washed with di water and dried next eight containers were filled with 24 ml of sodium nitrate solution with concentrations between 0 3 and 3 mm and 50 mg of activated carbon was added to each container the containers were sealed and gently agitated for 24 h and the equilibrium concentration of nitrate and chloride was measured with ic 3 2 2 i cdi experiments fig 1 shows the schematic of the i cdi cell our i cdi cell utilizes a radial inflow geometry wherein feed solution is injected into the system from the periphery of the stack of circular electrodes the solution then flows radially inward between the electrode layers through separators and electrosorption or desorption occurs the desalted brine solution then exits the system from the center of the porous electrode stack in a direction normal to the planes of the electrodes see hemmatifar et al 2017 oyarzun et al 2018 and palko et al 2017 for descriptions of similar cdi cell architectures we fabricated a flow between i cdi cell using a single pair of surfactant treated electrodes with 3 5 cm diameter 300 μm thickness and a total dry mass of 0 28 g we used 50 μm thick titanium sheets as current collectors and a 300 μm thick woven plastic mesh mcmaster carr los angeles ca as a spacer between the electrodes our i cdi experimental setup consisted of the i cdi cell a 3 l reservoir a sourcemeter keithley 2400 cleveland oh and a peristaltic pump watson marlow 120u dv falmouth cornwall uk to exchange the bromide initially on cta ac electrode we applied 0 v to the cell and maintained a continuous 0 23 ml min 1 flow of 2 mm nano3 and 2 mm nacl for 12 h we then applied voltages of 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 and 1 2 v for cell regeneration and 0 v short circuit for ion adsorption in a separate set of experiments we fixed the regeneration voltage and used different nitrate to chloride inlet concentrations to this end we applied 1 v in regeneration and 0 v in adsorption steps with a feed solution of 2 mm nano3 mixed with 2 4 or 8 mm nacl the duration of each regeneration or adsorption step in all experiments was 2 h we collected effluent in aliquots accumulated over 10 min intervals and saved into separate containers using a fraction collector model 2128 bio rad ca the ionic content of each sample was then measured using ion chromatography dionex dx 500 dionex ca at the stanford icp ms tims facility 3 2 3 up concentration experiment to demonstrate ion selective capacitive desalination we fabricated a second higher capacity cell this second cell was similar to that in section 3 2 2 but featured three pairs of electrodes three cta ac and three dbs ac electrodes with a total dry mass of 0 84 g we use this cell to demonstrate and study a multi pass air flush mode which we term up concentration operation of our cta ac dbs ac system the up concentration experiments were as follows first in the adsorption step we fed a solution of 2 mm nano3 and 2 mm nacl at a 4 ml min 1 flow rate for 4 h and applied 0 v to the cell a single pass flow was used in this adsorption step i e the solution passed through the cell once and effluent was collected in a reservoir after the adsorption step the cell was emptied of solution by pumping air into the system while a voltage of 0 v was applied to the cell next we performed a closed loop circulation step by connecting the cell to a second reservoir which we herein call brine reservoir ﬂow at 8 ml min 1 from the brine reservoir to the cell and back to the brine reservoir this brine reservoir was initially filled with 154 ml of di water during regeneration a voltage of 1 v was applied to the cell negative lead to cta ac and positive lead to dbs ac electrode for 4 h to desorb the nitrate and chloride ions into the brine reservoir to minimize cross contamination the solution in the cell and tubing was then emptied to the brine reservoir by flowing air into the system at this point we collected an 0 4 ml sample from the reservoir for the ic measurement we repeated this process eight times and measured the nitrate and chloride content of the brine reservoir using ic we show the results of this selective up concentration experiment in section 4 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 quantification of intrinsic selectivity as described in section 3 2 1 we exchanged bromide initially on a sample of cta ac electrode with chloride we then placed 50 mg pieces of treated electrodes into 8 containers filled with 24 ml nano 3 of various concentrations 0 3 3 mm nitrate and chloride content of the solutions was then measured with ic after 24 h equilibration time fig 2 shows adsorption equilibrium of nitrate and chloride in the micropores c ctano 3 c ctacl on the ordinate versus that of nitrate and chloride in the solution phase c no 3 c cl on the abscissa final concentrations of nitrate and chloride in the solution phase c no 3 and c cl were directly and independently measured using ic micropore concentration of nitrate and chloride was calculated indirectly using the following relation 25 c ctano 3 c ctacl n no 3 v s o l c no 3 n br v s o l c cl where n no 3 is amount moles of nitrate ions added to the solution and n br is amount moles of released bromide initially bound to cta ac electrode the latter is approximately equal to amount of exchanged chloride we measured this quantity in section 3 2 1 in fig 2 markers show experimental results and solid line is linear regression based on the mean squared error r 2 0 9952 based on slope of regression line the intrinsic selectivity coefficient of nitrate with respect to chloride is approximately 7 7 we will use this measured intrinsic selectivity coefficient in the model as k i n t k cl k no 3 7 7 4 2 selective ion removal in i cdi operation 4 2 1 dynamic ion adsorption fig 3 shows the dynamic model prediction for nitrate and chloride and measurements at the outlet of our i cdi cell discussed in section 3 2 2 for the case of 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 and 1 2 v regeneration and 0 v adsorption with 2 mm nano3 and 2 mm nacl feed solution markers are experimental data measured by ic during regeneration step a portion of chemically and electrically adsorbed chloride and nitrate are expelled from cta ac electrode and are flushed from the cell similarly sodium ions are expelled from dbs ac counter electrode also the regeneration phase for nitrate has longer duration than that of the chloride in order to account for the higher affinity of quaternary ammonium groups towards nitrate higher affinity implies a larger number of moles of nitrate in the functional groups as discussed in our previous work oyarzun et al 2018 palko et al 2017 the anionic surfactant on dbs ac counter electrode provides an electrostatic shield against re adsorption of nitrate and chloride we stress that this treatment is thus a critical component of our desalination system in the adsorption step at 0 v chloride and nitrate are removed from the solution at different rates consistent with mass transport dynamics coupling with the different intrinsic anion selectivity of cta ac at the beginning of adsorption nitrate and chloride concentration both drop rapidly at longer times however chloride concentration approaches the inlet value noticeably faster than nitrate moreover chloride concentration increases beyond the inlet value shortly after start of adsorption step while nitrate concentration stays below the inlet value during the adsorption step this behavior is strong evidence of ion exchange on cta ac surface a similar phenomenon is also observed in adsorption of cations of different valence and hydrated radii such as na mg 2 and ca 2 in traditional cdi operation dykstra et al 2016 seo et al 2010 suss 2017 zhao et al 2012 in fig 3 solid lines are the model predictions using k na 10 m o l m 3 and k no 3 77 m o l m 3 as fitting parameters k cl is determined using the measured intrinsic selectivity k i n t 7 7 as k cl k no 3 k i n t eq 20 parameters and other constants used are listed in table s1 of the si the model predictions of selectivity agree well with ic measurements of effluent concentrations particularly during the adsorption step the model further captures the ionic exchange between chloride and nitrate ions during adsorption at higher regeneration voltages the model predictions for effluent chloride dynamics during the regeneration phase deviate somewhat from the respective measurements we hypothesize that this discrepancy at higher voltages is due to a competition with a third species hydroxide which may be generated by faradaic reactions 4 2 2 effect of regeneration voltage and ratio of concentrations in cycle selectivity fig 4 a and b summarize nitrate and chloride adsorption capacity of our cell μmol of anions as a function of respectively regeneration voltage and ratio of feed nitrate concentration over chloride concentration nitrate concentration was fixed 2 mm in all the experiments and chloride concentration varied between 2 and 8 mm markers are experimental measurements for each species fig 4c shows cycle selectivity for feed chloride concentration from 2 to 8 mm at fixed 2 mm feed nitrate concentration and regeneration voltage of 1 v cycle selectivity slightly increases with high feed chloride concentration fig 4d shows cycle selectivity at regeneration voltages from 0 4 to 1 2 v at 0 v adsorption cycle selectivity approaches the intrinsic selectivity value as expected experiments show cycle selectivity defined in eq 24 decreases with regeneration voltage magnitude the applied electronic charge during regeneration at the carbon surface is sufficient to electrostatically repel both anionic species from the surface with no observable preference i e fraction of desorbed ions is proportional to total moles present on the ac this implies that the estimated ions released into the stream during regeneration is a strong function of applied voltage and a weak function of the current cell ion concentration this non selective desorption mechanism produces available sites proportional to the initial ratio of species on the porous at the beginning of the regeneration step a higher desorption voltage produces more available sites on the cta ac electrode for both nitrate and chloride however due to the presence of quaternary ammonium functional groups on the cta ac electrode nitrate is simultaneously re adsorbed to the cta ac electrode further in fig 3 we observe a net deficit of chloride at the effluent during the regeneration concentration bellow the inlet concentration of chloride this suggests re adsorption of chloride ions on the dbs ac counter electrode during the regeneration selectivity data shown in fig 4d as discussed in section 3 2 2 corresponds to 2 h charge and 2 h discharge time according to fig 3 for high regeneration voltages cases exchange of chloride with nitrate is incomplete nitrate and chloride concentrations are far from baseline at the end of adsorption step we believe that a longer cycle time will lead to a complete exchange which in turn can increase cycle selectivity in those cases 4 3 up concentration a high water recovery method for selective ion removal using i cdi high water recovery wr is beneficial for water treatment processes however wr in cdi applications is usually around 50 in this section we present an operation method for cdi i cdi to increase wr and simultaneously concentrate the high affinity ion in a fixed volume of regenerated brine the method we present here can be used to concentrate rare species in our approach the brine reservoir volume was chosen to be much smaller than the volume of the electrode fig 5 shows concentration of chloride and nitrate in brine reservoir at the end of first eight cycles markers are measured values and lines are least square regressions with r 2 0 97 for chloride and 0 99 for nitrate concentration of ions in the reservoir linearly increases up to respectively 1 7 and 3 mm for chloride and nitrate by the end of last 8th cycle this is equivalent to an average increase of about 2 1 mg g 1 37 μmol g 1 nacl and 5 9 mg g 1 70 μmol g 1 nano3 per cycle based on dry mass of all electrodes the molar cycle selectivity of nitrate with respect to chloride is thus about 1 9 smaller than 7 7 intrinsic selectivity and even 3 0 cycle selectivity in i cdi experiment in section 5 2 at similar 1 v voltage level we hypothesize this decline in cycle selectivity in part is due to incomplete air flush step solution is partially removed from tubing and the cell interior this is particularly true for the smallest pores which have the highest capillary pressure moreover the partially wet macropores of the electrode after the air flush step have similar nitrate and chloride concentrations this increase mixing with the brine reservoir solution during the subsequent regeneration step and thus reduces the nitrate selectivity but nonetheless fig 5 shows successful selective removal of nitrate from feed solution and storage in a brine reservoir since we use a fixed brine volume and an open cycle to remove ions wr increases from 86 at the end of first cycle to 98 at the end of the eighth cycle we observe a linear relationship up to the eighth cycle however we expect a deviation from linear after more cycles due to concentration equilibrium between microporous and brine concentration 5 conclusions we showed a nitrate selective i cdi system with simple functionalization of electrodes with surfactants the active electrode was functionalized with ctab and the counter electrode with sdbs we first measured the intrinsic selectivity of cta ac for nitrate over chloride to be 7 7 using a controlled ex situ experiment we defined cycle selectivity as a parameter which takes into consideration the coupling of electrostatics and mass transport limitations our experiments showed that an increase in regeneration voltage magnitude decreases cycle selectivity in the limiting case at 0 v cycle selectivity approaches intrinsic selectivity as expected we developed a dynamic model to predict the dynamic steady state of adsorption regeneration of a i cdi system with functionalized electrodes our model assumes a predominant effect of surface groups over native weak electrolyte surface charge groups on the ac surface our model presents good agreement with ic measurements of dynamic steady state for the low affinity cl and high affinity no3 ion we explored a method of increasing water recovery while increasing the concentration of the high affinity species here nitrate over that of lower affinity species chloride to this end we implemented a novel multi pass air flush i cdi operation of our functionalized cell design we showed nitrate ions are preferentially adsorbed to the positive electrode from the feed solution during adsorption step subsequently we used an air flush step to minimize cross contamination and then desorbed the ions into a small 154 ml brine reservoir we showed a successful selective nitrate separation from the feed solution to brine reservoir with cyclic selectivity of about 1 9 declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing
