6855,periphyton is important to lake ecosystems contributing to primary production nutrient cycling and benthic metabolism increases in periphyton growth in lakes can be indicative of changes in water quality shifts in ecosystem structure and increases in nutrient fluxes in oligotrophic lakes conservationists are interested in characterizing the influence of hydrological drivers on excessive periphyton growth along nearshore areas we collected nutrient samples bi weekly from groundwater and surface water during a 9 month monitoring period to evaluate the timing and availability of nutrients to eulittoral periphyton in lake tahoe groundwater discharge rates were measured synoptically using seepage meters and estimated indirectly using continuous head gradient measurements and aquifer properties estimated by slug tests the discharge measurements made from the seepage meter measurements provide information about the spatial variability perpendicular from shore along and the change in groundwater discharge due to wave action algal biomass sampled from substrates and observed using underwater photographs were used to correlate seasonal growth and nutrient concentrations in groundwater and lake water results indicate that groundwater and nutrient discharge are temporally variable due to seasonal changes in recharge within the watershed wave action and lake stage groundwater discharge was enhanced by the seasonally low lake stage and episodic recharge caused by precipitation falling as rain in the watershed increases in dissolved phosphorus and nitrate in the lake during winter are attributed to groundwater discharge and correlates to increases in algal biomass in the nearshore area results indicate that nutrient rich groundwater discharge appears to stimulate seasonal periphyton blooms along the eulittoral zone of lake tahoe keywords oligotrophic lake periphyton growth nutrients groundwater hydrology littoral zone 1 introduction cultural eutrophication is an important threat to lake water quality and ecosystems goldman 1988 dodds et al 2008 salmaso and mosello 2010 runoff from streams and urban areas fertilizers waste water atmospheric deposition and manure as major sources of nutrients that contribute to primary productivity algal blooms and eutrophication smith 1998 wetzel 2001 historically there has been a focus on the contribution of nutrients from urban and stream runoff to lakes however there is growing recognition of the contribution of nutrients from groundwater hagerthey and kerfoot 1998 shaw et al 2013

groundwater can be an important source of inorganic forms of nitrogen phosphorus carbon and micronutrients to lakes loeb and goldman 1979 meinikmann et al 2015 périllon and hilt 2016 freshwater lakes are considered extremely important resources and significant investments are put toward conservation efforts however these efforts mostly have neglected the influence of groundwater on eutrophication as few studies have focused on the influence of groundwater discharge on lake water quality more research is needed to develop a process understanding of the contribution of groundwater to benthic biomass research on primary production has focused more on free floating phytoplankton and periphyton responses to nutrient enrichment has mostly been done on stream systems cantonati and lowe 2014 biggs and close 1989 in situ lake periphyton studies are lacking and the few studies on the influence of groundwater on periphyton have relied upon artificial substrates and have neglected seasonal hydrological drivers loeb 1986 périllon et al 2017 and important contributions to whole lake primary production vadeboncoeur et al 2008 nutrients can limit primary production in lakes and depending on nutrient sources lakes can be limited by nitrogen and or phosphorus nutrient limitation studies can be used to evaluate the impacts of various sources of nutrients on periphyton in lakes and this information can inform best management practices and reduce economic impacts dodds et al 2008 groundwater discharge to lakes depends on the surrounding climate geology topography and lake stage discharge rates typically are the greatest near the shoreline and decline exponentially from shore making groundwater discharge particularly relevant to the littoral areas of lakes mcbride and pfannkuch 1975 schafran and driscoll 1993 périllon and hilt 2016 quantifying the rate of groundwater discharge to lakes is typically measured directly using seepage meters or indirectly using shallow piezometers tracers and or through numerical modeling lee 1977 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 nakayama and watanabe 2008 shaw et al 2013 rosenberry et al 2015 virdi et al 2013 niswonger et al 2014 numerous studies have shown that groundwater discharge rates can vary spatially and temporally depending on aquifer heterogeneity hydraulic gradients wave action generated by winds and seasonal recharge within the watershed mcbride and pfannkuch 1975 pfannkuch and winter 1984 winter 1999 kidmose et al 2013 virdi et al 2013 karan et al 2014 because groundwater discharge rates can vary by orders of magnitude combined methods are often used to characterize variability and to reduce uncertainty shaw et al 1990 shaw et al 2013 kidmose et al 2013 nutrients derived from groundwater are subject to physical and biogeochemical processes within the aquifer and at the sediment water interface of lakes schafran and driscoll 1993 stoliker et al 2016 sediment heterogeneity and near surface clogging strongly control the direction of flow and discharge of nutrients such as nitrate karan et al 2014 kidmose et al 2015 nitrate transformations mediated by microbial processes at the lake sediment water interface are controlled by physical exchange redox conditions and labile carbon stoliker et al 2016 lewandowski et al 2015 natural processes such as denitrification can reduce nitrate loads however low oxygen environments also can release sediment bound phosphorus hou et al 2013 point out that both redox conditions and solution temperature can control the release of nitrogen and phosphorus from lake bed sediments further meinikmann et al 2015 also highlighted the redox dependency of phosphorus transport in groundwater to lakes however transport of phosphorus from groundwater to nearshore lake environments can be complex and controlled by sorption onto different mineral surfaces with fe iii containing oxides or hydroxides and al sesquioxides meinikmann et al 2015

steinman 2002 nutrient controls on periphyton are important for understanding anthropogenic impacts to lake ecosystems and to understand how these systems will change in the future periphyton is influenced by physical and biological drivers over a range of temporal and spatial scales and previous work indicates that nutrients derived from groundwater discharge to lakes may have a strong influence on periphyton growth loeb 1987 reuter et al 1986 lewandowski et al 2015 périllon and hilt 2016 knights et al 2017 périllon et al 2017 it is well understood that excessive growth of periphyton in littoral zones of lakes is considered an indicator of nutrient enrichment caused by human activities loeb 1986 1987 loeb et al 1983 jacoby et al 1991 nakayama and watanabe 2008 timoshkin

fluctuations wave action sloughing seasonal changes in temperature and grazing cantonati and lowe 2014 conceptual models for periphyton growth in oligotrophic lakes indicate a positive correlation with increased nutrient supply until a threshold level is attained at which point periphyton growth is limited by light périllon and hilt 2016 lake water in littoral zones of oligotrophic lakes can be highly transparent and increased nutrients supplied by the surrounding watershed provide optimal conditions for periphyton loeb et al 1983 loeb 1987 and aquatic macrophytes loeb and hackley 1988 sebestyen and schneider 2004 there is a need to better understand the temporal and spatial relationships among climate hydrology seasonal variations in groundwater discharge and periphyton life cycles the work herein seeks to establish the role of groundwater in controlling periphyton growth in a sub alpine oligotrophic lake which could impact how these systems are studied and managed in the future here we analyze and correlate seasonal periphyton growth patterns and spatiotemporal trends in nutrients sampled in surface and shallow subsurface waters in lake tahoe located in california and nevada usa as periphyton biomass peaks during the late winter and spring in lake tahoe it is important to establish the seasonal hydrological drivers that influence periphyton growth patterns furthermore oligotrophic lakes are very susceptible to impacts of nutrient enrichment and it is important to characterize the contributions of nutrient inputs that stimulate excessive periphyton growth extending previous work on the interactions between nutrient inputs to lakes and periphyton to include linkages in seasonal growth patterns and watershed hydrologic processes will benefit conceptual models of primary production in sub alpine lakes generally the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate whether winter discharge of nutrients originating from an upland watershed are correlated to winter periphyton growth 2 characterize the seasonal variation of dissolved nutrients in the eulittoral zone where excessive growths occur and 3 identify physical hydrological drivers of nutrient delivery to the eulittoral zone 2 methods 2 1 study site lake tahoe is a large oligotrophic sub alpine lake that resides in both the state of california and nevada in the sierra nevada range fig 1 the lake has an average surface elevation of 1898 m an average lake volume of 156 km3 and has 116 km of shoreline and a mean and maximum depth of 313 m and 505 m respectively goldman 1988 known for its natural beauty spectacular transparency and cobalt blue color lake tahoe is being impacted by cultural and climatic eutrophication human activities such as logging road development and rapid increases in urbanization during the last century has led to reduced lake clarity jassby et al 1999 increased nutrient loads from streams jassby et al 1995 and increased primary productivity goldman 1988 average annual clarity measured by secchi disc has declined from 31 to 22 m since 1967 prompting a large scale restoration and monitoring program alvarez et al 2006 recently a monitoring framework has been proposed to address nearshore ecological and water quality conditions heyvaert et al 2013 the study area was located at the base of the alluvial deposits of ward creek a small 25 1 km2 watershed on the west shore of the lake the watershed elevation ranges from 1898 m to 2700 m and has a channel length of 9 5 km hatch et al 2001 the northwestern portion of lake tahoe is overlain by volcanic rock with highly permeable soils comprising of andesitic and basaltic material leonard et al 1979 basement rock in the lower portions of the valley is overlain by glacial outwash and alluvial and lacustrine deposits of generally increasing depth toward the lake outcrops of volcanic rock are common on the steeper slopes and on ridges and peaks drainage from the watersheds predominantly occurs as shallow subsurface and surface flow in the upper elevations late summer streamflow is low due to a very permeable transmissivity 306 m2 day loeb and goldman 1979 aquifer beneath the stream that drains stream water and groundwater that eventually discharge to the lake a steep hydraulic gradient 0 019 and highly permeable aquifer materials results in relatively high yearly groundwater discharge to lake tahoe 3324 acre ft yr loeb 1987 except for a steeply sloping lake bottom at the mouth of ward creek there is a shallow gently sloping shelf 5 m extending about 100 m offshore along the study area shoreline during average lake stage conditions monitoring in this study is focused within the eulittoral zone or a sub region of the littoral zone consisting of lakeshore sediments encompassed by the annual variation in lake stage with lake depths of 0 2 m the littoral zone 0 150 m lake depth of lake tahoe represents 19 of the lake surface area and it has been reported that attached periphyton in this region contributes to 60 of the primary production loeb et al 1983 in the eulittoral zone a distinct winter seasonal growth pattern exists with peak biomass typically occurring in the spring and declining in early summer fig 1c the west shore of lake tahoe has shown a persistent and increasing trend in algal biomass in the eulittoral zone over the last decade hackley et al 2016 excessive algal growth in nearshore areas typically are highly visible from land negatively impact nearshore aesthetics and more broadly indicate changes in lake water quality reuter et al 1986 hagerthey and kerfoot 1998 hagerthey and kerfoot 2005 gaiser et al 2006 before 1980 nitrogen was initially considered the primary limiting nutrient to lake tahoe s phytoplankton population however atmospheric deposition of nitrogen directly on the lake surface has led to a shift towards nitrogen phosphorus co limitation hatch et al 2001 goldman et al 1993 jassby et al 1995 previous studies of lake tahoe have focused on nutrient loads from streams and atmospheric deposition coats et al 2008 jassby et al 1994 early investigations of ward creek provided indirect evidence for nutrients associated with groundwater to stimulate periphyton growth in the nearshore according to loeb and goldman 1979 groundwater contributed significantly to the nitrate 49 and soluble phosphorus loads 44 to lake tahoe laboratory bioassay work by loeb 1987 showed the stimulatory potential of interstitial water from nearshore sediments on periphyton growth however correlations between periphyton biomass collected from nearshore rock surfaces and potential external sources of nutrients i e stream groundwater and associated drivers controlling seasonal and annual algal growth has not yet been investigated nutrients from urban runoff streams lawn fertilizers or leaking sewer lines may be a significant source of nutrients to groundwater that enters the lake especially from residential neighborhoods and recreational facilities loeb 1987 nagy 2003 reports of increased algal growth along the nearshore over the last few decades are likely due to changes in one or more of these external nutrient sources internal lake mixing or physical drivers i e streamflow timing in lake mixing recharge 2 2 nearshore piezometers twenty one piezometers were installed in october 2015 along six transect perpendicular to shore to approximately 20 m offshore and to a lake depth of 0 5 m nearshore transects ns1 ns2 and ns3 were located 30 m 120 m and 320 m north of the mouth of ward creek respectively fig 1b transects ns4 ns5 and ns6 were located 800 m 830 m and 860 m north of the mouth of ward creek respectively transect ns5 represented a profile at the pineland periphyton monitoring site ppms where periphyton has been monitored for several decades fig 1c hackley et al 2016 transect ns2 and ns3 also were collocated with additional periphyton monitoring sites collected from substrates from 0 5 m lake depth discussed in section 2 5 piezometers were installed to an approximate depth of 0 3 m below the sediment water interface three piezometers were installed along each transect close to ward creek ns1 ns3 and 4 piezometers near the ppms ns4 ns6 site the distance between each piezometer ranged between 5 and 10 m piezometers were constructed of 2 54 cm interior diameter schedule 40 pvc with a 10 cm screened interval starting at 5 cm from the bottom a post hole driver was used to drive each piezometer to the desired depth shoreline topography and piezometers were surveyed and referenced to a local control point for making calculations that require relative elevation measurements e g hydraulic gradients the surveyed slopes of the lake bottom measured over 40 m transects toward the center of the lake at ns1 ns2 ns3 ns4 ns5 and ns6 were 9 0 4 0 4 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 0 respectively pressure transducers were installed at the first and last piezometer in all transects except for ns5 where all four piezometers were equipped with transducers lake stage was monitored at the ns5 to calculate vertical and horizontal head gradients all pressure measurements were monitored at an interval of 15 min converted to total head using a local control point altitude adjusted for drift by manual tape downs and were compensated for barometric pressure variations the error in pressure transducer measurements were 0 001 m continuous stream flow was measured at ward creek usgs 10336676 ward c at hwy 89 nr tahoe pines ca 400 m inland from the lake shore lake water and groundwater temperatures were measured using vertical temperature sensors arrays naranjo and turcotte 2015 2 3 groundwater discharge lateral and vertical groundwater discharge through the lakebed was calculated using darcy s law hydraulic gradients measured in piezometers installed into lakebed sediment and hydraulic conductivity values measured using repeat slug tests analysis bouwer and rice 1976 for piezometers ns5 1 and ns5 4 the vertical discharge was calculated when lake levels reached the sediment elevation located at the base of the piezometers for horizontal groundwater discharge average gradients were calculated between the shoreline and most off shore piezometer at each transect located approximately 20 m apart daily average horizontal and vertical fluxes were made assuming homogeneous and anisotropic conditions groundwater discharge rates also were determined from 150 separate measurements of seepage made from half barrel meters at and between piezometers along each transect using methods described by rosenberry and labaugh 2008 seepage meters were deployed between piezometers and close to shore and provided synoptic evaluation of groundwater discharge rates to the lake the first set of measurements were collected may 3 4 2016 when lake conditions were calm with relatively stable lake stage conditions a second set of measurements were taken on may 5 2015 at ns5 and ns6 to evaluate changes in groundwater discharge resulting from wind generated waves 2 4 groundwater and surface water sampling from november 2015 to july 2016 a total of 237 nutrient samples were collected from the piezometer at the lake side end of each transect and from the lake just above the sediment water interface during november 2015 to june 2016 to determine the spatial and temporal patterns on a weekly and monthly basis additional samples were collected along the ppms ns5 transect ns5 1 to ns5 4 from piezometers and the lake to assess nutrient concentrations from shore all samples were collected according to usgs water quality sampling protocol wilde 2011 u s geological survey variously dated to ensure that lake samples represented conditions near the sediment water interface samples were collected using a polyethylene tube attached to a wading rod with careful placement not to disturb the periphyton mat dissolved oxygen do temperature and specific conductance sc were measured in piezometers ward creek and lake tahoe these parameters were monitored to evaluate seasonal trends at the same frequency as nutrients water from piezometers and from the lake was drawn using a peristatic pump that was connected to a multi sensor ysi 660 following stabilization of do temperature and specific conductance sc readings samples were collected in 250 ml bottles stored on ice and delivered locally for analysis high sierra water lab tahoe city ca all water quality samples were analyzed for dissolved nitrate nitrogen plus nitrite nitrogen no3 no2 using epa method 353 1

analysis results from samples collected at ward creek by the u s geological survey lake tahoe interagency monitoring program were used to supplement lake and groundwater data collected in this study water samples were collected for stable isotopic analyses to determine whether the source of water introduced to the nearshore by groundwater or by surface water stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h were analyzed from lake tahoe and groundwater at ns5 4 and ward creek samples collected on 4 21 2016 and 6 27 2016 samples were analyzed by the usgs reston stable isotope laboratory 2 5 periphyton sampling periphyton samples were collected near ns2 3 ns3 3 and ns5 4 0 4 0 5 m depth at approximately 7 to 14 day intervals from october 31 2015 to june 3 2016 fig 1 two to five randomly selected rocks of similar size 0 020 m2 were collected from each location placed in sealed plastic containers and transported to the lab for scrubbing homogenizing and subsampling for periphyton biomass chlorophyll a and algal community composition chlorophyll a chl a subsamples were vacuum filtered whatman gf f and frozen until analysis chl a concentrations were determined using methanol extractions via fluorometry welschmeyer 1994 using a turner designs model 10au fluorometer calibrated with anacystis nidulans ash free dry weight afdw were determined from replicates by calculating the difference of weight from samples dried at 60 c and then combusted at 475 c chl a and afdw are presented as mean concentration per unit area with standard deviations variation in chl a and afdw is expected given the timing of nutrients natural heterogeneity in growth and sloughing caused by wave turbulence the relations between algal biomass indicators such as chl a and afdw can provide additional information regarding nutrient sources and algal community the autotrophic index ai the ratio of afdw chl a that is indicative of the proportions of the community comprised of heterotrophic and autotrophic organisms biggs and close 1989 was computed on monthly averaged values the ai is widely used to assess organic inputs where greater values indicate greater amounts of bacteria and lower water quality ai values of 50 100 are characteristic of non polluted conditions with little organic detritus biggs and close 1989 ai near 250 are more typical for eutrophic conditions watson and gestring 1996 values greater than 400 indicate organically enriched environments collins and weber 1978 the long term data 1980 2014 collected on the periphyton community at the ppms typically comprised of stalked diatom species i e gomphoneis herculeana and filamentous green algae i e ulothrix sp zygnema sp 2 6 data analysis the relationships between nutrient concentrations in lake tahoe and concentrations in ward creek and groundwater were evaluated using multivariate linear regression analysis and hypothesis tests for assessing significance at the 95 confidence level coefficient of determination slope of the regression and p values are presented for significant models chl a concentrations were regressed against nutrients measured in ward creek groundwater and lake tahoe using log transformed data other nutrients sources to the nearshore area also were analyzed including offshore samples indicative of internal lake mixing and upwelling and runoff sources from the roadway and residential areas adjacent to the lake these analyses are not presented herein because offshore nutrient data were not correlated to indicators of periphyton biomass and direct runoff sources were insignificant 3 results 3 1 physical measurements lake levels were in steady decline due to lake evaporation and releases during the summer and reached a seasonal minimum stage of 1896 m on december 3 2015 fig 2 a the steady decline in lake levels had been occurring since 2011 due to a prolonged drought precipitation during the study period was close to the annual average for the basin and higher than previous years and consequently lake levels rose steadily during winter the maximum lake elevation of 1897 m was reached on june 12 2016 from october 1 2015 to july 31 2016 the range in lake elevation was 0 81 m ward creek receives its flow from snowmelt and to a lesser extent from periodic rain events during winter ward creek often becomes dry lower in the watershed during the summer and fall there was no flow in ward creek at the mouth for 90 days in 2015 and ward creek flowed intermittently at the mouth associated with precipitation events during october through january fig 2b flows remained continuous average 1 1 m3 s maximum 9 1 m3 s from january 19 2015 to end of our field investigation period in june 27 2016 precipitation measured within ward creek at an elevation of 2055 m national resource conservation service snotel 848 ward 3 was 180 cm between october 2015 and june 2016 saturated hydraulic conductivity estimated by repeat slug tests ranged from 0 1 to 27 4 m d table st1 horizontal fluxes ranged from 0 02 to 0 79 m d with positive off shore groundwater flow for much of the monitoring period fig 2c horizontal groundwater flow estimated at ns1 and ns2 was most influenced by the early episodic rain storms and subsequent diffusive recharge in the watershed and from channel seepage losses from ward creek at ns3 horizontal flow rates were lowest of all transects with a range of 1 0 10 3 to 3 10 3 m d and an average of 4 10 4 m d at the ppms transect horizontal flow at transect ns5 ranged from 4 0 10 3 to 0 15 m d with an average of 0 03 m d vertical groundwater flow at the ppms transect ns5 1 to ns5 4 ranged from 0 03 to 0 13 m d fig 2d pressure data collected from ns5 3 piezometer was not used in the discharge calculation due to inadvertent vertical and abrupt shift in the piezometer by a recreationalist as such data collected from this piezometer were removed during the period from 3 25 2016 to 6 27 2016 when lake levels reached the base of the ns5 1 and ns5 2 piezometers maximum vertical groundwater flux rates were estimated as 0 04 and 0 05 m d respectively seepage meter measurements along each transect show an exponential decline in groundwater discharge rate as a function of distance from shore fig sf1 the average flux rate measured along each transect during relatively calm conditions ranged from 0 04 to 0 26 m d the range in seepage rates measured were highest near the shoreline 5 m from shore with range of 0 2 0 5 m d and average of 1 3 m d highest rates were observed at ns2 with a maximum flux rate of 2 9 m d measured 0 5 m from shore during a wind event on may 5 2016 0 5 meter high waves were generated and groundwater discharge increased further offshore fig sf3b overall the average rate increased 18 0 38 0 45 m d excluding the flow reversals caused by dynamic mixing along the shoreline caused by waves at ns5 0 2 m from shore the influence of wave action reduced the seepage by an order of magnitude 1 6 0 25 m hr fig sf3b along the same transect seepage increased by an order of magnitude 0 15 1 0 m d at 10 m offshore at ns6 1 m from shore the flux rate was locally influenced by negative gradients causing flow reversal towards the foreshore direction seepage at ns6 also decreased 33 0 9 to 0 6 m d from waves fig sf3c further from shore the influence of waves was more variable with an average rate increase of 400 0 06 0 3 m d 3 2 spatial and seasonal trends in nutrients the samples collected from lake tahoe ward creek and groundwater reflect distinctly different nutrient and physiochemical characteristics table st2 no3 measured in lake tahoe range from 1 0 to 47 μg l with an average value of 3 μg l in ward creek the no3 ranged from 1 0 to 243 μg l with an average of 48 μg l in piezometers no3 ranged from 1 0 to 117 μg l with an average of 64 μg l srp concentrations were greater in groundwater than what was observed in lake tahoe or ward creek samples table st2 in groundwater srp ranged from 10 to 80 μg l with an average of 51 μg l srp values in lake tahoe ranged from 1 0 to 56 μg l with an average of 3 μg l in ward creek srp ranged from 3 to 14 μg l with an average of 6 μg l sc data indicate distinct differences between lake tahoe ward creek and groundwater in groundwater the sc ranged between 48 and 161 μs cm with an average of 125 μs cm flow in ward creek is generated primarily as snow melt runoff and from periodic flow events generated by precipitation in ward creek the sc ranged from 40 to 67 μs cm with an average of 52 μs cm the range of sc in lake tahoe was 71 to 139 μs cm with an average of 93 μs cm seasonal sc and do measurements for ward creek lake tahoe and groundwater were compared to evaluate relative contributions to the nearshore fig 3 groundwater sampled near ward creek ns1 ns2 and surface water samples taken from ward creek show very similar patterns for do and sc from 11 10 2015 to 1 8 2016 the do in piezometers ns1 3 and ns2 3 increased from 4 7 to 10 8 mg l and 1 1 to 8 3 mg l respectively indicating significant influence from recharge by ward creek fig 3b however piezometers transect ns5 and ns6 have distinctly different do and sc concentrations relative to ward creek indicating that unlike ns1 and ns2 groundwater originates as diffuse recharge higher in the watershed and not recharge from ward creek transect ns3 appears to be a mixture of groundwater originating from ward creek seepage and regional groundwater sampled at ns4 and ns6 time series of no3 srp and dp concentrations measured from ward creek and groundwater are shown in fig 4 during the early period of episodic flow november 2015 to january 2016 no3 concentrations in ward creek were at their greatest concentrations likely due to the initial flushing of salts accumulated in soils and sediment during the previous years of drought coats and goldman 2001 during continuous flow in ward creek 1 19 2016 to 6 28 2016 concentrations decreased to an average no3 concentration of 9 0 μg l as shown with do and sc seasonal patterns in no3 corresponds to changes in ward creek at ns1 and ns2 at ns5 4 and ns6 4 the concentrations of no3 were not directly influenced by changes in ward creek srp and dp concentrations were generally greater in samples taken from the piezometers located further away from ward creek fig 4b c comparison of groundwater stable isotopic composition to that of surface water collected from ward creek and lake tahoe were used to determine if the groundwater originated as creek or lake water the data were compared to isotopic compositions of lake tahoe and groundwater collected from a network of monitoring wells located throughout the basin thodal 1997 the average δ18o and δ2h composition of water sampled in the piezometer at ns5 4 was 13 6 and 98 3 table st3 and were consistent with groundwater collected from wells with a depth to water range of 7 140 m thodal 1997 the isotopic composition of lake tahoe and ward creek collected from this study also were consistent with previous reports on surface water entering lake tahoe nehring 1980 welch et al 1997 these results indicate that water stored within the shallow lakebed sediment in the nearshore area is characteristic of groundwater within the basin and supports the conclusion that nutrients entering the lake from the lakebed in the nearshore area comes from aquifer storage in the watershed these results also rule out the possibility that water stored in the lakebed originates from the lake because lake water isotopic signature is much more evaporated than the groundwater isotopic signature there were modest positive correlations between no3 concentrations observed in ward creek and concentrations in groundwater for shoreline piezometers ns1 3 r2 0 26 p 0 2 ns2 3 r2 0 5 p 0 05 and ns3 3 r2 0 78 p 0 01 located near the stream mouth fig 5 a concentrations remained elevated in groundwater following decreases in surface water concentrations to levels near the detection limits 1 μg l the regression analysis did not identify any relationship between groundwater and ward creek at transects ns5 and ns6 for no3 or dp however modest positive correlations were identified between groundwater and lake tahoe observations for dp at ns3 3 r2 0 35 p 0 1 ns5 4 r2 0 56 p 0 01 and ns6 4 r2 0 3 p 0 2 monitoring locations fig 5b 3 3 trends in seasonal periphyton biomass unlike historical patterns and patterns during the monitoring period for this study observed at pineland ns5 see fig 1c the seasonal peak in periphyton biomass occurs earlier at sites ns2 and ns3 closer to ward creek fig 6 chl a peaked during december to january at ns2 and ns3 and peaked in april at ns5 conversely afdw at transect site ns2 and ns3 steadily increased during the monitoring period fig 6b despite decreases in chl a during the april to june period afdw at ns5 remained steady until the end of the monitoring period in early june greater values of afdw later in the season relative to the earlier peak in chl a could be related to a decrease in the amount of living algae and an increase in the amount of cyanobacteria heterotrophic microbes and detritus the ai ranged between 400 and 800 at ns5 whereas values were much lower during the early season and increased above 1000 during late season at ns2 and ns3 fig 6c 3

7 multivariate regression models of nutrient contributions from ward creek were significantly correlated r2 0 76 p 0 001 to chl a with contributions of srp and no3 to the correlation of 80 and 20 respectively table 1 at ns3 nutrient concentrations in ward creek also were correlated to chl a r2 0 40 p 0 03 with contributions of srp and no3 to the correlation of 46 and 54 respectively regression models improved when nutrients from groundwater were included as additional independent variables at ns2 groundwater contributed 9 of the no3 to the correlation r2 0 77 p 0 001 dp from groundwater did not improve the regression model at ns3 groundwater contributed 11 dp and ward creek contributed 45 no3 and 44 srp to the correlation r2 0 49 p 0 01 recharge from ward creek during a period of seasonally low lake levels may have resulted in rapid transfer of nutrients from groundwater to the nearshore concentrations of srp were below detection in lake tahoe samples at ns2 or ns3 likely due to algal uptake or sorption onto sediments results of the nutrient sampling and biomass monitoring at ns2 and ns3 demonstrate that algal biomass was stimulated by the combination with no3 and srp from ward creek and groundwater however decreases in groundwater nutrient flux increases in solar radiation or other factors could have contributed to the cessation of periphyton growth nutrients associated with groundwater also contribute to observable changes in lake concentrations and correspond to variations in algal biomass at ns5 fig 8 at ns5 the regression results indicate that ward creek did not influence nutrient concentrations in groundwater or periphyton biomass variations no3 concentrations in lake water rapidly increased from less than the detection limit 1 μg l to 8 μg l between january and april fig 8a no3 concentrations in groundwater discharging to the lake are correlated to variations in algal biomass fig 8b for dp the contributions of groundwater to lake concentrations fig 8c and to algal biomass were more pronounced fig 8d given the correlation between groundwater and lake nutrient concentrations the regression analysis identified dp from lake and no3 from groundwater contributed 42 and 42 to the correlation r2 0 39 p 0 007 respectively table 1 at ns5 regression analysis indicates a significant correlation between nutrients in groundwater and chl a qualitative trends in periphyton biomass growing at ns5 also were assessed with time lapse photography and shows increased periphyton through february followed by bleaching and sloughing during spring fig sf2 underwater photographs during the period of monitoring were helpful in identifying seasonal growth patterns and disturbance to algal mats caused by turbulent wave action during the april to june period the color of the algal mat changed to a translucent white color that was thick and loosely attached to surface of rocks disturbance to algal mats by loose adjacent rocks occurred frequently caused by turbulence induced by wave action 4 discussion 4 1 groundwater lake interactions measured and estimated groundwater seepage rates measured for this study are high relative to global estimates of groundwater discharge in lakes rosenberry et al 2015 compiled seepage estimates from a variety of methods from 108 lakes world wide and summarized average and maximum values ranging of 5 10 5 to 1 2 m d and 2 10 4 to 7 4 m d respectively the reported median for the average and maximum discharge rates was 0 07 and 0 05 m d respectively groundwater discharge rates for all transects in lake tahoe ranged from 1 0 10 2 to 0 8 m d with an average of 0 08 m d the rates measured with seepage meters ranged from 1 4 10 2 to 2 9 m d with an average of 0 4 m d these values 2 5 10 3 m d to 0 6 m d have similar values as seepage measurements made by previous studies along the shore of lake tahoe loeb and goldman 1979 loeb 1987 constantz et al 2016 notwithstanding the differences in seepage rates using darcy s equation and seepage meters kennedy et al 2010 the rates of groundwater discharge estimated herein are significant with respect to water budgets nutrient fluxes and littoral algal dynamics for lake tahoe as demonstrated by nutrient concentrations and most profoundly by the sc data groundwater discharge to lake tahoe is seasonally variable and driven by recharge from ward creek in proximity to the stream mouth i e transects ns1 and ns2 and by rain and snowmelt recharge on the hillslopes north of ward creek i e transect sites ns3 ns5 and ns6 at low lake stage recharge events in the watershed mobilize groundwater beneath the lake shore causing greater amounts of nutrients to discharge into the lake this is illustrated by abrupt changes in water quality in piezometers beneath the lakebed recharge on hillslopes causing rapid pre event groundwater discharge to distal locations as noted here for the ward creek watershed has been reported extensively in other watersheds e g ward 1984 buttle 1994 variations in lake stage also are important for controlling groundwater discharge including reversals in the direction of seepage storage is regulated in lake tahoe and the average annual variation in lake stage is 0 72 m usgs 10337000 lake tahoe at tahoe city ca variations in lake stage strongly influence rates and locations of groundwater discharge to illustrate this point we present a conceptual model to highlight the dynamic interaction between recharge in the basin and groundwater discharge along the shore of lake tahoe for the ppms transect fig 9 in general nutrients discharging to the nearshore by groundwater are controlled by the hydraulic gradient aquifer hydraulic properties and clogging armoring processes at the sediment water interface as runoff is generated in streams the permeable stream sediments allow transport of well oxygenated surface water to maintain aerobic conditions in groundwater near streams fig 9a physical and biogeochemical processes in groundwater near the streams are highly influenced by the timing and duration of surface runoff groundwater discharge rates and nutrient concentrations located further away from the influence of stream recharge is more diffuse contains lower do higher sc and is driven by recharge from precipitation and snow melt during the winter period lake levels are at the seasonal low due minimal surface water inputs and lake evaporation the nutrients delivered to the eulittoral zone sediments by groundwater stimulate algal growth as lake concentrations are low nutrients cycling at the benthic zone contribute to additional sources of nutrients for algal assimilation and uptake mixing of lake and groundwater at shoreline locally elevates discharge rates and nutrient fluxes fig 9b increases in lake stage reduces the gradient and groundwater discharge rates and temporarily reverses the groundwater flow direction at the highest lake stage the area of greatest rates of groundwater discharge shifts towards the maximum elevation of the eulittoral zone fig 9c periphyton in the eulittoral zone must adapt to the changes in lake stage and nutrients flux as well as other controlling variables such as solar radiation temperature and wave action morphology of the backshore and foreshore areas control the seasonal variation in seepage at the shoreline as the lake stage changes seasonally from the minimum to maximum elevations within the eulittorial zone for relatively flat shorelines changes in lake stage will strongly influence the rate and location of groundwater and nutrient discharge for example along the ppms a lake stage increase of 1 m above the minimum lake level shifts the shoreline 30 m onto the foreshore the seasonal variation in the shoreline driven by lake stage has ecological implications for eulittorial periphyton as they are stimulated or controlled by lakebed substrate temperature nutrients solar radiation groundwater discharge and waves all of which are influenced by lake depth in the nearshore area hofmann et al 2008 lake tahoe stage rose following the spring snowmelt runoff period in january and peaked in late may 2016 and the upward hydraulic gradient beneath the lake decreased in response groundwater discharge was focused closer to the shoreline and discharge rates decreased from shore as shown by results from the seepage meter measurements made may 3 4 2016 fig sf1 4 2 spatial and temporal variability of nutrients recharge from ward creek is an important driver for delivering oxygen and nutrients to groundwater discharging to the lakeshore however this influence becomes minimal between 120 m and 320 m laterally away from where ward creek enters the lake the lakeshore further from ward creek including the ppms is influenced by recharge from diffuse sources such as precipitation and snow melt runoff that infiltrates and recharges the shallow hillslope aquifer concentrations of no3 in ward creek during the monitoring period were greater during early episodic rain events and decreased during the average flow conditions fed by snowmelt these results are consistent with previous work describing the fate and transport of nutrients in the tahoe basin pearson et al 2015 ohara et al 2011 miller et al 2005 coats et al 1976 our results suggest that intense precipitation released more particulate nitrogen and phosphorus due to the erosion and transport of organic rich material from the forest floor and channel sediments this is illustrated by the greatest increases in nutrient concentrations in ward creek following large rain events that occurred during december and january however the seasonal groundwater samples characterized into pre event and event water indicate that recharge events in the watershed cause increases in nutrient rich pre event groundwater discharge to the lake this process is consistent with previous findings in steep watersheds vidon 2012 torres et al 1998 and our results indicate this process is important for stimulating periphyton growth nutrients concentrations associated with pre event groundwater are nearly three times greater for no3 pre event 80 μg l event 30 μg l and 2 times greater for srp pre event 70 μg l event 40 μg l thus two thirds of no3 and srp in groundwater discharging to the lake comes from nutrient enrichment in the subsurface and the other one third is the result of atmospheric deposition contained in the precipitation reduction of concentrations in subsequent storms and runoff may be related to less available particulate nitrogen and phosphorus inamdar et al 2015 or dilution during peak recharge concentrations of no3 in groundwater near ward creek at transect ns1 is lower than more distal observations suggesting dilution of groundwater by stream infiltration recharge alluvial deposits containing andesite may contain naturally elevated phosphorus concentrations compared to granite soils which also could explain greater concentrations in groundwater in the ward creek watershed porder and ramachandran 2012 rapid decreases in sc and increases in do in groundwater to levels more consistent with ward creek at both ns1 3 and ns2 3 during november to december further demonstrates the influence of mixing of recharge from ward creek with older groundwater groundwater beneath the confluence of ward creek and lake tahoe do concentrations at ns1 3 were 4 mg l for the entire period of monitoring thus suggesting that denitrification is minimal in the hyporheic zone of ward creek the aerobic conditions within the sediments of ward creek watershed likely enhance mineralization of organic deposits and contribute to no3 in groundwater through nitrification leonard et al 1979 jones et al 1995 niswonger et al 2017 at ns2 3 the ambient do concentration at the initial period of monitoring were among the lowest levels 1 0 mg l measured at any of the piezometers when ward creek was not flowing following the episodic flow events do increased to 8 mg l and remained at or above levels measured at other piezometers until march 2016 when the do concentrations dropped below 4 0 mg l and trended to a seasonal minimum of 1 mg l fig 3b the timing of the do response closely matches the seasonal change in do from ward creek however the decrease to anaerobic conditions in groundwater is likely a consequence of biogeochemical processes the decrease in do towards anaerobic conditions also coincides with decreases in no3 concentrations during this period march 2016 to june 2016 the average no3 concentration in ward creek was 7 7 μg l fig 4a at the same time the average groundwater concentration at ns2 3 was 25 μg l the reduction in no3 in groundwater from 117 to 5 μg l at ns2 3 was likely a result of changes in subsurface flow paths and residence times associated with rising lake levels and greater proportions of more dilute event water kendall et al 1995 schafran and driscoll 1993 the notable changes in concentrations in piezometers while lake levels increased likely were a result of a shift in the area where maximum groundwater discharge to the lake occurs karan et al 2014 schafran and driscoll 1993 of the two transects closest to ward creek we observed a relatively dense benthic algal cover on the cobble substrates at ns2 and ns3 with peak growth occurring earlier than at the ppms consistent with the earlier breakthrough of nutrients closer to ward creek no3 concentrations in ward creek during october to january period widely varied from 1 to 243 μg l during early winter period runoff benthic surveys by hackley et al 2014 2016 also have shown the area around the mouth of ward creek to contain moderate to high winter and spring algal growth the influence of waves on the swash zone may also be a factor in delivering nutrients to the nearshore and increasing the nutrient gradient at the cell boundary of periphyton communities reuter et al 1986 as observed with the seepage meters the influence of waves can dramatically affect the rate and direction of groundwater discharge to the lake the influence of waves precipitation and evapotranspiration was also found to be important influences on nearshore seepage rates rosenberry et al 2013 waves that move up on to land may temporarily decouple the groundwater from the lake elevation horn 2002 the change in the hydraulic gradient beneath the foreshore may be responsible for increases in groundwater discharge further from shore as measured with the seepage meters during wind generated waves wave induced changes in groundwater flow can cause localized circulation patterns that promote offshore discharge of groundwater li and barry 2000 and biogeochemical reactive zones robinson 2015 other driving influences affect nutrient concentrations in lake water are precipitation and recharge into the foreshore area or sloughing of algal mats that temporarily reduce biomass that controls uptake rates reuter et al 1986 and areas of the nearshore near streams 4 3 nutrient fluxes to nearshore environment increases in no3 from 6 to 47 μg l in lake water at the sediment water interface indicate that the nutrient flux rates from groundwater discharge to the lake periodically exceeds the algal uptake periphyton uptake experiments from algal communities of lake tahoe were shown to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorus reuter et al 1986 loeb 1987 thus increases in nutrient concentrations in lake water as observed during our sampling period are significant a strong correlation between the timing of increases in nutrient concentrations and the onset of the winter periphyton growth indicate the important role that streamflow and groundwater discharge has on biomass in the nearshore zone phosphorus concentrations in streams in the tahoe basin occur in the soluble and particulate form and particulate forms are typically associated with suspended sediments hatch et al 1999 coats et al 2016 sorption and assimilative processes may partly explain why srp concentration were 1 μg l in lake samples while relatively high concentrations were measured in the groundwater 75 μg l furthermore the total dp consisted of a greater proportion of srp within the piezometers 75 of dp was srp whereas dp in lake water only consisted of dissolved organic phosphorus nutrient concentrations measured in groundwater beneath the lake are slightly higher than concentrations measured in groundwater in the watershed nearly 40 years ago the average no3 concentrations in groundwater collected from piezometers within lake tahoe were greater by 20 50 60 μg l for no3 and by 155 20 51 μg l for srp since the previous work by loeb 1987 these increases may reflect changes in natural processes or anthropogenic activity within the watershed that directly influence the nutrient loads delivered to streams groundwater and nearshore areas for example coats et al 1976 reported the release of nitrates by alder stands during the fall and winter periods and potential for disturbance to soils to increase loads periphyton growth along nearshore areas of ward creek have been monitored for several decades and accumulation of organic matter and nutrient cycling may be responsible for local sources of nutrients at the sediment water interface in the ward creek watershed alluvial deposits containing andesite may comprise of naturally elevated phosphorus compared to sediment derived from granite other sources of phosphorus may include desorption from soils beneath organic rich o horizons miller et al 2005 urban runoff coats et al 2008 fertilizer use loeb 1986 and from leaking sewer lines nagy 2003 variability in phosphorus measured in groundwater may be partly related to the redox conditions that impact dissolution and mobilization hou et al 2013 phosphorus concentrations collected from piezometers furthest from ward creek were generally higher than observed from piezometers nearby ward creek i e fig 4 srp the most biologically reactive form of phosphorus was not detected in most lake water samples however the regression analysis indicates that even low srp concentrations from ward creek significantly contribute changes periphyton biomass given that concentrations of srp in groundwater exceeded other sources but remained low within lake samples suggest that srp concentrations in the lake are controlled by periphyton uptake and or sorption processes in the upper 20 cm of the lakebed 4 4 periphyton growth 4 4 1 onset of the periphyton bloom periphyton growing in the eulittoral zone at lake tahoe has a pronounced seasonal growth pattern that peaks in winter and early spring this unusual seasonal growth pattern is likely caused by the hydrologic cycle and nutrient availability as supported by correlations between precipitation increases in nutrient discharge to the lake and increases in chl a sources of nutrients to the eulittoral zone were provided by groundwater discharge originating as stream infiltration near the creek mouth and as diffuse recharge in the watershed at locations distal to the stream mouth seasonal timing of the highest nutrient concentrations in groundwater discharging to the lake correlate to the onset of the winter periphyton bloom these results compliment the study by périllon et al 2017 and support their findings that periphyton preferentially grows where groundwater discharge of nutrients is greatest roy et al 2009 found strong correlations between increased periphyton growth and nutrients in groundwater derived by wastewater our work on the nearshore of clarifies linkages among seasonal periphyton growth and the seasonal hydrologic cycle within the lake tahoe basin these linkages are likely prevalent in many lake systems with strong seasonal climate variability another example of the influence of the hydrologic cycle was the earlier periphyton bloom that occurred near the creek mouth verses distal to the creek mouth which corresponded to earlier increases in nutrient concentrations in groundwater near the creek mouth 4 4 2 cessation of the periphyton bloom cessation of the winter spring periphyton bloom at lake tahoe appears to be caused by 1 reductions in nutrient discharge caused by rising lake levels during spring and 2 increases in solar radiation due to longer photoperiods as the sun rises above the steep mountainous horizon in spring over exposure of uv radiation can cause photo bleaching of diatoms and a loss of chl a in highly transparent alpine lakes vinebrooke and leavitt 1996 higley et al 2001 given the shallow lake depth and clear transparency of the nearshore environment changes in pigment of the stock diatom were also observed with the underwater camera deployed at the ppms fig sf1 declines in chl a while there are steady concentrations of afdw also suggests that cyanobacteria heterotrophic microbes and detritus remain present on sediments long after chl a declines monitoring of nutrient concentrations in groundwater in upland areas as well as areas of development would be valuable in evaluating the anthropogenic impacts to groundwater and seasonal variations 4 4 3 management implications some important management considerations include contributions of nutrients from developed areas and the changes in nutrient transformations in groundwater further there is a need to collect data to determine the source of nutrients in groundwater to determine what management activities to prioritize inputs of nutrients from lawn fertilizer applications or leaking sewer lines may be a significant source of nutrients to groundwater that enters the lake especially from residential neighborhoods and recreational facilities nagy 2003 the use of infiltration basins and constructed wetlands to reduce surface runoff may also contribute to the timing and magnitude of subsurface nutrient fluxes as well as stimulate biogeochemical transformations prudic et al 2005 assessments of the effectiveness of engineered basins and wetlands for reducing nutrient loads primarily has focused on reductions in streamflow runoff and sediment loads to the lake schuster and grismer 2004 however transformations of nutrients in groundwater induced by infiltration may contribute to additional sources of nutrients to the nearshore 5 conclusions the goal of this work was to better understand linkages among climate hydrology groundwater and seasonal variations in periphyton biomass in a subalpine oligotrophic lake our work shows that for areas near the mouth of streams nutrient inputs to the nearshore are temporally and spatially variable and consist of both streamflow and groundwater sources in nearshore areas distal to the influence of streamflow groundwater is the major source of nutrients for periphyton our work demonstrates that seasonal climatic and hydrologic cycles affect groundwater discharge to the lake and are correlated to seasonal periphyton biomass growing in the eulittorial zone furthermore atypical winter periphyton blooms in lake tahoe are likely a result of the seasonal variations in nutrient rich groundwater discharge to the lake and are therefore a result of hydrologic conditions in the basin water resource managers that are working to reduce external nutrient sources to lake tahoe are challenged by non point sources of nutrients such as groundwater that appears to contribute significant amounts of nutrients to the lake furthermore as previous periphyton studies in lakes have mostly neglected groundwater as a source of nutrients results presented herein should help guide future investigations changes in recharge processes caused by climate change will likely result in greater variability in nutrient concentrations delivered by surface and groundwater to lake tahoe and to snow fed lakes in general groundwater monitoring along littoral areas could improve our understanding of changing hydrological conditions and projected future trends in periphyton growth in lakes under the influence of a changing climate 6 declaration we have no financial personal

quality shifts in ecosystem structure and increases in nutrient fluxes in oligotrophic lakes conservationists are interested in characterizing the influence of hydrological drivers on excessive periphyton growth along nearshore areas we collected nutrient samples bi weekly from groundwater and surface water during a 9 month monitoring period to evaluate the timing and availability of nutrients to eulittoral periphyton in lake tahoe groundwater discharge rates were measured synoptically using seepage meters and estimated indirectly using continuous head gradient measurements and aquifer properties estimated by slug tests the discharge measurements made from the seepage meter measurements provide information about the spatial variability perpendicular from shore along and the change in groundwater discharge due to wave action algal biomass sampled from substrates and observed using underwater photographs were used to correlate seasonal growth and nutrient concentrations in groundwater and lake water results indicate that groundwater and nutrient discharge are temporally variable due to seasonal changes in recharge within the watershed wave action and lake stage groundwater discharge was enhanced by the seasonally low lake stage and episodic recharge caused by precipitation falling as rain in the watershed increases in dissolved phosphorus and nitrate in the lake during winter are attributed to groundwater discharge and correlates to increases in algal biomass in the nearshore area results indicate that nutrient rich groundwater discharge appears to stimulate seasonal periphyton blooms along the eulittoral zone of lake tahoe keywords oligotrophic lake periphyton growth nutrients groundwater hydrology littoral zone 1 introduction cultural

are considered extremely important resources and significant investments are put toward conservation efforts however these efforts mostly have neglected the influence of groundwater on eutrophication as few studies have focused on the influence of groundwater discharge on lake water quality more research is needed to develop a process understanding of the contribution of groundwater to benthic biomass research on primary production has focused more on free floating phytoplankton and periphyton responses to nutrient enrichment has mostly been done on stream systems cantonati and lowe 2014

hydrological drivers loeb 1986 périllon et al 2017 and important contributions to whole lake primary production vadeboncoeur et al 2008 nutrients can limit primary production in lakes and depending on nutrient sources lakes can be limited by nitrogen and or phosphorus nutrient limitation studies can be used to evaluate the impacts of various sources of nutrients on periphyton in lakes and this information can inform best management practices and reduce economic impacts dodds et al 2008 groundwater discharge to lakes depends on the surrounding climate geology topography and lake stage

orders of magnitude combined methods are often used to characterize variability and to reduce uncertainty shaw et al 1990 shaw et al 2013 kidmose et al 2013 nutrients derived from groundwater are subject to physical and biogeochemical processes within the aquifer and at the sediment water interface of lakes schafran and driscoll 1993 stoliker et al 2016 sediment heterogeneity and near surface clogging strongly control the direction of flow and discharge of nutrients such as nitrate karan et al 2014 kidmose et al 2015 nitrate transformations mediated by microbial processes at the lake sediment water interface are controlled by physical exchange redox conditions and labile carbon stoliker et al 2016 lewandowski et al 2015 natural processes such as denitrification can reduce nitrate loads however low oxygen environments also can release sediment bound phosphorus hou et al 2013 point out that both redox conditions and solution temperature can control the release of nitrogen and phosphorus from lake bed sediments further meinikmann et al 2015 also highlighted the redox dependency of phosphorus transport in groundwater to lakes however transport of phosphorus from groundwater to nearshore lake environments can be complex and controlled by sorption onto different mineral surfaces with fe iii containing oxides or hydroxides and al sesquioxides meinikmann et al 2015 sondergaard et al 2003 correll 1998 jensen et al 1992 periphyton is often dominant in the littoral zone loeb 1987 reuter et al 1986 and corresponds to where groundwater discharge to lakes typically is

steinman 2002 nutrient controls on periphyton are important for understanding anthropogenic impacts to lake ecosystems and to understand how these systems will change in the future periphyton is influenced by physical and biological drivers over a range of temporal and spatial scales and previous work indicates that nutrients derived from groundwater discharge to lakes may have a strong influence on periphyton growth loeb 1987 reuter et al 1986 lewandowski et al 2015 périllon and hilt 2016 knights et al 2017 périllon et al 2017 it is well understood that excessive growth of

with increased nutrient supply until a threshold level is attained at which point periphyton growth is limited by light périllon and hilt 2016 lake water in littoral zones of oligotrophic lakes can be highly transparent and increased nutrients supplied by the surrounding watershed provide optimal conditions for periphyton loeb et al 1983 loeb 1987 and aquatic macrophytes loeb and hackley 1988 sebestyen and schneider 2004 there is a need to better understand the temporal and spatial relationships among climate hydrology seasonal variations in groundwater discharge and periphyton life cycles the work herein seeks to establish the role of groundwater in controlling periphyton growth in a sub alpine oligotrophic lake which could impact how these systems are studied and managed in the future here we analyze and correlate seasonal periphyton growth patterns and spatiotemporal trends in nutrients sampled in surface and shallow subsurface waters in lake tahoe located in california and nevada usa as periphyton biomass peaks during the late winter and spring in lake tahoe it is important to establish the seasonal hydrological drivers that influence periphyton growth patterns furthermore oligotrophic lakes are very susceptible to impacts of nutrient enrichment and it is important to characterize the contributions of nutrient inputs that stimulate excessive periphyton growth extending previous work on the interactions between nutrient inputs to lakes and periphyton to include linkages in seasonal growth patterns and watershed hydrologic processes will benefit conceptual models of primary production in sub alpine lakes generally the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate whether winter discharge of nutrients originating from an upland watershed are correlated to winter periphyton growth 2 characterize the seasonal variation of dissolved nutrients in the eulittoral zone where excessive growths occur and 3 identify physical hydrological drivers of nutrient delivery to the eulittoral zone 2 methods 2 1 study site lake tahoe is a large oligotrophic sub alpine lake that resides in both the state of california and nevada in the sierra nevada range fig 1 the lake has an average surface elevation of 1898 m an average lake volume of 156 km3 and has 116 km of shoreline and a mean and maximum depth of 313 m and 505 m respectively goldman 1988 known for its natural beauty spectacular transparency and cobalt blue color lake tahoe is being impacted by cultural and climatic eutrophication human activities such as logging road development and rapid increases in urbanization during the last century has led to reduced lake clarity jassby et al 1999 increased nutrient loads from streams jassby et al 1995 and increased primary productivity goldman 1988 average annual clarity measured by secchi disc has declined from 31 to 22 m since 1967 prompting a large scale restoration and monitoring program alvarez et al 2006 recently a monitoring framework has been proposed to address nearshore ecological and water quality conditions heyvaert et al 2013 the study area was located at the base of the alluvial deposits of ward creek a small 25 1 km2 watershed on the west shore of the lake the watershed elevation ranges from 1898 m to 2700 m and has a channel length of 9 5 km hatch et al 2001 the northwestern portion of lake tahoe is overlain by volcanic rock with highly permeable soils comprising of andesitic and basaltic material leonard et al 1979 basement rock in the lower portions of the valley is overlain by glacial outwash and alluvial and lacustrine deposits of generally increasing depth toward the lake outcrops of volcanic rock are common on the steeper slopes and on ridges and peaks drainage from the watersheds predominantly occurs as shallow subsurface and surface flow in the upper elevations late summer streamflow is low due to a very permeable transmissivity 306 m2 day loeb and goldman 1979 aquifer beneath the stream that drains stream water and groundwater that eventually discharge to the lake a steep hydraulic gradient 0 019 and highly permeable aquifer materials results in relatively high yearly groundwater discharge to lake tahoe 3324 acre ft yr loeb 1987 except for a steeply sloping lake bottom at the mouth of ward creek there is a shallow gently sloping shelf 5 m extending about 100 m offshore along the study area shoreline during average lake stage conditions monitoring in this study is focused within the eulittoral zone or a sub region of the littoral zone consisting of lakeshore sediments encompassed by the annual variation in lake stage with lake depths of 0 2 m the littoral zone 0 150 m lake depth of lake tahoe represents 19 of the lake surface area and it has been reported that attached periphyton in this region contributes to 60 of the primary production loeb et al 1983 in the eulittoral zone a distinct winter seasonal growth pattern exists with peak biomass typically occurring in the spring and declining in early summer fig 1c the west shore of lake tahoe has shown a persistent and increasing trend in algal biomass in the eulittoral zone over the last decade hackley et al 2016 excessive algal growth in nearshore areas typically are highly visible from land negatively impact nearshore aesthetics and more broadly indicate changes in lake water quality reuter et al 1986 hagerthey and kerfoot 1998 hagerthey and kerfoot 2005 gaiser et al 2006 before 1980 nitrogen was initially considered the primary limiting nutrient to lake tahoe s phytoplankton population however atmospheric deposition of nitrogen directly on the lake surface has led to a shift towards nitrogen phosphorus co limitation hatch et al 2001 goldman et al 1993 jassby et al 1995 previous studies of lake tahoe have focused on nutrient loads from streams and atmospheric deposition coats et al 2008 jassby et al 1994 early investigations of ward creek provided indirect evidence for nutrients associated with groundwater to stimulate periphyton growth in the nearshore according to loeb and goldman 1979 groundwater contributed significantly to the nitrate 49 and soluble phosphorus loads 44 to lake tahoe laboratory bioassay work by loeb 1987 showed the stimulatory potential of interstitial water from nearshore sediments on periphyton growth however correlations between periphyton biomass collected from nearshore rock surfaces and potential external sources of nutrients i e stream groundwater and associated drivers controlling seasonal and annual algal growth has not yet been investigated nutrients from urban runoff streams lawn fertilizers or leaking sewer lines may be a significant source of nutrients to groundwater that enters the lake especially from residential neighborhoods and recreational facilities loeb 1987 nagy 2003 reports of increased algal growth along the nearshore over the last few decades are likely due to changes in one or more of these external nutrient sources internal lake mixing or physical drivers i e streamflow timing in lake mixing recharge 2 2 nearshore piezometers twenty one piezometers were installed in october 2015 along six transect perpendicular to shore to approximately 20 m offshore and to a lake depth of 0 5 m nearshore transects ns1 ns2 and ns3 were located 30 m 120 m and 320 m north of the mouth of ward creek respectively fig 1b transects ns4 ns5 and ns6 were located 800 m 830 m and 860 m north of the mouth of ward creek respectively transect ns5 represented a profile at the pineland periphyton monitoring site ppms where periphyton has been monitored for several decades fig 1c hackley et al 2016 transect ns2 and ns3 also were collocated with additional periphyton monitoring sites collected from substrates from 0 5 m lake depth discussed in section 2 5 piezometers were installed to an approximate depth of 0 3 m below the sediment water interface three piezometers were installed along each transect close to ward creek ns1 ns3 and 4 piezometers near the ppms ns4 ns6 site the distance between each piezometer ranged between 5 and 10 m piezometers were constructed of 2 54 cm interior diameter schedule 40 pvc with a 10 cm screened interval starting at 5 cm from the bottom a post hole driver was used to drive each piezometer to the desired depth shoreline topography and piezometers were surveyed and referenced to a local control point for making calculations that require relative elevation measurements e g hydraulic gradients the surveyed slopes of the lake bottom measured over 40 m transects toward the center of the lake at ns1 ns2 ns3 ns4 ns5 and ns6 were 9 0 4 0 4 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 0 respectively pressure transducers were installed at the first and last piezometer in all transects except for ns5 where all four piezometers were equipped with transducers lake stage was monitored at the ns5 to calculate vertical and horizontal head gradients all pressure measurements were monitored at an interval of 15 min converted to total head using a local control point altitude adjusted for drift by manual tape downs and were compensated for barometric pressure variations the

1976 for piezometers ns5 1 and ns5 4 the vertical discharge was calculated when lake levels reached the sediment elevation located at the base of the piezometers for horizontal groundwater discharge average gradients were calculated between the shoreline and most off shore piezometer at each transect located approximately 20 m apart daily average horizontal and vertical fluxes were made assuming homogeneous and anisotropic conditions groundwater discharge rates also were determined from 150 separate measurements of seepage made from half barrel meters at and between piezometers along each transect using methods described by rosenberry and labaugh 2008 seepage meters were deployed between piezometers and close to shore and provided synoptic evaluation of groundwater discharge rates to the lake the first set of measurements were collected may 3 4 2016 when lake conditions were calm with relatively stable lake stage conditions a second set of measurements were taken on may 5 2015 at ns5 and ns6 to evaluate changes in groundwater discharge resulting from wind generated waves 2 4 groundwater and surface water sampling from november 2015 to july 2016 a total of 237 nutrient samples were collected from the piezometer at the lake side end of each transect and from the lake just above the sediment water interface during november 2015 to june 2016 to determine the spatial and temporal patterns on a weekly and monthly basis additional samples were collected along the ppms ns5 transect ns5 1 to ns5 4 from piezometers and the lake to assess nutrient concentrations from shore all samples were collected according to usgs water quality sampling protocol wilde 2011 u s geological survey variously dated to ensure that lake samples represented conditions near the sediment water interface samples were collected using a polyethylene tube attached to a wading rod with careful placement not to disturb the periphyton mat dissolved oxygen do temperature and specific conductance sc

analysis results from samples collected at ward creek by the u s geological survey lake tahoe interagency monitoring program were used to supplement lake and groundwater data collected in this study water samples were collected for stable isotopic analyses to determine whether the source of water introduced to the nearshore by groundwater or by surface water stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h were analyzed from lake tahoe and groundwater at ns5 4 and ward creek samples collected on 4 21 2016 and 6 27 2016 samples were analyzed by the usgs reston stable isotope laboratory 2 5 periphyton sampling periphyton samples were collected near ns2 3 ns3 3 and ns5 4 0 4 0 5 m depth at approximately 7 to 14 day intervals from october 31 2015 to june 3 2016 fig 1 two to five randomly selected rocks of similar size 0 020 m2 were collected from each location placed in sealed plastic containers and transported to the lab for scrubbing homogenizing and subsampling for periphyton biomass chlorophyll a

diatom species i e gomphoneis herculeana and filamentous green algae i e ulothrix sp zygnema sp 2 6 data analysis the relationships between nutrient concentrations in lake tahoe and concentrations in ward creek and groundwater were evaluated using multivariate linear regression analysis and hypothesis tests for assessing significance at the 95 confidence level coefficient of determination slope of the regression and p values are presented for significant models chl a concentrations were regressed against nutrients measured in ward creek groundwater and lake tahoe using log transformed data other nutrients sources to the nearshore area also were analyzed including offshore samples indicative of internal lake mixing and upwelling and runoff sources from the roadway and residential areas adjacent to the lake these analyses are not presented herein because offshore nutrient data were not correlated to indicators of periphyton biomass and direct runoff sources were insignificant 3 results 3 1 physical measurements lake levels were in steady decline due to lake evaporation and releases during the summer and reached a seasonal minimum stage of 1896 m on december 3 2015 fig 2 a the steady decline in lake levels had been occurring since 2011 due to a prolonged drought precipitation during the study period was close to the annual average for the basin and higher than previous years and consequently lake levels rose steadily during winter the maximum lake elevation of 1897 m was reached on june 12 2016 from october 1 2015 to july 31 2016 the range in lake elevation was 0 81 m ward creek receives its flow from snowmelt and to a lesser extent from periodic rain events during winter ward creek often becomes dry lower in the watershed during the summer and fall there was no flow in ward creek at the mouth for 90 days in 2015 and ward creek flowed intermittently at the mouth associated with precipitation events during october through january fig 2b flows remained continuous average 1 1 m3 s maximum 9 1 m3 s from january 19 2015 to end of our field investigation period in june 27 2016 precipitation measured within ward creek at an elevation of 2055 m national resource conservation service snotel 848 ward 3 was 180 cm between october 2015 and june 2016 saturated hydraulic conductivity estimated by repeat slug tests ranged from 0 1 to 27 4 m d table st1 horizontal fluxes ranged from 0 02 to 0 79 m d with positive off shore groundwater flow for much of the monitoring period fig 2c horizontal groundwater flow estimated at ns1 and ns2 was most influenced by the early episodic rain storms and subsequent diffusive recharge in the watershed and from channel seepage losses from ward creek at ns3 horizontal flow rates were lowest of all transects with a range of 1 0 10 3 to 3 10 3 m d and an average of 4 10 4 m d at the ppms transect horizontal flow at transect ns5 ranged from 4 0 10 3 to 0 15 m d with an average of 0 03 m d vertical groundwater flow at the ppms transect ns5 1 to ns5 4 ranged from 0 03 to 0 13 m d fig 2d pressure data collected from ns5 3 piezometer was not used in the discharge calculation due to inadvertent vertical and abrupt shift in the piezometer by a recreationalist as such data collected from this piezometer were removed during the period from 3 25 2016 to 6 27 2016 when lake levels reached the base of the ns5 1 and ns5 2 piezometers maximum vertical groundwater flux rates were estimated as 0 04 and 0 05 m d respectively seepage meter measurements along each transect show an exponential decline in groundwater discharge rate as a function of distance from shore fig sf1 the average flux rate measured along each transect during relatively calm conditions ranged from 0 04 to 0 26 m d the range in seepage rates measured were highest near the shoreline 5 m from shore with range of 0 2 0 5 m d and average of 1 3 m d highest rates were observed at ns2 with a maximum flux rate of 2 9 m d measured 0 5 m from shore during a wind event on may 5 2016 0 5 meter high waves were generated and groundwater discharge increased further offshore fig sf3b overall the average rate increased 18 0 38 0 45 m d excluding the flow reversals caused by dynamic mixing along the shoreline caused by waves at ns5 0 2 m from shore the influence of wave action reduced the seepage by an order of magnitude 1 6 0 25 m hr fig sf3b along the same transect seepage increased by an order of magnitude 0 15 1 0 m d at 10 m offshore at ns6 1 m from shore the flux rate was locally influenced by negative gradients causing flow reversal towards the foreshore direction seepage at ns6 also decreased 33 0 9 to 0 6 m d from waves fig sf3c further from shore the influence of waves was more variable with an average rate increase of 400 0 06 0 3 m d 3 2 spatial and seasonal trends in nutrients the samples collected from lake tahoe ward creek and groundwater reflect distinctly different nutrient and physiochemical characteristics table st2 no3 measured in lake tahoe range from 1 0 to 47 μg l with an average value of 3 μg l in ward creek the no3 ranged from 1 0 to 243 μg l with an average of 48 μg l in piezometers no3 ranged from 1 0 to 117 μg l with an average of 64 μg l srp concentrations were greater in groundwater than what was observed in lake tahoe or ward creek samples table st2 in groundwater srp ranged from 10 to 80 μg l with an average of 51 μg l srp values in lake tahoe ranged from 1 0 to 56 μg l with an average of 3 μg l in ward creek srp ranged from 3 to 14 μg l with an average of 6 μg l sc data indicate distinct differences between lake tahoe ward creek and groundwater in groundwater the sc ranged between 48 and 161 μs cm with an average of 125 μs cm flow in ward creek is generated primarily as snow melt runoff and from periodic flow events generated by precipitation in ward creek the sc ranged from 40 to 67 μs cm with an average of 52 μs cm the range of sc in lake tahoe was 71 to 139 μs cm with an average of 93 μs cm seasonal sc and do measurements for ward creek lake tahoe and groundwater were compared to evaluate relative contributions to the nearshore fig 3 groundwater sampled near ward creek ns1 ns2 and surface water samples taken from ward creek show very similar patterns for do and sc from 11 10 2015 to 1 8 2016 the do in piezometers ns1 3 and ns2 3 increased from 4 7 to 10 8 mg l and 1 1 to 8 3 mg l respectively indicating significant influence from recharge by ward creek fig 3b however piezometers transect ns5 and ns6 have distinctly different do and sc concentrations relative to ward creek indicating that unlike ns1 and ns2 groundwater originates as diffuse recharge higher in the watershed and not recharge from ward creek transect ns3 appears to be a mixture of groundwater originating from ward creek seepage and regional groundwater sampled at ns4 and ns6 time series of no3 srp and dp concentrations measured from ward creek and groundwater are shown in fig 4 during the early period of episodic flow november 2015 to january 2016 no3 concentrations in ward creek were at their greatest concentrations likely due to the initial flushing of salts accumulated in soils and sediment during the previous years of drought coats and goldman 2001 during continuous flow in ward creek 1 19 2016 to 6 28 2016 concentrations decreased to an average no3 concentration of 9 0 μg l as shown with do and sc seasonal patterns in no3 corresponds to changes in ward creek at ns1 and ns2 at ns5 4 and ns6 4 the concentrations of no3 were not directly influenced by changes in ward creek srp and dp concentrations were generally greater in samples taken from the piezometers located further away from ward creek fig 4b c comparison of groundwater stable isotopic composition to that of surface water collected from ward creek and lake tahoe were used to determine if the groundwater originated as creek or lake water the data were compared to isotopic compositions of lake tahoe and groundwater collected from a network of monitoring wells located throughout the basin thodal 1997 the average δ18o and δ2h composition of water sampled in the piezometer at ns5 4 was 13 6 and 98 3 table st3 and were consistent with groundwater collected from wells with a depth to water range of 7 140 m thodal 1997 the isotopic composition of lake tahoe and ward creek collected from this study also were consistent with previous reports on surface water entering lake tahoe nehring 1980 welch et al 1997 these results indicate that water stored within the shallow lakebed sediment in the nearshore area is characteristic of groundwater within the basin and supports the conclusion that nutrients entering the lake from the lakebed in the nearshore area comes from aquifer storage in the watershed these results also rule out the possibility that water stored in the lakebed originates from the lake because lake water isotopic signature is much more evaporated than the groundwater isotopic signature there were modest positive correlations between no3 concentrations observed in ward creek and concentrations in groundwater for shoreline piezometers ns1 3 r2 0 26 p 0 2 ns2 3 r2 0 5 p 0 05 and ns3 3 r2 0 78 p 0 01 located near the stream mouth fig 5 a concentrations remained elevated in groundwater following decreases in surface water concentrations to levels near the detection limits 1 μg l the regression analysis did not identify any relationship between groundwater and ward creek at transects ns5 and ns6 for no3 or dp however modest positive correlations were identified between groundwater and lake tahoe observations for dp at ns3 3 r2 0 35 p 0 1 ns5 4 r2 0 56 p 0 01 and ns6 4 r2 0 3 p 0 2 monitoring locations fig 5b 3 3 trends in seasonal periphyton biomass unlike historical patterns and patterns during the monitoring period for this study observed at pineland ns5 see fig 1c the seasonal peak in periphyton biomass occurs earlier at sites ns2 and ns3 closer to ward creek fig 6 chl a peaked during december to january at ns2 and ns3 and peaked in april at ns5 conversely afdw at transect site ns2 and ns3 steadily increased during the monitoring period fig 6b despite decreases in chl a during the april to june period afdw at ns5 remained steady until the end of the monitoring period in early june greater values of afdw later in the season relative to the earlier peak in chl a could be related to a decrease in the amount of living algae and an increase in the amount of cyanobacteria heterotrophic microbes and detritus the ai ranged between 400 and 800 at ns5 whereas values were much lower during the early season and increased above 1000 during late season at ns2 and ns3 fig 6c 3 4 source of nutrients to nearshore periphyton the timing of nutrient contributions from both ward creek and groundwater correspond to early peaks in algal biomass measured at transects ns2 and ns3 fig 7 multivariate regression models of nutrient contributions from ward creek were significantly correlated r2 0 76 p 0 001 to chl a with contributions of srp and no3 to the correlation of 80 and 20 respectively table 1 at ns3 nutrient concentrations in ward creek also were correlated to chl a r2 0 40 p 0 03 with contributions of srp and no3 to the correlation of 46 and 54 respectively regression models improved when nutrients from groundwater were included as additional independent variables at ns2 groundwater contributed 9 of the no3 to the correlation r2 0 77 p 0 001 dp from groundwater did not improve the regression model at ns3 groundwater contributed 11 dp and ward creek contributed 45 no3 and 44 srp to the correlation r2 0 49 p 0 01 recharge from ward creek during a period of seasonally low lake levels may have resulted in rapid transfer of nutrients from groundwater to the nearshore concentrations of srp were below detection in lake tahoe samples at ns2 or ns3 likely due to algal uptake or sorption onto sediments results of the nutrient sampling and biomass monitoring at ns2 and ns3 demonstrate that algal biomass was stimulated by the combination with no3 and srp from ward creek and groundwater however decreases in groundwater nutrient flux increases in solar radiation or other factors could have contributed to the cessation of periphyton growth nutrients associated with groundwater also contribute to observable changes in lake concentrations and correspond to variations in algal biomass at ns5 fig 8 at ns5 the regression results indicate that ward creek did not influence nutrient concentrations in groundwater or periphyton biomass variations no3 concentrations in lake water rapidly increased from less than the detection limit 1 μg l to 8 μg l between january and april fig 8a no3 concentrations in groundwater discharging to the lake are correlated to variations in algal biomass fig 8b for dp the contributions of groundwater to lake concentrations fig 8c and to algal biomass were more pronounced fig 8d given the correlation between groundwater and lake nutrient concentrations the regression analysis identified dp from lake and no3 from groundwater contributed 42 and 42 to the correlation r2 0 39 p 0 007 respectively table 1 at ns5 regression analysis indicates a significant correlation between nutrients in groundwater and chl a qualitative trends in periphyton biomass growing at ns5 also were assessed with time lapse photography and shows increased periphyton through february followed by bleaching and sloughing during spring fig sf2 underwater photographs during the period of monitoring were helpful in identifying seasonal growth patterns and disturbance to algal mats caused by turbulent wave action during the april to june period the color of the algal mat changed to a translucent white color that was thick and loosely attached to surface of rocks disturbance to algal mats by loose adjacent rocks occurred frequently caused by turbulence induced by wave action 4 discussion 4 1 groundwater lake interactions measured and estimated groundwater seepage rates measured for this study are high relative to global estimates of groundwater discharge in lakes rosenberry et al 2015 compiled seepage estimates from a variety of methods from 108 lakes world wide and summarized average and maximum values ranging of 5 10 5 to 1 2 m d and 2 10 4 to 7 4 m d respectively the reported median for the average and maximum discharge rates was 0 07 and 0 05 m d respectively groundwater discharge rates for all transects in lake tahoe ranged from 1 0 10 2 to 0 8 m d with an average of 0 08 m d the rates measured with seepage meters ranged from 1 4 10 2 to 2 9 m d with an average of 0 4 m d these values 2 5 10 3 m d to 0 6 m d have similar values as seepage measurements made by previous studies along the shore of lake tahoe loeb and goldman 1979 loeb 1987 constantz et al 2016 notwithstanding the differences in seepage rates using darcy s equation and seepage meters kennedy et al 2010 the rates of groundwater discharge estimated herein are significant with respect to water budgets nutrient fluxes and littoral algal dynamics for lake tahoe as demonstrated by nutrient concentrations and most profoundly by the sc data groundwater discharge to lake tahoe is seasonally variable and driven by recharge from ward creek in proximity to the stream mouth i e transects ns1 and ns2 and by rain and snowmelt recharge on the hillslopes north of ward creek i e transect sites ns3 ns5 and ns6 at low lake stage recharge events in the watershed mobilize groundwater beneath the lake shore causing greater amounts of nutrients to discharge into the lake this is illustrated by abrupt changes in water quality in piezometers beneath the lakebed recharge on hillslopes causing rapid pre event groundwater discharge to distal locations as noted here for the ward creek watershed has been reported extensively in other watersheds e g ward 1984 buttle 1994 variations in lake stage also are important for controlling groundwater discharge including reversals in the direction of seepage storage is regulated in lake tahoe and the average annual variation in lake stage is 0 72 m usgs 10337000 lake tahoe at tahoe city ca variations in lake stage strongly influence rates and locations of groundwater discharge to illustrate this point we present a conceptual model to highlight the dynamic interaction between recharge in the basin and groundwater discharge along the shore of lake tahoe for the ppms transect fig 9 in general nutrients discharging to the nearshore by groundwater are controlled by the hydraulic gradient aquifer hydraulic properties and clogging armoring processes at the sediment water interface as runoff is generated in streams the permeable stream sediments allow transport of well oxygenated surface water to maintain aerobic conditions in groundwater near streams fig 9a physical and biogeochemical processes in groundwater near the streams are highly influenced by the timing and duration of surface runoff groundwater discharge rates and nutrient concentrations located further away from the influence of stream recharge is more diffuse contains lower do higher sc and is driven by recharge from precipitation and snow melt during the winter period lake levels are at the seasonal low due minimal surface water inputs and lake evaporation the nutrients delivered to the eulittoral zone sediments by groundwater stimulate algal growth as lake concentrations are low nutrients cycling at the benthic zone contribute to additional sources of nutrients for algal assimilation and uptake mixing of lake and groundwater at shoreline locally elevates discharge rates and nutrient fluxes fig 9b increases in lake stage reduces the gradient and groundwater discharge rates and temporarily reverses the groundwater flow direction at the highest lake stage the area of greatest rates of groundwater discharge shifts towards the maximum elevation of the eulittoral zone fig 9c periphyton in the eulittoral zone must adapt to the changes in lake stage and nutrients flux as well as other controlling variables such as solar radiation temperature and wave action morphology of the backshore and foreshore areas control the seasonal variation in seepage at the shoreline as the lake stage changes seasonally from the minimum to maximum elevations within the eulittorial zone for relatively flat shorelines changes in lake stage will strongly influence the rate and location of groundwater and nutrient discharge for example along the ppms a lake stage increase of 1 m above the minimum lake level shifts the shoreline 30 m onto the foreshore the seasonal variation in the shoreline driven by lake stage has ecological implications for eulittorial periphyton as they are stimulated or controlled by lakebed substrate temperature nutrients solar radiation groundwater discharge and waves all of which are influenced by lake depth in the nearshore area hofmann et al 2008 lake tahoe stage rose following the spring snowmelt runoff period in january and peaked in late may 2016 and the upward hydraulic gradient beneath the lake decreased in response groundwater discharge was focused closer to the shoreline and discharge rates decreased from shore as shown by results from the seepage meter measurements made may 3 4 2016 fig sf1 4 2 spatial and temporal variability of nutrients recharge from ward creek is an important driver for delivering oxygen and nutrients to groundwater discharging to the lakeshore however this influence becomes minimal between 120 m and 320 m laterally away from where ward creek enters the lake the lakeshore further from ward creek including the ppms is influenced by recharge from diffuse sources such as precipitation and snow melt runoff that infiltrates and recharges the shallow hillslope aquifer concentrations of no3 in ward creek during the monitoring period were greater during early episodic rain events and decreased during the average flow conditions fed by snowmelt these results are consistent with previous work describing the fate and transport of nutrients in the tahoe basin pearson et al 2015 ohara et al 2011 miller et al 2005 coats et al 1976 our results suggest that intense precipitation released more particulate nitrogen and phosphorus due to the erosion and transport of organic rich material from the forest floor and channel sediments this is illustrated by the greatest increases in nutrient concentrations in ward creek following large rain events that occurred during december and january however the seasonal groundwater samples characterized into pre event and event water indicate that recharge events in the watershed cause increases in nutrient rich pre event groundwater discharge to the lake this process is consistent with previous findings in steep watersheds vidon 2012 torres et al 1998 and our results indicate this process is important for stimulating periphyton growth nutrients concentrations associated with pre event groundwater are nearly three times greater for no3 pre event 80 μg l event 30 μg l and 2 times greater for srp pre event 70 μg l event 40 μg l thus two thirds of no3 and srp in groundwater discharging to the lake comes from nutrient enrichment in the subsurface and the other one third is the result of atmospheric deposition contained in the precipitation reduction of concentrations in subsequent storms and runoff may be related to less available particulate nitrogen and phosphorus inamdar et al 2015 or dilution during peak recharge concentrations of no3 in groundwater near ward creek at transect ns1 is lower than more distal observations suggesting dilution of groundwater by stream infiltration recharge alluvial deposits containing andesite may contain naturally elevated phosphorus concentrations compared to granite soils which also could explain greater concentrations in groundwater in the ward creek watershed porder and ramachandran 2012 rapid decreases in sc and increases in do in groundwater to levels more consistent with ward creek at both ns1 3 and ns2 3 during november to december further demonstrates the influence of mixing of recharge from ward creek with older groundwater groundwater beneath the confluence of ward creek and lake tahoe do concentrations at ns1 3 were 4 mg l for the entire period of monitoring thus suggesting that denitrification is minimal in the hyporheic zone of ward creek the aerobic conditions within the sediments of ward creek watershed likely enhance mineralization of organic deposits and contribute to no3 in groundwater through nitrification leonard et al 1979 jones et al 1995 niswonger et al 2017 at ns2 3 the ambient do concentration at the initial period of monitoring were among the lowest levels 1 0 mg l measured at any of the piezometers when ward creek was not flowing following the episodic flow events do increased to 8 mg l and remained at or above levels measured at other piezometers until march 2016 when the do concentrations dropped below 4 0 mg l and trended to a seasonal minimum of 1 mg l fig 3b the timing of the do response closely matches the seasonal change in do from ward creek however the decrease to anaerobic conditions in groundwater is likely a consequence of biogeochemical processes the decrease in do towards anaerobic conditions also coincides with decreases in no3 concentrations during this period march 2016 to june 2016 the average no3 concentration in ward creek was 7 7 μg l fig 4a at the same time the average groundwater concentration at ns2 3 was 25 μg l the reduction in no3 in groundwater from 117 to 5 μg l at ns2 3 was likely a result of changes in subsurface flow paths and residence times associated with rising lake levels and greater proportions of more dilute event water kendall et al 1995 schafran and driscoll 1993 the notable changes in concentrations in piezometers while lake levels increased likely were a result of a shift in the area where maximum groundwater discharge to the lake occurs karan et al 2014 schafran and driscoll 1993 of the two transects closest to ward creek we observed a relatively dense benthic algal cover on the cobble substrates at ns2 and ns3 with peak growth occurring earlier than at the ppms consistent with the earlier breakthrough of nutrients closer to ward creek no3 concentrations in ward creek during october to january period widely varied from 1 to 243 μg l during early winter period runoff benthic surveys by hackley et al 2014 2016 also have shown the area around the mouth of ward creek to contain moderate to high winter and spring algal growth the influence of waves on the swash zone may also be a factor in delivering nutrients to the nearshore and increasing the nutrient gradient at the cell boundary of periphyton communities reuter et al 1986 as observed with the seepage meters the influence of waves can dramatically affect the rate and direction of groundwater discharge to the lake the influence of waves precipitation and evapotranspiration was also found to be important influences on nearshore seepage rates rosenberry et al 2013 waves that move up on to land may temporarily decouple the groundwater from the lake elevation horn 2002 the change in the hydraulic gradient beneath the foreshore may be responsible for increases in groundwater discharge further from shore as measured with the seepage meters during wind generated waves wave induced changes in groundwater flow can cause localized circulation patterns that promote offshore discharge of groundwater li and barry 2000 and biogeochemical reactive zones robinson 2015 other driving influences affect nutrient concentrations in lake water are precipitation and recharge into the foreshore area or sloughing of algal mats that temporarily reduce biomass that controls uptake rates reuter et al 1986 and areas of the nearshore near streams 4 3 nutrient fluxes to nearshore environment increases in no3 from 6 to 47 μg l in lake water at the sediment water interface indicate that the nutrient flux rates from groundwater discharge to the lake periodically exceeds the algal uptake periphyton uptake experiments from algal communities of lake tahoe were shown to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorus reuter et al 1986 loeb 1987 thus increases in nutrient concentrations in lake water as observed during our sampling period are significant a strong correlation between the timing of increases in nutrient concentrations and the onset of the winter periphyton growth indicate the important role that streamflow and groundwater discharge has on biomass in the nearshore zone phosphorus concentrations in streams in the tahoe basin occur in the soluble and particulate form and particulate forms are typically associated with suspended sediments hatch et al 1999 coats et al 2016 sorption and assimilative processes may partly explain why srp concentration were 1 μg l in lake samples while relatively high concentrations were measured in the groundwater 75 μg l furthermore the total dp consisted of a greater proportion of srp within the piezometers 75 of dp was srp whereas dp in lake water only consisted of dissolved organic phosphorus nutrient concentrations measured in groundwater beneath the lake are slightly higher than concentrations measured in groundwater in the watershed nearly 40 years ago the average no3 concentrations in groundwater collected from piezometers within lake tahoe were greater by 20 50 60 μg l for no3 and by 155 20 51 μg l for srp since the previous work by loeb 1987 these increases may reflect changes in natural processes or anthropogenic activity within the watershed that directly influence the nutrient loads delivered to streams groundwater and nearshore areas for example coats et al 1976 reported the release of nitrates by alder stands during the fall and winter periods and potential for disturbance to soils to increase loads periphyton growth along nearshore areas of ward creek have been monitored for several decades and accumulation of organic matter and nutrient cycling may be responsible for local sources of nutrients at the sediment water interface in the ward creek watershed alluvial deposits containing andesite may comprise of naturally elevated phosphorus compared to sediment derived from granite other sources of phosphorus may include desorption from soils beneath organic rich o horizons miller et al 2005 urban runoff coats et al 2008 fertilizer use loeb 1986 and from leaking sewer lines nagy 2003 variability in phosphorus measured in groundwater may be partly related to the redox conditions that impact dissolution and mobilization hou et al 2013 phosphorus concentrations collected from piezometers furthest from ward creek were generally higher than observed from piezometers nearby ward creek i e fig 4 srp the most biologically reactive form of phosphorus was not detected in most lake water samples however the regression analysis indicates that even low srp concentrations from ward creek significantly contribute changes periphyton biomass given that concentrations of srp in groundwater exceeded other sources but remained low within lake samples suggest that srp concentrations in the lake are controlled by periphyton uptake and or sorption processes in the upper 20 cm of the lakebed 4 4 periphyton growth 4 4 1 onset of the periphyton bloom periphyton growing in the eulittoral zone at lake tahoe has a pronounced seasonal growth pattern that peaks in winter and early spring this unusual seasonal growth pattern is likely caused by the hydrologic cycle and nutrient availability as supported by correlations between precipitation increases in nutrient discharge to the lake and increases in chl a sources of nutrients to the eulittoral zone were provided by groundwater discharge originating as stream infiltration near the creek mouth and as diffuse recharge in the watershed at locations distal to the stream mouth seasonal timing of the highest nutrient concentrations in groundwater discharging to the lake correlate to the onset of the winter periphyton bloom these results compliment the study by périllon et al 2017 and support their findings that periphyton preferentially grows where groundwater discharge of nutrients is greatest roy et al 2009 found strong correlations between increased periphyton growth and nutrients in groundwater derived by wastewater our work on the nearshore of clarifies linkages among seasonal periphyton growth and the seasonal hydrologic cycle within the lake tahoe basin these linkages are likely prevalent in many lake systems with strong seasonal climate variability another example of the influence of the hydrologic cycle was the earlier periphyton bloom that occurred near the creek mouth verses distal to the creek mouth which corresponded to earlier increases in nutrient concentrations in groundwater near the creek mouth 4 4 2 cessation of the periphyton bloom cessation of the winter spring periphyton bloom at lake tahoe appears to be caused by 1 reductions in nutrient discharge caused by rising lake levels during spring and 2 increases in solar radiation due to longer photoperiods as the sun rises above the steep mountainous horizon in spring over exposure of uv radiation can cause photo bleaching of diatoms and a loss of chl a in highly transparent alpine lakes vinebrooke and leavitt 1996 higley et al 2001 given the shallow lake depth and clear transparency of the nearshore environment changes in pigment of the stock diatom were also observed with the underwater camera deployed at the ppms fig sf1 declines in chl a while there are steady concentrations of afdw also suggests that cyanobacteria heterotrophic microbes and detritus remain present on sediments long after chl a declines monitoring of nutrient concentrations in groundwater in upland areas as well as areas of development would be valuable in evaluating the anthropogenic impacts to groundwater and seasonal variations 4 4 3 management implications some important management considerations include contributions of nutrients from developed areas and the changes in nutrient transformations in groundwater further there is a need to collect data to determine the source of nutrients in groundwater to determine what management activities to prioritize inputs of nutrients from lawn fertilizer applications or leaking sewer lines may be a significant source of nutrients to groundwater that enters the lake especially from residential neighborhoods and recreational facilities nagy 2003 the use of infiltration basins and constructed wetlands to reduce surface runoff may also contribute to the timing and magnitude of subsurface nutrient fluxes as well as stimulate biogeochemical transformations prudic et al 2005 assessments of the effectiveness of engineered basins and wetlands for reducing nutrient loads primarily has focused on reductions in streamflow runoff and sediment loads to the lake schuster and grismer 2004 however transformations of nutrients in groundwater induced by infiltration may contribute to additional sources of nutrients to the nearshore 5 conclusions the goal of this work was to better understand linkages among climate hydrology groundwater and seasonal variations in periphyton biomass in a subalpine oligotrophic lake our work shows that for areas near the mouth of streams nutrient inputs to the nearshore are temporally and spatially variable and consist of both streamflow and groundwater sources in nearshore areas distal to the influence of streamflow groundwater is the major source of nutrients for periphyton our work demonstrates that seasonal climatic and hydrologic cycles affect groundwater discharge to the lake and are correlated to seasonal periphyton biomass growing in the eulittorial zone furthermore atypical winter periphyton blooms in lake tahoe are likely a result of the seasonal variations in nutrient rich groundwater discharge to the lake and are therefore a result of hydrologic conditions in the basin water resource managers that are working to reduce external nutrient sources to lake tahoe are challenged by non point sources of nutrients such as groundwater that appears to contribute significant amounts of nutrients to the lake furthermore as previous periphyton studies in lakes have mostly neglected groundwater as a source of nutrients results presented herein should help guide future investigations changes in recharge processes caused by climate change will likely result in greater variability in nutrient concentrations delivered by surface and groundwater to lake tahoe and to snow fed lakes in general groundwater monitoring along littoral areas could improve our understanding of changing hydrological conditions and projected future trends in periphyton growth in lakes under the influence of a changing climate 6 declaration we have no financial personal

6856,among the four types of drought socioeconomic drought which has a direct impact on human production and daily life is the least understood the current socioeconomic drought index proposed by mehran et al 2015 is the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri which combines information on inflow demand reliability and water storage resilience the msrri resolves the problem of difficult quantification of socioeconomic drought however the msrri also has some flaws such as ignoring reservoir dispatching regulations and the relationship between water supply and water demand therefore this study aims to improve the msrri through combining reservoir operation processes and actual water supply and demand and proposing an improved msrri imsrri the upper yellow river basin uyrb was selected as a case study and comparison between the msrri and imsrri was conducted the evolution characteristics of the imsrri series in the uyrb were examined additionally cross wavelet analysis was utilized to reveal the associations between the imsrri series and climate factors results indicated that 1 compared with the msrri the imsrri could capture the onset and termination of socioeconomic drought more accurately and reasonably due to the fusion of reservoir scheduling characteristics at a smaller timescale 2 the socioeconomic drought in the uyrb had dramatically changed during the past few decades the imsrri series showed a significantly decreasing trend and two change points 1995 and 1975 were captured and 3 the el niño southern oscillation enso and the atlantic oscillation ao showed significant influences on the short period the influences of enso were stronger than ao while sunspots had the strongest impacts on the long period keywords socioeconomic drought reservoir system limited outflow process line climate factors the upper yellow river basin 1 introduction drought is a complex and periodic natural hazard which may have serious destructive effects on agriculture industry ecological environment and residents live gan et al 2016 cammalleri et al 2017 generally droughts can be classified into four types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic wilhite and glantz 1985 wilhite 2000 american meteorological society 1997 world meteorological organization 2006 meteorological drought is often associated with the shortage of precipitation over a region for a period of time agricultural drought is usually measured by soil moisture deficit hydrological drought is related to dry periods of surface or subsurface hydrology and water resources and socioeconomic drought refers to whether the water supply can meet the demand of various water use sectors and their economic benefits wilhite and glantz 1985 american meteorological society 2004 zseleczky and yosef 2014 with population growth the rapid development of industry and the expansion of urbanization the demand for water has increased dramatically and there have been water scarcities in varying degrees in many regions of the world mishra and singh 2010 mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016a furthermore in the context of global climate variation extreme events such as floods and droughts are frequent willems 2000 kunkel 2003 roy and balling 2004 beniston and stephenson 2004 leng et al 2015 liu et al 2019 therefore it is especially necessary to investigate the risk and evolution characteristics of drought in recent years there have been many previous studies focusing on drought risk and evolution characteristics that have obtained some significant findings which are helpful for disaster prevention and reduction and allocation of water resources however these previous studies mainly aimed at meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought li et al 2013 xu et al 2014 huang et al 2014a 2014b 2015 wanders and wada 2015 van loon and laaha 2015 serinaldi 2016 lin et al 2017 wu et al 2017 fang et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge until now there have only been a few studies concentrating on socioeconomic drought mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016a shi et al 2017 due to the rapid development of industry and urbanization the water supply cannot meet the water demand of water use sectors socioeconomic drought becomes an extremely serious issue in many areas of the world sivapalan 2015 mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016a hence to better guide the allocation and utilization of water resources it is very necessary to construct socioeconomic drought evaluation indexes and investigate the evolution characteristics of socioeconomic drought as large man made water conservancy structures reservoirs have the function of redistributing runoff in temporal and spatial scales shiklomanov et al 2000 a reservoir can be seen as a system which can provide resilience to withstand extreme events such as floods and droughts and the storage and discharge of reservoirs determines the balance of water supply and water demand downstream therefore the reservoir system can be used to evaluate socioeconomic drought currently frequent distinctions in vulnerability and drought assessment research emerge from the top down and bottom up methodologies dessai and hulme 2004 mehran et al 2015 a top down approach comes from climate variability impact assessments and focuses on different climate conditions that cannot be primitively controlled or changed by decision makers a bottom up methodology pays attention to the capacity of people and governments response under climate extremes such as water conservation and reuse as ways to deal with water stress integrating the concepts and theories of top down and bottom up methodologies and establishing a comprehensive assessment system is a good way to assess a complex man made system socioeconomic droughts are likely to occur more frequently around the world in the future chen et al 2016 smirnov et al 2016 trinh et al 2017 for this type of drought mehran et al 2015 utilized the ideology of top down and bottom up methodology proposed the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri which is based on the inflow demand reliability index idr and the water storage resilience index wsr for assessing water stress and socioeconomic droughts and combined the two indexes through a non parametric multivariate statistical approach this methodology dealt with the problem of difficult quantification of socioeconomic drought for the first time huang et al 2016a applied the msrri to investigate the evolution characteristics of socioeconomic droughts in the heihe river basin in china and shi et al 2017 proposed the socioeconomic drought index sedi through integrating water shortage and drought duration and utilized it to characterize socioeconomic drought in the east river basin these studies provided new insight into the development of the socioeconomic drought index however in the idr index framework the outflow of a reservoir was regarded as the demand but the outflow cannot accurately represent the demand especially during the drought period when the outflow is small the demand is large and the outflow is much less than the actual demand therefore the msrri cannot reasonably reflect the real relationship between water supply and water demand in practice additionally the msrri cannot accurately characterize socioeconomic drought during the flood season as for the sedi it ignores the influence of reservoir water storage on future socioeconomic drought to better assess the operation process and the potential to cope with socioeconomic drought in the reservoir system we proposed an improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri based on the framework of the msrri and operational characteristics of the reservoir system in this present study in order to accurately and reasonably reflect the water supply and water demand relationship in the downstream of the reservoir and reduce the susceptibility of msrri to inflow the outflow demand reliability odr indicator was proposed in this present study additionally the reservoir system resilience rsr indicator was proposed by combining the concept of the limited outflow process line in the reservoir operation chart into the bottom up frame furthermore the imsrri reduced the time scale of the frame of msrri to prevent appearance of attenuation therefore the index can in theory more precisely reveal the onset and termination of socioeconomic droughts climate variation has been one of the major elements that exert great influence on drought even a diminutive variation in climate can lead to a drastic change in the hydrological cycle thereby causing more frequent hydrological hazards hanson and weltzin 2000 hirabayashi et al 2008 ahn et al 2016 linares et al 2017 tietjen et al 2017 huang et al 2014c much research has confirmed that drought events are strongly linked to climate indices stahl and demuth 1999 revealed that the hydrological drought in southern germany was closely linked to anti cyclonic atmospheric circulation patterns and severe high pressure huang et al 2016b disclosed that the arctic oscillation ao and the el niño southern oscillation enso play an important role in hydrological drought in the columbia river basin huang et al 2017 found that the arctic oscillation ao and the el niño southern oscillation enso have a strong link with the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought in the wei river basin asong et al 2018 found droughts in a typically cold region to be associated with large scale climate signals however as we know previous studies concerning socioeconomic drought and climate indices are rare to better forecast regional socioeconomic drought conditions and effectively guide local drought relief and management this present study investigates the linkages between socioeconomic droughts and the enso ao pdo pacific decadal oscillation sunspot being the second largest river basin in china the contradiction between water supply and water demand in the upper yellow river basin uyrb is comparatively more severe because of the combined influence of climate variation and human activities bai et al 2015 meanwhile the uyrb lies in arid and semi arid regions and plays a distinctly important role in water resource planning and management in northwestern china thus the present study selected the uyrb as a case study the main purposes of this study are 1 to propose an improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri for assessing socioeconomic drought and verify its practicability and reliability in the uyrb through analyzing the onset termination persistence peak and retreat of socioeconomic drought and contrasting the reservoir operation process 2 to fully reveal the evolution characteristics of socioeconomic drought including trend analysis and change point diagnosis and define the socioeconomic drought events in the uyrb and 3 to explore the effect of climate factors on socioeconomic droughts in the uyrb 2 study area and data the yellow river is the fifth largest river in the world and the uyrb is located in the interior of the eurasian continent and belongs to arid and semi arid regions its drainage area is 386000 km2 accounting for 51 3 of the total area of the yellow river basin and it yields 54 of the total runoff of the yellow river the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources in northwest china is uneven in this area and the contradiction between water supply and water demand is prominent as the most important water source in northwest china the upper yellow river plays a significant role in the socioeconomics of northwest china bai et al 2015 fang et al 2017 longyang gorge lyx reservoir is the first large water control project in the uyrb and has 24 7 billion m3 of total storage and 19 4 billion m3 of regulating storage with 1280 mw installed capacity and 590 mw guaranteed output fig 1 as a multi year reservoir the lyx reservoir plays a leading role in the water resources management and cascade scheduling system and undertakes water supply hydroelectric power generation irrigation ice prevention and ecological tasks in this study the monthly inflow datasets of the lyx reservoir during 1959 4 2010 4 hydrological year were collected from the northwest china grid company limited the optimized operation chart of the lyx reservoir fig 2 was utilized to establish a reservoir simulation scheduling model and the constraints of the model included 1 water balance 2 pool level 3 discharge and 4 hydropower station output constraints in the reservoir simulation scheduling model the optimized operation chart provided the operation rules which meant that the output of the hydropower station was determined by the water level of the reservoir to delineate the uyrb the aster dem dataset with 30 m spatial resolution was used fig 1 additionally the monthly ao nino 3 4 pdo sunspot index time series spanning 1959 4 2010 4 was collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa earth system research laboratory http www esrl noaa gov 3 methodology 3 1 an improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index for characterizing socioeconomic drought generally over year and within year reservoirs are two major types of reservoir systems vogel and bolognese 1995 the within year systems can redistribute the runoff over a period of one year and as a result these systems are very susceptible to seasonal variations the over year systems can redistribute the runoff over a period of several years and these systems therefore are able to defend against longer term drought in a previous study msrri was used to assess socioeconomic drought mehran et al 2015 this indicator relied on two individual indexes the inflow demand reliability idr index and water storage resilience wsr index which correspond to the top down and bottom up methodology respectively the idr and wsr indicators are shown as follows mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016a 1 α t i t m 1 t q i n t q es t t q es t t q es t t i t 12 t 13 m q out i if m 6 i t m 1 t q out i if m 12 2 β t s t t v i n t v ou t t v min v es t t v es t t where α t is an unstandardized idr indicator β t denotes an unstandardized wsr indicator q i n t represents the monthly inflow to the reservoir i is the sample size which ranges from month 1 to n q ou t t is the monthly outflow from the reservoir q es t t stands for the total estimated water demand in projected timeframe and time step t ranges from month 13 to n t 13 n here the first 6 or 12 months of the date are used for assessing the demand in the projected timeframe therefore the index can only be evaluated starting from the second year of the data t 13 n m denotes the selected timeframe in months 6 months for within year reservoir systems and 12 for multi year reservoir systems s t t represents the reservoir storage at month t where t 13 n v ou t t stands for the monthly outflow volume from the reservoir v i n t denotes the monthly inflow volume from the reservoir v min denotes reservoir storage corresponding to the dead pool level and v es t t denotes the total estimated demand volume in the projected timeframe however outflow is treated as water demand in the frame of msrri which cannot reflect the real relationship between water supply and water demand thus we not only treat outflow as water supply but also combine it with the demand of the downstream thereby proposing the outflow demand reliability odr index however in practice the attenuation phenomenon was found due to the large timescale and in terms of the operation period of the reservoir systems the temporal scales were too large to characterize the development process of socioeconomic drought to cope with this problem the temporal scales of the frame are reduced in the present study to 3 months for the within year reservoir and 6 months for the multi year reservoir the odr indicator is shown as follows 3 α t i t m 1 t q ou t t q es t t q es t t q es t t i t 6 t 7 m q dem i if m 3 i t m 1 t q dem i if m 6 where α t is the unstandardized odr indicator m denotes the selected timeframe in months 3 months for within year and 6 for multi year systems q de m t represents the monthly water demand of the reservoir s downstream and the demand is calculated as follows 4 q de m t q la n t i 1 n q rd i t q r c t δ q l where q la n t denotes the demand of lanzhou section q rd i t represents the demand of the i region q r c t stands for the interval watershed concentration δ q is the unit of river course loss and l denotes the length of the river between the lyx reservoir and the lanzhou section furthermore figs 3 and 4 clearly illustrate the basic characteristics of inflow and demand it is obvious that annual distribution of inflow is uneven and there are many extreme values conversely the demand of the lyx reservoir is stabilized these findings are consistent with the practical situation the odr indicator corresponded to the top down methodology where the outflow was assessed relative to the water demand of the downstream hence this indicator indicates whether the outflow from the system is enough to satisfy the water demand of the downstream regardless of the storage in the reservoir the water storage resilience wsr indicator is constructed by bottom up methodology which is defined on the basis of monthly storage monthly inflow monthly outflow and total demand during the timeframe and indicates the status of a reservoir system to withstand socioeconomic drought during the operation process in the present study to precisely characterize the ability of reservoirs for coping with socioeconomic drought especially in the flood season introducing the limited outflow process line from the optimized operation chart fig 2 in this framework we propose the reservoir system resilience rsr indicator 5 β t s t t v i n t v ou t t v min v es t t v es t t where β t denotes the unstandardized rsr indicator and it is noted that v min stands for reservoir storage corresponding to the limited outflow process line copulas are functions that can be used to calculate the joint distribution of two variables regardless of their original marginal distributions kao and govindaraju 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2013 assuming the outflow demand reliability index and reservoir system resilience index as random variables x and y respectively the distribution with the cumulative joint probability p can be expressed with a copula as 6 p x x y y c f x g y p where c is the copula and f x and g y denote the marginal cumulative distribution functions of random variables x and y the copula c has the flexibility to construct the joint distribution of random variables on the basis of their marginal distributions copulas have been widely used in hydrological and climatological studies in modeling dependence structures of nonlinear multivariate data the copula family has various types and archimedean copulas were utilized due to their simple structure and strong representativeness gumbel copulas clayton copulas and frank copulas gumbel and clayton copulas exert asymmetric dependence structures and are only applicable to positively related sequences while the frank copula offers a symmetric dependence structure which can be applied to both positive and negative correlations and without limitation to the degree of correlation nelsen 2006 meanwhile the frank copula has been widely used in drought research hao and aghakouchak 2013 rajsekhar and singh 2015 salvadori 2010 therefore we selected the frank copula to structure the joint distribution of the odr and rsr the frank copula is expressed as 7 c u v 1 θ ln 1 e θ u 1 e θ v 1 e θ u 1 where u and v are the marginal cumulative probabilities of the odr and rsr respectively and θ is the parameter which can be estimated from kendall s rank correlation τ 8 τ 1 4 d θ 1 θ where d θ is expressed as 9 d θ 1 θ 0 θ t exp t 1 d t where t represents the integration variable from the cumulative joint probability p shown in eq 3 the improve multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri can be defined as 10 imsrri ϕ 1 p where ϕ represents the standard normal distribution function imsrri is not only a hybrid index including two fundamentally different indicators but it also covers both common methodologies in vulnerability studies top down and bottom up because imsrri assesses the supply and storage relative to the demand it can be regarded as a measure of socioeconomic drought different from the msrri imsrri reduces the sensitivity of inflow and increases the response to the operation process and the relationship between water supply and water demand of the downstream 3 2 identification of socioeconomic drought event once the socioeconomic drought index is calculated some standard should be applied to characterize the socioeconomic drought event the imsrri is similar to other standardized drought indices and positive values indicate that a reservoir system s status can guarantee the water demand while negative values mean reliability and resilience of the reservoir system have decreased to some extent however because of the resiliency of the reservoir system some negative values do not affect the operation of the system based on the frank copula a threshold of 0 8 is often chosen to characterize drought conditions in multivariate drought analyses because the cumulative probability of a standardized index of 0 8 is 0 2 which was popularly adopted by previous studies hao and aghakouchak 2013 yuan et al 2016 wu et al 2018 in this present study the threshold value 0 8 means the cumulative probability of joint distribution of the odr and rsr series is 0 2 duration severity and intensity are three important drought features drought duration is the number of months when the drought index is less than a given threshold drought severity is the total deficits of the drought index which are continuously below the threshold and drought intensity is the ratio of drought severity to drought duration huang et al 2016b in order to intuitively illustrate the extent of damage to the reservoir system during drought duration drought intensity and drought duration were selected in this study 3 3 modified mann kendall mmk trend test method the mann kendall mk trend test method is a nonparametric method for trend testing which is recommended by the world meteorological organization mitchell et al 1966 however the persistence of time series has influence on mk test results hamed and rao 1998 put forward a modified mann kendall mmk trend test by considering the lag i autocorrelation to remove the persistence daufresne et al 2009 indicated the mmk test method was more robust than the mk in catching the trends of hydro meteorological series thus the mmk trend test method was utilized to capture the trends of the developed imsrri series in the uyrb for a time series x x1x2 xn the mk trend statistic s is calculated as follows 11 s i j sgn x j x i where 12 sgn x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i the variance of s is calculated as 13 var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 then the significance of the time series trend z is tested by z 14 z s var s however hamed and rao 1998 found that the evaluation of the variance of s is disturbed by the temporal autocorrelations of a time series and suggested using a nonparametric trend estimator from the original series to estimate the autocorrelation coefficients of the new series ranked by size autocorrelation coefficients ρs i at lag i which are significantly different from zero at the 5 level are then used to estimate the modified variance of s v s as follows 15 v s v a r s c o r where cor denotes a correction due to the autocorrelation in the time series which is shown as follows 16 cor 1 2 n n 1 n 2 i 1 n 1 n 1 n i 1 n i 2 ρ s i 3 4 the heuristic segmentation method traditional statistical test methods like rank sum test the sliding f test the mann kendall test and the sliding t test are frequently applied to detect change points of time series however all of these methods strongly rely on the assumption that the series is linear and smooth for nonlinear and nonstationary time series these methods are difficult in accurately identifying real change points the heuristic segmentation method proposed by pedro et al 2001 is based on the sliding t test and modified to detect change points of nonlinear and nonstationary time series in the heuristic segmentation method the time series is split into stationary segments which can overcome the disadvantages of traditional methods hence we used the heuristic segmentation method in this study to detect feasible change points of the developed annual imsrri series in uyrb a sliding pointer is moved step by step from left to right along the whole time series and the non stationary time series is divided into several stationary segments the averages of the two subseries μ1 and μ2 are computed and the difference between the mean values of the two series at a given statistical significance level is assessed by the student s t test statistic expressed as the following 17 t μ 1 μ 2 s d where 18 s d n 1 1 s 1 2 n 2 1 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 1 2 1 n 1 1 n 2 1 2 denotes the pooled variance n1 and n2 denote the number of points from the two subseries and s1 and s2 are the standard deviations of the two subseries through moving the pointer along the time series step by step the statistic t is calculated to evaluate the difference between the mean values of the two subseries the larger t is the more difference there is between averages of the two subseries the largest t is seen as a good indicator for the segmentation point then the statistical significance indicator p t max is calculated 19 p t max 1 i v t max 2 δ v δ η where η 4 19 ln n 11 54 and δ 0 40 are gained from monte carlo simulations v n 2 n is the number of the whole time series and i x a b is an incomplete beta function if the p t max 0 95 the time series will not be split conversely the time series will be divided into two subseries after the original time series is split the iteration of the above processes on each new subseries will continue until the gained significant value is smaller than the threshold or the length of the subseries is shorter than the presupposed minimum length ℓ 0 3 5 the cross wavelet transform the cross wavelet analysis developed by hudgins et al 1993 is an effective method in exploring the linkage between two associated time series it is combined with cross spectrum analysis and wavelet transform and can preferably examine the correlation between two time series in both time and frequency domains hudgins and huang 1996 torrence and compo 1998 the cross wavelet transform of the two time series x n and y n is expressed as w xy w x w y where is their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power is expressed as w xy the complex argument arg w xy can be seen as the local relative phase between x n and y n in time and frequency fields the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of the two time series with their background power spectra p k x and p k y is expressed as follows 20 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p stands for the confidence level associated with the probability p of a probability distribution function which is defined by the square root of two χ 2 distributions grinsted et al 2004 4 results 4 1 comparison of msrri and imsrri for assessing socioeconomic drought imsrri was based on the joint distribution function of odr and rsr and it contains information on these two indices the developed imsrri was applied to the case study in the uyrb the lyx reservoir is an over year reservoir in the uyrb hence the timeframe of imsrri was selected as 6 months odr rsr and imsrri series are exhibited in fig 5 a it can be seen from fig 5a that the odr and rsr indexes performed differently in trend and severity which reflected the relationship between demand and supply of downstream and reservoir conditions respectively as shown in fig 5b odr 0 meant water supply could not meet water demand of the downstream and rsr 0 signified the current reservoir system condition was below the multi year average which might reduce the ability of the reservoir to withstand socioeconomic drought mehran et al 2015 meanwhile idr wsr and msrri series are exhibited in fig 5b as observed in fig 5b msrri and imsrri showed similar drought trends but there were still big differences for better comparison the msrri and imsrri series during 1959 4 2010 4 are plotted and presented in fig 5c we selected three time periods 1969 8 1972 4 1976 11 1978 7 and 2003 4 2005 3 to detailed analyze the differences between msrri and imsrri 1 through observing the first time period in fig 5c it was clear that msrri and imsrri provided different judgments on the onset and termination of socioeconomic drought the beginning point of drought detected by msrri and imsrri was 1969 8 and 1970 3 respectively while the end point of drought detected by msrri and imsrri was 1971 9 and 1972 4 respectively analyzing the reservoir operation process during the first time period table 1 we found that both the output decreased and the outflow could not meet demand in the timeframe appearing at 1970 3 since the idr index was too sensitive to inflow the msrri began to decrease earlier than the imsrri in fact the reservoir system had the ability to resist hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought would not occur during this period however as the hydrological drought continued the reservoir resilience decreased which would cause socioeconomic drought therefore the imsrri accurately captured the onset of the socioeconomic drought after hydrological drought the reservoir system and the downstream have a recovery period and the socioeconomic drought will continue in the recovery period thus the imsrri could accurately detect the termination of socioeconomic drought water supply could meet water demand in the timeframe of 1971 11 1972 4 2 as shown in the second time period in fig 5c all the imsrri values were above the threshold but the msrri detected a severe socioeconomic drought contrasting the reservoir operation process shown in table 2 there was a hydrological drought during this period 1977 8 1978 7 which would cause the idr index to reduce but in fact the reservoir had a high water level and operated in the power generation and water supply expansion area for several months during the second time period and due to the resilience of the reservoir this hydrological drought did not cause socioeconomic drought the outputs of this period were greater than or equal to the guaranteed output and water supply could basically meet the requirements in addition regarding outflow as the demand and the timeframe of msrri is too large could also exacerbate the decrease of the idr index in this situation 3 it can be seen from fig 5c and table 3 that there was an extremely serious socioeconomic drought before the third time period and the reservoir system entered the recovery period from that period the odr index rose slightly after the recovery period and the rsr index was basically below 0 8 in the imsrri framework during the recovery period both the idr index and the wsr index rose sharply in the msrri framework however since the reservoir system was seriously damaged before the third time period limited water volume increase could satisfy water demand 2003 11 2004 3 but it could not restore the reservoir system to its normal state the reservoir system still had high vulnerability and severe socioeconomic droughts occurred along with hydrological drought 2004 6 2005 3 in the msrri framework outflow was regarded as the demand however the water level of the reservoir was below the bottom output line in the recovery period the outflow of this period was reduced and the reservoir had a large inflow in the flood season thus the idr index had a sharp increase as for the wsr index v min denoted the dead pool level during flood season 2003 7 2003 10 the reservoir water level was much higher than the dead pool level and the reservoir system was still in a state of low output and low water supply thus the wsr index could not accurately monitor the drought situation of the reservoir during the flood season in contrast the odr index could monitor the water supply condition of the downstream and it precisely and reasonably characterized the reservoir stored water during the flood season and the increase in outflow for the purpose of meeting the water demand in the water supply period in the imsrri framework v min stood for the limited outflow process line the rsr index could therefore be used to characterize the resiliency and vulnerability of the reservoir system in addition we also investigated the persistence retreat and peak of the socioeconomic drought events based on the msrri and imsrri an extreme drought during 2001 2004 fig 5c is taken as an example since the outflow was regarded as the demand and the outflow was limited to 300 m3 s when the reservoir pool level was below the limited outflow process line the idr index had a substantial increase consequently the msrri index rose above the threshold twice in this extreme drought compared with the msrri the imsrri can better characterize the persistence of drought moreover it can be seen from table 1 and fig 5c that the msrri rose sharply above the threshold in the retreat period of an extreme drought during 1969 1972 as the inflow grew for one month back to normal whilst the imsrri increased steadily in the retreat period for four months back to normal which meant that the imsrri could more accurately reflect the real recovery process of the reservoir system the peak of the drought event is an important feature of drought which can intuitively reflect its severity for slight and moderate droughts two drought events during 1963 and 1990 1991 were taken as examples fig 5c comparing the peak values of the msrri and the imsrri we found the peak values of the msrri 2 4 and 2 were lower than those of the imsrri 1 3 and 1 2 in assessing slight and moderate droughts because the outflow was regarded as the demand in the frame of the msrri when the inflow was reduced it tended to result in the decrease of the idr however the imsrri fully considered the reservoir s regulating function and the peak value could more accurately reflect the damage of the reservoir system as for extreme droughts we took two drought events during 1969 1972 and 2001 2004 as examples fig 5c on the one hand we found that both of the msrri and imsrri peaks could consistently characterize the intensity of extreme drought indicating the reliability of the two indicators in characterizing extreme droughts on the other hand we found the occurrence of the imsrri peaks lagged behind the msrri and the peak values of the imsrri were slightly lower than msrri as is known socioeconomic drought is caused by cumulative inflow loss and the larger the cumulative inflow loss the more serious the socioeconomic drought because the msrri was overly sensitive to runoff processes the peak of the msrri occurred when runoff was severely reduced in the early period of socioeconomic drought and the peak values were dominated by the inflow loss over a calculated period nevertheless the peak of the imsrri occurred when the reservoir system was destroyed most severely in the late periods of socio economic drought and the peak value was slightly lower than the msrri which indicated that the peak of the imsrri was the consequence of cumulative inflow loss thereby implying the better performance of the imsrri than the msrri in capturing the peak values of socioeconomic drought events in general the imsrri proposed in this study showed a better performance than the msrri in characterizing socioeconomic drought events in terms of their onset termination persistence peak and retreat and in reducing the misjudgment rate of socioeconomic drought furthermore it was also able to accurately characterize the socioeconomic drought in flood season therefore the imsrri had better performance in characterizing socioeconomic droughts than the msrri therefore the evolution characteristics of the socioeconomic drought in the uyrb were further studied on the basis of the imsrri in the next section 4 2 socioeconomic drought events generally hydrological drought and meteorological drought events are described by drought duration and severity huang et al 2016b however for socioeconomic drought intensity is more intuitive than severity in reflecting the extent of damage to the reservoir system therefore drought duration and intensity were selected to define socioeconomic drought events in this study the statistical results of socioeconomic drought during the 1959 4 2010 4 in the uyrb are shown in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that there were obvious differences among socioeconomic drought events there were three drought events lasting more than two years and eight drought events lasting less than three months and there were two drought events whose intensity was greater than 1 and seven drought events whose intensity was less than 0 1 in this study the socioeconomic drought events were classified in terms of drought duration and intensity the probability range of the duration and intensity of slight moderate severe and extreme drought was 0 0 5 0 5 0 75 0 75 0 90 and 0 90 1 respectively after the distribution optimization among gamma distribution generalized extreme value distribution generalized pareto distribution and index distribution the generalized extreme value distribution was applied to fit the distribution of duration and intensity the cumulative probability of duration and intensity are shown in fig 6 the ranges of the duration and intensity of different grades of drought are shown in table 5 and socioeconomic drought event grade took the larger value of the grade of duration and intensity for example if the duration and intensity grade were ⅰ and ⅱ respectively the grade of the socioeconomic drought event would belong to ⅱ which meant it was a moderate socioeconomic drought event in addition fig 7 shows the results of socioeconomic drought classification in the uyrb during 1959 4 2010 4 4 3 the trends of imsrri in the uyrb the mmk trend test method was applied to calculate the trends of monthly and annual imsrri odr and wsr in 1959 4 2010 4 in the uyrb and the results are exhibited in table 6 it can be obviously seen from table 6 that the imsrri series in the uyrb exhibited reducing trends at both monthly and annual scales specifically the imsrri series showed significantly reducing trends in march may july october and november meanwhile other months showed non significantly reducing trends it should be noted that the annual series of the imsrri and odr within 1959 4 2009 4 in the uyrb had significantly reducing trends and the rsr had a non significantly reducing trend which were consistent with the findings of she et al 2012 and wang and zhai 2003 on the drought in the uyrb additionally the trend test results of odr and rsr indicated that the evolution trend of imsrri was influenced by the trend of both odr and rsr and the influence of the odr was greater than that of the rsr 4 4 identification of change points in annual imsrri series it is important to identify change points in the imsrri series which are a key component in drought characteristics helping to determine whether the drought mechanism has changed the heuristic segmentation method was utilized to identify the change points of the annual imsrri series within 1959 2009 in the uyrb the threshold p0 was selected as 0 95 and ℓ 0 was chosen as 25 in this study pedro et al 2001 the results of detected change points are shown in fig 8 it was obvious that two change points 1995 and 1975 were detected because probabilities of their largest t were larger than the threshold p0 therefore the annual imsrri series in the uyrb had changed greatly and the stationarity of the annual imsrri series was invalid 4 5 the links between imsrri and climate indices and their evolutions it is important to reveal the correlations between the imsrri and climate indices which help us to further understand the response of socioeconomic drought and the reservoir system to climate variation therefore cross wavelet analysis was adopted to investigate the correlations between monthly imsrri and monthly ao enso pdo and sunspots covering 1959 4 2010 4 in the uyrb the cross wavelet transforms between monthly imsrri and climate indices are illustrated in figs 9 12 in the four figures the color bar meant the energy density the 95 confidence level against red noise is shown as a thick contour and arrows denoted the relative phase relationship with anti phase pointing left and in phase pointing right it can obviously be observed from fig 9 that the strong interaction between ao events and the imsrri occurred in the period of 30 60 months in 1963 1970 1968 1977 and 1985 1994 and the period of 70 110 months in 1970 1988 in the period of 30 60 months ao and imsrri had positive phase relationships in 1963 1970 and 1985 1994 and negative phase linkages in 1968 1977 in the period of 70 110 months ao and imsrri showed positive phase correlations in 1970 1988 it could be clearly observed from fig 10 that enso events showed stronger impacts than ao events on monthly imsrri series in the uyrb huang et al 2016a fig 10 indicated that the strong interaction between enso events and the imsrri took place in the period of 22 64 months which was consistent with enso periodicity of 2 7 years dash et al 2013 huang et al 2016b enso events and the imsrri had positive phase relationships in 1968 1977 and 1984 1993 and negative phase linkages in 1962 1967 1982 1985 and 1990 2001 meanwhile these results corresponded to the two change points 1995 and 1975 tested in section 4 4 of this paper conversely pdo events exhibited a weak influence on the imsrri series in the uyrb fig 11 in addition on the long period 10 11 years as fig 12 shows sunspots have the strongest correlation with imsrri which is consistent with sunspot periodicity of 11 years hathaway et al 2002 sunspots and the imsrri have significant negative phase linkages in 1970 1989 which proved the result of the second iteration 1975 in section 4 4 these findings implied that the change points in the imsrri series in the uyrb were related to climate variation in conclusion ao and enso had obvious influence on socioeconomic drought evolution on the short period in the uyrb on the long period the evolution of socioeconomic drought was mainly influenced by sunspots in the uyrb which was consistent with the findings of zhao and huang 2004 therefore these climate factors could be used to monitor and warn of future socioeconomic droughts in the uyrb 5 discussions 5 1 differences in trend and change points between msrri and imsrri to further distinguish the strength and weaknesses of both the imsrri and msrri we also did a trend test on the msrri idr and wsr series and the results are shown in table 7 being different from the imsrri odr and rsr the msrri idr and wsr showed non significantly decreasing trends at both monthly and annual scales both the odr and idr were constructed by the top down methodology but mmk statistics of the idr were much smaller than the odr table 6 primarily because the outflow was regarded as the demand in the idr frame which led to a rapid rise in the idr during the drought period and a rapid decrease in the idr when a sudden reduction happened in inflow therefore the msrri series could not truly reflect the evolution trend of the socioeconomic drought in the uyrb conversely the imsrri accurately represented the operation process of the reservoir system under the changing environment therefore the trend test results of the imsrri were more reliable than the msrri as mentioned in section 4 4 the imsrri had two change points 1995 and 1975 in this section the heuristic segmentation method was also applied to identify the change points in the annual msrri series within 1959 2009 in the uyrb and the results of fig 13 indicated that there was no change point detected p p0 in order to explore the reasons why the change point identification of the msrri were different from the imsrri we conducted change point identification on the annual idr wsr odr and rsr for the imsrri the odr had two change points 1990 and 1975 and the rsr also had two change points 1995 and 1975 these results were consistent with the results of change point identification of the imsrri for the msrri the wsr had two change points 1995 and 1980 but the idr had no change point detected then we did the correlation analysis between the idr and odr as well as between the wsr and rsr which were constructed by the top down methodology and the bottom up methodology respectively the correlation coefficient between the idr and odr was 0 12 while the correlation coefficient between the wsr and rsr was 0 92 the correlation between the idr and odr was much lower than the correlation between the wsr and rsr hence the idr was the main reason for the differences of temporal variation characteristics between the msrri and imsrri because the outflow was regarded as the demand in the msrri framework the idr instead increased during extreme drought periods and the idr could not characterize the non stationary nature of the relationship between the supply and the demand therefore compared with the msrri the imsrri could more accurately characterize the evolution of socioeconomic drought 5 2 impact of the imsrri on lyx reservoir operation rules through investigating the evolution characteristics of the imsrri we found some socioeconomic droughts were caused by the reservoir operation rules in 1991 and 1994 the rsr index was high which meant the reservoir had sufficient water but the odr was lower than the threshold value when the reservoir pool level rose to the vicinity of the upper output line but was lower than the upper output line the hydropower station operated according to the guaranteed output as the water level rose the outflow decreased and the odr index declined therefore to fully exert the reservoir regulation capacity and reduce the occurrence of socioeconomic drought we suggest drawing a water supply guarantee line on the operation chart and generating a water supply guarantee zone the output of the reservoir will increase according to the demand when the pool level is located in the water supply guarantee zone additionally we have concluded that the imsrri has declined significantly over the past 50 years in sections 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 which means the uyrb has become drier and drier in the past 50 years under the changing environment as a response to this change we suggest that the reservoir adopt the principle of determining electricity by water demand rather than determining it by guaranteed output if the reservoir discharges according to the guaranteed output when the reservoir is running at low pool levels the outflow is much more than the demand when the pool level rises back to the normal the reservoir system will discharge according to the guaranteed output 5 3 sensitivity analysis of the threshold to further explore the rationality of the threshold selection we also selected the threshold of 0 5 and 1 as comparison and the results are shown in table 8 when the threshold 0 5 there were 25 drought events captured but it was obvious that there were some drought events integrated into one drought event duration was 130 8 months and the attenuation phenomenon occurred on the intensity value intensity was 0 99 this meant that the drought event characteristics could not be accurately characterized when 0 5 was chosen as the threshold it also could be observed that some slight drought events could not be monitored especially those caused by the reservoir operation rules 1991 and 1994 when the threshold 1 therefore the selection of threshold was very important to identify drought events generally the threshold of 0 8 denoting that the cumulative probability of the joint distribution of the rsr and odr was 0 2 was reliable in capturing the socioeconomic drought events compared with the threshold of 0 5 and 1 5 4 physics linkages between the imsrri and climatic indices as is known the walker circulation has an important influence on precipitation in arid regions of china the weakened walker circulation would cause less precipitation and drought in northern china paul and robert 1978 reginald and yong 1996 and the variation of the walker circulation is related to various factors vecchi 2007 lau and yang 2015 enso was taken as an example enso events can dramatically weaken the intensity of the walker circulation philander 1990 tobias et al 2014 and further affect precipitation in northern china in addition previous studies indicated that enso events are increasing in both frequency and intensity under the global warming meehl et al 2007 jin 1997 cai et al 2014 tong et al 2010 power et al 2013 which indicated that the results of change point detection of the imsrri had a good correspondence with the variations of climatic indices moreover these results were also consistent with the significantly decreasing trend of the imsrri series in the uyrb 6 conclusions socioeconomic drought is the least studied among the four different drought types most existing drought indexes ignore the importance of local reservoirs in coping with climatic extremes in this study based on the top down and bottom up concepts of msrri and the characteristics of reservoir operation we have improved msrri through combining reservoir operation processes and actual water supply and demand which is on the basis of the joint distribution function of outflow demand reliability odr indicator and reservoir system resilience rsr indicator the developed msrri and imsrri were applied in the uyrb with the reservoir scheduling process as a comparison results indicated that imsrri could identify the onset termination persistence peak and retreat period of socioeconomic drought more accurately and reasonably than msrri and in terms of obviously reducing the misjudgment rate of socioeconomic drought additionally it was also able to precisely characterize the socioeconomic drought in flood season furthermore the socioeconomic droughts events were frequent in the uyrb and the socioeconomic droughts were relatively serious the imsrri series in the uyrb showed a significantly decreasing trend in addition there were two change points 1995 and 1975 in annual imsrri series during 1959 2010 in the uyrb the cross wavelet analysis was adopted to explore the correlations between monthly imsrri series and climatic factors in the uyrb which help to reveal the causes of changes in socioeconomic drought in the uyrb results indicated that ao and enso had obvious effect on socioeconomic drought evolution on the short period in the uyrb and the influences of enso were stronger than ao sunspots showed the most significant impacts on the socioeconomic drought evolution on the long period in the uyrb generally the findings in this study further facilitate the development of the socioeconomic drought index and help to reveal the socioeconomic drought evolution characteristics in the uyrb which is helpful for local socioeconomic drought mitigation and water resources management in this present study we fully revealed the evolution characteristics of socioeconomic drought during the 1959 2010 in the uyrb however the evolution of future socioeconomic drought is also important for water resources management therefore the forecast of evolution of future socioeconomic drought and how the reservoir systems respond to the future socioeconomic drought will be the focus of our future research acknowledgements

6856,among the four types of drought socioeconomic drought which has a direct impact on human production and daily life is the least understood the current socioeconomic drought index proposed by mehran et al 2015 is the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri which combines information on inflow demand reliability and water storage resilience the msrri resolves the problem of difficult quantification of socioeconomic drought however the msrri also has some flaws such as ignoring reservoir dispatching regulations and the relationship between water supply and water demand therefore this study aims to improve the msrri through combining reservoir operation processes and actual water supply and demand and proposing an improved msrri imsrri the upper yellow river basin uyrb was selected as a case study and comparison between the msrri and imsrri was conducted the evolution characteristics of the imsrri series in the uyrb were examined additionally cross wavelet analysis was utilized to reveal the associations between the imsrri series and climate factors results indicated that 1 compared with the msrri the imsrri could capture the onset and termination of socioeconomic drought more accurately and reasonably due to the fusion of reservoir scheduling characteristics at a smaller timescale 2 the socioeconomic drought in the uyrb had dramatically changed during the past few decades the imsrri series showed a significantly decreasing trend and two change points 1995 and 1975 were captured and 3 the el niño southern oscillation enso and the atlantic oscillation ao showed significant influences on the short period the influences of enso were stronger than ao while sunspots had the strongest impacts on the long period keywords socioeconomic drought reservoir system limited outflow process line climate factors the upper yellow river basin 1 introduction drought is a complex and periodic natural hazard which may have serious destructive effects on agriculture industry ecological environment and residents live gan et al 2016 cammalleri et al 2017 generally droughts can be classified into four types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic wilhite and glantz 1985 wilhite 2000 american meteorological society 1997 world meteorological organization 2006 meteorological drought is often associated with the shortage of precipitation over a region for a period of time agricultural drought is usually measured by soil moisture deficit hydrological drought is related to dry periods of surface or subsurface hydrology and water resources and socioeconomic drought refers to whether the water supply can meet the demand of various water use sectors and their economic benefits wilhite and glantz 1985 american meteorological society 2004 zseleczky and yosef 2014 with population growth the rapid development of industry and the expansion of urbanization the demand for water has increased dramatically and there have been water scarcities in varying degrees in many regions of the world mishra and singh 2010 mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016a furthermore in the context of global climate variation extreme events such as floods and droughts are frequent willems 2000 kunkel 2003 roy and balling 2004 beniston and stephenson 2004 leng et al 2015 liu et al 2019 therefore it is especially necessary to investigate the risk and evolution characteristics of drought in recent years there have been many previous studies focusing on drought risk and evolution characteristics that have obtained some significant findings which are helpful for disaster prevention and reduction and allocation of water resources however these previous studies mainly aimed at meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought li et al 2013 xu et al 2014 huang et al 2014a 2014b 2015 wanders and wada 2015 van loon and laaha 2015 serinaldi 2016 lin et al 2017 wu et al 2017 fang et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge until now there have only been a few studies concentrating on socioeconomic drought mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016a shi et al 2017 due to the rapid development of industry and urbanization the water supply cannot meet the water demand of water use sectors socioeconomic drought becomes an extremely serious issue in many areas of the world sivapalan 2015 mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016a hence to better guide the allocation and utilization of water resources it is very necessary to construct socioeconomic drought evaluation indexes and investigate the evolution characteristics of socioeconomic drought as large man made water conservancy structures reservoirs have the function of redistributing runoff in temporal and spatial scales shiklomanov et al 2000 a reservoir can be seen as a system which can provide resilience to withstand extreme events such as floods and droughts and the storage and discharge of reservoirs determines the balance of water supply and water demand downstream therefore the reservoir system can be used to evaluate socioeconomic drought currently frequent distinctions in vulnerability and drought assessment research emerge from the top down and bottom up methodologies dessai and hulme 2004 mehran et al 2015 a top down approach comes from climate variability impact assessments and focuses on different climate conditions that cannot be primitively controlled or changed by decision makers a bottom up methodology pays attention to the capacity of people and governments response under climate extremes such as water conservation and reuse as ways to deal with water stress integrating the concepts and theories of top down and bottom up methodologies and establishing a comprehensive assessment system is a good way to assess a complex man made system socioeconomic droughts are likely to occur more frequently around the world in the future chen et al 2016 smirnov et al 2016 trinh et al 2017 for this type of drought mehran et al 2015 utilized the ideology of top down and bottom up methodology proposed the multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index msrri which is based on the inflow demand reliability index idr and the water storage resilience index wsr for assessing water stress and socioeconomic droughts and combined the two indexes through a non parametric multivariate statistical approach this methodology dealt with the problem of difficult quantification of socioeconomic drought for the first time huang et al 2016a applied the msrri to investigate the evolution characteristics of socioeconomic droughts in the heihe river basin in china and shi et al 2017 proposed the socioeconomic drought index sedi through integrating water shortage and drought duration and utilized it to characterize socioeconomic drought in the east river basin these studies provided new insight into the development of the socioeconomic drought index however in the idr index framework the outflow of a reservoir was regarded as the demand but the outflow cannot accurately represent the demand especially during the drought period when the outflow is small the demand is large and the outflow is much less than the actual demand therefore the msrri cannot reasonably reflect the real relationship between water supply and water demand in practice additionally the msrri cannot accurately characterize socioeconomic drought during the flood season as for the sedi it ignores the influence of reservoir water storage on future socioeconomic drought to better assess the operation process and the potential to cope with socioeconomic drought in the reservoir system we proposed an improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri based on the framework of the msrri and operational characteristics of the reservoir system in this present study in order to accurately and reasonably reflect the water supply and water demand relationship in the downstream of the reservoir and reduce the susceptibility of msrri to inflow the outflow demand reliability odr indicator was proposed in this present study additionally the reservoir system resilience rsr indicator was proposed by combining the concept of the limited outflow process line in the reservoir operation chart into the bottom up frame furthermore the imsrri reduced the time scale of the frame of msrri to prevent appearance of attenuation therefore the index can in theory more precisely reveal the onset and termination of socioeconomic droughts climate variation has been one of the major elements that exert great influence on drought even a diminutive variation in climate can lead to a drastic change in the hydrological cycle thereby causing more frequent hydrological hazards hanson and weltzin 2000 hirabayashi et al 2008 ahn et al 2016 linares et al 2017 tietjen et al 2017 huang et al 2014c much research has confirmed that drought events are strongly linked to climate indices stahl and demuth 1999 revealed that the hydrological drought in southern germany was closely linked to anti cyclonic atmospheric circulation patterns and severe high pressure huang et al 2016b disclosed that the arctic oscillation ao and the el niño southern oscillation enso play an important role in hydrological drought in the columbia river basin huang et al 2017 found that the arctic oscillation ao and the el niño southern oscillation enso have a strong link with the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought in the wei river basin asong et al 2018 found droughts in a typically cold region to be associated with large scale climate signals however as we know previous studies concerning socioeconomic drought and climate indices are rare to better forecast regional socioeconomic drought conditions and effectively guide local drought relief and management this present study investigates the linkages between socioeconomic droughts and the enso ao pdo pacific decadal oscillation sunspot being the second largest river basin in china the contradiction between water supply and water demand in the upper yellow river basin uyrb is comparatively more severe because of the combined influence of climate variation and human activities bai et al 2015 meanwhile the uyrb lies in arid and semi arid regions and plays a distinctly important role in water resource planning and management in northwestern china thus the present study selected the uyrb as a case study the main purposes of this study are 1 to propose an improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri for assessing socioeconomic drought and verify its practicability and reliability in the uyrb through analyzing the onset termination persistence peak and retreat of socioeconomic drought and contrasting the reservoir operation process 2 to fully reveal the evolution characteristics of socioeconomic drought including trend analysis and change point diagnosis and define the socioeconomic drought events in the uyrb and 3 to explore the effect of climate factors on socioeconomic droughts in the uyrb 2 study area and data the yellow river is the fifth largest river in the world and the uyrb is located in the interior of the eurasian continent and belongs to arid and semi arid regions its drainage area is 386000 km2 accounting for 51 3 of the total area of the yellow river basin and it yields 54 of the total runoff of the yellow river the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources in northwest china is uneven in this area and the contradiction between water supply and water demand is prominent as the most important water source in northwest china the upper yellow river plays a significant role in the socioeconomics of northwest china bai et al 2015 fang et al 2017 longyang gorge lyx reservoir is the first large water control project in the uyrb and has 24 7 billion m3 of total storage and 19 4 billion m3 of regulating storage with 1280 mw installed capacity and 590 mw guaranteed output fig 1 as a multi year reservoir the lyx reservoir plays a leading role in the water resources management and cascade scheduling system and undertakes water supply hydroelectric power generation irrigation ice prevention and ecological tasks in this study the monthly inflow datasets of the lyx reservoir during 1959 4 2010 4 hydrological year were collected from the northwest china grid company limited the optimized operation chart of the lyx reservoir fig 2 was utilized to establish a reservoir simulation scheduling model and the constraints of the model included 1 water balance 2 pool level 3 discharge and 4 hydropower station output constraints in the reservoir simulation scheduling model the optimized operation chart provided the operation rules which meant that the output of the hydropower station was determined by the water level of the reservoir to delineate the uyrb the aster dem dataset with 30 m spatial resolution was used fig 1 additionally the monthly ao nino 3 4 pdo sunspot index time series spanning 1959 4 2010 4 was collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa earth system research laboratory http www esrl noaa gov 3 methodology 3 1 an improved multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index for characterizing socioeconomic drought generally over year and within year reservoirs are two major types of reservoir systems vogel and bolognese 1995 the within year systems can redistribute the runoff over a period of one year and as a result these systems are very susceptible to seasonal variations the over year systems can redistribute the runoff over a period of several years and these systems therefore are able to defend against longer term drought in a previous study msrri was used to assess socioeconomic drought mehran et al 2015 this indicator relied on two individual indexes the inflow demand reliability idr index and water storage resilience wsr index which correspond to the top down and bottom up methodology respectively the idr and wsr indicators are shown as follows mehran et al 2015 huang et al 2016a 1 α t i t m 1 t q i n t q es t t q es t t q es t t i t 12 t 13 m q out i if m 6 i t m 1 t q out i if m 12 2 β t s t t v i n t v ou t t v min v es t t v es t t where α t is an unstandardized idr indicator β t denotes an unstandardized wsr indicator q i n t represents the monthly inflow to the reservoir i is the sample size which ranges from month 1 to n q ou t t is the monthly outflow from the reservoir q es t t stands for the total estimated water demand in projected timeframe and time step t ranges from month 13 to n t 13 n here the first 6 or 12 months of the date are used for assessing the demand in the projected timeframe therefore the index can only be evaluated starting from the second year of the data t 13 n m denotes the selected timeframe in months 6 months for within year reservoir systems and 12 for multi year reservoir systems s t t represents the reservoir storage at month t where t 13 n v ou t t stands for the monthly outflow volume from the reservoir v i n t denotes the monthly inflow volume from the reservoir v min denotes reservoir storage corresponding to the dead pool level and v es t t denotes the total estimated demand volume in the projected timeframe however outflow is treated as water demand in the frame of msrri which cannot reflect the real relationship between water supply and water demand thus we not only treat outflow as water supply but also combine it with the demand of the downstream thereby proposing the outflow demand reliability odr index however in practice the attenuation phenomenon was found due to the large timescale and in terms of the operation period of the reservoir systems the temporal scales were too large to characterize the development process of socioeconomic drought to cope with this problem the temporal scales of the frame are reduced in the present study to 3 months for the within year reservoir and 6 months for the multi year reservoir the odr indicator is shown as follows 3 α t i t m 1 t q ou t t q es t t q es t t q es t t i t 6 t 7 m q dem i if m 3 i t m 1 t q dem i if m 6 where α t is the unstandardized odr indicator m denotes the selected timeframe in months 3 months for within year and 6 for multi year systems q de m t represents the monthly water demand of the reservoir s downstream and the demand is calculated as follows 4 q de m t q la n t i 1 n q rd i t q r c t δ q l where q la n t denotes the demand of lanzhou section q rd i t represents the demand of the i region q r c t stands for the interval watershed concentration δ q is the unit of river course loss and l denotes the length of the river between the lyx reservoir and the lanzhou section furthermore figs 3 and 4 clearly illustrate the basic characteristics of inflow and demand it is obvious that annual distribution of inflow is uneven and there are many extreme values conversely the demand of the lyx reservoir is stabilized these findings are consistent with the practical situation the odr indicator corresponded to the top down methodology where the outflow was assessed relative to the water demand of the downstream hence this indicator indicates whether the outflow from the system is enough to satisfy the water demand of the downstream regardless of the storage in the reservoir the water storage resilience wsr indicator is constructed by bottom up methodology which is defined on the basis of monthly storage monthly inflow monthly outflow and total demand during the timeframe and indicates the status of a reservoir system to withstand socioeconomic drought during the operation process in the present study to precisely characterize the ability of reservoirs for coping with socioeconomic drought especially in the flood season introducing the limited outflow process line from the optimized operation chart fig 2 in this framework we propose the reservoir system resilience rsr indicator 5 β t s t t v i n t v ou t t v min v es t t v es t t where β t denotes the unstandardized rsr indicator and it is noted that v min stands for reservoir storage corresponding to the limited outflow process line copulas are functions that can be used to calculate the joint distribution of two variables regardless of their original marginal distributions kao and govindaraju 2010 hao and aghakouchak 2013 assuming the outflow demand reliability index and reservoir system resilience index as random variables x and y respectively the distribution with the cumulative joint probability p can be expressed with a copula as 6 p x x y y c f x g y p where c is the copula and f x and g y denote the marginal cumulative distribution functions of random variables x and y the copula c has the flexibility to construct the joint distribution of random variables on the basis of their marginal distributions copulas have been widely used in hydrological and climatological studies in modeling dependence structures of nonlinear multivariate data the copula family has various types and archimedean copulas were utilized due to their simple structure and strong representativeness gumbel copulas clayton copulas and frank copulas gumbel and clayton copulas exert asymmetric dependence structures and are only applicable to positively related sequences while the frank copula offers a symmetric dependence structure which can be applied to both positive and negative correlations and without limitation to the degree of correlation nelsen 2006 meanwhile the frank copula has been widely used in drought research hao and aghakouchak 2013 rajsekhar and singh 2015 salvadori 2010 therefore we selected the frank copula to structure the joint distribution of the odr and rsr the frank copula is expressed as 7 c u v 1 θ ln 1 e θ u 1 e θ v 1 e θ u 1 where u and v are the marginal cumulative probabilities of the odr and rsr respectively and θ is the parameter which can be estimated from kendall s rank correlation τ 8 τ 1 4 d θ 1 θ where d θ is expressed as 9 d θ 1 θ 0 θ t exp t 1 d t where t represents the integration variable from the cumulative joint probability p shown in eq 3 the improve multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index imsrri can be defined as 10 imsrri ϕ 1 p where ϕ represents the standard normal distribution function imsrri is not only a hybrid index including two fundamentally different indicators but it also covers both common methodologies in vulnerability studies top down and bottom up because imsrri assesses the supply and storage relative to the demand it can be regarded as a measure of socioeconomic drought different from the msrri imsrri reduces the sensitivity of inflow and increases the response to the operation process and the relationship between water supply and water demand of the downstream 3 2 identification of socioeconomic drought event once the socioeconomic drought index is calculated some standard should be applied to characterize the socioeconomic drought event the imsrri is similar to other standardized drought indices and positive values indicate that a reservoir system s status can guarantee the water demand while negative values mean reliability and resilience of the reservoir system have decreased to some extent however because of the resiliency of the reservoir system some negative values do not affect the operation of the system based on the frank copula a threshold of 0 8 is often chosen to characterize drought conditions in multivariate drought analyses because the cumulative probability of a standardized index of 0 8 is 0 2 which was popularly adopted by previous studies hao and aghakouchak 2013 yuan et al 2016 wu et al 2018 in this present study the threshold value 0 8 means the cumulative probability of joint distribution of the odr and rsr series is 0 2 duration severity and intensity are three important drought features drought duration is the number of months when the drought index is less than a given threshold drought severity is the total deficits of the drought index which are continuously below the threshold and drought intensity is the ratio of drought severity to drought duration huang et al 2016b in order to intuitively illustrate the extent of damage to the reservoir system during drought duration drought intensity and drought duration were selected in this study 3 3 modified mann kendall mmk trend test method the mann kendall mk trend test method is a nonparametric method for trend testing which is recommended by the world meteorological organization mitchell et al 1966 however the persistence of time series has influence on mk test results hamed and rao 1998 put forward a modified mann kendall mmk trend test by considering the lag i autocorrelation to remove the persistence daufresne et al 2009 indicated the mmk test method was more robust than the mk in catching the trends of hydro meteorological series thus the mmk trend test method was utilized to capture the trends of the developed imsrri series in the uyrb for a time series x x1x2 xn the mk trend statistic s is calculated as follows 11 s i j sgn x j x i where 12 sgn x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i the variance of s is calculated as 13 var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 then the significance of the time series trend z is tested by z 14 z s var s however hamed and rao 1998 found that the evaluation of the variance of s is disturbed by the temporal autocorrelations of a time series and suggested using a nonparametric trend estimator from the original series to estimate the autocorrelation coefficients of the new series ranked by size autocorrelation coefficients ρs i at lag i which are significantly different from zero at the 5 level are then used to estimate the modified variance of s v s as follows 15 v s v a r s c o r where cor denotes a correction due to the autocorrelation in the time series which is shown as follows 16 cor 1 2 n n 1 n 2 i 1 n 1 n 1 n i 1 n i 2 ρ s i 3 4 the heuristic segmentation method traditional statistical test methods like rank sum test the sliding f test the mann kendall test and the sliding t test are frequently applied to detect change points of time series however all of these methods strongly rely on the assumption that the series is linear and smooth for nonlinear and nonstationary time series these methods are difficult in accurately identifying real change points the heuristic segmentation method proposed by pedro et al 2001 is based on the sliding t test and modified to detect change points of nonlinear and nonstationary time series in the heuristic segmentation method the time series is split into stationary segments which can overcome the disadvantages of traditional methods hence we used the heuristic segmentation method in this study to detect feasible change points of the developed annual imsrri series in uyrb a sliding pointer is moved step by step from left to right along the whole time series and the non stationary time series is divided into several stationary segments the averages of the two subseries μ1 and μ2 are computed and the difference between the mean values of the two series at a given statistical significance level is assessed by the student s t test statistic expressed as the following 17 t μ 1 μ 2 s d where 18 s d n 1 1 s 1 2 n 2 1 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 1 2 1 n 1 1 n 2 1 2 denotes the pooled variance n1 and n2 denote the number of points from the two subseries and s1 and s2 are the standard deviations of the two subseries through moving the pointer along the time series step by step the statistic t is calculated to evaluate the difference between the mean values of the two subseries the larger t is the more difference there is between averages of the two subseries the largest t is seen as a good indicator for the segmentation point then the statistical significance indicator p t max is calculated 19 p t max 1 i v t max 2 δ v δ η where η 4 19 ln n 11 54 and δ 0 40 are gained from monte carlo simulations v n 2 n is the number of the whole time series and i x a b is an incomplete beta function if the p t max 0 95 the time series will not be split conversely the time series will be divided into two subseries after the original time series is split the iteration of the above processes on each new subseries will continue until the gained significant value is smaller than the threshold or the length of the subseries is shorter than the presupposed minimum length ℓ 0 3 5 the cross wavelet transform the cross wavelet analysis developed by hudgins et al 1993 is an effective method in exploring the linkage between two associated time series it is combined with cross spectrum analysis and wavelet transform and can preferably examine the correlation between two time series in both time and frequency domains hudgins and huang 1996 torrence and compo 1998 the cross wavelet transform of the two time series x n and y n is expressed as w xy w x w y where is their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power is expressed as w xy the complex argument arg w xy can be seen as the local relative phase between x n and y n in time and frequency fields the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of the two time series with their background power spectra p k x and p k y is expressed as follows 20 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p stands for the confidence level associated with the probability p of a probability distribution function which is defined by the square root of two χ 2 distributions grinsted et al 2004 4 results 4 1 comparison of msrri and imsrri for assessing socioeconomic drought imsrri was based on the joint distribution function of odr and rsr and it contains information on these two indices the developed imsrri was applied to the case study in the uyrb the lyx reservoir is an over year reservoir in the uyrb hence the timeframe of imsrri was selected as 6 months odr rsr and imsrri series are exhibited in fig 5 a it can be seen from fig 5a that the odr and rsr indexes performed differently in trend and severity which reflected the relationship between demand and supply of downstream and reservoir conditions respectively as shown in fig 5b odr 0 meant water supply could not meet water demand of the downstream and rsr 0 signified the current reservoir system condition was below the multi year average which might reduce the ability of the reservoir to withstand socioeconomic drought mehran et al 2015 meanwhile idr wsr and msrri series are exhibited in fig 5b as observed in fig 5b msrri and imsrri showed similar drought trends but there were still big differences for better comparison the msrri and imsrri series during 1959 4 2010 4 are plotted and presented in fig 5c we selected three time periods 1969 8 1972 4 1976 11 1978 7 and 2003 4 2005 3 to detailed analyze the differences between msrri and imsrri 1 through observing the first time period in fig 5c it was clear that msrri and imsrri provided different judgments on the onset and termination of socioeconomic drought the beginning point of drought detected by msrri and imsrri was 1969 8 and 1970 3 respectively while the end point of drought detected by msrri and imsrri was 1971 9 and 1972 4 respectively analyzing the reservoir operation process during the first time period table 1 we found that both the output decreased and the outflow could not meet demand in the timeframe appearing at 1970 3 since the idr index was too sensitive to inflow the msrri began to decrease earlier than the imsrri in fact the reservoir system had the ability to resist hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought would not occur during this period however as the hydrological drought continued the reservoir resilience decreased which would cause socioeconomic drought therefore the imsrri accurately captured the onset of the socioeconomic drought after hydrological drought the reservoir system and the downstream have a recovery period and the socioeconomic drought will continue in the recovery period thus the imsrri could accurately detect the termination of socioeconomic drought water supply could meet water demand in the timeframe of 1971 11 1972 4 2 as shown in the second time period in fig 5c all the imsrri values were above the threshold but the msrri detected a severe socioeconomic drought contrasting the reservoir operation process shown in table 2 there was a hydrological drought during this period 1977 8 1978 7 which would cause the idr index to reduce but in fact the reservoir had a high water level and operated in the power generation and water supply expansion area for several months during the second time period and due to the resilience of the reservoir this hydrological drought did not cause socioeconomic drought the outputs of this period were greater than or equal to the guaranteed output and water supply could basically meet the requirements in addition regarding outflow as the demand and the timeframe of msrri is too large could also exacerbate the decrease of the idr index in this situation 3 it can be seen from fig 5c and table 3 that there was an extremely serious socioeconomic drought before the third time period and the reservoir system entered the recovery period from that period the odr index rose slightly after the recovery period and the rsr index was basically below 0 8 in the imsrri framework during the recovery period both the idr index and the wsr index rose sharply in the msrri framework however since the reservoir system was seriously damaged before the third time period limited water volume increase could satisfy water demand 2003 11 2004 3 but it could not restore the reservoir system to its normal state the reservoir system still had high vulnerability and severe socioeconomic droughts occurred along with hydrological drought 2004 6 2005 3 in the msrri framework outflow was regarded as the demand however the water level of the reservoir was below the bottom output line in the recovery period the outflow of this period was reduced and the reservoir had a large inflow in the flood season thus the idr index had a sharp increase as for the wsr index v min denoted the dead pool level during flood season 2003 7 2003 10 the reservoir water level was much higher than the dead pool level and the reservoir system was still in a state of low output and low water supply thus the wsr index could not accurately monitor the drought situation of the reservoir during the flood season in contrast the odr index could monitor the water supply condition of the downstream and it precisely and reasonably characterized the reservoir stored water during the flood season and the increase in outflow for the purpose of meeting the water demand in the water supply period in the imsrri framework v min stood for the limited outflow process line the rsr index could therefore be used to characterize the resiliency and vulnerability of the reservoir system in addition we also investigated the persistence retreat and peak of the socioeconomic drought events based on the msrri and imsrri an extreme drought during 2001 2004 fig 5c is taken as an example since the outflow was regarded as the demand and the outflow was limited to 300 m3 s when the reservoir pool level was below the limited outflow process line the idr index had a substantial increase consequently the msrri index rose above the threshold twice in this extreme drought compared with the msrri the imsrri can better characterize the persistence of drought moreover it can be seen from table 1 and fig 5c that the msrri rose sharply above the threshold in the retreat period of an extreme drought during 1969 1972 as the inflow grew for one month back to normal whilst the imsrri increased steadily in the retreat period for four months back to normal which meant that the imsrri could more accurately reflect the real recovery process of the reservoir system the peak of the drought event is an important feature of drought which can intuitively reflect its severity for slight and moderate droughts two drought events during 1963 and 1990 1991 were taken as examples fig 5c comparing the peak values of the msrri and the imsrri we found the peak values of the msrri 2 4 and 2 were lower than those of the imsrri 1 3 and 1 2 in assessing slight and moderate droughts because the outflow was regarded as the demand in the frame of the msrri when the inflow was reduced it tended to result in the decrease of the idr however the imsrri fully considered the reservoir s regulating function and the peak value could more accurately reflect the damage of the reservoir system as for extreme droughts we took two drought events during 1969 1972 and 2001 2004 as examples fig 5c on the one hand we found that both of the msrri and imsrri peaks could consistently characterize the intensity of extreme drought indicating the reliability of the two indicators in characterizing extreme droughts on the other hand we found the occurrence of the imsrri peaks lagged behind the msrri and the peak values of the imsrri were slightly lower than msrri as is known socioeconomic drought is caused by cumulative inflow loss and the larger the cumulative inflow loss the more serious the socioeconomic drought because the msrri was overly sensitive to runoff processes the peak of the msrri occurred when runoff was severely reduced in the early period of socioeconomic drought and the peak values were dominated by the inflow loss over a calculated period nevertheless the peak of the imsrri occurred when the reservoir system was destroyed most severely in the late periods of socio economic drought and the peak value was slightly lower than the msrri which indicated that the peak of the imsrri was the consequence of cumulative inflow loss thereby implying the better performance of the imsrri than the msrri in capturing the peak values of socioeconomic drought events in general the imsrri proposed in this study showed a better performance than the msrri in characterizing socioeconomic drought events in terms of their onset termination persistence peak and retreat and in reducing the misjudgment rate of socioeconomic drought furthermore it was also able to accurately characterize the socioeconomic drought in flood season therefore the imsrri had better performance in characterizing socioeconomic droughts than the msrri therefore the evolution characteristics of the socioeconomic drought in the uyrb were further studied on the basis of the imsrri in the next section 4 2 socioeconomic drought events generally hydrological drought and meteorological drought events are described by drought duration and severity huang et al 2016b however for socioeconomic drought intensity is more intuitive than severity in reflecting the extent of damage to the reservoir system therefore drought duration and intensity were selected to define socioeconomic drought events in this study the statistical results of socioeconomic drought during the 1959 4 2010 4 in the uyrb are shown in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that there were obvious differences among socioeconomic drought events there were three drought events lasting more than two years and eight drought events lasting less than three months and there were two drought events whose intensity was greater than 1 and seven drought events whose intensity was less than 0 1 in this study the socioeconomic drought events were classified in terms of drought duration and intensity the probability range of the duration and intensity of slight moderate severe and extreme drought was 0 0 5 0 5 0 75 0 75 0 90 and 0 90 1 respectively after the distribution optimization among gamma distribution generalized extreme value distribution generalized pareto distribution and index distribution the generalized extreme value distribution was applied to fit the distribution of duration and intensity the cumulative probability of duration and intensity are shown in fig 6 the ranges of the duration and intensity of different grades of drought are shown in table 5 and socioeconomic drought event grade took the larger value of the grade of duration and intensity for example if the duration and intensity grade were ⅰ and ⅱ respectively the grade of the socioeconomic drought event would belong to ⅱ which meant it was a moderate socioeconomic drought event in addition fig 7 shows the results of socioeconomic drought classification in the uyrb during 1959 4 2010 4 4 3 the trends of imsrri in the uyrb the mmk trend test method was applied to calculate the trends of monthly and annual imsrri odr and wsr in 1959 4 2010 4 in the uyrb and the results are exhibited in table 6 it can be obviously seen from table 6 that the imsrri series in the uyrb exhibited reducing trends at both monthly and annual scales specifically the imsrri series showed significantly reducing trends in march may july october and november meanwhile other months showed non significantly reducing trends it should be noted that the annual series of the imsrri and odr within 1959 4 2009 4 in the uyrb had significantly reducing trends and the rsr had a non significantly reducing trend which were consistent with the findings of she et al 2012 and wang and zhai 2003 on the drought in the uyrb additionally the trend test results of odr and rsr indicated that the evolution trend of imsrri was influenced by the trend of both odr and rsr and the influence of the odr was greater than that of the rsr 4 4 identification of change points in annual imsrri series it is important to identify change points in the imsrri series which are a key component in drought characteristics helping to determine whether the drought mechanism has changed the heuristic segmentation method was utilized to identify the change points of the annual imsrri series within 1959 2009 in the uyrb the threshold p0 was selected as 0 95 and ℓ 0 was chosen as 25 in this study pedro et al 2001 the results of detected change points are shown in fig 8 it was obvious that two change points 1995 and 1975 were detected because probabilities of their largest t were larger than the threshold p0 therefore the annual imsrri series in the uyrb had changed greatly and the stationarity of the annual imsrri series was invalid 4 5 the links between imsrri and climate indices and their evolutions it is important to reveal the correlations between the imsrri and climate indices which help us to further understand the response of socioeconomic drought and the reservoir system to climate variation therefore cross wavelet analysis was adopted to investigate the correlations between monthly imsrri and monthly ao enso pdo and sunspots covering 1959 4 2010 4 in the uyrb the cross wavelet transforms between monthly imsrri and climate indices are illustrated in figs 9 12 in the four figures the color bar meant the energy density the 95 confidence level against red noise is shown as a thick contour and arrows denoted the relative phase relationship with anti phase pointing left and in phase pointing right it can obviously be observed from fig 9 that the strong interaction between ao events and the imsrri occurred in the period of 30 60 months in 1963 1970 1968 1977 and 1985 1994 and the period of 70 110 months in 1970 1988 in the period of 30 60 months ao and imsrri had positive phase relationships in 1963 1970 and 1985 1994 and negative phase linkages in 1968 1977 in the period of 70 110 months ao and imsrri showed positive phase correlations in 1970 1988 it could be clearly observed from fig 10 that enso events showed stronger impacts than ao events on monthly imsrri series in the uyrb huang et al 2016a fig 10 indicated that the strong interaction between enso events and the imsrri took place in the period of 22 64 months which was consistent with enso periodicity of 2 7 years dash et al 2013 huang et al 2016b enso events and the imsrri had positive phase relationships in 1968 1977 and 1984 1993 and negative phase linkages in 1962 1967 1982 1985 and 1990 2001 meanwhile these results corresponded to the two change points 1995 and 1975 tested in section 4 4 of this paper conversely pdo events exhibited a weak influence on the imsrri series in the uyrb fig 11 in addition on the long period 10 11 years as fig 12 shows sunspots have the strongest correlation with imsrri which is consistent with sunspot periodicity of 11 years hathaway et al 2002 sunspots and the imsrri have significant negative phase linkages in 1970 1989 which proved the result of the second iteration 1975 in section 4 4 these findings implied that the change points in the imsrri series in the uyrb were related to climate variation in conclusion ao and enso had obvious influence on socioeconomic drought evolution on the short period in the uyrb on the long period the evolution of socioeconomic drought was mainly influenced by sunspots in the uyrb which was consistent with the findings of zhao and huang 2004 therefore these climate factors could be used to monitor and warn of future socioeconomic droughts in the uyrb 5 discussions 5 1 differences in trend and change points between msrri and imsrri to further distinguish the strength and weaknesses of both the imsrri and msrri we also did a trend test on the msrri idr and wsr series and the results are shown in table 7 being different from the imsrri odr and rsr the msrri idr and wsr showed non significantly decreasing trends at both monthly and annual scales both the odr and idr were constructed by the top down methodology but mmk statistics of the idr were much smaller than the odr table 6 primarily because the outflow was regarded as the demand in the idr frame which led to a rapid rise in the idr during the drought period and a rapid decrease in the idr when a sudden reduction happened in inflow therefore the msrri series could not truly reflect the evolution trend of the socioeconomic drought in the uyrb conversely the imsrri accurately represented the operation process of the reservoir system under the changing environment therefore the trend test results of the imsrri were more reliable than the msrri as mentioned in section 4 4 the imsrri had two change points 1995 and 1975 in this section the heuristic segmentation method was also applied to identify the change points in the annual msrri series within 1959 2009 in the uyrb and the results of fig 13 indicated that there was no change point detected p p0 in order to explore the reasons why the change point identification of the msrri were different from the imsrri we conducted change point identification on the annual idr wsr odr and rsr for the imsrri the odr had two change points 1990 and 1975 and the rsr also had two change points 1995 and 1975 these results were consistent with the results of change point identification of the imsrri for the msrri the wsr had two change points 1995 and 1980 but the idr had no change point detected then we did the correlation analysis between the idr and odr as well as between the wsr and rsr which were constructed by the top down methodology and the bottom up methodology respectively the correlation coefficient between the idr and odr was 0 12 while the correlation coefficient between the wsr and rsr was 0 92 the correlation between the idr and odr was much lower than the correlation between the wsr and rsr hence the idr was the main reason for the differences of temporal variation characteristics between the msrri and imsrri because the outflow was regarded as the demand in the msrri framework the idr instead increased during extreme drought periods and the idr could not characterize the non stationary nature of the relationship between the supply and the demand therefore compared with the msrri the imsrri could more accurately characterize the evolution of socioeconomic drought 5 2 impact of the imsrri on lyx reservoir operation rules through investigating the evolution characteristics of the imsrri we found some socioeconomic droughts were caused by the reservoir operation rules in 1991 and 1994 the rsr index was high which meant the reservoir had sufficient water but the odr was lower than the threshold value when the reservoir pool level rose to the vicinity of the upper output line but was lower than the upper output line the hydropower station operated according to the guaranteed output as the water level rose the outflow decreased and the odr index declined therefore to fully exert the reservoir regulation capacity and reduce the occurrence of socioeconomic drought we suggest drawing a water supply guarantee line on the operation chart and generating a water supply guarantee zone the output of the reservoir will increase according to the demand when the pool level is located in the water supply guarantee zone additionally we have concluded that the imsrri has declined significantly over the past 50 years in sections 4 2 4 3 and 4 4 which means the uyrb has become drier and drier in the past 50 years under the changing environment as a response to this change we suggest that the reservoir adopt the principle of determining electricity by water demand rather than determining it by guaranteed output if the reservoir discharges according to the guaranteed output when the reservoir is running at low pool levels the outflow is much more than the demand when the pool level rises back to the normal the reservoir system will discharge according to the guaranteed output 5 3 sensitivity analysis of the threshold to further explore the rationality of the threshold selection we also selected the threshold of 0 5 and 1 as comparison and the results are shown in table 8 when the threshold 0 5 there were 25 drought events captured but it was obvious that there were some drought events integrated into one drought event duration was 130 8 months and the attenuation phenomenon occurred on the intensity value intensity was 0 99 this meant that the drought event characteristics could not be accurately characterized when 0 5 was chosen as the threshold it also could be observed that some slight drought events could not be monitored especially those caused by the reservoir operation rules 1991 and 1994 when the threshold 1 therefore the selection of threshold was very important to identify drought events generally the threshold of 0 8 denoting that the cumulative probability of the joint distribution of the rsr and odr was 0 2 was reliable in capturing the socioeconomic drought events compared with the threshold of 0 5 and 1 5 4 physics linkages between the imsrri and climatic indices as is known the walker circulation has an important influence on precipitation in arid regions of china the weakened walker circulation would cause less precipitation and drought in northern china paul and robert 1978 reginald and yong 1996 and the variation of the walker circulation is related to various factors vecchi 2007 lau and yang 2015 enso was taken as an example enso events can dramatically weaken the intensity of the walker circulation philander 1990 tobias et al 2014 and further affect precipitation in northern china in addition previous studies indicated that enso events are increasing in both frequency and intensity under the global warming meehl et al 2007 jin 1997 cai et al 2014 tong et al 2010 power et al 2013 which indicated that the results of change point detection of the imsrri had a good correspondence with the variations of climatic indices moreover these results were also consistent with the significantly decreasing trend of the imsrri series in the uyrb 6 conclusions socioeconomic drought is the least studied among the four different drought types most existing drought indexes ignore the importance of local reservoirs in coping with climatic extremes in this study based on the top down and bottom up concepts of msrri and the characteristics of reservoir operation we have improved msrri through combining reservoir operation processes and actual water supply and demand which is on the basis of the joint distribution function of outflow demand reliability odr indicator and reservoir system resilience rsr indicator the developed msrri and imsrri were applied in the uyrb with the reservoir scheduling process as a comparison results indicated that imsrri could identify the onset termination persistence peak and retreat period of socioeconomic drought more accurately and reasonably than msrri and in terms of obviously reducing the misjudgment rate of socioeconomic drought additionally it was also able to precisely characterize the socioeconomic drought in flood season furthermore the socioeconomic droughts events were frequent in the uyrb and the socioeconomic droughts were relatively serious the imsrri series in the uyrb showed a significantly decreasing trend in addition there were two change points 1995 and 1975 in annual imsrri series during 1959 2010 in the uyrb the cross wavelet analysis was adopted to explore the correlations between monthly imsrri series and climatic factors in the uyrb which help to reveal the causes of changes in socioeconomic drought in the uyrb results indicated that ao and enso had obvious effect on socioeconomic drought evolution on the short period in the uyrb and the influences of enso were stronger than ao sunspots showed the most significant impacts on the socioeconomic drought evolution on the long period in the uyrb generally the findings in this study further facilitate the development of the socioeconomic drought index and help to reveal the socioeconomic drought evolution characteristics in the uyrb which is helpful for local socioeconomic drought mitigation and water resources management in this present study we fully revealed the evolution characteristics of socioeconomic drought during the 1959 2010 in the uyrb however the evolution of future socioeconomic drought is also important for water resources management therefore the forecast of evolution of future socioeconomic drought and how the reservoir systems respond to the future socioeconomic drought will be the focus of our future research acknowledgements

the even distribution of rainfall on an unshaded gr the pv dripline may cause temporary ponding of water beneath the panel edge fig 1 a rainwater that falls directly on the gr surface is either

table 1 summarizes rainwater retention of gr field studies within the last decade reported total rainwater retention ranges between 10 and 86 however performance results are site specific and are not

bousselot et al 2013 hui and chan 2011 there is a gap in the literature regarding the hydrology of gr pv systems the current study is the first quantitative investigation of the hydrology of an integrated full scale gr pv system in canada the objective of this study is to investigate the performance of gr pv systems including rainwater retention peak flow reduction curve number and biomass this study also assesses the influence of differential height between pv panels and gr modules in gr pv systems on each of these variables 2 method 2 1 experimental setup the experimental system was constructed in 2014 on the fifth story roof of a university of toronto building located on the downtown st george campus fig 2 a two separate raised grs 31 2 m2 each were built on top of a wooden platform to accommodate discharge monitoring equipment the wooden platforms were pitched at a 3 5 slope southward and lined with an impermeable roofing membrane flashing was installed along the north east and west edges of each gr two rows of pv panels were mounted to racking structures above each gr the vertical distances between the pv panels and the gr surface were 0 6 m and 1 2 m for the south and north test modules respectively fig 2b subsequently the test module with a vertical separation of 0 6 m will be referred to as low differential height ldh while the test module with a vertical separation of 1 2 m will be referred to as high differential height hdh bioroof systems supplied the gr trays for the gr system a biologically derived medium containing a matured screened pine bark compost with 5 additional components a growing medium of 200 mm thick was laid in the mesh of the trays with a minimum water retention capacity of 60 water permeability of 0 013 cm s and a bulk density of 0 58 g cm3 the substrate can hold 5 2 l m2 water with a saturated unit weight of 1 1 g cm3 hill et al 2017 the gr modules were seeded with a mix of native growing forbs and grasses lundholm et al 2010 the growing medium and vegetation were selected based on availability and common use throughout may to october in 2016 and 2017 daily irrigation a total of 1 l m2 over 20 min was provided to the gr beds via drip lines with 300 mm spacing between emitters hydrological performance of a control gr module was monitored for comparison against the gr pv systems the control gr established on the same roof had a 2 86 m2 drainage area and was constructed with a 2 slope the control gr system was built four years earlier than the gr pv systems but contained the same substrate material 150 mm depth and vegetation as the gr pv systems all quantitative gr pv performance data were compared with the control gr performance data 2 2 vegetation data collection vegetation data were collected bi weekly by engineering undergraduate students using a pin frame between may and august 2017 the pin frame consisted of 16 pins with a height of 60 cm it was placed directly on the surface of the growing medium vegetation measurements were taken at six equidistant locations for each gr pv test module the number of pin touches by both plants and leaves were recorded for grasses vegetation data for the shaded and unshaded areas in both hdh and ldh modules were compared to determine which height differential produced higher plant density and whether there were any correlations between plant density and stormwater retention 2 3 discharge monitoring stormwater discharge from the two gr pv modules was measured by high flow 2 l genec inc and low flow 6 ml te525m texas electronics tipping buckets the combined tipping bucket system could measure discharge ranging from 6 ml min to 24 l min control gr discharge was measured by a 6 ml tipping bucket the accuracy of the 6 ml te525 was 1 3 and 5 for stormwater of 25 mm h 25 51 mm h and 51 76 mm h respectively according to the manufacturer s manual the 2l genec inc can measure a maximum flow of 24 l min or 12 tips per minute there was also a 6 ml te525 located on the adjacent upper roof deck for rainfall measurement a data logger collected data from the tipping buckets at 5 min intervals 2 4 data analysis discharge from 51 rainfall events was measured excluding snow and rain on snow events from august 2016 to july 2017 discharge volumetric data were converted to depth data using the vegetated area of gr pv and gr beds allowing a comparison of systems with different areas for the hydrologic analysis discrete rainfall events that occurred less than 6 h apart were treated as a single event rainfall events with less than 0 6 mm total depth were excluded rainfall events were classified by total depth as small rain 0 6 mm 3 mm medium rain 3 mm 10 mm and large rain 10 mm following classification standards used in previous studies wong and jim 2014 simmons et al 2008 vanwoert et al 2005 the percentage of rainwater retention rr was calculated after each event as follows 1 rr r d r 100 where d is the total discharge depth mm of an individual event normalized by the vegetated area and r is total rainfall depth mm using the hyetographs of individual rainfalls and discharge hydrographs the peak flow reductions pr of gr pv

parameters rr pr cn of gr pv and gr were evaluated for 51 rainfalls with eqs 1 4 statistical analyses i e mann whitney tests were applied to determine if there was a significant difference between discharge characteristics of hdh ldh and gr beds the impact of the differential height of gr and pv on hydrological parameters was also examined statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss 3 results and discussion 3 1 study climatic conditions the monthly precipitation at the experimental site during the study period was largely consistent with the 30 year average 1986 2016 except for april and may 2017 when the monthly averages were exceeded by 50 mm and 110 mm respectively fig 3 the air temperature was within the range of the last 30 year climatological normal except for january and february 2017 when the temperature was approximately 5 c warmer than normal a total of 556 8 mm of rainfall was recorded over 51 rainfall events the maximum rainfall depth was 64 2 mm in 27 h may 25th 2017 characterized by a return period of 3 3 years based on toronto climate ontario idf curve lookup 2016 the median antecedent dry weather period adwp was 2 5 days table 2 summarises small medium and large rainfall events by total depth 3 2 vegetation based on the visual observations the leaves grown in moderate shading of the hdh platform were thicker and had a smaller area per leaf while leaves grown in substantial shading of ldh platform were thinner and had a larger surface area per leaf to capture more of the limited light the total numbers of pin touches for the ldh and hdh modules are plotted in fig 4 a the number of pin touches for the hdh module increased continuously during the measurement period from 122 on may 17th to 331 on aug 25th in contrast the rate of pin touches in the ldh module increased from 109 on may 17th to 282 in july 28th and then decreased to 175 in aug 25th fig 4a the number of pin touches for the hdh module was consistently greater than that for the ldh module by the maximum difference of means of 47 on august 25th fig 4b plots pin touches in shaded and unshaded portions on ldh and hdh platforms in the shade of the pv panels the biomass was significantly more than unshaded portions in the growing months in ldh platform the biomass difference between shaded and unshaded portions ranged from 15 5 on may 17th 2017 to 72 on june 28th 2017 pin touches in addition the vegetation difference between the shaded and unshaded portion of hdh platform started from 0 on may 17th 2017 and reached a maximum of 91 5 pin touches on july 12th 2017 vegetation in the gr pv modules did not grow uniformly in comparison with the control gr system there was more biomass under the pv panels shaded portion of gr pv systems compared to the unshaded portion of gr pv systems during the growing season june to august with daily irrigation the vegetation growth below the ldh and hdh pv panels was greater than growth in unshaded areas by 28 45 and 18 49 respectively blocking of direct radiation by pv panels has been shown to enhance plant growth nagengast et al 2013 bousselot et al 2013 köhler et al 2007 nagengast et al 2013 and köhler et al 2007 found that the shading from a pv reduced direct solar radiation and et rates which in turn led to less drought stress for the underlying plants bousselot et al 2013 observed that temperature beneath pv panels was more stable than in an unshaded area reduced diurnal temperature fluctuations and solar irradiance and associated reduced et allows for moisture to be retained by the substrate for a longer period of time which is potentially beneficial for vegetation bousselot et al 2013 biomass analysis showed that there was minimal difference at the beginning of the growing season in may between the hdh and ldh modules an observation that is consistent with a similar study by bousselot et al 2013 after ten weeks of growth there was 47 more biomass in the shaded areas of the hdh platform than in the shaded areas of the ldh platform hdh provided plants with more solar radiation and greater rain exposure which led to higher biomass in the hdh module compared to the ldh platform 3 3 discharge the cumulative discharge from the gr pv and gr systems over the study period is shown in fig 5 over the study the hdh and ldh gr pv systems released 1815 l and 2010 l of discharge in comparison the control gr released 1260 l of discharge approximately 30 27 less than the gr pv systems the pv panels in the gr pv intercepted and concentrated rainfall in a narrow strip of the gr along the pv panel driplines this likely created localized saturated conditions within the substrate while the substrate directly beneath pv panels remained dry localized saturated conditions were confirmed with visual observations during rainfall periods as temporary ponded water was frequently noted along the pv panel driplines we were not able to obtain reliable measurements of moisture contents and matrix potentials across the gr modules and in the panel dripline areas this precluded making quantitative comparisons of the effects of the pv panels on moisture distribution estimates of evapotranspiration and completion of full hydrological balances for the systems a strong non linear correlation was observed between rainfall and discharge values fig 6 the results of this study had a high similarity to the study of fassman beck et al 2013 which reported on 641 rainfalls on four gr systems with 50 150 mm depth of growing medium in auckland new zealand unlike the gr pv which produced discharge with rainfalls in excess of 3 mm in the gr discharge rarely occurred from events with less than 11 mm of rainfall in large rainfalls the discharge volume increased considerably for both gr pv and gr systems fig 7 a compares rainwater retention generated by the gr pv and the gr system storms with small rainfall depth had the greatest fractional rainwater retention for all systems for storms with 10 mm of rainfall or less rainwater retention of at least 90 was measured for the gr module whereas 61 and 75 rainwater retention values were recorded for the gr pv ldh and hdh systems respectively for large rainfalls rainwater retention of at least 20 was measured for both gr and gr pv systems however rainwater retention for the control gr was as high as 100 in large rainfalls after 8 12 days of adwp while the gr pv systems could not retain more than 76 of the stormwater using a mann whitney test with 95 confidence interval there was a significant difference between gr pv and gr regarding rainwater retention fig 8 b illustrates the probability of exceedance for rainwater retention of gr pv hdh and ldh beds and gr based on fig 7b in 80 of the rain events rainwater retention in all systems was higher than 55 also in 70 of rain events the rainwater retention in the control gr was higher than 97 while it was less than 65 for gr pv systems the hdh gr pv performed slightly better than ldh gr pv although there is no significant difference with 95 confidence interval between them fig 9 the average rainwater retention values for the control gr in this study were 99 93 and 54 in small medium and large rainfalls respectively the results of this study are comparable see table 2 with other studies of rainwater retention fassman beck et al 2013 simmons et al 2008 carter and jackson 2007 vanwoert et al 2005 in comparison the gr pv modules had lower rainwater retention in medium rainfalls rainwater retention values for the gr pv modules were 12 18 less than the control gr 75 for ldh and 81 for hdh modules peak flow reduction eq 2 is a widely used parameter to evaluate the impact of a gr on stormwater control box plots of peak flow reductions are presented in fig 8a overall both the gr and the gr pv were able to reduce peak flows substantially in small and medium rainfalls 10 mm the gr had lower peak flow than the gr pv systems by 10 21 and 9 39 respectively in large rainfalls the gr reduced the peak discharge flow over the wide range of 33 and 90 compared to the gr pv systems which ranged from 35 to 69 there was a significant difference 95 confidence interval between the gr pv and the gr for peak flow reduction fig 8b illustrates the probability of exceedance for peak flow reduction of the gr pv systems hdh and ldh beds and gr in 80 of the rain events the peak flow reduction of the gr pv and gr systems were 55 65 and 85 respectively overall there was no significant difference between hdh and ldh regarding peak flow reduction in the small medium and large rainfalls the control gr reduced peak flow by mean values of 100 98 and 58 respectively in comparison fassman beck et al 2013 observed that a gr reduced peak flow by 73 to 89 after 2 5 years of monitoring and 22 significant storm events 22 mm stovin et al 2012 concluded that a gr could provide mean peak flow reduction of 60 alfredo et al 2010 reported peak flow reductions ranging between 22 and 70 for a gr with variable depths 2 5 6 3 and 10 cm while voyde et al 2010 showed that in some individual rain events a gr could reduce the peak flow up to 93 in small and medium rainfalls the peak reduction in the gr was higher than the ldh and hdh gr pv systems by 8 9 and 16 17 respectively however in large rainfalls the difference between gr and gr pv systems in terms of rainwater retention was minimal average nrcs cn values of gr pv and gr systems were obtained using least squares optimization over the study period the average cn for the gr was 93 while average cn values were 96 and 97 for the hdh and ldh gr pvs respectively the higher cn value for the gr pvs might be due to the presence of the impermeable pv panels which partially sheltered the gr surfaces the range of cn values in this study is comparable with cn values found in other studies hill et al 2017 calculated an average cn of 94 for 24 gr test modules in toronto considering various combinations of growing media types and depths vegetation types and irrigation schedules in toronto similarly van seters et al 2009 found a mean cn of 92 for gr and fassman beck et al 2016 determined a cn for a gr in the range of 90 96 the higher performance of the control gr in comparison with the gr pv might have been due to surface permeability one square meter of gr contains permeable growing media while one square meter of gr pv is partially permeable growing media and partially impermeable pv panel for the gr pv platforms in this study the panels covered 40 of the underlying gr surfaces the differential height between the pv and the gr surface influences the operating temperature of the pv panels as the height of the pv is increased the airflow beneath becomes less restricted ogaili and sailor 2016 a high differential height also increases the solar radiation angle and decreases gr shading as a result the rate of et from the gr surface increases which in turn improves the cooling effect there was no significant difference between ldh and hdh beds regarding rainwater retention and peak flow reduction however in large rainfalls the median rainwater retention for the hdh system was 15 higher than for the ldh system fig 8a the cn value of the ldh system was one unit higher than the value for the hdh system 97 for ldh and 96 for hdh larger differential height between the pv and the gr in the hdh provided more solar radiation and rain exposure which led to more biomass and a lower cn value for the hdh system compared to the ldh system the larger vertical distance between pv and gr relatively improves the biomass and hydrologic performance of gr pv system these outcomes are against a fact that the pv panel and vegetation should be placed at a close distance so that the cooling by et can directly influence the solar modules hui and chan 2011 thus for future studies examining a variety of differential heights i e 10 20 30 40 and 50 cm would be recommended to optimise the biomass and hydrologic performance of gr and efficiency of pv system simultaneously there are some other relevant objectives which were beyond the scope of study such as influence of pv panel on the hydrological balance of gr water retention of gr on the edge of pv panel where temporary pond created by panel dripline and matrix potential measurement and corresponding water retention curve in addition the shading effect of pv panel on different plants are not alike measuring the effect of different vegetation types on gr plant growth by the presence of pv panel would be another potential objective for future research 4 summary and conclusions in this study the hydrologic performance of two integrated green roof photovoltaic gr pv systems was compared with a green roof gr for 51 rainfall events the results suggest that gr pv systems are less effective in reducing stormwater runoff and peak flow in comparison with grs also the average curve number cn of gr system was 93 versus 96 97 for gr pv the poor performance of the gr pv in comparison with the gr is due to nonuniform distribution of rainwater on a gr surface as a portion of rainwater is intercepted by the pv panel surface and concentrated to a narrow strip of gr along the panel dripline this likely created localized saturated conditions within the substrate while the substrate directly beneath pv panels remained dry this study provides further insights about the effect of pv panel height on gr pv efficiency in terms of hydrology and biomass doubling the pv panel height from 0 6 to 1 2 m did not significantly change the rainwater retention and peak flow reduction however a larger gap between pv and gr led to lower cn value from 97 in 0 6 m to 96 in 1 2 m due to more rainwater and sun exposure increasing the pv panel height from 0 6 to 1 2 m increased the biomass by 47 after ten weeks of growing season larger vertical distance between pv and gr provided plants with more solar radiation and greater rain exposure which led to more biomass and improved growing conditions although the larger vertical distance between pv and gr relatively improves the biomass and hydrologic performance of gr pv system the lower vertical distance is recommended for best practice as usually the pv panel and vegetation should be placed at a close distance so that the cooling by et can directly influence the solar modules otherwise the differences between ambient temperature of pv panels with and without gr would be too small to influence pv power

also a 6 ml te525 located on the adjacent upper roof deck for rainfall measurement a data logger collected data from the tipping buckets at 5 min intervals 2 4 data analysis discharge from 51 rainfall events was measured excluding snow and rain on snow events from august 2016 to july 2017 discharge volumetric data were converted to depth data using the vegetated area of gr pv and gr beds allowing a comparison of systems with different areas for the hydrologic analysis discrete rainfall events that occurred less than 6 h apart were treated as a single event rainfall events with less than 0 6 mm total depth were excluded rainfall events were classified by total depth as small rain 0 6 mm 3 mm medium rain 3 mm 10 mm and large rain 10 mm following classification standards used in previous studies wong and jim 2014 simmons et al 2008 vanwoert et al 2005 the percentage of rainwater retention rr was calculated after each event as follows 1 rr r d r 100 where d is the total discharge depth mm of an individual event normalized by the vegetated area and r is total rainfall depth mm using the hyetographs of individual rainfalls and discharge hydrographs the peak flow reductions pr of gr pv and gr were calculated as 2 pr p r p d p r 100 where p r and p d represent the peak flow of rainfall and discharge respectively nrcs curve numbers cn were generated to assess the theoretical storage capacity and compare between shaded and unshaded gr and between differential heights the measured r and d were fit to the following equation using the least squares method to solve for storage s asce

parameters rr pr cn of gr pv and gr were evaluated for 51 rainfalls with eqs 1 4 statistical analyses i e mann whitney tests were applied to determine if there was a significant difference between discharge characteristics of hdh ldh and gr beds the impact of the differential height of gr and pv on hydrological parameters was also examined statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss 3 results and discussion 3 1 study climatic conditions the monthly precipitation at the experimental site during the study period was largely consistent with the 30 year average 1986 2016 except for april and may 2017 when the monthly averages were exceeded by 50 mm and 110 mm respectively fig 3 the air temperature was within the range of the last 30 year climatological normal except for january and february 2017 when the temperature was approximately 5 c warmer than normal a total of 556 8 mm of rainfall was recorded over 51 rainfall events the maximum rainfall depth was 64 2 mm in 27 h may 25th 2017 characterized by a return period of 3 3 years based on toronto climate ontario idf curve lookup 2016 the median antecedent dry weather period adwp was 2 5 days table 2 summarises small medium and large rainfall events by total depth 3 2 vegetation based on the visual observations the leaves grown in moderate shading of the hdh platform were thicker and had a smaller area per leaf while leaves grown in substantial shading of ldh platform were thinner and had a larger surface area per leaf to capture more of the limited light the total numbers of pin touches for the ldh and hdh modules are plotted in fig 4 a the number of pin touches for the hdh module increased continuously during the measurement period from 122 on may 17th to 331 on aug 25th in contrast the rate of pin touches in the ldh module increased from 109 on may 17th to 282 in july 28th and then decreased to 175 in aug 25th fig 4a the number of pin touches for the hdh module was consistently greater than that for the ldh module by the maximum difference of means of 47 on august 25th fig 4b plots pin touches in shaded and unshaded portions on ldh and hdh platforms in the shade of the pv panels the biomass was significantly more than unshaded portions in the growing months in ldh platform the biomass difference between shaded and unshaded portions ranged from 15 5 on may 17th 2017 to 72 on june 28th 2017 pin touches in addition the vegetation difference between the shaded and unshaded portion of hdh platform started from 0 on may 17th 2017 and reached a maximum of 91 5 pin touches on july 12th 2017 vegetation in the gr pv modules did not grow uniformly in comparison with the control gr system there was more biomass under the pv panels shaded portion of gr pv systems compared to the unshaded portion of gr pv systems during the growing season june to august with daily irrigation the vegetation growth below the ldh and hdh pv panels was greater than growth in unshaded areas by 28 45 and 18 49 respectively blocking of direct radiation by pv panels has been shown to enhance plant growth nagengast et al 2013 bousselot et al 2013 köhler et al 2007 nagengast et al 2013 and köhler et al 2007 found that the shading from a pv reduced direct solar radiation and et rates which in turn led to less drought stress for the underlying plants bousselot et al 2013 observed that temperature beneath pv panels was more stable than in an unshaded area reduced diurnal temperature fluctuations and solar irradiance and associated reduced et allows for moisture to be retained by the substrate for a longer period of time which is potentially beneficial for vegetation bousselot et al 2013 biomass analysis showed that there was minimal difference at the beginning of the growing season in may between the hdh and ldh modules an observation that is consistent with a similar study by bousselot et al 2013 after ten weeks of growth there was 47 more biomass in the shaded areas of the hdh platform than in the shaded areas of the ldh platform hdh provided plants with more solar radiation and greater rain exposure which led to higher biomass in the hdh module compared to the ldh platform 3 3 discharge the cumulative discharge from the gr pv and gr systems over the study period is shown in fig 5 over the study the hdh and ldh gr pv systems released 1815 l and 2010 l of discharge in comparison the control gr released 1260 l of discharge approximately 30 27 less than the gr pv systems the pv panels in the gr pv intercepted and concentrated rainfall in a narrow strip of the gr along the pv panel driplines this likely created localized saturated conditions within the substrate while the substrate directly beneath pv panels remained dry localized saturated conditions were confirmed with visual observations during rainfall periods as temporary ponded water was frequently noted along the pv panel driplines we were not able to obtain reliable measurements of moisture contents and matrix potentials across the gr modules and in the panel dripline areas this precluded making quantitative comparisons of the effects of the pv panels on moisture distribution estimates of evapotranspiration and completion of full hydrological balances for the systems a strong non linear correlation was observed between rainfall and discharge values fig 6 the results of this study had a high similarity to the study of fassman beck et al 2013 which reported on 641 rainfalls on four gr systems with 50 150 mm depth of growing medium in auckland new zealand unlike the gr pv which produced discharge with rainfalls in excess of 3 mm in the gr discharge rarely occurred from events with less than 11 mm of rainfall in large rainfalls the discharge volume increased considerably for both gr pv and gr systems fig 7 a compares rainwater retention generated by the gr pv and the gr system storms with small rainfall depth had the greatest fractional rainwater retention for all systems for storms with 10 mm of rainfall or less rainwater retention of at least 90 was measured for the gr module whereas 61 and 75 rainwater retention values were recorded for the gr pv ldh and hdh systems respectively for large rainfalls rainwater retention of at least 20 was measured for both gr and gr pv systems however rainwater retention for the control gr was as high as 100 in large rainfalls after 8 12 days of adwp while the gr pv systems could not retain more than 76 of the stormwater using a mann whitney test with 95 confidence interval there was a significant difference between gr pv and gr regarding rainwater retention fig 8 b illustrates the probability of exceedance for rainwater retention of gr pv hdh and ldh beds and gr based on fig 7b in 80 of the rain events rainwater retention in all systems was higher than 55 also in 70 of rain events the rainwater retention in the control gr was higher than 97 while it was less than 65 for gr pv systems the hdh gr pv performed slightly better than ldh gr pv although there is no significant difference with 95 confidence interval between them fig 9 the average rainwater retention values for the control gr in this study were 99 93 and 54 in small medium and large rainfalls respectively the results of this study are comparable see table 2 with other studies of rainwater retention fassman beck et al 2013 simmons et al 2008 carter and jackson 2007 vanwoert et al 2005 in comparison the gr pv modules had lower rainwater retention in medium rainfalls rainwater retention values for the gr pv modules were 12 18 less than the control gr 75 for ldh and 81 for hdh modules peak flow reduction eq 2 is a widely used parameter to evaluate the impact of a gr on stormwater control box plots of peak flow reductions are presented in fig 8a overall both the gr and the gr pv were able to reduce peak flows substantially in small and medium rainfalls 10 mm the gr had lower peak flow than the gr pv systems by 10 21 and 9 39 respectively in large rainfalls the gr reduced the peak discharge flow over the wide range of 33 and 90 compared to the gr pv systems which ranged from 35 to 69 there was a significant difference 95 confidence interval between the gr pv and the gr for peak flow reduction fig 8b illustrates the probability of exceedance for peak flow reduction of the gr pv systems hdh and ldh beds and gr in 80 of the rain events the peak flow reduction of the gr pv and gr systems were 55 65 and 85 respectively overall there was no significant difference between hdh and ldh regarding peak flow reduction in the small medium and large rainfalls the control gr reduced peak flow by mean values of 100 98 and 58 respectively in comparison fassman beck et al 2013 observed that a gr reduced peak flow by 73 to 89 after 2 5 years of monitoring and 22 significant storm events 22 mm stovin et al 2012 concluded that a gr could provide mean peak flow reduction of 60 alfredo et al 2010 reported peak flow reductions ranging between 22 and 70 for a gr with variable depths 2 5 6 3 and 10 cm while voyde et al 2010 showed that in some individual rain events a gr could reduce the peak flow up to 93 in small and medium rainfalls the peak reduction in the gr was higher than the ldh and hdh gr pv systems by 8 9 and 16 17 respectively however in large rainfalls the difference between gr and gr pv systems in terms of rainwater retention was minimal average nrcs cn values of gr pv and gr systems were obtained using least squares optimization over the study period the average cn for the gr was 93 while average cn values were 96 and 97 for the hdh and ldh gr pvs respectively the higher cn value for the gr pvs might be due to the presence of the impermeable pv panels which partially sheltered the gr surfaces the range of cn values in this study is comparable with cn values found in other studies hill et al 2017 calculated an average cn of 94 for 24 gr test modules in toronto considering various combinations of growing media types and depths vegetation types and irrigation schedules in toronto similarly van seters et al 2009 found a mean cn of 92 for gr and fassman beck et al 2016 determined a cn for a gr in the range of 90 96 the higher performance of the control gr in comparison with the gr pv might have been due to surface permeability one square meter of gr contains permeable growing media while one square meter of gr pv is partially permeable growing media and partially impermeable pv panel for the gr pv platforms in this study the panels covered 40 of the underlying gr surfaces the differential height between the pv and the gr surface influences the operating temperature of the pv panels as the height of the pv is increased the airflow beneath becomes less restricted ogaili and sailor 2016 a high differential height also increases the solar radiation angle and decreases gr shading as a result the rate of et from the gr surface increases which in turn improves the cooling effect there was no significant difference between ldh and hdh beds regarding rainwater retention and peak flow reduction however in large rainfalls the median rainwater retention for the hdh system was 15 higher than for the ldh system fig 8a the cn value of the ldh system was one unit higher than the value for the hdh system 97 for ldh and 96 for hdh larger differential height between the pv and the gr in the hdh provided more solar radiation and rain exposure which led to more biomass and a lower cn value for the hdh system compared to the ldh system the larger vertical distance between pv and gr relatively improves the biomass and hydrologic performance of gr pv system these outcomes are against a fact that the pv panel and vegetation should be placed at a close distance so that the cooling by et can directly influence the solar modules hui and chan 2011 thus for future studies examining a variety of differential heights i e 10 20 30 40 and 50 cm would be recommended to optimise the biomass and hydrologic performance of gr and efficiency of pv system simultaneously there are some other relevant objectives which were beyond the scope of study such as influence of pv panel on the hydrological balance of gr water retention of gr on the edge of pv panel where temporary pond created by panel dripline and matrix potential measurement and corresponding water retention curve in addition the shading effect of pv panel on different plants are not alike measuring the effect of different vegetation types on gr plant growth by the presence of pv panel would be another potential objective for future research 4 summary and conclusions in this study the hydrologic performance of two integrated green roof photovoltaic gr pv systems was compared with a green roof gr for 51 rainfall events the results suggest that gr pv systems are less effective in reducing stormwater runoff and peak flow in comparison with grs also the average curve number cn of gr system was 93 versus 96 97 for gr pv the poor performance of the gr pv in comparison with the gr is due to nonuniform distribution of rainwater on a gr surface as a portion of rainwater is intercepted by the pv panel surface and concentrated to a narrow strip of gr along the panel dripline this likely created localized saturated conditions within the substrate while the substrate directly beneath pv panels remained dry this study provides further insights about the effect of pv panel height on gr pv efficiency in terms of hydrology and biomass doubling the pv panel height from 0 6 to 1 2 m did not significantly change the rainwater retention and peak flow reduction however a larger gap between pv and gr led to lower cn value from 97 in 0 6 m to 96 in 1 2 m due to more rainwater and sun exposure increasing the pv panel height from 0 6 to 1 2 m increased the biomass by 47 after ten weeks of growing season larger vertical distance between pv and gr provided plants with more solar radiation and greater rain exposure which led to more biomass and improved growing conditions although the larger vertical distance between pv and gr relatively improves the biomass and hydrologic performance of gr pv system the lower vertical distance is recommended for best practice as usually the pv panel and vegetation should be placed at a close distance so that the cooling by et can directly influence the solar modules otherwise the differences between ambient temperature of pv panels with and without gr would be too small to influence pv power

6858,overland routing processes are critical for understanding the water environment impact of the urbanization induced land cover change and guiding the optimized landscape planning however current models generally tend to simplify the overland flow process by a semi distributed routing approach in this study the cellular automata based hydrology and nps pollution model ca hnpsm is established by integrating the ca based overland runoff routing algorithm and the nps pollution module three layer spaces were also constructed by considering the hydrological connection among urban roofs land surfaces and artificial drainage networks simplified sewer routing modules were introduced to improve the applicability of the ca algorithm in urban nps pollution studies with insufficient drainage data then the ca hnpsm is tested in a real case study on an urban catchment in beijing china based on the results the ca hnpsm shows good performance in both the hydrological and nps simulations in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and coefficient of determination detailed overland routing processes and hydrological and pollution results are provided in addition landscape configurations along the overland flow routs could also be identified these overland results can be used as powerful reference for optimized landscape planning and the allocation of management measures keywords cellular automata nonpoint source pollution hydrology overland routing process landscape configuration urban 1 introduction as the modern world s epicenter for sociopolitical power and economic development urbanization has resulted in dramatic environmental changes including altered hydrology increased rainfall runoff and more serious nonpoint source nps pollution chen et al 2018a risi et al 2017 specifically due to the expansion of the impervious land covers and sewer systems associated with urbanization the hydrological overland routing process has changed greatly which has proven to exert significant influence on the transport of both the rainfall runoff and pollutants and ultimately affect the discharged water quantity and quality shen et al 2015a ullah et al 2018 in addition compared to natural catchments the land planning and intensive human activities increased the fragmentation and heterogeneity of land cover configurations leading to complex interactions between upstream and downstream land covers connected by the hydrological routs during the overland routing process deng et al 2009 nagendra et al 2004 a better understanding of the overland routing process would be helpful for evaluating the water environment impact of the urbanization induced land cover change liu et al 2018 zhou and li 2015 and exert optimized land planning and water environment management measures such as low impact development lid green infrastructures gi and sponge city planning etc miles and band 2015 zhang and chui 2017 to date some present studies have been dedicated to quantify the rainfall runoff and nps pollution output in urban areas and evaluate the effect on them from the urban landscape pattern initially field monitoring of the runoff flow and water quality was the primary method for characterizing the rainfall runoff and nps pollution generation chen et al 2018b zhi et al 2018 however it would be time consuming and labor intensive when conduct field monitoring along the entire overland flow routs especially in large catchments in large scale studies researchers tended to just monitor water flow and quality at the catchment outlet cross sections tried to establish the statistical relationship between the landscape metrics and water quality indicators zhang et al 2018a this approach confines attention to the landscape compositions and spatial configurations but neglect their hydrological connections and pollution interactions which will result in incorrect assessment of the response relation between landscape nps pollution induced water quality degradation zhang et al 2018b with the development of the modeling technology physical based distributed or semi distributed models have been gradually employed to rainfall runoff and nps pollution simulations fatichi et al 2016 compared to field monitoring these models use less monitoring data to calibrate parameters and are cost effective for presenting the spatial temporal distributions of runoff water and nps pollution fatichi et al 2016 these models such as the storm water management model swmm shin et al 2017 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model chang and li 2017 and source loading and management model slamm pitt 1998 regard sub catchments or sub watersheds as basic computational units with homogeneous topographic characteristics while their generated rainfall runoff and nps pollutants are routed to corresponding sewer inlets gironás et al 2010 but are still too simplified in the localized interactions of different units to deal with detailed process besides the high dependence on the detailed sewer network data limits these models application in large scale or data scarce urban catchments krebs et al 2014 a new model that combine the considerations of both the detailed overland process and the feasibility in data scarce catchments is needed the cellular automata ca method which was first proposed in the 1950s has developed into a supplement for calculating runoff routing and pollution transport as a local to global algorithm the ca could discretize the spatiotemporal dimension and achieve the global evolution of complex macroscopic phenomena based on simple neighborhood transition rules gregorio and serra 1999 compared to the widely used subcatchment based models the ca could fully represent the spatial heterogeneity by a grid based structure matched with input raster data thus be a more adequate tool for involving in the landscape elements with the overland routing process compared to conventional algorithms such as the single direction d8 algorithm and the multi direction md8 algorithm xu and tang 2018 the ca method considers temporally dynamic water depths in addition to land surface elevation when determining the flow direction thus it describes a more reliable dynamic flow routing behavior currently the ca has been applied to study many natural phenomena including the hydrological simulation of braided rivers murray and paola 1994 complex fluid flows zhang and kwok 2013 and unsaturated flows folino et al 2006 in recent years the ca has been applied for overland flow simulation such as the runca model by shao et al 2015 the hillslope scale ecohydrological model by mendicino et al 2013 and the ca based unsteady flow model by parsons and fonstad 2007 these ca based models have been used to simulate urban flood inundation and the associated interaction between surface flow and sewer overflow abbasizadeh et al 2018 liu et al 2014 however as far as we know the consideration of urban land cover characteristics and artificial sewer system is still limited when applying current ca based models to urban catchments besides there is no ca related overland routing algorithm for nps pollution associated with rainfall runoff in this study a ca based nps pollution model ca hnpsm is established to study urban rainfall runoff and nps pollution processes both the runoff routing algorithm and pollutant transport algorithm are considered and integrated then the ca hnpsm is tested in a real case study on an urban catchment in beijing china the landscape configuration along the overland hydrological routes and the nps pollution routing process are provided in detail 2 model development the ca hnpsm model consists of an overland routing module and a subsurface routing module for each module both the hydrological and nps pollution calculations are involved based on the water balance and mass conservation assumptions the routing processes are described by the ca method ranging from local interactions to global evolutions thus the description and key assumptions of the ca are given first followed by the governing equation while the modeling framework is described at the end of this section 2 1 ca description and key assumptions the structure of the ca dynamic system can be described as a quadruple function shao et al 2015 1 s t 1 f l d s t n r where s t 1 represents the set of cell states at a new timestep l d represents the d dimensional lattice space of the cells covering the study area s t represents the set of cell states at the current time t n represents the neighborhood of a central cell and the surrounding cells and r represents the local transition rule specifying how the cell state changes the meanings of these elements in this study are described as follows 2 1 1 lattice space for the ca hnpsm the studied catchment was simplified into a lattice space with three vertical layers including the roof layer land surface layer and subsurface sewer system layer roofs and land surfaces are generalized as 2d lattice spaces of overland routing process while the subsurface layer for pipe routing process is generalized as a set of separate 1d lattice spaces from each pipe inlet to the catchment outlet then the time area method her and heatwole 2016 is used to sum up the respective hydrographs and pollute graphs at the end of each 1d space to be the output of the whole system thus minimize the dependence on detailed drainage network data the interfaces between layers represented drainages from one layer to another via artificial structures including downspouts onto building roofs and pipe inlets onto land surfaces abbasizadeh et al 2018 boundary cells are added to both the land and sub surface layers to define the relationship between cell states inside and outside of the study area shao et al 2015 specifically the cells located at the borders of the land surface are treated as the closed boundary cells where no overland flow routs beyond while the cell at the sub surface outlet is regarded as the open boundary cell to track the flow volume and pollution load leaving the study area 2 1 2 cell states the cell state indicates the runoff e g runoff depth and pollutant e g load or concentration characteristics for each cell at a specific timestep as a model mainly aimed at normal rainfall events where the water depths are small relative to cell size and pollutants propagate slowly the cell states of runoff and pollutants in this study are assumed to be in quasi steady conditions during each time step these cell states are initialized before the simulation and evolve automatically at each timestep during evolution the states of overland cells including roof and land cells at each timestep are not only determined by the rainfall redistribution and pollutant wash off in a cell itself but also water and pollutant exchanges within the neighborhood controlled by local transition rules see section 2 1 4 for the subsurface cell space the only source for the pipe cell is drainage from the land surface therefore runoff and pollutant generation only occur in cells with pipe inlets while other cell states are determined by their upstream and downstream cell states and redistribution guided by the pipe routing rules 2 1 3 local neighborhood the von neumann neighborhood algorithm which includes four cells neighboring the central cell in four cardinal directions is used for roof and land surfaces to define areas where the influence of local neighborhoods occurs as a simple neighborhood type the von neumann neighborhood has been widely used in recent ca based overland flow models folino et al 2006 parsons and fonstad 2007 compared to other more complex methods such as the moore and hexagonal type methods the von neumann neighborhood algorithm integrates local process rules with the raster format of the basic input data and guarantees system symmetry in different directions for pipe cells only its two neighboring cells located upstream and downstream of the central cell are considered 2 1 4 neighborhood transition rules three neighborhood transition rules are set in this study including the overland flow direction rule the roof land rule and the subsurface routing rule 1 overland routing rule in this study we assume that overland flow directions are basically determined by the differences in real time water levels that are determined by the sum of each cell s surface elevation and its ponded runoff depth the widely used minimum difference algorithm mda gregorio and serra 1999 is employed to identify flow directions and volumes based on the principle that a dynamic system always tends to be in equilibrium as illustrated in fig 1 the algorithm first eliminates the neighboring cells with water levels that are higher than that of the central cell then the average water level is calculated for the remaining cells by comparing the average value to the water level of each remaining neighboring cell those with higher water levels are eliminated again for each neighborhood this paradigm is repeated and looped for each timestep until no neighboring cell can be eliminated finally the remaining cells are identified to obtain the runoff flow from the central cell and their average water level is calculated compared to single direction d4 or d8 flow algorithms xu and tang 2018 mda allows the outflow from the central cell to multi directions which is more approximate to the dispersion of the real urban rainfall runoff flow besides mda take the water component into account when decide the flow direction which is more helpful to capture the dynamic flow behaviors shao et al 2015 on this basis the runoff rates are calculated via the manning equation by considering the effects of land surface characteristics such as slope and surface roughness besides in order to avoid redundant back and forth flow between central and neighbor cells the runoff rates are restrained below the difference between the receiving neighbor cells water levels and the last average water level when urban flood occurs in extreme storm events the simulation by the shallow water equations are suggested as an option 2 roof land rule one unique fact that should be noted in urban catchments is that runoff routing from building roofs to land surfaces is usually via downspouts instead of elevation gradients thus a roof land rule is set in neighborhoods with a central roof cell and neighboring land cells instead of using the water level based mda this rule specifies a one way flow from roofs to land via downspouts first the algorithm automatically identifies roof cells with downspouts and their neighboring land cells by assuming that the downspouts are distributed along the building perimeter at a specific interval then groups of paired roof land cells are regarded as the only links between the separate roof and land cell spaces finally runoff drainage via downspouts during each timestep is calculated subtracted from upstream roof cells and added instantly to corresponding downstream land cells 3 subsurface routing rule another important fact in urban hydrology is that an artificial subsurface routing system significantly affects runoff and nps pollution outputs in this study the subsurface routing rule links land cells and subsurface cells at the interface cells where the pipe inlets are located a transition is designed for runoff drainage and sewer overflow at each interface in normal conditions the overland runoff routs into pipe layer through sewer inlet interfaces while if overflow occurs when all of the pipe cells are saturated with runoff the leakage water derived from the pipe routing process transitions from the pipe layer to the land layer in opposite directions in the pipe layer a downstream forward transition motivated by the pipe slope is assumed austin et al 2014 the flow rate from the central pipe cell to its downstream neighboring cell is calculated by the manning equation for the free surface flow state gironás et al 2010 kwon 2014 and the bernoulli s equation for the full pipe flow state as an alternate isenmann et al 2016 nps pollutants are supposed to form a transmission with runoff flow and gradually attenuate at a first order decay rate menzies et al 2017 2 2 governing equations 2 2 1 hydrological component the runoff generation and routing process is based on the water balance principle and the quasi steady assumption during a small timestep the hydrological state of a cell is regarded to be uniform which is a reasonable approximation during the normal rainfall events with relatively shadow runoff depth runoff generation in each cell could be described by the following equation 2 re r p i d s d where re represents the runoff depth mm r represents the discrete rainfall mm p represents the rainwater intercepted by vegetation mm i represents the infiltrated rainwater on pervious land covers mm ds represents the rainwater stored in depressions in land surfaces mm where this parameter reflects the micromorphological characteristics and amends the effects of insufficient resolution in the dem data to an extent and d represents the rainwater drained by roof downspouts or sewer system inlets mm here evapotranspiration is neglected as it is not significant during rainfall event simulations the intercepted rainfall is calculated as aston 1979 shao et al 2015 3 p cum p max 1 e x p 0 046 l a i r cum p max where p cum represents the cumulative intercepted rainwater mm r cum represents the cumulative rainfall mm lai represents the leaf area index and p max represents the maximum storage capacity and is a function of the lai deroo et al 1996 von hoyningen huene 1981 4 p max 0 935 0 498 l a i 0 00575 lai 2 then the intercepted rainwater p is calculated by the difference in p cum at two successive timesteps it should be noted that the above relation of lai and p cum is initially obtained for crops or and natural vegetation deroo et al 1996 and is introduced in this study for urban green land by considering the similarity of the rainfall interception mechanism by leaves of whether the urban or natural vegetation the horton infiltration method is as follows gironás et al 2010 5 i f u f 0 f u e k d t t s where i represents the infiltration per unit area during a timestep mm f u represents the minimum or equilibrium infiltration rate mm s f 0 represents the maximum or initial infiltration rate mm s t represents the time from the beginning of the storm s k d is the decay coefficient s 1 and ts represents the timestep size s the drainage rates of downspouts and pipe inlets could be calculated by either the weir flow model or orifice flow model based on the ponded runoff depth in a cell liu et al 2014 xiuhui 1999 a critical runoff depth h c which causes the calculated weir flow to be equal to the orifice flow should be identified as a reference when switching between the two drainage models the weir flow model is used when h is less than h c otherwise the orifice flow model is used weir flow model 6 d ts c w p h 1 5 a orifice flow model 7 d t s c o a d 2 g h 0 5 a where d represents the rainfall drainage per unit area mm a represents the area of the cell a b b mm2 c w is the weir flow coefficient p represents the wetted perimeter mm h represents the ponded runoff depth before discharging into the downspouts or pipe inlets mm c o is the orifice flow coefficient and a d represents the area of the drainage inlet or downspout mm2 the exchange volume of runoff water between neighboring cells is calculated using the manning equation 8 q 1 49 r e 2 3 s 1 2 n r e b where q represents the outflow runoff rate per unit area from the central cell to a specific neighboring cell mm s b represents the side length of a square cell mm n is the manning coefficient and s represents the water surface slope it should be noted that the manning equation was derived for steady uniform flow when gravity force balance friction so that water depth remains constant in time and space therefore its application in this study is based on the assumed quasi steady condition but is limited for simulating extreme weather events when urban flash flood occurs and the overland flow tends to be unsteady dynamic system as for the urban flash flood scenarios in extreme storms events the rain runoff propagation is suggested to be simulated using the shallow water equations and can be expressed as 9 h t h u j x j r e 10 h u i t h u i u j x j g 2 h 2 x i v 2 h u i x j x j f i where x is distance t is time i a n d j are the cartesian directions u is the flow velocity mm s v is the coefficient of kinematic viscosity h is the water depth mm g is the acceleration of gravity f i is the force term in the direction i and is regarded as the frictional force is this study the net inflow into each cell is calculated by the difference between the total inflow from neighboring cells and the total outflow into neighboring cells 11 q i j q i 1 j q i j 1 q i j 1 q i 1 j q i j t s where q i j represents the net inflow per unit area of the cell located at i j mm q i 1 j q i j 1 q i j 1 a n d q i 1 j represent the inflows from four neighboring cells located at cardinal directions mm and q i j represents the total outflow of the cell i j which is the sum of q with its neighboring cell in a different direction at the end of each timestep the runoff depth of each cell is updated 12 re t 1 re t q i j we assumed that the runoff discharge at each timestep should not exceed the current ponded runoff depth in a cell otherwise the actual discharge be regarded as the current remained ponded runoff 2 2 2 pollutant component the nps pollution is initially generated from the wash off of constituents deposited during dry periods guo et al 2018 wang et al 2011 during its overland routing process pollutants are assumed to be conserved without deposition or decay gironás et al 2010 with the simulated overland flow newly washed off pollutant loads in each cell during a given timestep are calculated by the most oft cited exponential function which was first proposed by sartor and boyd sartor et al 1974 13 w k w q n w m b t s where w represents the washed off mass load mg k w is the wash off coefficient mm h nw h 1 n w represents the wash off exponent m b represents the remaining pollutant accumulation in a cell mg which is initially calculated by a saturated function partially removed by street sweeping during dry periods and gradually reduced with the wash off process butcher 2003 14 m b b max a d k b a d a 1 s s e w t 1 where m b represents the remaining pollutant accumulation on a cell surface mg b max represents the maximum possible cumulative load of a pollutant per area mg mm2 k b is a semisaturated accumulation constant which is equal to the days required to reach half of b max ad represents the antecedent number of dry days d sse represents the removal ratio of accumulated pollutants via street sweeping and w t 1 represents the washed off mass loads in the last timestep mg these washed off pollutant loads are transported between neighboring cells in the direction of runoff exchange in addition to the newly washed off loads the pollution outflow from a single cell also include the pollutants contained in the current runoff water and the total load output is calculated as 15 l q t s a 10 6 c w where l represents the discharged pollutant load from the central cell to a specific neighboring cell during a timestep mg and c represents the pollutant concentration in the current runoff discharge mg l then from a global perspective the net inflow into each central cell is described as 16 l i j l i 1 j l i j 1 l i j 1 l i 1 j l i j where l i j represents the net inflow of nps pollution into the cell located at i j mg l i 1 j l i j 1 l i j 1 a n d l i 1 j represent inflow pollution from neighboring cells mg l i j represents the total number of outflow pollutants from the central cell which is equal to the sum of l i j in different directions coupled with the losses via infiltration and drainage the pollution load and concentration of a cell can be updated as 17 m t 1 q r c r l i j q i c q p c 18 c t 1 m t 1 re a 10 6 where m t 1 represents the new pollution load ponding on top of a cell surface at the end of a timestep mg c represents the current pollution concentration in a cell mg l q r represents the rainfall received by a cell l c r represents the pollutant concentration of rainfall mg l q i represents the infiltrated runoff volume l where q i i a 10 6 and q p represents the drained runoff volume l q p d a 10 6 it should be noted that infiltration or drainage loss and the discharge of pollutants at each calculation step should not exceed the current ponded pollution load in a cell otherwise either the actual loss or discharge should be the current remaining ponded pollution load 2 2 3 subsurface routing the runoff and nps pollution in a subsurface space are initially derived from overland drainages gironás et al 2010 the subsurface pipe routing of runoff and nps pollution is based on the manning equation for free surface pipe flow state although the manning equation is derived empirically for the flow in open channel and lacks provision for pressurized fluids its calculation result of the normal flow value can be regarded as the flow limitation during a timestep which is small enough for the quasi steady condition assumption the flow founded by the manning equation is supposed to be an approximate to the real pipe flow the manning equation is described as 19 q p 1 49 h p 2 3 s p 1 2 n p d p h p 20 l p q p t s 10 6 c p where q p represents the discharge flow rate from a central cell to a downstream cell mm3 s h p represents the runoff depth of the central pipe cell mm s p represents the pipe slope n p is the manning roughness coefficient of the pipeline d p represents the side length of a pipe section which is simplified into a square instead of a circle to save calculation costs mm l p represents nps pollution load routing from a central cell to a downstream cell mg and c p represents the pollution concentration in a central pipe cell mg l due to the simplified pipe system employed in this model average values of s p and d p are utilized for all pipe cells as for full pipe conditions the bernoulli s equation is provided as an alternate for the pipe flow simulation 21 pr 1 1 2 ρ v 1 2 ρ g δ z pr 2 1 2 ρ v 2 2 where v 1 and v 2 are the flow velocities at the upstream and downstream ends of a pipe segment respectively m s pr 1 and pr 2 are the pressures at the upstream and downstream ends of a pipe segment respectively pa ρ is the fluid density and supposed to be 1000 kg m3 for runoff water g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 δ z is the elevation difference determined by the pipe slope m then the redistributions of runoff flow volumes and nps pollutant loads in each pipe cell are calculated as austin et al 2014 22 q p t 1 q p t q

and outflow rates for a cell respectively p in and l p out represent the mass inflow and outflow rates for a cell respectively 2 3 modeling framework 2 3 1 setup process based on the above assumptions the modeling framework could be illustrated as shown in fig 2 the ca hnpsm is mainly based on the python 2 7 programming language as a high level open source programming language python is used in many domains such as scientific and numeric computation software development and web and internet development oliphant 2007 in our study scientific and numeric computations are involved while some fundamental packages mainly numpy and scipy are introduced to fulfill the scientific computations in addition spatial distribution results can be visualized by inputting the raster format data into the arcmap 10 2 software downloaded from http www arcgis com features 2 3 2 model input the required input for the ca hnpsm is similar to that of previous models including rainfall data land cover data dem drainage datasets lai data and street sweeping measures of these spatial data should be uniform in terms of raster resolution as they are the reference for determining the model s cell size specifically drainage datasets only consist of the locations and sizes of downspouts sewer system inlets average pipe slopes and section sizes and catchment outfall locations all of these data could be acquired by field monitoring or investigations from open sources the required model parameters such as time variant rainfall intensity land surface elevation digitalized land cover type and lai can be obtained directly by analyzing the spatial data while other parameter values could be obtained via calibration and validation the key parameters of this new model can be found in table 1 the overland hydrological and water quality parameters are set according to each cell s land cover type to represent spatial heterogeneity in addition cells with overland drainage or catchment outlet discharge are marked according to the drainage location information 2 3 3 model calibration an autocalibration platform is also coded to reduce manual calibration efforts this platform is constructed in a free cloud computing environment and based on the combination of the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii and multiobjective optimization bekele and nicklow 2007 during autocalibration sets of parameters that are valued randomly according to specific value ranges are introduced into the model sequentially and the corresponding simulation results at the catchment outlet are compared to the observations in a pairwise manner the matching degrees of these comparisons are evaluated by indicators such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and coefficient of determination r2 and ranked which allows for the selection of optimized parameter values for a better model performance 24 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 25 r 2 c o v o i p i v a r o i v a r p i 2 where o represents the observed value p represents the predicted value n represents the number of data points and o represents the mean observed value 2 3 4 model setup and results analysis after model initialization the cell state calculation and evolution based on local transition rules are executed in a time loop restricted by specified start and end simulation times a fixed timestep is set for the time loop duration to guarantee simulation continuity and the quasi steady condition as much as possible the temporal scale timestep size should be maintained lower than the minimum transition time between neighboring cells the spatial scale cell size is also extremely critical to model results specifically the cell size is not only related to surface flow characteristics but also related to the distribution of drainage inlets higher resolutions of the temporal and spatial scales could theoretically bring about more accurate results but also increase the expense of simulation efficiency in this study a cell size matching with the raster size of the input data is recommended for both the calculation convenience and the aim of analyzing the hydrological connected landscape configuration as for the temporal scale a test of different timestep sizes is recommended to conduct before the simulation the simulation results include overland routing maps hydrographs and pollution graphs at the catchment outlet of these the overland routing maps are saved sequentially during the time loop at a specified time interval while the outfall results are recorded at each timestep and output at the end of the time loop 3 case study the ca hnpsm was then tested in an urban catchment beijing normal university located in beijing china fig 3 this catchment covers a total drainage area of nearly 43 52 ha and consists of different land covers including asphalt surfaces concrete block pavements building roofs and permeable land covers e g green spaces and permeable pavements by analyzing the spatial data it is observed that the percent imperviousness is 65 which could be explained by obvious urban features and heterogeneous overland properties then the separate sewer system was constructed to drain the storm water to the final outlet connected to the municipal sewer system detailed input data for this study area can be found in our previous study dai et al 2018 the spatial data used in this study include land cover data 1 10000 dem data 5 m 5 m and the location coordinates of the sewer system inlets and outlets the rainfall series data at 5 min or 10 min intervals were recorded by a local meteorological station fig 3 field monitoring data include discharge flow series at 5 min intervals and scatter pollution cod nh4 n and tp concentrations for five independent rainfall events table 2 during the rainy season july september in 2014 which were obtained by an automated current meter and manual sampling at different intervals considering the first flush effect respectively then the monitored discharge flow and cod nh4 n and tp concentrations of three rainfall events 140729 140830 and 140926 were used for the calibrations and the other two rainfall events 140804 and 140831 were used for validation hydrological parameters were calibrated before the water quality parameters while some critical parameters were identified via a sensitivity analysis and selected for calibration the cell size was set to be as 5 m according to the resolution of input data thus guarantee the uniform land cover type and surface elevation of each cell then the whole study area is delineate into 17 411 cells a test of different timestep sizes was conducted to seek for an appropriate one the results indicated that acceptable hydrology simulations of rainfall events could be obtained with timestep sizes lower than 10 s as for pollutants their simulations responded more sensitively to the temporal scale and exhibit better performance with timestep size lower than 5 s based on an overall consideration of both the model performance and the simulation efficiency the timestep size was set as 1 s for the case study 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance results the calibrated parameter values are listed in table 3 the goodness of fit indicators for the calibration results via the ca hnpsm are listed in table 4 the hydrograph and pollute graph are shown in fig 4 for the hydrology simulation the nse and r2 values are all higher than 0 7 and 0 87 respectively excluding the rainfall event 0831 indicating that the new model performs well in the study area for the pollution simulation the nse and r2 values for cod all exceed 0 5 in the 0729 0830 and 0831 rainfall events the performances of the nh4n simulations are inferior to those of cod but are also acceptable with positive nse values the performances of the tp simulation during the calibrated events 0729 0830 and 0926 are also satisfactory as the nse and r2 values exceed or approximate 0 5 and 0 7 respectively by comparing with the observations the performance of the new ca hnpsm could be judged as good especially for heavy rainfall events however the model performance is relatively poor for light rainfall events 0804 which may be due to the following reasons first the overland flow process during the light rainfall event may be more sensitive to some local microtopography features which are difficult to measure and quantify melesse et al 2007 in addition the details of the sewer network structures such as the ponding capacity of manholes are not considered due to data availability which would show more impact on the model performance during light rainfall events dirksen et al 2014 overall the ca hnpsm shows good performance in simulating hydrographs and pollution graphs at the catchment outlet 4 2 overland routing results taking the 0729 rainfall event as an example the dynamical distributions of the runoff depths and pollutant concentrations throughout the catchment are shown in fig 5 for the study area the major pathways initially appear at locations with greater elevation differences between cells such as roads and edges of buildings in relatively flatter areas such as sports fields the routing process lags and is mainly determined by the distribution of draining points the distributions of pollutants are highly related to the hydrology routing process due to the nps pollution generation mechanism moreover the distributions of pollution accumulations during dry days which are the source terms of the nps pollution also affect the pollutant propagation process as illustrated in fig 4 roads are the major transmission routs for cod due to both the higher accumulation load and the greater runoff rate followed by roofs and impervious pavement lands while the cod distributions at areas with lower intensity of human activities such as the sports grounds are much lower in concentration compared to cod the concentrations of nh4n and tp are relatively more well distributed as they are mainly distributed at green lands and may loss substantially with runoff infiltration while at other areas low accumulation loads prevail and their distributions are uniform leading to minor generation by the wash off process and relatively uniform concentration distributions despite of the heterogeneous distribution of runoff depth in order to have an insight into the overland routing process some critical characteristic parameters are analyzed including the overland routing distance the effective impervious area eia and the time of concentration as illustrated in fig 6 the whole catchment is automatically delineated into 874 subcatchments according to the routing directions at each timestep the overland routing distances range from 5 m to 70 m with an average value of 44 m for each subcatchment along the overland routes the landscape configuration could be diverse and impact the routing process a lot chen et al 2009 pervious lands such as green land and pervious pavement are usually regarded as sink landscape during normal rainfall events by intercepting and infiltrating rainwater by running the ca hnpsm 52 77 of the pervious cells which occupies 18 47 of the whole catchment are found to be allocated at the direct downstream of impervious cells which could restrain or retard the routing process from upstream as the major source of urban rainfall runoff and pollutants the impervious areas only make substantial contributions to the hydrology and nps pollutions process when they are effectively connected to the sewer system without disconnection by the pervious areas eia is a widely used landscape concept to characterize the effectively connected impervious areas epps and hathaway 2018 in the case study the eia ratio founded by the ca hnpsm is 43 99 during the 0729 event which meant 67 68 of the impervious cells drains directly into the pipe inlets without flowing through any pervious areas the distribution of the eia is identified fig 7 and regarded as the main target for cost effective landscape optimization on this basis some specific measures are suggested such as transforming eia roofs into green roofs allocating lid measures like rain garden and bio swale in eia replacing impervious pavement with pervious pavement in eia with low traffic density zhang and chui 2017 throughout the whole catchment the time of concentration for cells range from 2 min to 270 min fig 6 which not only depended on the cells distance to the catchment outfall but also are related to their locations on the hydrological routs eia cells generally contribute to the outfall hydro pollution graph within the first 40 min during the rainfall event the major runoff and nps pollution transmission routes such as road roof and impervious pavements contribute to the outfall mainly during the first 8 20 min which basically match with the lag time of peak flow 20th minute and pollution concentrations 10 11th minute of the outfall discharge as for the non effective impervious areas or pervious cells the time of concentration for their generated runoff could even reach 270 min 4 3 comparison with current models the ca hnpsm developed in this study is primary for figuring out the response mechanism between the landscape configurations and the nps pollution the conventional approaches for this purpose mainly base on the statistical models and dedicate efforts to establish the relationship between the water quality indicators and the landscape metrics which characterizing the overall landscape compositions or spatial layout liu et al 2018 however an insight into the overland nps pollution process under the impact of landscape configuration is still necessary to guide the specific design work of landscape planning and allocation of storm water management measures zhang et al 2018b distributed models have now become the most favorable approaches for nps pollution studies as their physically based schemes and the spatial temporally heterogeneous structures fatichi et al 2016 with the development of the computing technology various distributed models have emerged prominently in recent decades each of these models was primarily developed to solving a few specific problems and has its own advantages and drawbacks among the mature distributed models swmm is one of the most widely used for the urban rainfall runoff and nps pollution studies the model structure involving both the subcatchment based semi distributed overland module and the explicit sewer pipe module which enables the swmm to predict the overland generation in each subcatchment and the migration process in the sewer conduits however this semi distribution module also brings about some application limitations such as the simplification of the localized routing process inside subcatchments and the highly dependence on sewer system data gironás et al 2010 krebs et al 2014 therefore seldom application of the swmm is reported in studying the detailed routing process and the influence from the landscape pattern in addition data scarcity usually hinder its application in large scale studies the ca algorithm adopted in the ca hnpsm could partly make up for the above deficiencies by changing the subcatchment based structure into grid based and describing the global process derived from local cells interactions besides its self evolution mechanism may help saving efforts of delineating subcatchments based on ca the ca hnpsm involves in the artificial drainage and the pollutant build up and wash off approaches in the swmm thus expanding the algorithm s current application to the urban nps pollution simulation in addition a simplified sewer routing approach could save efforts of collecting sewer system data and improve the model s feasibility in large scale areas from the simulation results an acceptable performance was obtained regarding the overland process and the total discharge at the outfall despite of the indistinct migration details in sewer pipes however it should be noted that uncertainties are always a major concern involved with rainfall runoff and nps pollution modeling and simulation shen et al 2015b sohrabi et al 2002 specifically for urban catchments highly heterogeneous land surfaces and intensive human activities further intensify these uncertainties fraga et al 2016 wijesiri et al 2016 on the one hand the relatively idealized neighborhood type and transition rules employed in this study reduce the computational complexity but on the other hand may neglect some possible flow routes in addition inaccurate monitoring data could also cause uncertainties in the calibration deletic et al 2012 shen 2015 thus the effect of cell resolution and the threshold for the degree of simplification for the drainage data inputs are supposed to be further studied to identify basic data requirements for reference in large scale studies in addition the ca hnpsm should be tested in more types of urban catchments to capture urban landscape optimizations the uncertainties introduced by different neighborhood types and flow direction algorithms coupled with rainfall types should also be further analyzed 5 conclusions in this study the ca hnpsm is constructed to simulate urban rainfall runoff and nps pollution the advantages of the ca hnpsm are as follows 1 the ca based overland runoff routing algorithm and nps pollution module were combined 2 both urban artificial drainage networks and roofs were considered by constructing three layer spaces and 3 a simplified pipe routing module was introduced to improve the applicability of the ca algorithm in urban nps pollution studies with insufficient drainage data the ca hnpsm shows good performance in the real case study of an urban catchment in beijing china where detailed overland routing processes characterized by the spatial temporal distribution overland routing distance and time of concentration as well as the outlet s hydrological and pollution graphs are obtained landscape configurations along the overland flow routs including the allocation of pervious areas and the distribution of eia could also be identified these overland results can be used as powerful reference for optimized landscape planning and the allocation of management measures however some limitations of the method are worthwhile to be noted the quasi steady assumption adopted in this study may limit its application in extreme storm events and urban flash flood conditions besides the uncertainties introduced by different neighborhood types and flow direction algorithms coupled with rainfall types should also be further analyzed

6858,overland routing processes are critical for understanding the water environment impact of the urbanization induced land cover change and guiding the optimized landscape planning however current models generally tend to simplify the overland flow process by a semi distributed routing approach in this study the cellular automata based hydrology and nps pollution model ca hnpsm is established by integrating the ca based overland runoff routing algorithm and the nps pollution module three layer spaces were also constructed by considering the hydrological connection among urban roofs land surfaces and artificial drainage networks simplified sewer routing modules were introduced to improve the applicability of the ca algorithm in urban nps pollution studies with insufficient drainage data then the ca hnpsm is tested in a real case study on an urban catchment in beijing china based on the results the ca hnpsm shows good performance in both the hydrological and nps simulations in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and coefficient of determination detailed overland routing processes and hydrological and pollution results are provided in addition landscape configurations along the overland flow routs could also be identified these overland results can be used as powerful reference for optimized landscape planning and the allocation of management measures keywords cellular automata nonpoint source pollution hydrology overland routing process landscape configuration urban 1 introduction as the modern world s epicenter for sociopolitical power and economic development urbanization has resulted in dramatic environmental changes including altered hydrology increased rainfall runoff and more serious nonpoint source nps pollution chen et al 2018a risi et al 2017 specifically due to the expansion of the impervious land covers and sewer systems associated with urbanization the hydrological overland routing process has changed greatly which has proven to exert significant influence on the transport of both the rainfall runoff and pollutants and ultimately affect the discharged water quantity and quality shen et al 2015a ullah et al 2018 in addition compared to natural catchments the land planning and intensive human activities increased the fragmentation and heterogeneity of land cover configurations leading to complex interactions between upstream and downstream land covers connected by the hydrological routs during the overland routing process deng et al 2009 nagendra et al 2004 a better understanding of the overland routing process would be helpful for evaluating the water environment impact of the urbanization induced land cover change liu et al 2018 zhou and li 2015 and exert optimized land planning and water environment management measures such as low impact development lid green infrastructures gi and sponge city planning etc miles and band 2015 zhang and chui 2017 to date some present studies have been dedicated to quantify the rainfall runoff and nps pollution output in urban areas and evaluate the effect on them from the urban landscape pattern initially field monitoring of the runoff flow and water quality was the primary method for characterizing the rainfall runoff and nps pollution generation chen et al 2018b zhi et al 2018 however it would be time consuming and labor intensive when conduct field monitoring along the entire overland flow routs especially in large catchments in large scale studies researchers tended to just monitor water flow and quality at the catchment outlet cross sections tried to establish the statistical relationship between the landscape metrics and water quality indicators zhang et al 2018a this approach confines attention to the landscape compositions and spatial configurations but neglect their hydrological connections and pollution interactions which will result in incorrect assessment of the response relation between landscape nps pollution induced water quality degradation zhang et al 2018b with the development of the modeling technology physical based distributed or semi distributed models have been gradually employed to rainfall runoff and nps pollution simulations fatichi et al 2016 compared to field monitoring these models use less monitoring data to calibrate parameters and are cost effective for presenting the spatial temporal distributions of runoff water and nps pollution fatichi et al 2016 these models such as the storm water management model swmm shin et al 2017 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model chang and li 2017 and source loading and management model slamm pitt 1998 regard sub catchments or sub watersheds as basic computational units with homogeneous topographic characteristics while their generated rainfall runoff and nps pollutants are routed to corresponding sewer inlets gironás et al 2010 but are still too simplified in the localized interactions of different units to deal with detailed process besides the high dependence on the detailed sewer network data limits these models application in large scale or data scarce urban catchments krebs et al 2014 a new model that combine the considerations of both the detailed overland process and the feasibility in data scarce catchments is needed the cellular automata ca method which was first proposed in the 1950s has developed into a supplement for calculating runoff routing and pollution transport as a local to global algorithm the ca could discretize the spatiotemporal dimension and achieve the global evolution of complex macroscopic phenomena based on simple neighborhood transition rules gregorio and serra 1999 compared to the widely used subcatchment based models the ca could fully represent the spatial heterogeneity by a grid based structure matched with input raster data thus be a more adequate tool for involving in the landscape elements with the overland routing process compared to conventional algorithms such as the single direction d8 algorithm and the multi direction md8 algorithm xu and tang 2018 the ca method considers temporally dynamic water depths in addition to land surface elevation when determining the flow direction thus it describes a more reliable dynamic flow routing behavior currently the ca has been applied to study many natural phenomena including the hydrological simulation of braided rivers murray and paola 1994 complex fluid flows zhang and kwok 2013 and unsaturated flows folino et al 2006 in recent years the ca has been applied for overland flow simulation such as the runca model by shao et al 2015 the hillslope scale ecohydrological model by mendicino et al 2013 and the ca based unsteady flow model by parsons and fonstad 2007 these ca based models have been used to simulate urban flood inundation and the associated interaction between surface flow and sewer overflow abbasizadeh et al 2018 liu et al 2014 however as far as we know the consideration of urban land cover characteristics and artificial sewer system is still limited when applying current ca based models to urban catchments besides there is no ca related overland routing algorithm for nps pollution associated with rainfall runoff in this study a ca based nps pollution model ca hnpsm is established to study urban rainfall runoff and nps pollution processes both the runoff routing algorithm and pollutant transport algorithm are considered and integrated then the ca hnpsm is tested in a real case study on an urban catchment in beijing china the landscape configuration along the overland hydrological routes and the nps pollution routing process are provided in detail 2 model development the ca hnpsm model consists of an overland routing module and a subsurface routing module for each module both the hydrological and nps pollution calculations are involved based on the water balance and mass conservation assumptions the routing processes are described by the ca method ranging from local interactions to global evolutions thus the description and key assumptions of the ca are given first followed by the governing equation while the modeling framework is described at the end of this section 2 1 ca description and key assumptions the structure of the ca dynamic system can be described as a quadruple function shao et al 2015 1 s t 1 f l d s t n r where s t 1 represents the set of cell states at a new timestep l d represents the d dimensional lattice space of the cells covering the study area s t represents the set of cell states at the current time t n represents the neighborhood of a central cell and the surrounding cells and r represents the local transition rule specifying how the cell state changes the meanings of these elements in this study are described as follows 2 1 1 lattice space for the ca hnpsm the studied catchment was simplified into a lattice space with three vertical layers including the roof layer land surface layer and subsurface sewer system layer roofs and land surfaces are generalized as 2d lattice spaces of overland routing process while the subsurface layer for pipe routing process is generalized as a set of separate 1d lattice spaces from each pipe inlet to the catchment outlet then the time area method her and heatwole 2016 is used to sum up the respective hydrographs and pollute graphs at the end of each 1d space to be the output of the whole system thus minimize the dependence on detailed drainage network data the interfaces between layers represented drainages from one layer to another via artificial structures including downspouts onto building roofs and pipe inlets onto land surfaces abbasizadeh et al 2018 boundary cells are added to both the land and sub surface layers to define the relationship between cell states inside and outside of the study area shao et al 2015 specifically the cells located at the borders of the land surface are treated as the closed boundary cells where no overland flow routs beyond while the cell at the sub surface outlet is regarded as the open boundary cell to track the flow volume and pollution load leaving the study area 2 1 2 cell states the cell state indicates the runoff e g runoff depth and pollutant e g load or concentration characteristics for each cell at a specific timestep as a model mainly aimed at normal rainfall events where the water depths are small relative to cell size and pollutants propagate slowly the cell states of runoff and pollutants in this study are assumed to be in quasi steady conditions during each time step these cell states are initialized before the simulation and evolve automatically at each timestep during evolution the states of overland cells including roof and land cells at each timestep are not only determined by the rainfall redistribution and pollutant wash off in a cell itself but also water and pollutant exchanges within the neighborhood controlled by local transition rules see section 2 1 4 for the subsurface cell space the only source for the pipe cell is drainage from the land surface therefore runoff and pollutant generation only occur in cells with pipe inlets while other cell states are determined by their upstream and downstream cell states and redistribution guided by the pipe routing rules 2 1 3 local neighborhood the von neumann neighborhood algorithm which includes four cells neighboring the central cell in four cardinal directions is used for roof and land surfaces to define areas where the influence of local neighborhoods occurs as a simple neighborhood type the von neumann neighborhood has been widely used in recent ca based overland flow models folino et al 2006 parsons and fonstad 2007 compared to other more complex methods such as the moore and hexagonal type methods the von neumann neighborhood algorithm integrates local process rules with the raster format of the basic input data and guarantees system symmetry in different directions for pipe cells only its two neighboring cells located upstream and downstream of the central cell are considered 2 1 4 neighborhood transition rules three neighborhood transition rules are set in this study including the overland flow direction rule the roof land rule and the subsurface routing rule 1 overland routing rule in this study we assume that overland flow directions are basically determined by the differences in real time water levels that are determined by the sum of each cell s surface elevation and its ponded runoff depth the widely used minimum difference algorithm mda gregorio and serra 1999 is employed to identify flow directions and volumes based on the principle that a dynamic system always tends to be in equilibrium as illustrated in fig 1 the algorithm first eliminates the neighboring cells with water levels that are higher than that of the central cell then the average water level is calculated for the remaining cells by comparing the average value to the water level of each remaining neighboring cell those with higher water levels are eliminated again for each neighborhood this paradigm is repeated and looped for each timestep until no neighboring cell can be eliminated finally the remaining cells are identified to obtain the runoff flow from the central cell and their average water level is calculated compared to single direction d4 or d8 flow algorithms xu and tang 2018 mda allows the outflow from the central cell to multi directions which is more approximate to the dispersion of the real urban rainfall runoff flow besides mda take the water component into account when decide the flow direction which is more helpful to capture the dynamic flow behaviors shao et al 2015 on this basis the runoff rates are calculated via the manning equation by considering the effects of land surface characteristics such as slope and surface roughness besides in order to avoid redundant back and forth flow between central and neighbor cells the runoff rates are restrained below the difference between the receiving neighbor cells water levels and the last average water level when urban flood occurs in extreme storm events the simulation by the shallow water equations are suggested as an option 2 roof land rule one unique fact that should be noted in urban catchments is that runoff routing from building roofs to land surfaces is usually via downspouts instead of elevation gradients thus a roof land rule is set in neighborhoods with a central roof cell and neighboring land cells instead of using the water level based mda this rule specifies a one way flow from roofs to land via downspouts first the algorithm automatically identifies roof cells with downspouts and their neighboring land cells by assuming that the downspouts are distributed along the building perimeter at a specific interval then groups of paired roof land cells are regarded as the only links between the separate roof and land cell spaces finally runoff drainage via downspouts during each timestep is calculated subtracted from upstream roof cells and added instantly to corresponding downstream land cells 3 subsurface routing rule another important fact in urban hydrology is that an artificial subsurface routing system significantly affects runoff and nps pollution outputs in this study the subsurface routing rule links land cells and subsurface cells at the interface cells where the pipe inlets are located a transition is designed for runoff drainage and sewer overflow at each interface in normal conditions the overland runoff routs into pipe layer through sewer inlet interfaces while if overflow occurs when all of the pipe cells are saturated with runoff the leakage water derived from the pipe routing process transitions from the pipe layer to the land layer in opposite directions in the pipe layer a downstream forward transition motivated by the pipe slope is assumed austin et al 2014 the flow rate from the central pipe cell to its downstream neighboring cell is calculated by the manning equation for the free surface flow state gironás et al 2010 kwon 2014 and the bernoulli s equation for the full pipe flow state as an alternate isenmann et al 2016 nps pollutants are supposed to form a transmission with runoff flow and gradually attenuate at a first order decay rate menzies et al 2017 2 2 governing equations 2 2 1 hydrological component the runoff generation and routing process is based on the water balance principle and the quasi steady assumption during a small timestep the hydrological state of a cell is regarded to be uniform which is a reasonable approximation during the normal rainfall events with relatively shadow runoff depth runoff generation in each cell could be described by the following equation 2 re r p i d s d where re represents the runoff depth mm r represents the discrete rainfall mm p represents the rainwater intercepted by vegetation mm i represents the infiltrated rainwater on pervious land covers mm ds represents the rainwater stored in depressions in land surfaces mm where this parameter reflects the micromorphological characteristics and amends the effects of insufficient resolution in the dem data to an extent and d represents the rainwater drained by roof downspouts or sewer system inlets mm here evapotranspiration is neglected as it is not significant during rainfall event simulations the intercepted rainfall is calculated as aston 1979 shao et al 2015 3 p cum p max 1 e x p 0 046 l a i r cum p max where p cum represents the cumulative intercepted rainwater mm r cum represents the cumulative rainfall mm lai represents the leaf area index and p max represents the maximum storage capacity and is a function of the lai deroo et al 1996 von hoyningen huene 1981 4 p max 0 935 0 498 l a i 0 00575 lai 2 then the intercepted rainwater p is calculated by the difference in p cum at two successive timesteps it should be noted that the above relation of lai and p cum is initially obtained for crops or and natural vegetation deroo et al 1996 and is introduced in this study for urban green land by considering the similarity of the rainfall interception mechanism by leaves of whether the urban or natural vegetation the horton infiltration method is as follows gironás et al 2010 5 i f u f 0 f u e k d t t s where i represents the infiltration per unit area during a timestep mm f u represents the minimum or equilibrium infiltration rate mm s f 0 represents the maximum or initial infiltration rate mm s t represents the time from the beginning of the storm s k d is the decay coefficient s 1 and ts represents the timestep size s the drainage rates of downspouts and pipe inlets could be calculated by either the weir flow model or orifice flow model based on the ponded runoff depth in a cell liu et al 2014 xiuhui 1999 a critical runoff depth h c which causes the calculated weir flow to be equal to the orifice flow should be identified as a reference when switching between the two drainage models the weir flow model is used when h is less than h c otherwise the orifice flow model is used weir flow model 6 d ts c w p h 1 5 a orifice flow model 7 d t s c o a d 2 g h 0 5 a where d represents the rainfall drainage per unit area mm a represents the area of the cell a b b mm2 c w is the weir flow coefficient p represents the wetted perimeter mm h represents the ponded runoff depth before discharging into the downspouts or pipe inlets mm c o is the orifice flow coefficient and a d represents the area of the drainage inlet or downspout mm2 the exchange volume of runoff water between neighboring cells is calculated using the manning equation 8 q 1 49 r e 2 3 s 1 2 n r e b where q represents the outflow runoff rate per unit area from the central cell to a specific neighboring cell mm s b represents the side length of a square cell mm n is the manning coefficient and s represents the water surface slope it should be noted that the manning equation was derived for steady uniform flow when gravity force balance friction so that water depth remains constant in time and space therefore its application in this study is based on the assumed quasi steady condition but is limited for simulating extreme weather events when urban flash flood occurs and the overland flow tends to be unsteady dynamic system as for the urban flash flood scenarios in extreme storms events the rain runoff propagation is suggested to be simulated using the shallow water equations and can be expressed as 9 h t h u j x j r e 10 h u i t h u i u j x j g 2 h 2 x i v 2 h u i x j x j f i where x is distance t is time i a n d j are the cartesian directions u is the flow velocity mm s v is the coefficient of kinematic viscosity h is the water depth mm g is the acceleration of gravity f i is the force term in the direction i and is regarded as the frictional force is this study the net inflow into each cell is calculated by the difference between the total inflow from neighboring cells and the total outflow into neighboring cells 11 q i j q i 1 j q i j 1 q i j 1 q i 1 j q i j t s where q i j represents the net inflow per unit area of the cell located at i j mm q i 1 j q i j 1 q i j 1 a n d q i 1 j represent the inflows from four neighboring cells located at cardinal directions mm and q i j represents the total outflow of the cell i j which is the sum of q with its neighboring cell in a different direction at the end of each timestep the runoff depth of each cell is updated 12 re t 1 re t q i j we assumed that the runoff discharge at each timestep should not exceed the current ponded runoff depth in a cell otherwise the actual discharge be regarded as the current remained ponded runoff 2 2 2 pollutant component the nps pollution is initially generated from the wash off of constituents deposited during dry periods guo et al 2018 wang et al 2011 during its overland routing process pollutants are assumed to be conserved without deposition or decay gironás et al 2010 with the simulated overland flow newly washed off pollutant loads in each cell during a given timestep are calculated by the most oft cited exponential function which was first proposed by sartor and boyd sartor et al 1974 13 w k w q n w m b t s where w represents the washed off mass load mg k w is the wash off coefficient mm h nw h 1 n w represents the wash off exponent m b represents the remaining pollutant accumulation in a cell mg which is initially calculated by a saturated function partially removed by street sweeping during dry periods and gradually reduced with the wash off process butcher 2003 14 m b b max a d k b a d a 1 s s e w t 1 where m b represents the remaining pollutant accumulation on a cell surface mg b max represents the maximum possible cumulative load of a pollutant per area mg mm2 k b is a semisaturated accumulation constant which is equal to the days required to reach half of b max ad represents the antecedent number of dry days d sse represents the removal ratio of accumulated pollutants via street sweeping and w t 1 represents the washed off mass loads in the last timestep mg these washed off pollutant loads are transported between neighboring cells in the direction of runoff exchange in addition to the newly washed off loads the pollution outflow from a single cell also include the pollutants contained in the current runoff water and the total load output is calculated as 15 l q t s a 10 6 c w where l represents the discharged pollutant load from the central cell to a specific neighboring cell during a timestep mg and c represents the pollutant concentration in the current runoff discharge mg l then from a global perspective the net inflow into each central cell is described as 16 l i j l i 1 j l i j 1 l i j 1 l i 1 j l i j where l i j represents the net inflow of nps pollution into the cell located at i j mg l i 1 j l i j 1 l i j 1 a n d l i 1 j represent inflow pollution from neighboring cells mg l i j represents the total number of outflow pollutants from the central cell which is equal to the sum of l i j in different directions coupled with the losses via infiltration and drainage the pollution load and concentration of a cell can be updated as 17 m t 1 q r c r l i j q i c q p c 18 c t 1 m t 1 re a 10 6 where m t 1 represents the new pollution load ponding on top of a cell surface at the end of a timestep mg c represents the current pollution concentration in a cell mg l q r represents the rainfall received by a cell l c r represents the pollutant concentration of rainfall mg l q i represents the infiltrated runoff volume l where q i i a 10 6 and q p represents the drained runoff volume l q p d a 10 6 it should be noted that infiltration or drainage loss and the discharge of pollutants at each calculation step should not exceed the current ponded pollution load in a cell otherwise either the actual loss or discharge should be the current remaining ponded pollution load 2 2 3 subsurface routing the runoff and nps pollution in a subsurface space are initially derived from overland drainages gironás et al 2010 the subsurface pipe routing of runoff and nps pollution is based on the manning equation for free surface pipe flow state although the manning equation is derived empirically for the flow in open channel and lacks provision for pressurized fluids its calculation result of the normal flow value can be regarded as the flow limitation during a timestep which is small enough for the quasi steady condition assumption the flow founded by the manning equation is supposed to be an approximate to the real pipe flow the manning equation is described as 19 q p 1 49 h p 2 3 s p 1 2 n p d p h p 20 l p q p t s 10 6 c p where q p represents the discharge flow rate from a central cell to a downstream cell mm3 s h p represents the runoff depth of the central pipe cell mm s p represents the pipe slope n p is the manning roughness coefficient of the pipeline d p represents the side length of a pipe section which is simplified into a square instead of a circle to save calculation costs mm l p represents nps pollution load routing from a central cell to a downstream cell mg and c p represents the pollution concentration in a central pipe cell mg l due to the simplified pipe system employed in this model average values of s p and d p are utilized for all pipe cells as for full pipe conditions the bernoulli s equation is provided as an alternate for the pipe flow simulation 21 pr 1 1 2 ρ v 1 2 ρ g δ z pr 2 1 2 ρ v 2 2 where v 1 and v 2 are the flow velocities at the upstream and downstream ends of a pipe segment respectively m s pr 1 and pr 2 are the pressures at the upstream and downstream ends of a pipe segment respectively pa ρ is the fluid density and supposed to be 1000 kg m3 for runoff water g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 δ z is the elevation difference determined by the pipe slope m then the redistributions of runoff flow volumes and nps pollutant loads in each pipe cell are calculated as austin et al 2014 22 q p t 1 q p t q p in q p out t s 23 p p t 1 p p t l p in l p out e x p k ts 86400 where q p t a n d q p t 1 represent the runoff volumes in a pipe cell at the current and following timestep respectively mm3 p p t and p p t 1 represent the pollution loads in a pipe cell at the current and following timestep respectively and k is the first order decay coefficient d 1 q p in and q p out represent the runoff inflow and outflow rates for a cell respectively p in and l p out represent the mass inflow and outflow rates for a cell respectively 2 3 modeling framework 2 3 1 setup process based on the above assumptions the modeling framework could be illustrated as shown in fig 2 the ca hnpsm is mainly based on the python 2 7 programming language as a high level open source programming language python is used in many domains such as scientific and numeric computation software development and web and internet development oliphant 2007 in our study scientific and numeric computations are involved while some fundamental packages mainly numpy and scipy are introduced to fulfill the scientific computations in addition spatial distribution results can be visualized by inputting the raster format data into the arcmap 10 2 software downloaded from http www arcgis com features 2 3 2 model input the required input for the ca hnpsm is similar to that of previous models including rainfall data land cover data dem drainage datasets lai data and street sweeping measures of these spatial data should be uniform in terms of raster resolution as they are the reference for determining the model s cell size specifically drainage datasets only consist of the locations and sizes of downspouts sewer system inlets average pipe slopes and section sizes and catchment outfall locations all of these data could be acquired by field monitoring or investigations from open sources the required model parameters such as time variant rainfall intensity land surface elevation digitalized land cover type and lai can be obtained directly by analyzing the spatial data while other parameter values could be obtained via calibration and validation the key parameters of this new model can be found in table 1 the overland hydrological and water quality parameters are set according to each cell s land cover type to represent spatial heterogeneity in addition cells with overland drainage or catchment outlet discharge are marked according to the drainage location information 2 3 3 model calibration an autocalibration platform is also coded to reduce manual calibration efforts this platform is constructed in a free cloud computing environment and based on the combination of the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii and multiobjective optimization bekele and nicklow 2007 during autocalibration sets of parameters that are valued randomly according to specific value ranges are introduced into the model sequentially and the corresponding simulation results at the catchment outlet are compared to the observations in a pairwise manner the matching degrees of these comparisons are evaluated by indicators such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and coefficient of determination r2 and ranked which allows for the selection of optimized parameter values for a better model performance 24 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 25 r 2 c o v o i p i v a r o i v a r p i 2 where o represents the observed value p represents the predicted value n represents the number of data points and o represents the mean observed value 2 3 4 model setup and results analysis after model initialization the cell state calculation and evolution based on local transition rules are executed in a time loop restricted by specified start and end simulation times a fixed timestep is set for the time loop duration to guarantee simulation continuity and the quasi steady condition as much as possible the temporal scale timestep size should be maintained lower than the minimum transition time between neighboring cells the spatial scale cell size is also extremely critical to model results specifically the cell size is not only related to surface flow characteristics but also related to the distribution of drainage inlets higher resolutions of the temporal and spatial scales could theoretically bring about more accurate results but also increase the expense of simulation efficiency in this study a cell size matching with the raster size of the input data is recommended for both the calculation convenience and the aim of analyzing the hydrological connected landscape configuration as for the temporal scale a test of different timestep sizes is recommended to conduct before the simulation the simulation results include overland routing maps hydrographs and pollution graphs at the catchment outlet of these the overland routing maps are saved sequentially during the time loop at a specified time interval while the outfall results are recorded at each timestep and output at the end of the time loop 3 case study the ca hnpsm was then tested in an urban catchment beijing normal university located in beijing china fig 3 this catchment covers a total drainage area of nearly 43 52 ha and consists of different land covers including asphalt surfaces concrete block pavements building roofs and permeable land covers e g green spaces and permeable pavements by analyzing the spatial data it is observed that the percent imperviousness is 65 which could be explained by obvious urban features and heterogeneous overland properties then the separate sewer system was constructed to drain the storm water to the final outlet connected to the municipal sewer system detailed input data for this study area can be found in our previous study dai et al 2018 the spatial data used in this study include land cover data 1 10000 dem data 5 m 5 m and the location coordinates of the sewer system inlets and outlets the rainfall series data at 5 min or 10 min intervals were recorded by a local meteorological station fig 3 field monitoring data include discharge flow series at 5 min intervals and scatter pollution cod nh4 n and tp concentrations for five independent rainfall events table 2 during the rainy season july september in 2014 which were obtained by an automated current meter and manual sampling at different intervals considering the first flush effect respectively then the monitored discharge flow and cod nh4 n and tp concentrations of three rainfall events 140729 140830 and 140926 were used for the calibrations and the other two rainfall events 140804 and 140831 were used for validation hydrological parameters were calibrated before the water quality parameters while some critical parameters were identified via a sensitivity analysis and selected for calibration the cell size was set to be as 5 m according to the resolution of input data thus guarantee the uniform land cover type and surface elevation of each cell then the whole study area is delineate into 17 411 cells a test of different timestep sizes was conducted to seek for an appropriate one the results indicated that acceptable hydrology simulations of rainfall events could be obtained with timestep sizes lower than 10 s as for pollutants their simulations responded more sensitively to the temporal scale and exhibit better performance with timestep size lower than 5 s based on an overall consideration of both the model performance and the simulation efficiency the timestep size was set as 1 s for the case study 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance results the calibrated parameter values are listed in table 3 the goodness of fit indicators for the calibration results via the ca hnpsm are listed in table 4 the hydrograph and pollute graph are shown in fig 4 for the hydrology simulation the nse and r2 values are all higher than 0 7 and 0 87 respectively excluding the rainfall event 0831 indicating that the new model performs well in the study area for the pollution simulation the nse and r2 values for cod all exceed 0 5 in the 0729 0830 and 0831 rainfall events the performances of the nh4n simulations are inferior to those of cod but are also acceptable with positive nse values the performances of the tp simulation during the calibrated events 0729 0830 and 0926 are also satisfactory as the nse and r2 values exceed or approximate 0 5 and 0 7 respectively by comparing with the observations the performance of the new ca hnpsm could be judged as good especially for heavy rainfall events however the model performance is relatively poor for light rainfall events 0804 which may be due to the following reasons first the overland flow process during the light rainfall event may be more sensitive to some local microtopography features which are difficult to measure and quantify melesse et al 2007 in addition the details of the sewer network structures such as the ponding capacity of manholes are not considered due to data availability which would show more impact on the model performance during light rainfall events dirksen et al 2014 overall the ca hnpsm shows good performance in simulating hydrographs and pollution graphs at the catchment outlet 4 2 overland routing results taking the 0729 rainfall event as an example the dynamical distributions of the runoff depths and pollutant concentrations throughout the catchment are shown in fig 5 for the study area the major pathways initially appear at locations with greater elevation differences between cells such as roads and edges of buildings in relatively flatter areas such as sports fields the routing process lags and is mainly determined by the distribution of draining points the distributions of pollutants are highly related to the hydrology routing process due to the nps pollution generation mechanism moreover the distributions of pollution accumulations during dry days which are the source terms of the nps pollution also affect the pollutant propagation process as illustrated in fig 4 roads are the major transmission routs for cod due to both the higher accumulation load and the greater runoff rate followed by roofs and impervious pavement lands while the cod distributions at areas with lower intensity of human activities such as the sports grounds are much lower in concentration compared to cod the concentrations of nh4n and tp are relatively more well distributed as they are mainly distributed at green lands and may loss substantially with runoff infiltration while at other areas low accumulation loads prevail and their distributions are uniform leading to minor generation by the wash off process and relatively uniform concentration distributions despite of the heterogeneous distribution of runoff depth in order to have an insight into the overland routing process some critical characteristic parameters are analyzed including the overland routing distance the effective impervious area eia and the time of concentration as illustrated in fig 6 the whole catchment is automatically delineated into 874 subcatchments according to the routing directions at each timestep the overland routing distances range from 5 m to 70 m with an average value of 44 m for each subcatchment along the overland routes the landscape configuration could be diverse and impact the routing process a lot chen et al 2009 pervious lands such as green land and pervious pavement are usually regarded as sink landscape during normal rainfall events by intercepting and infiltrating rainwater by running the ca hnpsm 52 77 of the pervious cells which occupies 18 47 of the whole catchment are found to be allocated at the direct downstream of impervious cells which could restrain or retard the routing process from upstream as the major source of urban rainfall runoff and pollutants the impervious areas only make substantial contributions to the hydrology and nps pollutions process when they are effectively connected to the sewer system without disconnection by the pervious areas eia is a widely used landscape concept to characterize the effectively connected impervious areas epps and hathaway 2018 in the case study the eia ratio founded by the ca hnpsm is 43 99 during the 0729 event which meant 67 68 of the impervious cells drains directly into the pipe inlets without flowing through any pervious areas the distribution of the eia is identified fig 7 and regarded as the main target for cost effective landscape optimization on this basis some specific measures are suggested such as transforming eia roofs into green roofs allocating lid measures like rain garden and bio swale in eia replacing impervious pavement with pervious pavement in eia with low traffic density zhang and chui 2017 throughout the whole catchment the time of concentration for cells range from 2 min to 270 min fig 6 which not only depended on the cells distance to the catchment outfall but also are related to their locations on the hydrological routs eia cells generally contribute to the outfall hydro pollution graph within the first 40 min during the rainfall event the major runoff and nps pollution transmission routes such as road roof and impervious pavements contribute to the outfall mainly during the first 8 20 min which basically match with the lag time of peak flow 20th minute and pollution concentrations 10 11th minute of the outfall discharge as for the non effective impervious areas or pervious cells the time of concentration for their generated runoff could even reach 270 min 4 3 comparison with current models the ca hnpsm developed in this study is primary for figuring out the response mechanism between the landscape configurations and the nps pollution the conventional approaches for this purpose mainly base on the statistical models and dedicate efforts to establish the relationship between the water quality indicators and the landscape metrics which characterizing the overall landscape compositions or spatial layout liu et al 2018 however an insight into the overland nps pollution process under the impact of landscape configuration is still necessary to guide the specific design work of landscape planning and allocation of storm water management measures zhang et al 2018b distributed models have now become the most favorable approaches for nps pollution studies as their physically based schemes and the spatial temporally heterogeneous structures fatichi et al 2016 with the development of the computing technology various distributed models have emerged prominently in recent decades each of these models was primarily developed to solving a few specific problems and has its own advantages and drawbacks among the mature distributed models swmm is one of the most widely used for the urban rainfall runoff and nps pollution studies the model structure involving both the subcatchment based semi distributed overland module and the explicit sewer pipe module which enables the swmm to predict the overland generation in each subcatchment and the migration process in the sewer conduits however this semi distribution module also brings about some application limitations such as the simplification of the localized routing process inside subcatchments and the highly dependence on sewer system data gironás et al 2010 krebs et al 2014 therefore seldom application of the swmm is reported in studying the detailed routing process and the influence from the landscape pattern in addition data scarcity usually hinder its application in large scale studies the ca algorithm adopted in the ca hnpsm could partly make up for the above deficiencies by changing the subcatchment based structure into grid based and describing the global process derived from local cells interactions besides its self evolution mechanism may help saving efforts of delineating subcatchments based on ca the ca hnpsm involves in the artificial drainage and the pollutant build up and wash off approaches in the swmm thus expanding the algorithm s current application to the urban nps pollution simulation in addition a simplified sewer routing approach could save efforts of collecting sewer system data and improve the model s feasibility in large scale areas from the simulation results an acceptable performance was obtained regarding the overland process and the total discharge at the outfall despite of the indistinct migration details in sewer pipes however it should be noted that uncertainties are always a major concern involved with rainfall runoff and nps pollution modeling and simulation shen et al 2015b sohrabi et al 2002 specifically for urban catchments highly heterogeneous land surfaces and intensive human activities further intensify these uncertainties fraga et al 2016 wijesiri et al 2016 on the one hand the relatively idealized neighborhood type and transition rules employed in this study reduce the computational complexity but on the other hand may neglect some possible flow routes in addition inaccurate monitoring data could also cause uncertainties in the calibration deletic et al 2012 shen 2015 thus the effect of cell resolution and the threshold for the degree of simplification for the drainage data inputs are supposed to be further studied to identify basic data requirements for reference in large scale studies in addition the ca hnpsm should be tested in more types of urban catchments to capture urban landscape optimizations the uncertainties introduced by different neighborhood types and flow direction algorithms coupled with rainfall types should also be further analyzed 5 conclusions in this study the ca hnpsm is constructed to simulate urban rainfall runoff and nps pollution the advantages of the ca hnpsm are as follows 1 the ca based overland runoff routing algorithm and nps pollution module were combined 2 both urban artificial drainage networks and roofs were considered by constructing three layer spaces and 3 a simplified pipe routing module was introduced to improve the applicability of the ca algorithm in urban nps pollution studies with insufficient drainage data the ca hnpsm shows good performance in the real case study of an urban catchment in beijing china where detailed overland routing processes characterized by the spatial temporal distribution overland routing distance and time of concentration as well as the outlet s hydrological and pollution graphs are obtained landscape configurations along the overland flow routs including the allocation of pervious areas and the distribution of eia could also be identified these overland results can be used as powerful reference for optimized landscape planning and the allocation of management measures however some limitations of the method are worthwhile to be noted the quasi steady assumption adopted in this study may limit its application in extreme storm events and urban flash flood conditions besides the uncertainties introduced by different neighborhood types and flow direction algorithms coupled with rainfall types should also be further analyzed

al 2014 conducted an extensive literature review of distributed physics based models according to their study only 19 of 183 publications were at the regional scale greater than 10 000 km2 and only two of those considered stream aquifer exchanges monteil 2011 pryet et al 2015 the eaudyssée platform pryet et al 2015 saleh et al 2011 includes an explicit quantification of stream aquifer exchanges moreover this platform uses in stream water level fluctuations for the discharge modeling at the regional scale considering the river stage fluctuations improve the accuracy of the discharge modeling baratelli et al 2016 and piezometric head vergnes and habets 2018 the research proposed herein incorporates a hydrological modeling system coupled with a meteorological analysis system and an agronomic model to better understand nutrient dynamics in surface water and groundwater interaction at large scale river networks and long term temporal periods for this purpose the eaudyssée model and agronomic model stics simulateur multidisciplinaire pour les cultures standard beaudoin et al 2016 brisson et al 1998 2002 were coupled to obtain the infiltrating nitrate flux leaving the root zones the météo france safran durand et al 1993 quintana seguí et al 2008 model was used to provide required meteorological data for the eaudyssée model in this study transport of nitrate from land to rivers and from aquifers to surface water and rivers were developed in the eaudyssée platform furthermore this study shows development of in stream nitrate simulation based on the large scale river routing model at the regional scale the river routing model in the eaudyssée platform is based on the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid david et al 2011b the annual precomputed flow from this model was applied to study the effect of climatologic and physiographic characteristics of a watershed on the regional total nitrogen modeling using steady state riverine nitrogen transport tavakoly et al 2016 the application of regional river routing model for long term unsteady nitrate simulations has yet to be studied the modeling system was implemented over the seine river basin srb in france due to increasing nitrate concentrations over time and the existence of several layers of aquifers the srb represents an ideal test bed for this regional ecosystem approach the integrated modeling system was run over 39 years 1971 2010 at the daily time step and results were compared with observations in groundwater and water quality stations the new enhancements allow the eaudyssée platform to simulate regional watershed flow and solute modeling with stream and aquifer interactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the srb covers an area of approximately 88 000 square kilometers in northern france fig 1 the seine river is 776 km long and has 25 000 km of tributaries table 1 it begins at an elevation of 446 m at source seine in the department of côte d or in burgundy and discharges into the english channel near the city of le havre table 1 shows that the stream gradients are not extremely varied although elevations range from 0 to 856 m above sea level in the basin 90 of the basin have an elevation below 300 m the hydrological regime of the srb is considered to be pluvial oceanic with varied seasonal flows high flows in winter and low flows in summer that reflect rainfall distribution throughout the year the srb also has several aquifers that play an important role in sustaining base flow rousset et al 2004 interactions of three major aquifers with the river network were considered in this study these aquifers are from top to bottom 1 oligocene aquifer that includes the beauce and brie aquifers 2 eocene aquifer that includes champigny lutetien and ypressien aquifers and 3 upper cretaceous chalk aquifer gomez et al 2003b the aquifers are relatively permeable from medium to high and are relatively vulnerable from medium to high the middle and lower eocene aquifer is composed of coarse limestones of lutetian and sands the total transmissivity varies from 5 to 10 4 m2 s the upper cretaceous chalk aquifer has porosity between 37 and 45 and a transmissivity less than 10 2 m2 s a full description of the seine aquifers is available at http sigessn brgm fr spip php rubrique5 the srb is predominantly covered by an intensive agricultural industry with up to 57 of the land surface allocated to agriculture mignolet et al 2007 which is the main source of nutrients entering rivers in europe de wit et al 2002 the rest of the basin is covered by forest 25 grassland 13 and urban 5 the center of the basin is mainly covered by cereal oilseed and sugar beet croplands the outer limit of the basin is mostly covered by forest and grassland garnier et al 2009 sferratore et al 2005 the srb is home to approximately 20 million inhabitants including 10 million people in the region of paris agricultural activity pollution sources and population density lead to water quality degradation and nutrient enrichment of the srb furthermore this basin includes a major aquifer system made with a series of connected aquifer layers that interact with surface water resources the aquifers are key components of the hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the srb contoux et al 2013 gomez et al 2003b 2 2 descriptions of models this research is based on three models météo france safran durand et al 1993 quintana seguí et al 2008 an agronomic model stics and a hydrological model eaudyssée a brief pictorial representation of hydrologic and nitrate cycles is shown in fig 2 a this figure also shows the corresponding model used to simulate each of the processes safran is a mesoscale atmospheric analysis system which provides meteorological forcing data for eaudyssée including precipitation and potential evapotranspiration at a daily time step over a regular 8 km grid stics simulates leaching nitrate flux to the soil in the eaudyssée model finally eaudyssée simulates the water cycle in the hydrologic system and was developed to compute nitrate concentration in this study 2 2 1 the stics crop model stics brisson et al 2003 is a process based crop model which has been mainly developed at the french national institute for agricultural research inra brisson et al 1998 2002 2003 the stics model was used to simulate nitrate flux at the base of the soil profile in this study fig 2a stics features include the model capability to adapt to various crops using the same set of equations and specific parameters the simulation of various climate and soil conditions and the ability to add new modules and to communicate externally with other models the upper boundary corresponds to climatic variables including solar radiation daily minimum and maximum temperatures precipitation and reference evapotranspiration the lower boundary corresponds to the soil sub soil interface the model inputs include a climatic variables such as radiation minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall b soil properties and c the initial states of the soil crop system and management practices schnebelen et al 2004 the stics outputs include a agronomic variables such as leaf area index biomass yield and input consumption and b environmental variables such as water drainage and nitrate leaching at the daily time step schnebelen et al 2004 the stics model includes four primary sets of modules the first set includes phenology shoot growth and yield formation this set considers the ecophysiology of aerial plant parts the second set contains four modules root growth water balance nitrogen balance and soil transfer that simulate the interaction between underground plant parts and soil functions the third module is crop management which accounts for water transfer through the canopy the status of water and heat balances in the soil crop system and fertilizers the fourth module is the microclimate which calculates temperature and air humidity through the canopy three principal databases in the stics model are soil agriculture and meteorological datasets each has a different spatial resolution beaudoin et al 2016 ledoux et al 2007 the intersection of these databases generates spatial units called general simulation units gsu that share the same spatial pedological agricultural and meteorological characteristics stics was made up of 9596 units with an average unit area of 12 square kilometers over the srb 2 2 2 the eaudyssée platform the eaudyssée modeling platform is a hydrometeorological and biogeochemical model based on the existing models and databases in the piren seine program the hydrogeological component of the model uses the same principles as the modcou model habets et al 2008 ledoux et al 1989 eaudyssée couples four specialized modules to simulate water resources quantity and quality at regional scales fig 2b the surface module the river routing module the unsaturated module and the saturated module philippe et al 2011 pryet et al 2015 saleh et al 2011 the surface module uses a seven parameter conceptual model to compute water mass balance at a daily time step for each cell of the surface mesh deschesnes et al 1985 inputs to the surface component are precipitation and potential evapotranspiration with a daily time step provided by safran the outputs are actual evapotranspiration aet surface runoff infiltration and soil storage in this module the domain is divided into units called production functions that are based on the interaction of land use and geological units golaz cavazzi et al 2001 gomez et al 2003a the production function is composed of a balance partition and transfer reservoirs that are used to compute the hydrological mass balance at a daily time step for each cell of the surface mesh ledoux et al 1984 the total number of surface cells covering the srb is 35 698 with an average resolution of one square kilometer surface runoff is routed to the river network by iso module in eaudyssée routes the river routing module consists of two models rapid and qtoz saleh et al 2011 the rapid model takes runoff generated by the surface module and simulates time series of streamflow in each river cell the qtoz model estimates river water level fluctuation which is important to estimate the river aquifer exchange vergnes and habets 2018 the qtoz module improves river aquifer interaction by taking into account river water level fluctuations application of the rapid model in the sim france model was discussed by david et al 2011a the rapid model has been extensively applied in the united states e g david et al 2013 follum et al 2016 lin et al 2018 salas et al 2018 tavakoly et al 2012 2016 2017 discharge computed by rapid is used by the qtoz module to calculate water levels at a given river cell in the eaudyssée platform at each time step qtoz computes a water level that is sent to the groundwater model sam to simulate stream aquifer interactions to simulate in stream nitrate concentration the river velocity is required using the rapid simulated streamflow and the manning equation the qtoz model was modified to estimate flow velocity and cross sectional area for each river cell at every time step the requirement of hydrologic parameters is described in the section 2 2 3 infiltration is transferred to groundwater within the unsaturated zone nonsat module the nonsat model uses a series of reservoirs to simulate a delay between surface water infiltration and aquifer recharge ledoux et al 1989 the flow in the saturated zone is simulated by the sam simulation of multilayer aquifers model sam is a spatially distributed model that applies the diffusivity equation to compute both the temporal distribution of hydraulic heads and the flow in multilayer aquifer units ledoux et al 1989 marsily 1986 sam computes the water flux exchanged between aquifer and river grid cells using water levels calculated by the qtoz module and river volumes calculated by rapid sam also simulates the diffusive transfer of passive solute bourgeois et al 2016 ledoux et al 2007 philippe et al 2011 2 2 3 spatial coupling of eaudyssée and stics following the same methodology as in beaudoin et al 2016 the eaudyssée and stics models were coupled for nitrogen transport simulation the schematic framework for the spatial coupling of eaudyssée and stics is displayed in fig 3 the first step in superimposing eaudyssée is to calculate nitrate flux for each surface cell gis is utilized to determine the spatial contribution of the nitrate flux to the surface cells the intersect tool in arcgis is applied to correlate corresponding gsus to the surface cells and to compute the areal proportion of the gsu that overlaps with the surface cells in the second step nitrate flux stics output is diluted by runoff and infiltration for each surface cell with the assumption of both having the same concentration 1 c s φ s q r q i where c s and φ s are the nitrate concentration ml 3 and nitrate flux m at each surface cell q r and q i are daily runoff and infiltration l3 runoff and infiltration are calculated by the surface water balance component of eaudyssée 2 2 4 developments in the eaudyssée platform to simulate surface and stream aquifer nitrate exchange dashed red lines in fig 2 b show developments and modifications in the eaudyssée platform for the nitrate simulation in this study the solute transport was added to the iso module watershed routing the iso module was modified to accumulate the mass of solute constituents and to simulate the total mass transferred to river cells the solute transport in the watershed routing was developed as a new module in the eaudyssée platform called iso solute the iso solute module receives solute flux from the groundwater module sam and surface runoff and calculates the total nitrate flux delivered to the river cells a similar approach was used to simulate the stream aquifer exchange of solute the flow exchange between the stream and the aquifer is computed based on the difference between hydraulic heads of river cells and associated aquifer cells rushton 2007 as shown in the following equation 2 q r r c h r h p where qr is the stream aquifer flow l3t 1 rc is the hydraulic conductance of the stream aquifer interconnection l2t 1 hr is the water elevation of the stream l and hp is the piezometric head in aquifer l two different directions for stream aquifer exchange flow are considered for each river cell at each time step flow from the aquifer to river q a r and flow from river to aquifer q r a the majority of streams in the seine river network are gaining streams with the net aquifer to stream flow values between 0 and 0 1 m3 s which means the aquifer system supplies the river network with only a few river reaches losing flow to the aquifer pryet et al 2015 based on this fact the assumption is that the transfer of constituent to the aquifer from the river is negligible therefore q a r is used in the stream aquifer solute modeling nitrate load transported by the aquifer is calculated by multiplying both sides of eq 2 by a nitrate concentration 3 l a r c x r c h r h p where l a r is the nitrate load transported by the aquifer to river flow mt 1 and cx is the nitrate concentration ml 3 which is provided based on the coupling of eaudyssée and stics as a final model output of the modeling framework the in stream nitrate concentration with the unit of mg l was simulated by the first order decay rate for entire river network this approach has been extensively applied to study nutrients at the basin scale e g liu et al 2008 runkel 2007 smith et al 1997 tavakoly et al 2016 the decay rate k was determined based on the uptake length and the stream velocity 4 k v s w where v is the stream velocity lt 1 and sw is the uptake length l time series of the stream velocity for all river cells were computed based on the rapid streamflow simulation sw is the average distance that a nutrient atom travels downstream in the water body prior to its removal by either biotic or abiotic processes ball and hooper 1963 runkel 2007 the range of sw is defined based on the stream order using the predefined range in table 2 ensign and doyle 2006 the uptake length is determined for river cells through the calibration procedure the k coefficient is then calculated for all river cells and time steps 2 2 5 calibration process calibration of the nitrate concentration in the river network was conducted manually using daily nitrate concentrations over the period 1995 2000 the uptake length sw was optimized using three objective functions root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient ρ and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the strength of kge is to optimize a solution from the three dimensional criteria space considering correlation variability and bias which is an explicit component in this performance metric bennett et al 2013 haas et al 2016 the parameter sw was adjusted within the defined range in table 2 by trial and error to obtain maximum ρ and kge and minimum rmse once the optimized sw is obtained the decay rate k was calculated using eq 4 this method allows determination of a temporal variation of k daily scale since the velocity varies with time eq 4 the optimized sw is then assigned to river cells around each station moreover lower and upper bands 4 x 10 5 and 1 x 10 3 s 1 for k were contemplated in this study faulkner and campana 2007 runkel 1998 the optimized sw and temporal averages of k for different stream orders are shown in table 2 the magnitude of the obtained sw and k values stream order less than three in this study is in the same order of published values sw 671 m and k 1 5 10 3 s 1 by klocker et al 2009 2 2 6 limitation of modeling framework in terms of framework limitations the stics model computes the full nitrogen cycle within the upper soil and the amount of leaching nitrogen brisson et al 2003 after nitrogen leaching only the convection is taken into account in both the unsaturated and saturated zones with the transfer time varying according to the characteristics of each grid cell therefore there is no nitrification denitrification or mineralization once the nitrogen has left the soil column this is the reason why a decay rate is considered additionally the modeling chain includes drainage downward flux in the soil associated with gravity however it does not include a special treatment for those agricultural areas that are drained using an artificial pipe because the data at the basin scale are not available 2 3 modeling framework applied to the seine river basin nutrient enrichment and eutrophication are major environmental phenomena in the french coastal zone nitrate is a main nitrogen form in the srb due to the intensive agricultural use and clear cut forest landscapes billen et al 2007 in 2013 most of the surface and groundwater bodies of the srb did not have such a desirable status mostly due to nutrients in the groundwater bodies aesn 2013 many studies have investigated the nitrogen cycle of the srb with different purposes some studies focused on the nutrient transfers for a portion of or the entire basin but did not explicitly include stream aquifer interaction billen et al 2007 cugier et al 2005 even et al 2007 garnier et al 2005 passy et al 2012 sebilo et al 2003 sferratore et al 2005 thieu et al 2009 2010 other studies only considered the aquifers bourgeois et al 2016 ledoux et al 2007 philippe et al 2011 viennot 2009 and some complete studies only encompassed smaller parts of the srb flipo et al 2007a b which can support the understanding of nutrient transformations this study presents the nitrate simulation for entire srb with consideration of stream aquifer interaction using the spatial coupling process explained in the section 2 2 3 the nitrate concentration was calculated for all 35 698 surface cells for the study time period 1971 2010 at the daily time step the solutes were then transferred through the unsaturated zone groundwater and routed by eaudyssée to river cells the results for the hydrologic and hydrogeological components of the framework builds on previous results carried out by philippe et al 2011 pryet et al 2015 and saleh et al 2011 in their work the streamflow simulated by eaudyssée was calibrated and validated by comparing to measurements from 118 streamflow gages available within the srb in order to spatially evaluate the skill of the model the simulated flows were then used to compute daily nitrate concentrations for 6481 river cells in this study daily riverine nitrate concentration was simulated for 6481 river grid cells of which 3519 interacted with aquifers between august 1 1971 and july 31 2010 fig 4 2 3 1 groundwater initialization to compare observed and simulated groundwater nitrogen concentrations special attention was paid to the setting of the initial condition the time transfer in the unsaturated zone can last more than 30 years philippe et al 2011 to set the initial concentration three periods with different nitrogen leaching concentrations were considered with the eaudyssée runs the first period is pre industrial before 1935 and considered that the lixiviated nitrogen can be similar to the one from current organic farming according to thieu et al 2010 a homogeneous concentration of 26 mg l was used such forcing data were repeated long enough and the eaudyssée was run to reach a stable groundwater concentration the results were then compared to the data collected by landreau and roux 1984 in 1930 the second period lasts from 1935 to 1970 for this period the nitrogen lixiviation was considered to increase linearly between the pre industrial period and the value estimated by stics for the period of 1970 1971 2 4 observation data more than 6000 wells monitoring the groundwater quality at the annual scale in the srb are available from the accès aux données sur les eaux souterraines ades database http www ades eaufrance fr however they cover different time periods and are not all available for a given date observed river nitrate data were also used to evaluate and compare modeling results in total 72 stations with more than 150 sampling dates are available between 1985 and 2010 fig 4 the selected water quality stations cover a wide range of drainage area o 100 10 000 km2 five of the water quality stations were selected to discuss comparison between daily time series of observed and simulated streamflow and nitrate concentration selected stations are shown with green colored dots in fig 4 the poses station located downstream of the greater paris area before the tidal influence was used to assess the overall performance of the model with the drainage area of 64 820 square kilometers fig 4 the aronde at clairoix station is located in the northern part of the seine river basin with high agricultural activity the torcy station is located on the downstream of the marne river an eastern tributary of the seine river basin the montereau fault yonne station is on the seine river which is located downstream of troyes the saint aubin sur yonne station is located on the yonne river the southeast tributary of the seine river 3 results and discussion this section covers four topics evaluation of the nitrate concentration in groundwater comparison of the annual inflow and nitrate flux evaluation of nitrate balance at the basin scale and evaluation of the in stream nitrate concentration 3 1 comparison of simulated and observed nitrate flux in groundwater following the method described in the section 2 3 1 the evolution of the groundwater concentration compared quite well with the observations fig 5 the map shows that the concentration is above the 50 mg l target threshold in many parts of the aquifers fig 6 a presents the mean bias b i a s c simulated c observed between the observed and simulated concentration during the period of 1970 2010 it can be seen that there are several measurements in the same place as the observations can cover the different aquifer layers in one site and the simulated estimation can present large bias this is partly due to the fact that the model does not represent each aquifer layer individually this leads to some simplification of the aquifer exchange and the aquifer thickness fig 6b shows that the absolute bias is less than 10 mg l on 37 of the gages and 12 of the gages have a relative bias lower than 10 the large bias greater than 30 mg l was found on 19 of the gages in the northern tributary of the seine river oise river this could be explained by the fact that the hydrogeology model is less representative in this part of the seine river basin pryet et al 2015 beaudoin et al 2016 showed that the overestimation of lixiviated nitrogen could occur in this area due to an underestimation of the yield by the stics model fig 7 presents the temporal evolution of the observed and simulated nitrogen concentration on average through the 3 aquifer layers the method used to initialize the nitrogen concentration in groundwater is able to provide a nitrate concentration comparable to the observations at the beginning of the simulated period 1970 except for the oligocene aquifer from 1970 to 2010 the simulation reproduces the increase in nitrate concentration in the chalk aquifer the largest aquifer however it underestimates in the eocene aquifer and ends with a concentration close to the observations in the oligocene aquifer 3 2 annual average of the simulated inflow and nitrate flux nitrate fluxes leaching to rivers are carried by surface runoff and groundwater to better understand nitrate delivery the annual average of nitrate flux was compared with the annual average of inflow to river cells fig 8 results show that the amount of nitrate delivered to the river cells is highly dependent on inflow the amount of leaching nitrate is low during the dry years and increases during the wet years which is consistent with having more leaching in the wet years than the dry years for example the lowest amount of nitrate was delivered in 1996 and 1997 at the poses station while the annual average of inflow in these years was 173 and 382 m3 s respectively in contrast in wet years the annual average is substantially increased the model outputs show that 2000 and 2001 were characterized by very high discharge rates the delivered nitrate was also increased for these years in general low nitrate load was delivered to rivers in 1976 1985 1990 91 1996 and 2005 06 which were characterized as dry years and high nitrate flux was delivered to rivers in 1988 1993 2000 and 2001 these years had a high discharge rate and were categorized as wet years the increasing of nitrate load during wet years can be explained by the effect of rainfall during wet years the heavy rain causes accumulation of rainfall and raises the water table which increases the storage of nitrogen in the shallow soil layers subsequently more nitrate is transported to rivers during dry years the amount of transported nitrate declines the untrasported nitrate may flow to the river network during following wet years unlike at other stations the nitrate load leaching to the river cells failed to follow the inflow variation at the saint aubin sur yonne station fig 8 in this area the part of the river flow that comes from groundwater is reduced around 5 at saint aubin compared to more than 10 at clairoix and up to 40 at poses rousset et al 2004 therefore the impact of the surface load to the river nitrate load is more important 3 3 annual nitrate balance at the basin scale the nitrate balance can be determined by having nitrate simulation for entire basin annual accumulated nitrate flux leaching to the river network was calculated based on the simulation time period fig 9 the nitrate balance was obtained with and without consideration of steam aquifer interactions the accumulated nitrate flux increased from 7 45e 08 to 8 12e 08 kg results indicate that approximately 10 of nitrate flux is delivered to the river network from aquifers that portion of the nitrate is removed from the system by developing stream aquifer interactions for the nitrate simulation 3 4 simulation of in stream nitrate concentration fig 10 shows the kge values of in stream nitrate simulations for all stations in this study the daily kge was calculated using point by point concurrently comparison of observed and simulated values observed nitrate concentrations are available from 1985 to 2010 for most stations the spatial distribution of kge values demonstrated an overall satisfactory model performance in terms of simulating long term daily nitrate concentration the kge results fig 10 indicate that the model performed relatively better in eastern regions of the srb compared to the west part of the basin clearly nitrate concentration strongly depends on the hydrological simulation which confirms findings from literature thieu et al 2009 the western part of the basin is more hydrologically complex compared to the eastern part of the basin due to the presence of multi layer aquifers and the reduced precipitation these factors exacerbate the error on the partition of the precipitation between evapotranspiration runoff and groundwater recharge a relatively poor performance of eaudyssée with regard to the hydrological simulation in the western part of the basin can explain the reason pryet et al 2015 additionally the comparison of nitrate concentrations in groundwater fig 6 shows relatively large bias in the northwestern tributary of the basin oise river figs 11 and 12 present the comparison between daily observed and simulated nitrate concentrations at the five selected stations between january 1 1990 and july 31 2010 the model results illustrate that simulated nitrate concentrations tend to follow the inter annual variation of observations and hydrographs for the outlet of the basin the poses station torcy montereau fault yonne and saint aubin sur yonne for those stations the dynamic simulation of the nitrate concentration is consistent with the observation figs 11 and 12 urbanized areas can export more nitrate at high flows compared to the low density suburban areas klocker et al 2009 exporting high nitrate concentration from the greater paris area to the seine river could explain high nitrate concentration at the poses station furthermore this station is downstream of the srb with more than 50 of agricultural land coverage the model results for the poses station in this study are generally in a good agreement with previous studies the average nitrate concentration for the dry year 1991 and wet year 2001 are obtained at approximately 16 5 mg l 359 µmol l and 20 26 mg l 440 µmol l respectively these values are comparable with published results by sferratore et al 2005 the annual average of observation and the riverstrahler model ducharne et al 2007 in 2000 are 22 34 mg l and 35 mg l respectively for the pose stations the mean nitrate concentration of 19 38 mg l is obtained for the same year in this study the bias value 0 13 mg l is also confirmed that there is a slight underestimation of riverine nitrate concentration at this station this is likely due to the point sources loading to the seine and marne rivers in greater paris which were not available for this study less accurate nitrate simulations are observed at the clairoix station that has a relatively small drainage area of 285 km2 kge 0 13 and correlation 0 42 for the clairoix station the model simulated numerous peaks in 2008 fig 11c largely due to the very wet summer however the peaks did not appear in the observations which might be due to the low frequency of the sample analysis one or two samples per month this indicates the need for higher spatial resolution modeling to resolve the complex physics at the local scale of the basin which is an active subject for future research and continuous observation based on samples conditioned to the river flow the nitrate concertation at the clairoix station shows high average values the upstream region of this station is heavily dominated with cropland thus the emission of the nitrate to river network from this part of the basin is high long term nitrate simulation at torcy and saint aubin sur yonne stations were simulated with a good accuracy for the torcy station kge 0 6 and correlation 0 70 were obtained similarly kge 0 45 and correlation 0 60 were calculated at the saint aubin sur yonne station changes in the nitrate concentration are highly affected by the hydrologic simulations to have a better representation of variation in nitrate and flow simulations the seasonal simulations are also calculated for this purpose the daily model results were averaged monthly and a seasonal comparison was conducted figs 13 and 14 a general trend between riverine and flow simulations can be clearly seen in these figures results show that the model captured most of the seasonal variation of nitrate concentration major underestimations of the simulated nitrate are found during the dry season summer such an underestimated simulation is likely due to the complexity of nitrate attenuation pathways in the groundwater the discrepancy between observation and simulation can be seen at the aronde at clairoix station as mentioned before this station has less frequent measurements compared to other stations and a higher resolution model for this part of the basin could provide more details fig 15 displays the spatial distribution of riverine nitrate concentration in 1990 dry year and 2001 wet year from this figure the change in nitrate concentration can be qualitatively assessed for each river cell which may provide useful information for the regional scale nitrate management comparison of the simulated nitrate concentration between 1990 and 2001 show that nitrate concentration increases in the south part of the srb loing river the maximum annual nitrate concentration also displays approximately 60 difference an increase comparing a wet year 2001 and a dry year 1990 different in stream nitrate concentration for these years is largely driven by differences in river water discharge annual water yield in 2001 was roughly double as much as in 1990 4 summary and perspective this study describes the integration of the safran analysis system stics agronomic model and eaudyssée hydrological model to study nitrate simulation at the regional scale the stream aquifer solute transport was developed in the hydrologic model eaudyssée further application of the river routing streamflow results for the riverine nitrate simulation was demonstrated the integrated system was implemented over the entire seine river basin with a total area of 88 000 square kilometers to simulate long term 1971 2010 daily nitrate transport a first order decay rate was developed for the in stream nitrate simulation with spatiotemporal variation of the decay rate based on the stream order and daily river velocity for each river cell comparison of nitrate flux and inflow showed that simulated nitrate is highly dependent on the inflow produced by surface and subsurface waters variation of mean annual nitrate from year to year can be explained by the hydrologic regime of that year large volumes of nitrate transport tended to occur during wet years and lower nitrate fluxes occurred during dry years simulated groundwater nitrate concentrations show a general agreement with the observations with errors lower than 10 mg l and 10 in more than a third of the gages the modeled nitrate flux at the basin scale shows an increase of approximately 10 with the consideration of stream aquifer interactions the long term simulated nitrate concentration compares favorably to the measured data on a daily basis especially in the eastern part of the seine river basin the nitrate simulation at the poses station downstream of paris as the outlet of the basin is in general agreement with observation the annual simulated nitrate concentration of 19 38 mg l is closed to the average annual observed concentration of 22 34 mg l due to the agricultural activities in more than 50 of land usage upstream of the poses station high nitrate concentration was obtained in this station existence of multi layer aquifers and low rate of precipitation are factors that make the western part of the basin hydrologically complex region due to high rainfalls several high magnitudes of nitrate concentration were simulated by the model for the clairoix station in 2008 which were not captured by observations this is possibly explained by the low frequency of sample analysis the simulation results also showed that the model was able to capture seasonal variation of nitrate flux the robustness of the eaudyssée platform to simulate complex hydrologic systems with representation of the stream aquifer exchanges supports the success of the solute transport modeling with the first order approach for riverine nitrate simulation this work demonstrates a feasible methodology to quantify the overall variability of the nitrate fluxes in a regional basin impacted by agricultural activities furthermore this coupled framework can be used to project long term climate change effects on nitrate leaching over large scale basins as well as to provide tools to stakeholders to quantify the long term loads and concentration of nitrate dirnböck et al 2016 the framework offers important perspectives for future large scale applications coupled with existing hydrologic models such as the weather research and forecasting hydrological wrf hydro modeling system gochis et al 2015 the river routing component of the wrf hydro system operates similarly to the rapid routing model hence the in stream nitrate component of this project can be coupled to the wrf hydro system for nitrate simulation the land surface model component noah mp in wrf hydro was recently developed to simulate nitrate dynamics cai et al 2016 integration of this land surface and in stream nitrate simulation presented in this study will add a water quality modeling feature to the wrf hydro modeling system this study focused on the non point source pollution and did not include point source pollution sources such as wastewater treatment because of the unavailability of relevant data including such data in the modeling framework can improve the estimation of nitrate and the overall model bias

6859,nutrient enrichment from natural and anthropogenic activities is one of the major environmental pollution stressors this study presents an integrated framework that couples a mesoscale atmospheric analysis system safran an agronomic model stics and a distributed hydro geo logic model eaudyssée to estimate nitrogen flux at the regional scale the eaudyssée modeling framework was developed to include nitrate transport from soils to rivers via surface runoff and stream aquifer interactions further an in stream nitrate model was developed based on the large scale river routing of the framework the utility of the integrated framework was demonstrated on the seine river basin srb which has an area of 88 000 square kilometers the srb is one of the most productive agricultural areas in france and encompasses the megalopolis of paris this basin is a complex hydrosystem with multiple aquifers the stics eaudyssée integrated framework was implemented for a long term simulation covering 39 years 1971 2010 at a daily time step comparison of groundwater nitrate concentrations with observations showed an overall absolute bias of less than 10 mg l model results showed that simulated nitrate flux to rivers highly depend on the inflow produced by surface and subsurface waters results also demonstrated that approximately 10 of leaching nitrate flux is delivered to the river network from stream aquifer interactions the statistical analysis indicates the modeling system performs better in the eastern region of the srb in comparison to the western part of the basin due to the hydrological complexity of the western part of the basin comparison of maximum nitrate concentration between dry and wet years 1990 and 2001 showed an increase of 60 largely driven by more annual water yield in the wet year compared to the dry year keywords nitrate flux surface aquifer interactions regional scale modeling distributed hydrologic modeling seine river basin 1 introduction increasing nitrate concentration in surface water and groundwater is a major concern of water quality protection and consequently water resources management hooda et al 1997 kampas and white 2003 vitousek et al 1997 anthropogenic activities including food and energy productions have generated excessive nitrogen increasing it by over a factor of 10 compared to the late 19th century galloway et al 2004 the excess nitrate causes eutrophication and adverse environmental effects such as harmful algal blooms growth of phytoplankton in a water body hypoxia oxygen depletion and reduction of fish and shellfish production oehler et al 2009 sebilo et al 2003 spalding and exner 1993 wade et al 2005 zhang and schilling 2005 for example about 40 of the estuarine resources throughout the u s were extremely reduced from eutrophication and 67 are degraded to some level howarth et al 2006 eutrophication has exacerbated the formation of dead zones in the coastal oceans for example the mississippi river basin delivers large quantities of nutrients from u s agricultural activities to the gulf of mexico diaz and rosenberg 2008 climate change also has impacts on water quality changes in climate factors such as water discharge velocity which controls the residence time water temperature and precipitation influence nutrient availability ducharne et al 2007 sinha et al 2017 using 21 different cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 taylor et al 2012 models sinha et al 2017 showed that amount of riverine total nitrogen load will be increased by 5 to 33 based on the modeled range of precipitation changes in the united states water quality models provide an important and valuable support to evaluate nitrogen sources and loads in river basins with the advancement of computational resources several water quality models have been linked to hydrological models and applied to investigate nitrogen transports in watersheds gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis gssha downer and ogden 2004 soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1999 hspf bicknell et al 2005 inca whitehead et al 1998 agnps young et al 1989 mike she borah and bera 2003 stone wolf et al 2005 and growa denuz weku kunkel et al 2004 a few of these models can be applied for nutrient modeling at the regional scale with their advantages and limitations swat is a commonly used semi distributed continuous time watershed model that predicts the impact of land management on water sediment and chemical yields in ungagged watersheds arnold et al 1999 swat is limited in the accounting for sources of nitrogen as either the atmosphere alexander et al 2002 or point sources of n inputs kunkel et al 2017 mike she is computationally expensive and hence not adequate for large watersheds stone uses one dimensional physics based modeling to simulate n and p fluxes in surface and groundwater and vertical transport of n between saturated and unsaturated top soil layers wolf et al 2005 this model was used to analyze the impact of farming practices and to evaluate environmental policies on nutrient emission over the netherlands the growa denuz weku modeling system is the most common system used in germany at the level of river basins and federal states kunkel et al 2017 kunkel and wendland 1997 2002 the growa component of this model system uses an empirical approach to calculate

soil and groundwater capacity to retain nitrogen and interaction of surface water and groundwater are critical to understand nitrate changes in the hydrosystem therefore sustainable development and comprehensive water management require the need for the full representation of nitrate contamination from the soil surface to the unsaturated zone groundwater and rivers for the entire basin flipo et al 2014 conducted an extensive literature review of distributed physics based models according to their study only 19 of 183 publications were at the regional scale greater than 10 000 km2 and only two of those considered stream aquifer exchanges monteil 2011 pryet et al 2015 the eaudyssée platform pryet et al 2015 saleh et al 2011 includes an explicit quantification of stream aquifer exchanges moreover this platform uses in stream water level fluctuations for the discharge modeling at the regional scale considering the river stage fluctuations improve the accuracy of the discharge modeling baratelli et al 2016 and piezometric head vergnes and habets 2018 the research proposed herein incorporates a hydrological modeling system coupled with a meteorological analysis system and an agronomic model to better understand nutrient dynamics in surface water and groundwater interaction at large scale river networks and long term temporal periods for this purpose the eaudyssée model and agronomic model stics simulateur multidisciplinaire pour les cultures standard beaudoin et al 2016 brisson et al 1998 2002 were coupled to obtain the infiltrating nitrate flux leaving the root zones the météo france safran durand et al 1993 quintana seguí et al 2008 model was used to provide required meteorological data for the eaudyssée model in this study transport of nitrate from land to rivers and from aquifers to surface water and rivers were developed in the eaudyssée platform furthermore this study shows development of in stream nitrate simulation based on the large scale river routing model at the regional scale the river routing model in the eaudyssée platform is based on the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid david et al 2011b the annual precomputed flow from this model was applied to study the effect of climatologic and physiographic characteristics of a watershed on the regional total nitrogen modeling using steady state riverine nitrogen transport tavakoly et al 2016 the application of regional river routing model for long term unsteady nitrate simulations has yet to be studied the modeling system was implemented over the seine river basin srb in france due to increasing nitrate concentrations over time and the existence of several layers of aquifers the srb represents an ideal test bed for this regional ecosystem approach the integrated modeling system was run over 39 years 1971 2010 at the daily time step and results were compared with observations in groundwater and water quality stations the new enhancements allow the eaudyssée platform to simulate regional watershed flow and solute modeling with stream and aquifer interactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the srb covers an area of approximately 88 000 square kilometers in northern france fig 1 the seine river is 776 km long and has 25 000 km of tributaries table 1 it begins at an elevation of 446 m at source seine in the department of côte d or in burgundy and discharges into the english channel near the city of le havre table 1 shows that the stream gradients are not extremely varied although elevations range from 0 to 856 m above sea level in the basin 90 of the basin have an elevation below 300 m the hydrological regime of the srb is considered to be pluvial oceanic with varied seasonal flows high flows in winter and low flows in summer that reflect rainfall distribution throughout the year the srb also has several aquifers that play an important role in sustaining base flow rousset et al 2004 interactions of three major aquifers with the river network were considered in this study these aquifers are from top to bottom 1 oligocene aquifer that includes the beauce and brie aquifers 2 eocene aquifer that includes champigny lutetien and ypressien aquifers and 3 upper cretaceous chalk aquifer gomez et al 2003b the aquifers are relatively permeable from medium to high and are relatively vulnerable from medium to high the middle and lower eocene aquifer is composed of coarse limestones of lutetian and sands the total transmissivity varies from 5 to 10 4 m2 s the upper cretaceous chalk aquifer has porosity between 37 and 45 and a transmissivity less than 10 2 m2 s a full description of the seine aquifers is available at http sigessn brgm fr spip php rubrique5 the srb is predominantly covered by an intensive agricultural industry with up to 57 of the land surface allocated to agriculture mignolet et al 2007 which is the main source of nutrients entering rivers in europe de wit et al 2002 the rest of the basin is covered by forest 25 grassland 13 and urban 5 the center of the basin is mainly covered by cereal oilseed and sugar beet croplands the outer limit of the basin is mostly covered by forest and grassland garnier et al 2009 sferratore et al 2005 the srb is home to approximately 20 million inhabitants including 10 million people in the region of paris agricultural activity pollution sources and population density lead to water quality degradation and nutrient enrichment of the srb furthermore this basin includes a major aquifer system made with a series of connected aquifer layers that interact with surface water resources the aquifers are key components of the hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the srb contoux et al 2013 gomez et al 2003b 2 2 descriptions of models this research is based on three models météo france safran durand et al 1993 quintana seguí et al 2008 an agronomic model stics and a hydrological model eaudyssée a brief pictorial representation of hydrologic and nitrate cycles is shown in fig 2 a this figure also shows the corresponding model used to simulate each of the processes safran is a mesoscale atmospheric analysis system which provides meteorological forcing data for eaudyssée including precipitation and potential evapotranspiration at a daily time step over a regular 8 km grid stics simulates leaching nitrate flux to the soil in the eaudyssée model finally eaudyssée simulates the water cycle in the hydrologic system and was developed to compute nitrate concentration in this study 2 2 1 the stics crop model stics brisson et al 2003 is a process based crop model which has been mainly developed at the french national institute for agricultural research inra brisson et al 1998 2002 2003 the stics model was used to simulate nitrate flux at the base of the soil profile in this study fig 2a stics features include the model capability to adapt to various crops using the same set of equations and specific parameters the simulation of various climate and soil conditions and the ability to add new modules and to communicate externally with other models the upper boundary corresponds to climatic variables including solar radiation daily minimum and maximum temperatures precipitation and reference evapotranspiration the lower boundary corresponds to the soil sub soil interface the model inputs include a climatic variables such as radiation minimum and maximum temperatures and rainfall b soil properties and c the initial states of the soil crop system and management practices schnebelen et al 2004 the stics outputs include a agronomic variables such as leaf area index biomass yield and input consumption and b environmental variables such as water drainage and nitrate leaching at the daily time step schnebelen et al 2004 the stics model includes four primary sets of modules the first set includes phenology shoot growth and yield formation this set considers the ecophysiology of aerial plant parts the second set contains four modules root growth water balance nitrogen balance and soil transfer that simulate the interaction between underground plant parts and soil functions the third module is crop management which accounts for water transfer through the canopy the status of water and heat balances in the soil crop system and fertilizers the fourth module is the microclimate which calculates temperature and air humidity through the canopy three principal databases in the stics model are soil agriculture and meteorological datasets each has a different spatial resolution beaudoin et al 2016 ledoux et al 2007 the intersection of these databases generates spatial units called general simulation units gsu that share the same spatial pedological agricultural and meteorological characteristics stics was made up of 9596 units with an average unit area of 12 square kilometers over the srb 2 2 2 the eaudyssée platform the eaudyssée modeling platform is a hydrometeorological and biogeochemical model based on the existing models and databases in the piren seine program the hydrogeological component of the model uses the same principles as the modcou model habets et al 2008 ledoux et al 1989 eaudyssée couples four specialized modules to simulate water resources quantity and quality at regional scales fig 2b the surface module the river routing module the unsaturated module and the saturated module philippe et al 2011 pryet et al 2015 saleh et al 2011 the surface module uses a seven parameter conceptual model to compute water mass balance at a daily time step for each cell of the surface mesh deschesnes et al 1985 inputs to the surface component are precipitation and potential evapotranspiration with a daily time step provided by safran the outputs are actual evapotranspiration aet surface runoff infiltration and soil storage in this module the domain is divided into units called production functions that are based on the interaction of land use and geological units golaz cavazzi et al 2001 gomez et al 2003a the production function is composed of a balance partition and transfer reservoirs that are used to compute the hydrological mass balance at a daily time step for each cell of the surface mesh ledoux et al 1984 the total number of surface cells covering the srb is 35 698 with an average resolution of one square kilometer surface runoff is routed to the river network by iso module in eaudyssée routes the river routing module consists of two models rapid and qtoz saleh et al 2011 the rapid model takes runoff generated by the surface module and simulates time series of streamflow in each river cell the qtoz model estimates river water level fluctuation which is important to estimate the river aquifer exchange vergnes and habets 2018 the qtoz module improves river aquifer interaction by taking into account river water level fluctuations application of the rapid model in the sim france model was discussed by david et al 2011a the rapid model has been extensively applied in the united states e g david et al 2013 follum et al 2016 lin et al 2018 salas et al 2018 tavakoly et al 2012 2016 2017 discharge computed by rapid is used by the qtoz module to calculate water levels at a given river cell in the eaudyssée platform at each time step qtoz computes a water level that is sent to the groundwater model sam to simulate stream aquifer interactions to simulate in stream nitrate concentration the river velocity is required using the rapid simulated streamflow and the manning equation the qtoz model was modified to estimate flow velocity and cross sectional area for each river cell at every time step the requirement of hydrologic parameters is described in the section 2 2 3 infiltration is transferred to groundwater within the unsaturated zone nonsat module the nonsat model uses a series of reservoirs to simulate a delay between surface water infiltration and aquifer recharge ledoux et al 1989 the flow in the saturated zone is simulated by the sam simulation of multilayer aquifers model sam is a spatially distributed model that applies the diffusivity equation to compute both the temporal distribution of hydraulic heads and the flow in multilayer aquifer units ledoux et al 1989 marsily 1986 sam computes the water flux exchanged between aquifer and river grid cells using water levels calculated by the qtoz module and river volumes calculated by rapid sam also simulates the diffusive transfer of passive solute bourgeois et al 2016 ledoux et al 2007 philippe et al 2011 2 2 3 spatial coupling of eaudyssée and stics following the same methodology as in beaudoin et al 2016 the eaudyssée and stics models were coupled for nitrogen transport simulation the schematic framework for the spatial coupling of eaudyssée and stics is displayed in fig 3 the first step in superimposing eaudyssée is to calculate nitrate flux for each surface cell gis is utilized to determine the spatial contribution of the nitrate flux to the surface cells the intersect tool in arcgis is applied to correlate corresponding gsus to the surface cells and to compute the areal proportion of the gsu that overlaps with the surface cells in the second step nitrate flux stics output is diluted by runoff and infiltration for each surface cell with the assumption of both having the same concentration 1 c s φ s q r q i where c s and φ s are the nitrate concentration ml 3 and nitrate flux m at each surface cell q r and q i are daily runoff and infiltration l3 runoff and infiltration are calculated by the surface water balance component of eaudyssée 2 2 4 developments in the eaudyssée platform to simulate surface and stream aquifer nitrate exchange dashed red lines in fig 2 b show developments and modifications in the eaudyssée platform for the nitrate simulation in this study the solute transport was added to the iso module watershed routing the iso module was modified to accumulate the mass of solute constituents and to simulate the total mass transferred to river cells the solute transport in the watershed routing was developed as a new module in the eaudyssée platform called iso solute the iso solute module receives solute flux from the groundwater module sam and surface runoff and calculates the total nitrate flux delivered to the river cells a similar approach was used to simulate the stream aquifer exchange of solute the flow exchange between the stream and the aquifer is computed based on the difference between hydraulic heads of river cells and associated aquifer cells rushton 2007 as shown in the following equation 2 q r r c h r h p where qr is the stream aquifer flow l3t 1 rc is the hydraulic conductance of the stream aquifer interconnection l2t 1 hr is the water elevation of the stream l and hp is the piezometric head in aquifer l two different directions for stream aquifer exchange flow are considered for each river cell at each time step flow from the aquifer to river q a r and flow from river to aquifer q r a the majority of streams in the seine river network are gaining streams with the net aquifer to stream flow values between 0 and 0 1 m3 s which means the aquifer system supplies the river network with only a few river reaches losing flow to the aquifer pryet et al 2015 based on this fact the assumption is that the transfer of constituent to the aquifer from the river is negligible therefore q a r is used in the stream aquifer solute modeling nitrate load transported by the aquifer is calculated by multiplying both sides of eq 2 by a nitrate concentration 3 l a r c x r c h r h p where l a r is the nitrate load transported by the aquifer to river flow mt 1 and cx is the nitrate concentration ml 3 which is provided based on the coupling of eaudyssée and stics as a final model output of the modeling framework the in stream nitrate concentration with the unit of mg l was simulated by the first order decay rate for entire river network this approach has been extensively applied to study nutrients at the basin scale e g liu et al 2008 runkel 2007 smith et al 1997 tavakoly et al 2016 the decay rate k was determined based on the uptake length and the stream velocity 4 k v s w where v is the stream velocity lt 1 and sw is the uptake length l time series of the stream velocity for all river cells were computed based on the rapid streamflow simulation sw is the average distance that a nutrient atom travels downstream in the water body prior to its removal by either biotic or abiotic processes ball and hooper 1963 runkel 2007 the range of sw is defined based on the stream order using the predefined range in table 2 ensign and doyle 2006 the uptake length is determined for river cells through the calibration procedure the k coefficient is then calculated for all river cells and time steps 2 2 5 calibration process calibration of the nitrate concentration in the river network was conducted manually using daily nitrate concentrations over the period 1995 2000 the uptake length sw was optimized using three objective functions root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient ρ and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the strength of kge is to optimize a solution from the three dimensional criteria space considering correlation variability and bias which is an explicit component in this performance metric bennett et al 2013 haas et al 2016 the parameter sw was adjusted within the defined range in table 2 by trial and error to obtain maximum ρ and kge and minimum rmse once the optimized sw is obtained the decay rate k was calculated using eq 4 this method allows determination of a temporal variation of k daily scale since the velocity varies with time eq 4 the optimized sw is then assigned to river cells around each station moreover lower and upper bands 4 x 10 5 and 1 x 10 3 s 1 for k were contemplated in this study faulkner and campana 2007 runkel 1998 the optimized sw and temporal averages of k for different stream orders are shown in table 2 the magnitude of the obtained sw and k values stream order less than three in this study is in the same order of published values sw 671 m and k 1 5 10 3 s 1 by klocker et al 2009 2 2 6 limitation of modeling framework in terms of framework limitations the stics model computes the full nitrogen cycle within the upper soil and the amount of leaching nitrogen brisson et al 2003 after nitrogen leaching only the convection is taken into account in both the unsaturated and saturated zones with the transfer time varying according to the characteristics of each grid cell therefore there is no nitrification denitrification or mineralization once the nitrogen has left the soil column this is the reason why a decay rate is considered additionally the modeling chain includes drainage downward flux in the soil associated with gravity however it does not include a special treatment for those agricultural areas that are drained using an artificial pipe because the data at the basin scale are not available 2 3 modeling framework applied to the seine river basin nutrient enrichment and eutrophication are major environmental phenomena in the french coastal zone nitrate is a main nitrogen form in the srb due to the intensive agricultural use and clear cut forest landscapes billen et al 2007 in 2013 most of the surface and groundwater bodies of the srb did not have such a desirable status mostly due to nutrients in the groundwater bodies aesn 2013 many studies have investigated the nitrogen cycle of the srb with different purposes some studies focused on the nutrient transfers for a portion of or the entire basin but did not explicitly include stream aquifer interaction billen et al 2007 cugier et al 2005 even et al 2007 garnier et al 2005 passy et al 2012 sebilo et al 2003 sferratore et al 2005 thieu et al 2009 2010 other studies only considered the aquifers bourgeois et al 2016 ledoux et al 2007 philippe et al 2011 viennot 2009 and some complete studies only encompassed smaller parts of the srb flipo et al 2007a b which can support the understanding of nutrient transformations this study presents the nitrate simulation for entire srb with consideration of stream aquifer interaction using the spatial coupling process explained in the section 2 2 3 the nitrate concentration was calculated for all 35 698 surface cells for the study time period 1971 2010 at the daily time step the solutes were then transferred through the unsaturated zone groundwater and routed by eaudyssée to river cells the results for the hydrologic and hydrogeological components of the framework builds on previous results carried out by philippe et al 2011 pryet et al 2015 and saleh et al 2011 in their work the streamflow simulated by eaudyssée was calibrated and validated by comparing to measurements from 118 streamflow gages available within the srb in order to spatially evaluate the skill of the model the simulated flows were then used to compute daily nitrate concentrations for 6481 river cells in this study daily riverine nitrate concentration was simulated for 6481 river grid cells of which 3519 interacted with aquifers between august 1 1971 and july 31 2010 fig 4 2 3 1 groundwater initialization to compare observed and simulated groundwater nitrogen concentrations special attention was paid to the setting of the initial condition the time transfer in the unsaturated zone can last more than 30 years philippe et al 2011 to set the initial concentration three periods with different nitrogen leaching concentrations were considered with the eaudyssée runs the first period is pre industrial before 1935 and considered that the lixiviated nitrogen can be similar to the one from current organic farming according to thieu et al 2010 a homogeneous concentration of 26 mg l was used such forcing data were repeated long enough and the eaudyssée was run to reach a stable groundwater concentration the results were then compared to the data collected by landreau and roux 1984 in 1930 the second period lasts from 1935 to 1970 for this period the nitrogen lixiviation was considered to increase linearly between the pre industrial period and the value estimated by stics for the period of 1970 1971 2 4 observation data more than 6000 wells monitoring the groundwater quality at the annual scale in the srb are available from the accès aux données sur les eaux souterraines ades database http www ades eaufrance fr however they cover different time periods and are not all available for a given date observed river nitrate data were also used to evaluate and compare modeling results in total 72 stations with more than 150 sampling dates are available between 1985 and 2010 fig 4 the selected water quality stations cover a wide range of drainage area o 100 10 000 km2 five of the water quality stations were selected to discuss comparison between daily time series of observed and simulated streamflow and nitrate concentration selected stations are shown with green colored dots in fig 4 the poses station located downstream of the greater paris area before the tidal influence was used to assess the overall performance of the model with the drainage area of 64 820 square kilometers fig 4 the aronde at clairoix station is located in the northern part of the seine river basin with high agricultural activity the torcy station is located on the downstream of the marne river an eastern tributary of the seine river basin the montereau fault yonne station is on the seine river which is located downstream of troyes the saint aubin sur yonne station is located on the yonne river the southeast tributary of the seine river 3 results and discussion this section covers four topics evaluation of the nitrate concentration in groundwater comparison of the annual inflow and nitrate flux evaluation of nitrate balance at the basin scale and evaluation of the in stream nitrate concentration 3 1 comparison of simulated and observed nitrate flux in groundwater following the method described in the section 2 3 1 the evolution of the groundwater concentration compared quite well with the observations fig 5 the map shows that the concentration is above the 50 mg l target threshold in many parts of the aquifers fig 6 a presents the mean bias b i a s c simulated c observed between the observed and simulated concentration during the period of 1970 2010 it can be seen that there are several measurements in the same place as the observations can cover the different aquifer layers in one site and the simulated estimation can present large bias this is partly due to the fact that the model does not represent each aquifer layer individually this leads to some simplification of the aquifer exchange and the aquifer thickness fig 6b shows that the absolute bias is less than 10 mg l on 37 of the gages and 12 of the gages have a relative bias lower than 10 the large bias greater than 30 mg l was found on 19 of the gages in the northern tributary of the seine river oise river this could be explained by the fact that the hydrogeology model is less representative in this part of the seine river basin pryet et al 2015 beaudoin et al 2016 showed that the overestimation of lixiviated nitrogen could occur in this area due to an underestimation of the yield by the stics model fig 7 presents the temporal evolution of the observed and simulated nitrogen concentration on average through the 3 aquifer layers the method used to initialize the nitrogen concentration in groundwater is able to provide a nitrate concentration comparable to the observations at the beginning of the simulated period 1970 except for the oligocene aquifer from 1970 to 2010 the simulation reproduces the increase in nitrate concentration in the chalk aquifer the largest aquifer however it underestimates in the eocene aquifer and ends with a concentration close to the observations in the oligocene aquifer 3 2 annual average of the simulated inflow and nitrate flux nitrate fluxes leaching to rivers are carried by surface runoff and groundwater to better understand nitrate delivery the annual average of nitrate flux was compared with the annual average of inflow to river cells fig 8 results show that the amount of nitrate delivered to the river cells is highly dependent on inflow the amount of leaching nitrate is low during the dry years and increases during the wet years which is consistent with having more leaching in the wet years than the dry years for example the lowest amount of nitrate was delivered in 1996 and 1997 at the poses station while the annual average of inflow in these years was 173 and 382 m3 s respectively in contrast in wet years the annual average is substantially increased the model outputs show that 2000 and 2001 were characterized by very high discharge rates the delivered nitrate was also increased for these years in general low nitrate load was delivered to rivers in 1976 1985 1990 91 1996 and 2005 06 which were characterized as dry years and high nitrate flux was delivered to rivers in 1988 1993 2000 and 2001 these years had a high discharge rate and were categorized as wet years the increasing of nitrate load during wet years can be explained by the effect of rainfall during wet years the heavy rain causes accumulation of rainfall and raises the water table which increases the storage of nitrogen in the shallow soil layers subsequently more nitrate is transported to rivers during dry years the amount of transported nitrate declines the untrasported nitrate may flow to the river network during following wet years unlike at other stations the nitrate load leaching to the river cells failed to follow the inflow variation at the saint aubin sur yonne station fig 8 in this area the part of the river flow that comes from groundwater is reduced around 5 at saint aubin compared to more than 10 at clairoix and up to 40 at poses rousset et al 2004 therefore the impact of the surface load to the river nitrate load is more important 3 3 annual nitrate balance at the basin scale the nitrate balance can be determined by having nitrate simulation for entire basin annual accumulated nitrate flux leaching to the river network was calculated based on the simulation time period fig 9 the nitrate balance was obtained with and without consideration of steam aquifer interactions the accumulated nitrate flux increased from 7 45e 08 to 8 12e 08 kg results indicate that approximately 10 of nitrate flux is delivered to the river network from aquifers that portion of the nitrate is removed from the system by developing stream aquifer interactions for the nitrate simulation 3 4 simulation of in stream nitrate concentration fig 10 shows the kge values of in stream nitrate simulations for all stations in this study the daily kge was calculated using point by point concurrently comparison of observed and simulated values observed nitrate concentrations are available from 1985 to 2010 for most stations the spatial distribution of kge values demonstrated an overall satisfactory model performance in terms of simulating long term daily nitrate concentration the kge results fig 10 indicate that the model performed relatively better in eastern regions of the srb compared to the west part of the basin clearly nitrate concentration strongly depends on the hydrological simulation which confirms findings from literature thieu et al 2009 the western part of the basin is more hydrologically complex compared to the eastern part of the basin due to the presence of multi layer aquifers and the reduced precipitation these factors exacerbate the error on the partition of the precipitation between evapotranspiration runoff and groundwater recharge a relatively poor performance of eaudyssée with regard to the hydrological simulation in the western part of the basin can explain the reason pryet et al 2015 additionally the comparison of nitrate concentrations in groundwater fig 6 shows relatively large bias in the northwestern tributary of the basin oise river figs 11 and 12 present the comparison between daily observed and simulated nitrate concentrations at the five selected stations between january 1 1990 and july 31 2010 the model results illustrate that simulated nitrate concentrations tend to follow the inter annual variation of observations and hydrographs for the outlet of the basin the poses station torcy montereau fault yonne and saint aubin sur yonne for those stations the dynamic simulation of the nitrate concentration is consistent with the observation figs 11 and 12 urbanized areas can export more nitrate at high flows compared to the low density suburban areas klocker et al 2009 exporting high nitrate concentration from the greater paris area to the seine river could explain high nitrate concentration at the poses station furthermore this station is downstream of the srb with more than 50 of agricultural land coverage the model results for the poses station in this study are generally in a good agreement with previous studies the average nitrate concentration for the dry year 1991 and wet year 2001 are obtained at approximately 16 5 mg l 359 µmol l and 20 26 mg l 440 µmol l respectively these values are comparable with published results by sferratore et al 2005 the annual average of observation and the riverstrahler model ducharne et al 2007 in 2000 are 22 34 mg l and 35 mg l respectively for the pose stations the mean nitrate concentration of 19 38 mg l is obtained for the same year in this study the bias value 0 13 mg l is also confirmed that there is a slight underestimation of riverine nitrate concentration at this station this is likely due to the point sources loading to the seine and marne rivers in greater paris which were not available for this study less accurate nitrate simulations are observed at the clairoix station that has a relatively small drainage area of 285 km2 kge 0 13 and correlation 0 42 for the clairoix station the model simulated numerous peaks in 2008 fig 11c largely due to the very wet summer however the peaks did not appear in the observations which might be due to the low frequency of the sample analysis one or two samples per month this indicates the need for higher spatial resolution modeling to resolve the complex physics at the local scale of the basin which is an active subject for future research and continuous observation based on samples conditioned to the river flow the nitrate concertation at the clairoix station shows high average values the upstream region of this station is heavily dominated with cropland thus the emission of the nitrate to river network from this part of the basin is high long term nitrate simulation at torcy and saint aubin sur yonne stations were simulated with a good accuracy for the torcy station kge 0 6 and correlation 0 70 were obtained similarly kge 0 45 and correlation 0 60 were calculated at the saint aubin sur yonne station changes in the nitrate concentration are highly affected by the hydrologic simulations to have a better representation of variation in nitrate and flow simulations the seasonal simulations are also calculated for this purpose the daily model results were averaged monthly and a seasonal comparison was conducted figs 13 and 14 a general trend between riverine and flow simulations can be clearly seen in these figures results show that the model captured most of the seasonal variation of nitrate concentration major underestimations of the simulated nitrate are found during the dry season summer such an underestimated simulation is likely due to the complexity of nitrate attenuation pathways in the groundwater the discrepancy between observation and simulation can be seen at the aronde at clairoix station as mentioned before this station has less frequent measurements compared to other stations and a higher resolution model for this part of the basin could provide more details fig 15 displays the spatial distribution of riverine nitrate concentration in 1990 dry year and 2001 wet year from this figure the change in nitrate concentration can be qualitatively assessed for each river cell which may provide useful information for the regional scale nitrate management comparison of the simulated nitrate concentration between 1990 and 2001 show that nitrate concentration increases in the south part of the srb loing river the maximum annual nitrate concentration also displays approximately 60 difference an increase comparing a wet year 2001 and a dry year 1990 different in stream nitrate concentration for these years is largely driven by differences in river water discharge annual water yield in 2001 was roughly double as much as in 1990 4 summary and perspective this study describes the integration of the safran analysis system stics agronomic model and eaudyssée hydrological model to study nitrate simulation at the regional scale the stream aquifer solute transport was developed in the hydrologic model eaudyssée further application of the river routing streamflow results for the riverine nitrate simulation was demonstrated the integrated system was implemented over the entire seine river basin with a total area of 88 000 square kilometers to simulate long term 1971 2010 daily nitrate transport a first order decay rate was developed for the in stream nitrate simulation with spatiotemporal variation of the decay rate based on the stream order and daily river velocity for each river cell comparison of nitrate flux and inflow showed that simulated nitrate is highly dependent on the inflow produced by surface and subsurface waters variation of mean annual nitrate from year to year can be explained by the hydrologic regime of that year large volumes of nitrate transport tended to occur during wet years and lower nitrate fluxes occurred during dry years simulated groundwater nitrate concentrations show a general agreement with the observations with errors lower than 10 mg l and 10 in more than a third of the gages the modeled nitrate flux at the basin scale shows an increase of approximately 10 with the consideration of stream aquifer interactions the long term simulated nitrate concentration compares favorably to the measured data on a daily basis especially in the eastern part of the seine river basin the nitrate simulation at the poses station downstream of paris as the outlet of the basin is in general agreement with observation the annual simulated nitrate concentration of 19 38 mg l is closed to the average annual observed concentration of 22 34 mg l due to the agricultural activities in more than 50 of land usage upstream of the poses station high nitrate concentration was obtained in this station existence of multi layer aquifers and low rate of precipitation are factors that make the western part of the basin hydrologically complex region due to high rainfalls several high magnitudes of nitrate concentration were simulated by the model for the clairoix station in 2008 which were not captured by observations this is possibly explained by the low frequency of sample analysis the simulation results also showed that the model was able to capture seasonal variation of nitrate flux the robustness of the eaudyssée platform to simulate complex hydrologic systems with representation of the stream aquifer exchanges supports the success of the solute transport modeling with the first order approach for riverine nitrate simulation this work demonstrates a feasible methodology to quantify the overall variability of the nitrate fluxes in a regional basin impacted by agricultural activities furthermore this coupled framework can be used to project long term climate change effects on nitrate leaching over large scale basins as well as to provide tools to stakeholders to quantify the long term loads and concentration of nitrate dirnböck et al 2016 the framework offers important perspectives for future large scale applications coupled with existing hydrologic models such as the weather research and forecasting hydrological wrf hydro modeling system gochis et al 2015 the river routing component of the wrf hydro system operates similarly to the rapid routing model hence the in stream nitrate component of this project can be coupled to the wrf hydro system for nitrate simulation the land surface model component noah mp in wrf hydro was recently developed to simulate nitrate dynamics cai et al 2016 integration of this land surface and in stream nitrate simulation presented in this study will add a water quality modeling feature to the wrf hydro modeling system this study focused on the non point source pollution and did not include point source pollution sources such as wastewater treatment because of the unavailability of relevant data including such data in the modeling framework can improve the estimation of nitrate and the overall model bias
