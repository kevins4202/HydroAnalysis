1575,groundwater contamination by hexavalent chromium cr vi is currently a very serious and challenging issue therefore in the present study 108 shallow groundwater samples were collected during the years 2012 to 2015 n 27 samples each year from an industrial town aosta to assess the contamination status of the area to evaluate the cr vi concentration level sources of pollutants and groundwater geochemistry of the study area a combined approach of the multi statistical and hydrogeochemical techniques were used furthermore a geographic information system gis was applied for the spatial distribution of cr vi so that the most contaminated sites can be identified for a quick decision by policymakers results show that the groundwater chemistry was dominated by hco3 and so4 2 in the anionic chemistry and ca2 and na in the cationic chemistry while ca mg hco3 and ca mg cl so4 were the main water types during the years 2012 2015 in the study area the central part and some north eastern parts of the aosta town groundwater was contaminated with cr vi and are unsafe for drinking use concentration levels of cr vi in the groundwater were 0 09 μg l lowest value and 165 μg l highest value in the years studied and the spatial analysis shows the diffusion of cr vi to north east direction from the source contamination of cr vi in the groundwater was due to the superficial slag deposits from a steel company within the study area this study would be helpful for current and future water resource management in the area concerned keywords groundwater hydrogeochemistry

overexploitation of groundwater resources for different uses and its contamination due to anthropogenic activities is a very serious and challenging issue around the globe the problem is increasing and some cases have to lead the unsustainability of life ramachandra and solanki 2007 chromium cr contamination in water resources is a serious worldwide problem because it may cause toxic effects on living organisms when it is over the drinking water guideline in the natural environment dissolved chromium exists in two main oxidation states cr iii and cr vi chromium shows different biological and geochemical behaviours since cr iii is an essential metal nutrient and hexavalent chromium cr vi is carcinogenic gray 2003 bertolo et al 2011 both the geogenic origin and anthropogenic activities are responsible for cr vi contamination in groundwater in the last few years researchers from the usa oze et al 2004 ball and izbicki 2004 morrison et al 2009 vengosh et al 2016 italy fantoni et al 2002 lelli et al 2014 zimbabwe cooper 2002 australia gray 2003 brazil 2011 and greece moraetis et al 2012 economou eliopoulos et al 2014 have reported that the high levels of cr vi concentration in groundwater due to the geogenic origin however notably cr vi contamination in groundwater is due more to the anthropogenic contamination than to the geogenic origin industrial applications including tanning electroplating metal finishing industrial water cooling mining petroleum refining paper pulp production nuclear facilities and manufacturing of pigments dyes textiles carpets magnetic tapes etc are mainly responsible for cr vi contamination in groundwater saha et al 2011 gao and xia 2011 sharma et al 2012 hori et al 2015 kumari et al 2017 groundwater from the kanpur industrial area in india was highly contaminated with cr vi due to the indiscriminate disposal practices of waste sludge generated from industrial production schaffener et al 2010 in the same way groundwater resources of many industrial areas of italy are contaminated with cr vi the upper sarno valley southern italy aquifers were contaminated with metals including cr vi due to discharges of highly polluted effluent and waste materials from the tanning industry de pippo et al 2006 brunetti et al 2014 found that the groundwater of alessandria italy spinetta marengo industrial site was also contaminated with chromium due to the activities of the chrome plating facility that was dismantled in the mid 1970s they observed that the presence of cr vi in unsaturated soils was a source of groundwater contamination in the area a previous study by bonomi et al 2015 reported that the groundwater of the aosta plain the study area of the present research was contaminated by cr vi and is still present therefore the main goal of the current study was to assess the geochemistry of the groundwater level of cr vi pollution sources of contamination and the spatial distribution of contaminants in the groundwater of the industrial area aosta town italy the outcome of this study could be very helpful for policymakers to take quick decisions for proper planning and sustainable groundwater management in industrial regions 2 study area the aosta is the largest and the most important town in the region of the aosta valley north western part of the italian alps fig 1 the aosta valley region has an alpine climate summer temperatures are typically cool while the lowest temperatures are reached during the winter season the mean annual temperature of the valley floor has 10 12 c forno et al 2012 the maximum and minimum of mean precipitation of the aosta valley for a month are nearly 140 mm and 30 mm of rainfall respectively mercalli et al 2003 the study area has one steel factory situated in the aosta city fig 1 its main products are stainless steel bars stainless steel wire rods valve steel semi finished products tool steel and atomized powders many years ago industrial slag waste deposited in the asota city and it contaminated the groundwater resources of the area bonomi et al 2015 2 1 geology the aosta valley region has six different geological structural zones such as the austroalpine zone piemontese zone pennidic zone elvetico ultraelvetico south alpine zone and helvetic zone bonetto and gianotti 1998 lo russo et al 2015 supplementary fig 1 previously some investigators have described the geological structural zones of the aosta valley in details elsewhere regione valle d aosta and università degli studi di torino 2005 lo russo et al 2015 the present study area belongs to the categorizations of the piedmont zone and the austroalpine zone of the aosta valley region fig 2 the piedmont zone surfaces in the middle of the valley and separates the austroalpine units from the underlying pennidic units dal piaz 1992 the lithology of the study area has calc schists marble quartzite and gneiss fig 2 2 2 hydrology the dora baltea river which is one of the most important rivers in the valley has a directional flow from west towards east along the main alluvial valley bottom plain lo russo et al 2015 and receives 14 tributaries from different directions of the valley fig 1 the buthier river is the main tributary of the dora baltea river in the aosta town which flow from north to south fig 1 bonomi et al 2015 and stefania et al 2018 reported the hydraulic heads distribution and the hydraulic gradient of the aosta in details elsewhere a recent investigation of the valley the study area of the current research by tiwari et al 2017 reported that the depth to water table of the area was varied from 2 92 to 28 70 m below ground level mbgl with flow direction from west to east 2 3 land use pattern land use plays a vital role in the groundwater resources management of any areas in the world a major source of groundwater is the infiltration of excess rainfall through the land surface therefore land use has an important effect on both the quality and recharge rates of groundwater the land use of the study area is 32 80 for agriculture 4 24 for forest 4 12 for water bodies 5 21 for industry and 53 69 for human settlements fig 3 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical procedure one hundred and eight shallow groundwater samples n 27 samples each year were collected from the aosta town to determine the water quality status geochemistry and sources of contamination during the years 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 fig 1 in the study area 10 groundwater samples were collected from the industrial and surrounding zone the central part 4 samples from the western region and 13 samples from the eastern region in each year groundwater sampling was done based on the surface water and groundwater flow direction of the study area to evaluate the contaminant diffusion pattern the flow direction of the surface water and groundwater is west to east in the study area due to which a higher number of the groundwater samples were collected in the eastern region compared to the western region shallow groundwater samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles and the values of ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured at the time of sampling with a hanna instrument hi 9828 a metrohm ion chromatograph was used to analyse the major anion cl so4 2 and no3 concentrations in the groundwater samples and the acid titration method was used to determine the bicarbonate concentrations to determine the concentrations of major cation ca2 mg2 na and k an atomic absorption spectrophotometer shimadzu aa 6800 was used for the determination of cr vi concentrations unfiltered groundwater samples were taken and adjusted to ph 9 with 1 n sodium hydroxide naoh solution and then filtered with a millipore filtration unit 0 45 μm filter paper and refrigerated as per the american public health association apha 2005 and apat cnr irsa 3150c 2003 sampling handling rules the cr vi concentrations were analysed spectrophotometrically using 1 5 diphenylcarbazide 1 5 dpc in acidic medium standard methods for reagents and standard preparations for the colorimetric analysis were followed as prescribed by the apha 2005 and the apat cnr irsa 3150c 2003 the concentrations of cr vi in the groundwater samples were determined by measuring the absorbance of the cr vi solution at a wavelength of 540 nm by uv spectrophotometer double beam cary 100 varian 3 2 quality control during the groundwater sampling and analysis proper quality assurance measures and precautions were taken to ensure reliability and avoid contamination during the experimental procedure glassware was properly cleaned and analytical grade reagents were used moreover milli q water was used throughout the study and reagent blank determinations were used to correct the instruments readings during the analysis of major ions and cr vi the instruments were recalibrated after every 15 samples in the case of major cation analysis three replicates were run for every sample and the precision obtained was below 10 rsd relative standard deviation however for the analysis of cr vi duplicate samples were analysed and had a coefficient of variation cv equal to 5 apat cnr irsa 2003 an additional proof for the data precision of the study duration was the anionic and cationic charge balance which was found to be 5

acquisition processes of water resources singh et al 2012 in the present study hydrogeochemical methods including the piper diagram a modify durov diagram gibbs diagram saturation index si ion exchange reactions and scatter plots were used to understand the chemical composition of the groundwater resources and the geochemistry of the study area 3 4 statistical analysis multivariate statistical analysis is usually applied to establish the relationship between two variables as well as being used to discover and to interpret relations between variables or to test hypotheses davis 1986 ballukraya and ravi 1999 singh et al 2012 in the present study the pearson correlation coefficients significance level was 0 05 and principal component analyses pca eigenvalue was 1 were calculated using the statistical package for the social sciences spss software to evaluate the source of contaminants present in the groundwater 3 5 spatial distribution analysis a geographic information system gis helps to determine water availability and mapping of aquifer risk zones for sustainable water resources management arnous and el rayes 2013 tiwari et al 2016 in the present study natural neighbor interpolation was used for the spatial distribution of cr vi in an arc gis 10 3 environment natural neighbor is largely used in environmental studies for the definition of interpolation surfaces such as those of concentrations of pollutants in groundwater or in industrial regions natural neighbor uses an algorithm that considers the closest subset of input samples to a query point applying weights to them according to proportionate areas in order to interpolate a value sibson 1981 ledoux and gold 2005 4 results and discussion the statistical results of the analysed parameters of the groundwater samples n 108 from the study area during the years 2012 to 2015 are presented in table 1 moreover the results presented in table 1 are also compared to the drinking water standard established by the world health organization who 2017 4 1 groundwater major ion chemistry the chemistry of total major ions equivalent concentrations of total cations and anions of the groundwater was 469 mg l 512 mg l 483 mg l and 486 mg l during the year 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the highest major ion load was observed in the year 2013 and the minimum during the year 2012 in the present case hco3 so4 2 and ca2 were the major dominant dissolved ions and contributor towards the tds concentrations table 2 however cl na and mg2 were the second most important dissolved ions while no3 and k contributed a very small amount towards the tds solute load during the years 2012 to 2015 table 2 in the case of the groundwater cation chemistry ca2 and na ions dominated and majorly contributed to the total cation equivalent concentrations tz during the years studied the ca2 na mg2 k order was observed during the years 2012 2015 in the cationic abundance in the case of the groundwater anion chemistry hco3 and so4 2 ions dominated in the study area with a minor contribution from cl ion during the years 2012 2015 additionally no3 was a lesser contributor to the anionic chemistry of the area during the years studied the hco3 so4 2 cl no3 order was found during the years 2012 2015 in the anionic abundance 4 2 piper diagram the piper 1944 trilinear diagram can play an important role in evaluating the geochemical relationship between different dissolved ions and the dominant type of water chemistry in water this diamond shaped diagram reveals that the groundwater of the aosta town was primarily dominated by ca mg hco3 and secondarily by ca mg cl so4 water types in the years 2012 to 2015 fig 4 in the study area all the tested water samples plot in the ca2 dominant zone in the cation facies during the years studied however most of the groundwater samples plot in the hco3 zone and the no dominant zone in the anion facies the piper diagram shows that the water samples of the year 2013 had more variable compositions as compared with other years studied fig 4 4 3 modified durov diagram the durov 1948 diagram helps in understanding the hydrochemical and ion exchange processes of the groundwater system as well as water type of any area al bassam and khalil 2012 developed a modified durov diagram with new features that provide choice to users have the flexibility to design their own processing procedure for analysis of the samples according to other relevant hydrological factors in the present case the modified durov diagram revealed that most of the groundwater samples had ca2 dominance in cation chemistry and hco3 in anion chemistry during the years studied fig 5 the main sources of these elements in the groundwater samples were the dissolution of the carbonate minerals the geology of the study area contains the marble and calcareous schists minerals lo russo et al 2015 furthermore the class 7 and 4 of the modified durov diagram confirm that the reverse ion exchange phenomenon and dissolution of sulfate minerals of the area such as gypsum caso4 2h2o https www mindat org locentry 303232 html controlling the water chemistry of the study area fig 5 4 4 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry the gibbs s diagrams gibbs 1970 representing the ratio of na k na k ca2 and cl no3 cl no3 hco3 as a function of tds concentrations the plot of appropriate geochemical data on the gibbs s diagram fig 6 a and b suggests that the rock weathering phenomenon is the major driving force controlling the chemistry of the study area the scatter plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 displays strong correlation and most of the samples fall on 1 1 line in the years studied which suggests that the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum minerals were major sources of these elements in the groundwater of the study area fig 7a however some samples fall above the equiline in the study area indicating an excess of ca2 mg2 ions and the silicate weathering e g camgsio6 4h ca2 mg2 2sio2 2h2o or possibly by the reverse ion exchange processes can be potential for the release of ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater cerling et al 1989 fisher and mullican 1997 rajmohan and elango 2004 tiwari et al 2016 the scatter plot between ca2 mg2 vs na k shows that ca2 and mg2 ions were much higher than the na k ions in the groundwater during the years 2012 to 2015 fig 7b and suggesting that the chief portion of ca2 and mg2 was derived from the carbonate dissolution and the geology of the study area support this 4 5 statistical analysis the good correlations of ca2 with hco3 0 76 and so4 2 0 70 table 3 added proof that the carbonate minerals and gypsum dissolution were the major contributors for these dissolved ions in the present case the pca results are presented in table 4 indicate that the factor i had a high loading of dissolved ca2 mg2 and hco3 ions and moderate loading of so4 2 and na ions and clearly support that the weathering and dissolution of minerals were primarily controlling the groundwater major ion chemistry of the study area moreover the positive correlations between na cl 0 92 cl tds 0 71 and na tds 0 51 table 3 indicate that cl and some part of na were attributed from similar sources na cl and k ions had loaded in factor ii and no3 in factor iii table 4 it shows that the major ion chemistry of the groundwater was secondarily controlled by the agricultural activities and waste disposal in the study area elhatip et al 2003 mor et al 2006 4 6 ion exchange reactions the schoeller 1977 proposed the chloro alkaline indices cai to get very important information regarding the ion exchange reactions between the aquifer materials and groundwater of any region the chloro alkaline indices cai i and cai ii also known as the schoeller indices schoeller 1977 were estimated using the following formula 1 cai i cl na k cl 2 cai ii cl na k so 4 2 hco 3 no 3 the chloro alkaline indices could be either negative or positive the negative or positive values of chloro alkaline indices are depending on whether the exchange of na and k is from water with mg2 and ca2 in rock soil or vice versa when na and k ions in water are exchanged with mg2 and ca2 the cai value will be positive and it shows a reverse ion exchange reaction zaidi et al 2015 however low salt waters give negative value indicating chloro alkaline disequilibrium and it shows a cation anion exchange phenomenon srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 in the present case about 67 and 70 in 2012 74 and 78 during 2013 2014 and 70 and 74 in 2015 of the groundwater samples had positive values of the cai i and cai ii and demonstrating a reverse ion exchange reaction in the study area respectively moreover the rest of the water samples had negative values of the cai i and cai ii revealing chloro alkaline disequilibrium and it is a cation anion exchange reaction during the years studied the results of the modified durov diagram is also verifying and supporting that a reverse ion exchange reaction phenomenon was controlling the chemistry of the study area groundwater fig 5 4 7 saturation indices si the logarithm of the ratio of ion activity product iap to the mineral equilibrium constant ksp at a given temperature is called si freeze and cherry 1979 stumm and morgan 1981 and is expressed as si log iap ksp if the si has a positive value indicates that the water is supersaturated state regarding the particular mineral phase this state is incapable of the mineral dissolving and the phase of the mineral may precipitate a negative si value indicates that the undersaturation state and it is potential to mineral dissolution if present in the present study the si diagram of calcite sic vs dolomite sid shows that most of the groundwater samples were in the supersaturated state regarding to dolomite and calcite during the years studied fig 8 in the study area the values of sid were higher than the values of sic in the years studied the water samples were belonging to the supersaturated state may be due to gypsum dissolution by water already saturated with respect to the carbonate minerals a few groundwater samples were belonging to the undersaturated state and had negative si values during the years studied the water samples plotting in this zone come from an environment where calcite and dolomite are depleted or where ca and mg exist in other forms would also probably fall in this field water that has not reached an equilibrium state with the carbonates since of short residence time would also probably fall in this zone this type of waters will dissolve calcite and or dolomite if it meetings the source rocks 4 8 spatial distribution of cr vi level concentrations of cr vi in the groundwater samples ranged from minimum 0 09 to maximum165 μg l in the years 2012 to 2015 table 1 the spatial distribution maps of cr vi were classified into four different zones with different colours as per cr vi concentrations present in the groundwater safe zone in green 5 μg l moderately safe zone in yellow 5 1 10 0 μg l contaminated zone in orange 10 1 50 μg l and extremely contaminated zone in red 50 1 to maximum concentration in μg l fig 9 the results of spatial distribution as shown in fig 9 indicate that the groundwater locations 1 3 4 17 19 and 21 were contaminated by cr vi in the study area during the years studied the cr vi level was 3 30 times higher than the groundwater limit of 50 μg l who 2017 in the study area the maximum concentration of cr vi was recorded at location 3 inside the steelwork area during the years studied fig 9 the central part of the steelwork area and some part of the north eastern area groundwater were contaminated with cr vi fig 9 in the aosta town problem of cr vi contamination in the groundwater began in the industrial site and was transported to the north eastern area due to the groundwater flow direction w to e of the area and it is clearly visible in the spatial distribution maps of cr vi contamination fig 9 bonomi et al 2015 reported that the water flow direction w to e and drainage effect of the dora baltea river of the aosta area has transported cr vi contamination in the water resources moreover a hydraulic heads distribution from 580 m above sea level m a s l upstream to 526 downstream m a s l and a hydraulic gradient from 0 6 to 0 3 of the aosta aided to transport cr vi to downstream according to the flow direction bonomi et al 2015 4 9 comparative study and discussion of cr vi sources table 5 shows the cr vi concentrations in the groundwater of the aosta town during the years studied and compares with other studies done around the globe on groundwater contamination with cr vi moreover comparative table 5 shows the sources of the cr vi contamination in the groundwater around the world the comparative results presented in table 5 clearly indicate that the groundwater was contaminated by the anthropogenic activities that had very high concentrations of cr vi as compared to groundwater contaminated by the natural or geogenic activities table 5 shows the best example of groundwater contamination with cr vi by the anthropogenic and the natural activities in the leon valley mexico armienta et al 1993 observed that the groundwater from the southwest region of the leon valley was contaminated by the anthropogenic activities the inadequate solid waste disposal by a chromate factory and had a very high level of cr vi concentration 2500 times higher than the groundwater limit of 50 μg l as per the who 2017 however the groundwater from the northeast of the leon valley was controlled by the natural phenomenon weathering of ultramafic rocks and had concentrations below the who 2017 drinking water guideline the chief geogenic source of cr vi in groundwater is weathered ultramafic rocks previous study of the yilgarn craton western australia gray 2003 and north eastern attica greece moraetis et al 2012 have reported that groundwaters contaminated with cr vi due to ultramafic rocks in the present case high cr vi concentrations in the groundwater samples of the aosta was due to the superficial slag deposits from a steel company of the area fig 9 currently there is no active source to release cr vi into groundwater but cr vi contamination in groundwater of the aosta was due to a secondary accumulation of a cr vi in the unsaturated soil bonomi et al 2015 schaffener et al 2010 brunetti et al 2014 and hori et al 2015 observed that the cr vi pollution in freshwater due to the disposal of industrial slag the spatial distribution analysis of cr vi levels fig 9 in gis environment clearly demonstrates the association between high cr vi concentrations in the groundwater samples and one specific class of land use industrial zone fig 3 from the spatial distribution maps fig 9 it is clearly visible that the water samples from the industrial zone have an extremely high cr vi concentrations the findings of this research verify and support the previous observations of the area 4 10 water suitability for drinking and domestic uses the ph of the groundwater samples ranged from minimum 6 4 to maximum 8 8 in the years 2012 2015 indicating an acidic to slightly alkaline nature table 1 electrical conductivity ec concentrations varied between 314 and 1272 μs cm 1 in the water samples during the years studied table 1 moreover concentrations of tds in the groundwater samples of the study area ranged from the lowest of 242 mg l to highest of 1082 mg l in the study area table 1 according to the who 2017 drinking water guidelines tds value of 600 mg l is good for drinking uses and increasingly unpalatable at 1000 mg l moreover a high concentration of tds raises doubts about using water for drinking domestic and industrial purposes but there are no health based guidelines for tds as according to the who 2017 in the present case 81 74 81 and 77 of the groundwater samples were 600 mg l during the years studied and only location 13 had a concentration above 1000 mg l in the year 2013 concentrations of cl no3 and na in the water samples were within the recommended drinking water limit of 250 mg l 50 mg l and 200 mg l by the who 2017 during the years studied concentrations of so4 2 ca2 mg2 and th ranged from 46 to 371 mg l 50 195 mg l 5 61 mg l and 155 688 mg l in the groundwater samples during the years studied respectively table 1 as per the who 2017 drinking water guidelines there are no health based guideline values for so4 2 ca2 mg2 and th elements concentrations of cr vi were 2 77 3 18 2 37 and 3 30 times higher than the who 2017 guideline of 50 μg l table 1 in the years 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively a high concentration of cr vi could cause a potential cancer risk who 2017 for those who utilize the groundwater for drinking in the aosta town 5 conclusion the groundwater of the study area was acidic to slightly alkaline in the years studied the mean concentrations of major anions and cations in the groundwater samples follow the order of hco3 so4 2 cl no3 and ca2 na mg2 k in the years 2012 to 2015 the groundwater of the study area was primarily the ca mg hco3 type followed by the ca mg cl so4 type and most of the water samples were super saturated with respect to dolomite and calcite hydrogeochemical approaches and statistical analysis demonstrate that the major ion chemistry of the groundwater was primarily controlled by the weathering and dissolution of carbonate and sulphate minerals as well as ion exchange processes with a minor contribution from the anthropogenic activities of the study area high cr vi concentrations in the groundwater samples were mainly due to the superficial slag deposits by a steel company of the area the water samples from the central and some north eastern parts of the aosta town was contaminated with cr vi and therefore the water is not suitable for direct consumption furthermore the spatial distribution maps show that the contaminant is being transported to the north eastern direction with the help of the groundwater flow of the area from the groundwater management point of view previously beretta 2015 reported some corrective measures to be implemented for the reduction of cr vi contamination levels in the groundwater resources of the aosta however our research suggests that the cr vi concentration level is still much higher as compared to specified groundwater limits established by the who our findings suggest that the continuous monitoring of the groundwater in the area concerned is required acknowledgements the data were collected as part of a project drawn up between politecnico di torino and aosta valley regional authority the authors are grateful to the department of environment territory and the department of public work soil conservation public housing of the aosta valley

therefore the main goal of the current study was to assess the geochemistry of the groundwater level of cr vi pollution sources of contamination and the spatial distribution of contaminants in the groundwater of the industrial area aosta town italy the outcome of this study could be very helpful for policymakers to take quick decisions for proper planning and sustainable groundwater management in industrial regions 2 study area the aosta is the largest and the most important town in the region of the aosta valley north western part of the italian alps fig 1 the aosta valley region has an alpine climate summer temperatures are typically cool while the lowest temperatures are reached during the winter season the mean annual temperature of the valley floor has 10 12 c forno et al 2012 the maximum and minimum of mean precipitation of the aosta valley for a month are nearly 140 mm and 30 mm of rainfall respectively mercalli et al 2003 the study area has one steel factory situated in the aosta city fig 1 its main products are stainless steel bars stainless steel wire rods valve steel semi finished products tool steel and atomized powders many years ago industrial slag waste deposited in the asota city and it contaminated the groundwater resources of the area bonomi et al 2015 2 1 geology the aosta valley region has six different geological structural zones such as the austroalpine zone piemontese zone pennidic zone elvetico ultraelvetico south alpine zone and helvetic zone bonetto and gianotti 1998 lo russo et al 2015 supplementary fig 1 previously some investigators have described the geological structural zones of the aosta valley in details elsewhere regione valle d aosta and università degli studi di torino 2005 lo russo et al 2015 the present study area belongs to the categorizations of the piedmont zone and the austroalpine zone of the aosta valley region fig 2 the piedmont zone surfaces in the middle of the valley and separates the austroalpine units from the underlying pennidic units dal piaz 1992 the lithology of the study area has calc schists marble quartzite and gneiss fig 2 2 2 hydrology the dora baltea river which is one of the most important rivers in the valley has a directional flow from west towards east along the main alluvial valley bottom plain lo russo et al 2015 and receives 14 tributaries from different directions of the valley fig 1 the buthier river is the main tributary of the dora baltea river in the aosta town which flow from north to south fig 1 bonomi et al 2015 and stefania et al 2018 reported the hydraulic heads distribution and the hydraulic gradient of the aosta in details elsewhere a recent investigation of the valley the study area of the current research by tiwari et al 2017 reported that the depth to water table of the area was varied from 2 92 to 28 70 m below ground level mbgl with flow direction from west to east 2 3 land use pattern land use plays a vital role in the groundwater resources management of any areas in the world a major source of groundwater is the infiltration of excess rainfall through the land surface therefore land use has an important effect on both the quality and recharge rates of groundwater the land use of the study area is 32 80 for agriculture 4 24 for forest 4 12 for water bodies 5 21 for industry and 53 69 for human settlements fig 3 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical procedure one hundred and eight shallow groundwater samples n 27 samples each year were collected from the aosta town to determine the water quality status geochemistry and sources of contamination during the years 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 fig 1 in the study area 10 groundwater samples were collected from the industrial and surrounding zone the central part 4 samples from the western region and 13 samples from the eastern region in each year groundwater sampling was done based on the surface water and groundwater flow direction of the study area to evaluate the contaminant diffusion pattern the flow direction of the surface water and groundwater is west to east in the study area due to which a higher number of the groundwater samples were collected in the eastern region compared to the western region shallow groundwater samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles and the values of ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured at the time of sampling with a hanna instrument hi 9828 a metrohm ion chromatograph was used to analyse the major anion cl so4 2 and no3 concentrations in the groundwater samples and the acid titration method was used to determine the bicarbonate concentrations to determine the concentrations of major cation ca2 mg2 na and k an atomic absorption spectrophotometer shimadzu aa 6800 was used for the determination of cr vi concentrations unfiltered groundwater samples were taken and adjusted to ph 9 with 1 n sodium hydroxide naoh solution and then filtered with a millipore filtration unit 0 45 μm filter paper and refrigerated as per the american public health association apha 2005 and apat cnr irsa 3150c 2003 sampling handling rules the cr vi concentrations were analysed spectrophotometrically using 1 5 diphenylcarbazide 1 5 dpc in acidic medium standard methods for reagents and standard preparations for the colorimetric analysis were followed as prescribed by the apha 2005 and the apat cnr irsa 3150c 2003 the concentrations of cr vi in the groundwater samples were determined by measuring the absorbance of the cr vi solution at a wavelength of 540 nm by uv spectrophotometer double beam cary 100 varian 3 2 quality control during the groundwater sampling and analysis proper quality assurance measures and precautions were taken to ensure reliability and avoid contamination during the experimental procedure glassware was properly cleaned and analytical grade reagents were used moreover milli q water was used throughout the study and reagent blank determinations were used to correct the instruments readings during the analysis of major ions and cr vi the instruments were recalibrated after every 15 samples in the case of major cation analysis three replicates were run for every sample and the precision obtained was below 10 rsd relative standard deviation however for the analysis of cr vi duplicate samples were analysed and had a coefficient of variation cv equal to 5 apat cnr irsa 2003 an additional proof for the data precision of the study duration was the anionic and cationic charge balance which was found to be 5

acquisition processes of water resources singh et al 2012 in the present study hydrogeochemical methods including the piper diagram a modify durov diagram gibbs diagram saturation index si ion exchange reactions and scatter plots were used to understand the chemical composition of the groundwater resources and the geochemistry of the study area 3 4 statistical analysis multivariate statistical analysis is usually applied to establish the relationship between two variables as well as being used to discover and to interpret relations between variables or to test hypotheses davis 1986 ballukraya and ravi 1999 singh et al 2012 in the present study the pearson correlation coefficients significance level was 0 05 and principal component analyses pca eigenvalue was 1 were calculated using the statistical package for the social sciences spss software to evaluate the source of contaminants present in the groundwater 3 5 spatial distribution analysis a geographic information system gis helps to determine water availability and mapping of aquifer risk zones for sustainable water resources management arnous and el rayes 2013 tiwari et al 2016 in the present study natural neighbor interpolation was used for the spatial distribution of cr vi in an arc gis 10 3 environment natural neighbor is largely used in environmental studies for the definition of interpolation surfaces such as those of concentrations of pollutants in groundwater or in industrial regions natural neighbor uses an algorithm that considers the closest subset of input samples to a query point applying weights to them according to proportionate areas in order to interpolate a value sibson 1981 ledoux and gold 2005 4 results and discussion the statistical results of the analysed parameters of the groundwater samples n 108 from the study area during the years 2012 to 2015 are presented in table 1 moreover the results presented in table 1 are also compared to the drinking water standard established by the world health organization who 2017 4 1 groundwater major ion chemistry the chemistry of total major ions equivalent concentrations of total cations and anions of the groundwater was 469 mg l 512 mg l 483 mg l and 486 mg l during the year 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively the highest major ion load was observed in the year 2013 and the minimum during the year 2012 in the present case hco3 so4 2 and ca2 were the major dominant dissolved ions and contributor towards the tds concentrations table 2 however cl na and mg2 were the second most important dissolved ions while no3 and k contributed a very small amount towards the tds solute load during the years 2012 to 2015 table 2 in the case of the groundwater cation chemistry ca2 and na ions dominated and majorly contributed to the total cation equivalent concentrations tz during the years studied the ca2 na mg2 k order was observed during the years 2012 2015 in the cationic abundance in the case of the groundwater anion chemistry hco3 and so4 2 ions dominated in the study area with a minor contribution from cl ion during the years 2012 2015 additionally no3 was a lesser contributor to the anionic chemistry of the area during the years studied the hco3 so4 2 cl no3 order was found during the years 2012 2015 in the anionic abundance 4 2 piper diagram the piper 1944 trilinear diagram can play an important role in evaluating the geochemical relationship between different dissolved ions and the dominant type of water chemistry in water this diamond shaped diagram reveals that the groundwater of the aosta town was primarily dominated by ca mg hco3 and secondarily by ca mg cl so4 water types in the years 2012 to 2015 fig 4 in the study area all the tested water samples plot in the ca2 dominant zone in the cation facies during the years studied however most of the groundwater samples plot in the hco3 zone and the no dominant zone in the anion facies the piper diagram shows that the water samples of the year 2013 had more variable compositions as compared with other years studied fig 4 4 3 modified durov diagram the durov 1948 diagram helps in understanding the hydrochemical and ion exchange processes of the groundwater system as well as water type of any area al bassam and khalil 2012 developed a modified durov diagram with new features that provide choice to users have the flexibility to design their own processing procedure for analysis of the samples according to other relevant hydrological factors in the present case the modified durov diagram revealed that most of the groundwater samples had ca2 dominance in cation chemistry and hco3 in anion chemistry during the years studied fig 5 the main sources of these elements in the groundwater samples were the dissolution of the carbonate minerals the geology of the study area contains the marble and calcareous schists minerals lo russo et al 2015 furthermore the class 7 and 4 of the modified durov diagram confirm that the reverse ion exchange phenomenon and dissolution of sulfate minerals of the area such as gypsum caso4 2h2o https www mindat org locentry 303232 html controlling the water chemistry of the study area fig 5 4 4 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry the gibbs s diagrams gibbs 1970 representing the ratio of na k na k ca2 and cl no3 cl no3 hco3 as a function of tds concentrations the plot of appropriate geochemical data on the gibbs s diagram fig 6 a and b suggests that the rock weathering phenomenon is the major driving force controlling the chemistry of the study area the scatter plot of ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 displays strong correlation and most of the samples fall on 1 1 line in the years studied which suggests that the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum minerals were major sources of these elements in the groundwater of the study area fig 7a however some samples fall above the equiline in the study area indicating an excess of ca2 mg2 ions and the silicate weathering e g camgsio6 4h ca2 mg2 2sio2 2h2o or possibly by the reverse ion exchange processes can be potential for the release of ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater cerling et al 1989 fisher and mullican 1997 rajmohan and elango 2004 tiwari et al 2016 the scatter plot between ca2 mg2 vs na k shows that ca2 and mg2 ions were much higher than the na k ions in the groundwater during the years 2012 to 2015 fig 7b and suggesting that the chief portion of ca2 and mg2 was derived from the carbonate dissolution and the geology of the study area support this 4 5 statistical analysis the good correlations of ca2 with hco3 0 76 and so4 2 0 70 table 3 added proof that the carbonate minerals and gypsum dissolution were the major contributors for these dissolved ions in the present case the pca results are presented in table 4 indicate that the factor i had a high loading of dissolved ca2 mg2 and hco3 ions and moderate loading of so4 2 and na ions and clearly support that the weathering and dissolution of minerals were primarily controlling the groundwater major ion chemistry of the study area moreover the positive correlations between na cl 0 92 cl tds 0 71 and na tds 0 51 table 3 indicate that cl and some part of na were attributed from similar sources na cl and k ions had loaded in factor ii and no3 in factor iii table 4 it shows that the major ion chemistry of the groundwater was secondarily controlled by the agricultural activities and waste disposal in the study area elhatip et al 2003 mor et al 2006 4 6 ion exchange reactions the schoeller 1977 proposed the chloro alkaline indices cai to get very important information regarding the ion exchange reactions between the aquifer materials and groundwater of any region the chloro alkaline indices cai i and cai ii also known as the schoeller indices schoeller 1977 were estimated using the following formula 1 cai i cl na k cl 2 cai ii cl na k so 4 2 hco 3 no 3 the chloro alkaline indices could be either negative or positive the negative or positive values of chloro alkaline indices are depending on whether the exchange of na and k is from water with mg2 and ca2 in rock soil or vice versa when na and k ions in water are exchanged with mg2 and ca2 the cai value will be positive and it shows a reverse ion exchange reaction zaidi et al 2015 however low salt waters give negative value indicating chloro alkaline disequilibrium and it shows a cation anion exchange phenomenon srinivasamoorthy et al 2014 in the present case about 67 and 70 in 2012 74 and 78 during 2013 2014 and 70 and 74 in 2015 of the groundwater samples had positive values of the cai i and cai ii and demonstrating a reverse ion exchange reaction in the study area respectively moreover the rest of the water samples had negative values of the cai i and cai ii revealing chloro alkaline disequilibrium and it is a cation anion exchange reaction during the years studied the results of the modified durov diagram is also verifying and supporting that a reverse ion exchange reaction phenomenon was controlling the chemistry of the study area groundwater fig 5 4 7 saturation indices si the logarithm of the ratio of ion activity product iap to the mineral equilibrium constant ksp at a given temperature is called si freeze and cherry 1979 stumm and morgan 1981 and is expressed as si log iap ksp if the si has a positive value indicates that the water is supersaturated state regarding the particular mineral phase this state is incapable of the mineral dissolving and the phase of the mineral may precipitate a negative si value indicates that the undersaturation state and it is potential to mineral dissolution if present in the present study the si diagram of calcite sic vs dolomite sid shows that most of the groundwater samples were in the supersaturated state regarding to dolomite and calcite during the years studied fig 8 in the study area the values of sid were higher than the values of sic in the years studied the water samples were belonging to the supersaturated state may be due to gypsum dissolution by water already saturated with respect to the carbonate minerals a few groundwater samples were belonging to the undersaturated state and had negative si values during the years studied the water samples plotting in this zone come from an environment where calcite and dolomite are depleted or where ca and mg exist in other forms would also probably fall in this field water that has not reached an equilibrium state with the carbonates since of short residence time would also probably fall in this zone this type of waters will dissolve calcite and or dolomite if it meetings the source rocks 4 8 spatial distribution of cr vi level concentrations of cr vi in the groundwater samples ranged from minimum 0 09 to maximum165 μg l in the years 2012 to 2015 table 1 the spatial distribution maps of cr vi were classified into four different zones with different colours as per cr vi concentrations present in the groundwater safe zone in green 5 μg l moderately safe zone in yellow 5 1 10 0 μg l contaminated zone in orange 10 1 50 μg l and extremely contaminated zone in red 50 1 to maximum concentration in μg l fig 9 the results of spatial distribution as shown in fig 9 indicate that the groundwater locations 1 3 4 17 19 and 21 were contaminated by cr vi in the study area during the years studied the cr vi level was 3 30 times higher than the groundwater limit of 50 μg l who 2017 in the study area the maximum concentration of cr vi was recorded at location 3 inside the steelwork area during the years studied fig 9 the central part of the steelwork area and some part of the north eastern area groundwater were contaminated with cr vi fig 9 in the aosta town problem of cr vi contamination in the groundwater began in the industrial site and was transported to the north eastern area due to the groundwater flow direction w to e of the area and it is clearly visible in the spatial distribution maps of cr vi contamination fig 9 bonomi et al 2015 reported that the water flow direction w to e and drainage effect of the dora baltea river of the aosta area has transported cr vi contamination in the water resources moreover a hydraulic heads distribution from 580 m above sea level m a s l upstream to 526 downstream m a s l and a hydraulic gradient from 0 6 to 0 3 of the aosta aided to transport cr vi to downstream according to the flow direction bonomi et al 2015 4 9 comparative study and discussion of cr vi sources table 5 shows the cr vi concentrations in the groundwater of the aosta town during the years studied and compares with other studies done around the globe on groundwater contamination with cr vi moreover comparative table 5 shows the sources of the cr vi contamination in the groundwater around the world the comparative results presented in table 5 clearly indicate that the groundwater was contaminated by the anthropogenic activities that had very high concentrations of cr vi as compared to groundwater contaminated by the natural or geogenic activities table 5 shows the best example of groundwater contamination with cr vi by the anthropogenic and the natural activities in the leon valley mexico armienta et al 1993 observed that the groundwater from the southwest region of the leon valley was contaminated by the anthropogenic activities the inadequate solid waste disposal by a chromate factory and had a very high level of cr vi concentration 2500 times higher than the groundwater limit of 50 μg l as per the who 2017 however the groundwater from the northeast of the leon valley was controlled by the natural phenomenon weathering of ultramafic rocks and had concentrations below the who 2017 drinking water guideline the chief geogenic source of cr vi in groundwater is weathered ultramafic rocks previous study of the yilgarn craton western australia gray 2003 and north eastern attica greece moraetis et al 2012 have reported that groundwaters contaminated with cr vi due to ultramafic rocks in the present case high cr vi concentrations in the groundwater samples of the aosta was due to the superficial slag deposits from a steel company of the area fig 9 currently there is no active source to release cr vi into groundwater but cr vi contamination in groundwater of the aosta was due to a secondary accumulation of a cr vi in the unsaturated soil bonomi et al 2015 schaffener et al 2010 brunetti et al 2014 and hori et al 2015 observed that the cr vi pollution in freshwater due to the disposal of industrial slag the spatial distribution analysis of cr vi levels fig 9 in gis environment clearly demonstrates the association between high cr vi concentrations in the groundwater samples and one specific class of land use industrial zone fig 3 from the spatial distribution maps fig 9 it is clearly visible that the water samples from the industrial zone have an extremely high cr vi concentrations the findings of this research verify and support the previous observations of the area 4 10 water suitability for drinking and domestic uses the ph of the groundwater samples ranged from minimum 6 4 to maximum 8 8 in the years 2012 2015 indicating an acidic to slightly alkaline nature table 1 electrical conductivity ec concentrations varied between 314 and 1272 μs cm 1 in the water samples during the years studied table 1 moreover concentrations of tds in the groundwater samples of the study area ranged from the lowest of 242 mg l to highest of 1082 mg l in the study area table 1 according to the who 2017 drinking water guidelines tds value of 600 mg l is good for drinking uses and increasingly unpalatable at 1000 mg l moreover a high concentration of tds raises doubts about using water for drinking domestic and industrial purposes but there are no health based guidelines for tds as according to the who 2017 in the present case 81 74 81 and 77 of the groundwater samples were 600 mg l during the years studied and only location 13 had a concentration above 1000 mg l in the year 2013 concentrations of cl no3 and na in the water samples were within the recommended drinking water limit of 250 mg l 50 mg l and 200 mg l by the who 2017 during the years studied concentrations of so4 2 ca2 mg2 and th ranged from 46 to 371 mg l 50 195 mg l 5 61 mg l and 155 688 mg l in the groundwater samples during the years studied respectively table 1 as per the who 2017 drinking water guidelines there are no health based guideline values for so4 2 ca2 mg2 and th elements concentrations of cr vi were 2 77 3 18 2 37 and 3 30 times higher than the who 2017 guideline of 50 μg l table 1 in the years 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively a high concentration of cr vi could cause a potential cancer risk who 2017 for those who utilize the groundwater for drinking in the aosta town 5 conclusion the groundwater of the study area was acidic to slightly alkaline in the years studied the mean concentrations of major anions and cations in the groundwater samples follow the order of hco3 so4 2 cl no3 and ca2 na mg2 k in the years 2012 to 2015 the groundwater of the study area was primarily the ca mg hco3 type followed by the ca mg cl so4 type and most of the water samples were super saturated with respect to dolomite and calcite hydrogeochemical approaches and statistical analysis demonstrate that the major ion chemistry of the groundwater was primarily controlled by the weathering and dissolution of carbonate and sulphate minerals as well as ion exchange processes with a minor contribution from the anthropogenic activities of the study area high cr vi concentrations in the groundwater samples were mainly due to the superficial slag deposits by a steel company of the area the water samples from the central and some north eastern parts of the aosta town was contaminated with cr vi and therefore the water is not suitable for direct consumption furthermore the spatial distribution maps show that the contaminant is being transported to the north eastern direction with the help of the groundwater flow of the area from the groundwater management point of view previously beretta 2015 reported some corrective measures to be implemented for the reduction of cr vi contamination levels in the groundwater resources of the aosta however our research suggests that the cr vi concentration level is still much higher as compared to specified groundwater limits established by the who our findings suggest that the continuous monitoring of the groundwater in the area concerned is required acknowledgements the data were collected as part of a project drawn up between politecnico di

1576,the mobility of plutonium pu in groundwater is dependent of its speciation distribution and transformation the speciation and transformation kinetics of pu iv and its colloids in highly saline groundwater have however been rarely studied in the present study groundwater ionic strength 1 m from dunhuang region nw china was collected for investigating the speciation transformation kinetics and fate of spiked pu iv with aging time the results showed that 99 of the spiked pu iv over initial concentration c 0 range 2 5 10 10 7 8 10 7 mol l 1 was easily associated with the natural colloids and transformed into relatively unstable pu pseudo colloids in 1 day which then gradually deposited and or adsorbed on the container walls with aging the suspended pu pseudo colloids decreased in similar exponential models with rate equations r t 3 1 10 10e t 4 and 1 3 10 8e 3 for c 0 1 25 10 9 mol l 1and 4 17 10 8 mol l 1 respectively the chemical speciation of the suspended colloidal pu was dominated by fe mn oxides at the early time while carbonates with slower depositing rate r t 6 9 10 12e 0 149t dominated it 82 at equilibrium state whatever the c 0 was the concentration of dissolved pu i e the apparent solubility of pu kept at 0 7 10 11 mol l 1 over aging the valence of dissolved pu was dominated by pu iv at early time while pu v vi would become dominant 95 at equilibrium state with transformation rate of r t 92 9e t 16 6 96 9 the equilibrium times of pu deposition and or adsorption speciation transformation of the suspended colloidal pu and valence change of the dissolved pu were 30 d 80 d and 120 d respectively the kinetic process for each pu species could be well fitted with exponential model these results suggest that the majority of released pu iv into highly saline groundwater will be easily associated with natural aquatic colloids and then become immobile in short time due to deposition and or adsorption onto the environmental medium but potential migration risk caused by stable suspended pu colloids cannot be ignored graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords plutonium speciation transformation kinetics highly saline groundwater nuclide

2001 wang 2010 due to its hypertoxicity the transport of plutonium pu in the groundwater is an indispensable research subject xie et al 2014 kersting 2013 novikov et al 2006 salbu and skipperud 2009 for the siting and safety assessment of an hlw repository pu released into groundwater can exist in various physicochemical forms ranging from simple pu iv pu v cations and puo2 am hy to complex pu polymers and pu colloids include pu intrinsic colloids and pu pseudo colloids choppin 2006 salbu 2007 the mobility of pu strongly depends on its speciation in groundwater choppin 2006 for example aqueous pu iv readily hydrolyzes and forms amorphous oxyhydroxides polymeric species i e pu intrinsic colloid which then associates easily with the migratory natural aquatic colloids walther et al 2009 zhao et al 2016 kersting and reimus 2003 van de weerd and leijnse 1997 while pu v usually exists as dissolved species and can migrate along with the flow of groundwater powell et al 2014 runde et al 2002 orlandini et al 1986 the speciation and fate of pu are significantly affected by physicochemical parameters of groundwater including eh ph ion strength especially the content and component of natural aquatic colloids kersting and reimus 2003 hu et al 2008 kunze et al 2008 therefore in case of a leakage of a repository it is crucial to examine the speciation transformation and the fate of released pu under specific hydrochemical environment previous investigations were carried out mainly focusing on the physicochemical species solubility and aquatic environment behavior of pu in natural groundwaters but excluding the speciation transformation rate of pu iv stepan et al 2011 buesseler et al 2009 efurd et al 1998 hu et al 2008 kersting et al 1999 and in simulated groundwaters t

assess its stability and mobility in groundwater systems e g how did the concentration of total pu vary and the pu iv disproportionate with aging in contaminated groundwater moreover a final nuclear waste repository may be located in a highly saline geology region usually accompanied by highly saline groundwater environment wang 2010 remi marsac et al 2017 and references therein which can affect the fate of released pu salbu and skipperud 2009 choppin 2006 xie et al 2012 besides knowledge of natural aquatic colloids is crucial for understanding the environmental mobility sorptivity redox processes of pu in the groundwater which perform a significant control on pu transport in natural waters saito et al 2013 kersting et al 1999 as pu iv can easily associate with natural aquatic

present study highly saline groundwater from dunhuang region nw china was collected for investigating the speciation transformation kinetics and the fate of spiked pu iv we mainly examined the transformation rates and equilibrium times of the suspended colloidal and dissolved pu oxidation states of the dissolved pu and chemical species of the colloidal pu through nitrogen protection of the groundwater over the whole sampling transportation and experiment process the results are expected to be more unique and representative for a specific highly saline groundwater from the most potential site of chinese waste repository 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and characterization of the groundwater five liter groundwater 100 m depth was collected into a protective container with a self designed nitrogen assistant sampling equipment from a monitoring well in dunhuang region under sampling flow rate of 0 5 l min and kept in an anaerobic glove box in lab shown as fig 1 the sampling operation with small flow rate would not disturb the groundwater system because the water level was not found to be lowered after the sampling the groundwater have a tds total dissolved solids content of 9 2 0 4 g l 1 ionic strength of 1 m eh of 75 5 mv and ph of 7 4 0 1 see table s1 in the supporting information the salt content in the sample in significantly higher than for simulated groundwater samples trofimov t i et al 2008 and 2009 andrson e b et al 2009 and the samples collected at the mayak site n stepan et al 2011 and other sites efurd et al 1998 hu et al 2008 kersting et al 1999 the samples were kept in the glove box over the whole experiment period up to 180 d to ensure that the small changes of ph from 7 5 to7 8 and eh from 70 to 50 mv have less impact on the speciation of pu see fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 in the supporting information the concentration and particle size distribution of natural colloids in the groundwater were measured by direct filtration method combined with dls dynamic light scattering zeta sizer nano zs malvern instruments analysis giving a colloid concentration of 9 4 2 0 mg l 1 and a two component size distribution with the major one 65 of 450 nm 800 nm and a minor one 35 of 220 nm 450 nm the mineral composition of natural colloids was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd measurements showing that the colloids were mainly consisting of carbonate sulfate and silicate see fig s4 in the supporting information 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 experimental design 239pu stock solution 1 μg g 1 95 of 239pu iv checked by solvent extraction schramke et al 1989 wang et al 2014 was purified using dowex 1 4 anion exchange resin to remove the decay products and other impurities and adjusted to pu iv groundwater sample was divided into several subsamples into which various amounts of pu iv were added as soon as possible the details of the experiments are listed in table 1 briefly exp a to exp f were designed to study the speciation transformation kinetics of pu iv in the groundwater with aging time under different initial concentrations exp h and exp j with natural colloids removed by untrafiltration using 10 kd ultra filter were contrast experiments to examine the effect of natural colloids on the speciation of pu in addition the changes of ph and eh were monitored in the exp c and exp e to confirm the effectiveness of the protective measures on the groundwater exp g and exp i were performed as parallel experiments for exp b and exp h to confirm the accuracy of the experimentation the distribution and kinetic processes of multiple pu speciation were examined at various aging times during the experiment mainly including the transformation rates and equilibrium times of the suspended colloidal pu and dissolved pu oxidation states of the dissolved pu and chemical species of the colloidal pu the adsorption of pu on the membrane and ultrafiltration tube and the uniformity of pu concentration in water samples were checked before experiment the results show that these factors have negligible influences on the investigation results of 239pu speciation transformation see table s2 fig s5 and table s3 in the supporting information 2 2 2 measurement of particle size distribution of suspended colloidal pu the particle size distribution of suspended colloidal pu was measured by filter membrane fractionation technique 4 ml sample solution was filtrated with 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm millipore filters 100 kd and 10 kd ultrafiltration tubes amicon ultra 4 ml millipore in order the concentration of 239pu in each filtrate was analyzed using isotope dilution inductivity coupled plasma mass spectrometric method id icp ms to calculate the particle size distribution of the colloidal pu 2 2 3 analysis of chemical species of suspended colloidal pu a modified sequential extraction procedure see table s4 in the supporting information based on tessier procedure tessier et al 1979 huang et al 2012 was employed to extract pu in various speciation from the suspended colloidal pu by which colloid associated pu was categorized into five fractions exchangeable f1 carbonate f2 fe mn oxides f3 organic f4 and residual f5 in this work the pu retained by 10 kd ultrafiltration tube was regarded as colloidal pu but it could not be separated from the 10 kd ultrafiltration tube due to the very low content 0 06 mg natural colloids in 4 ml original groundwater and even lower after aging so the extraction was conducted by directly adding extraction agent into the inner pipe of the 10 kd ultrafiltration tube 2 2 4 analysis of oxidation states of dissolved pu oxidation states of dissolved pu is an important topic of pu speciation study since it significantly affects the migration of pu in groundwater kaplan et al 2004 in this study the pu permeated through the 10 kd ultrafiltration tube was regarded as dissolved pu the oxidation states of which were investigated using solvent extraction method as described in the literatures schramke et al 1989 wang et al 2014 briefly samples containing pu were adjusted to 1 m hcl solution from which pu iv and pu iv vi were extracted by tta xylene and hdehp xylene solutions respectively the concentrations of pu iv pu iv and pu vi were calculated by determination of plutonium remained in the aqueous phase after extraction 2 2 5 sample pretreatment for 239pu determination of samples containing pu colloids the samples containing pu colloids was first acid digested three digestion methods were investigated and the digestion method using 8 m hno3 for 2 h was selected due to its simplicity and short digestion time see fig s6 and related details in the supporting information 3 results and discussions 3 1 transformation and its kinetics of total colloidal and dissolved pu in the groundwater solutions with aging time concentrations of total colloidal and dissolved pu in the groundwater were determined at various aging times for exp b exp c and exp e as shown in fig 2 the kinetic processes were fitted with a first order mechanism exponential decay profile for the concentration change including total pu c t colloidal pu c c and dissolved pu c d in the solutions and the kinetic rate equation r t were presented in table 2 fig 2 a for exp b shows a continuous decrease of c t from 1 26 10 9 mol l 1to 4 18 10 11 mol l 1with a rate constant k of 0 25 d 1 during 30 d and a steady dissolved pu concentration level around 0 8 10 11 mol l 1 meanwhile most of pu in the solution is in colloidal form with c c decreased as decreasing c t accordingly with nearly asame decrease rate r t and r c fig 2 b and c show similar change trends suggesting that shaking and pu initial concentration c 0 do not greatly affect the concentration change trends but the dynamic process has been obviously accelerated by shaking exp c which was evidenced by a greater rate constant 0 44 d 1 compared to that for exp b 0 25 d 1 besides a higher c 0 4 17 10 8 mol l 1 for exp e could result in greater c c c d and k than those for exp b c 0 1 25 10 9 mol l 1 which means that colloidal pu can be formed easily for higher initial pu concentration see fig 3 meanwhile fig 4 shows that although both exp b in the presence of natural colloids and exp h in absence of natural colloids for same initial pu concentration have decreasing c t and c c the rate constant k of c c for exp b 0 26 d 1 was less than that for exp h 0 4 d 1 this indicated that pu would suspend a longer time in groundwater containing colloids and thus might migrate for a relative long distance in the favor of the colloids it can be seen from table 2 that if the aging time t went to infinity c d in exp b exp c and exp e would be 0 7 10 11 mol l 1 0 7 10 11 mol l 1 and 4 1 10 11 mol l 1 respectively this indicated an apparent solubility of 0 7 10 11 4 1 10 11 mol l 1 for pu in the investigated groundwater and 0 7 10 11 mol l 1 may be more closer to the intrinsic solubility taking into consideration of the formation of very fine intrinsic pu colloids under higher pu concentration see fig 5 the fraction of colloidal pu in groundwater increased with initial pu concentration c 0 the solubility obtained is obviously lower than that of pu iv hydroxide calculated by xie et al 2015 for ionic strength i 0 and pu iv pu v vi and pu iv coll calculated and experimentally determined by neck et al 2007 under ar atmosphere and oversaturated puo2 am hyd at ph 7 5 i 0 1 m based on the above experiments the equilibrium time of 30 d of deposited and or adsorbed of the suspended colloidal pu was obtained table 3 listed the c t c d c d c t and c c c t in the groundwater solutions after aging for 1 year despite of quite different initial pu concentration 99 of spiked pu were removed by deposition and adsorption except exp j which means that pu was easily adsorbed or precipitated on the container walls rock walls for real underground cases the minor remnant pu 1 in the water phase was mostly in dissolved form 77 except exp e exp f and exp j while the rest was in colloidal form 23 the decrease of c t in the solutions during aging may be also partly accounted by coprecipitation of pu iv with other elements and or sorption to container walls the coprecipitation may occur because the ground water collected is over saturated the activity products of some natural compounds which might precipitate in the groundwater were calculated for ph 7 5 and ph 8 5 the ph of groundwater changed from 7 5 to 7 8 during the experiments and summarized in table s5 in the supporting information it show that caso4 caco3 and fe oh 3 were all in saturated state and a part of which may precipitate and remove pu from the solutions when the groundwater was kept away from its habitat environment it should be noted that colloidal pu 63 4 would dominate in pu solution for very high initial pu concentration for exp e and exp f this may be due to the forming of pu intrinsic colloid quickly before pu was adsorbed onto the natural colloids when high concentration pu iv spike solution was added into the groundwater for exp j meanwhile fine intrinsic pu colloid dominated 96 because ultrapure water contains no natural colloids which are larger and tend to adsorb or precipitate pu into solid form so exp f gave a much higher apparent solubility of pu 5 10 10 mol l 1 the effect of c 0 on the final equilibrium pu concentration c t may give hints on the mechanism of pu removal from groundwater if pu was mainly removed via adsorption on precipitation or sedimented natural colloids a linear partition between the solid phase and the solution should be demonstrated on the other side if pu was removed via intrinsic colloidization or precipitation the equilibrium concentration of pu should be limited by the apparent solubility in the solution and kept nearly constant whatever the initial pu concentration was fig 6 shows the relation between c t and c 0 for experiments a b c d e and f it can be seen that c t increased with the increasing c 0 and an approximate linear relation was observed in the logarithmic graph however most of pu in the groundwater solutions was in colloidal form with concentration decreasing as aging and dissolved pu or colloidal pu with particle size of 3 nm dominated the pu in the groundwater at equilibrium state see fig 3 so we deduced that increasing c t with initial concentration presented in fig 6 was mainly consisting of colloidal pu with particle size of 3 nm formed under high initial pu concentration which was also demonstrated by the increasing c c c t with increasing c 0 from exp b to exp f as presented in fig 5 3 2 particle size distribution of the suspended colloidal pu the particle size distribution of the suspended colloidal pu after 180 days aging for exp b was measured as shown in fig 7 it is seen that the majority of the colloidal pu particle size 10 kd or 3 nm in the groundwater has particle size 450 nm while the minority of it with particle size ranging from 10 nm 100 kd to 450 nm the particle size distribution of colloidal pu was very similar to that of natural colloids in the groundwater examined so it is deduced that spiked pu was first adsorbed onto natural colloids and then deposited at the bottom of the container and or adsorbed by the container walls the results obtained matched the particle distribution of pu associated colloids in the groundwater at mayak site with anoxic condition examined by stepan et al 2011 it is well recognized that natural aquatic colloids in groundwater is one of the main factors affecting the speciation distribution and migration of pu kersting and reimus 2003 van de weerd and leijnse 1997 degueldre et al 1996 but the difference in pu partition in granitic groundwater with natural colloids present or removed is not very clear so we compared the particle size distributions of the suspended colloidal pu with and without natural colloids as shown in fig 7 exp b vs exp h it can be seen that most of the spiked pu transformed into colloidal pu with particle size of 10 nm in groundwater containing natural colloids while it mainly kept as dissolved species and formed pu intrinsic colloids with particle size mainly of 10 nm in the groundwater free of natural colloids this implied that natural aquatic colloids can easily adsorb pu and thus carries pu to wherever it goes 3 3 speciation transformation ant its kinetics of the suspended colloidal pu with aging time the speciation distribution of the suspended colloidal pu was investigated as function of aging time for exp e by the modified tessier method which categorizes the colloidal pu into five fractions f1 exchangeable f2 carbonate f3 fe mn oxide f4 organic and f5 residual the change trends of the relative percentage and absolute amount of the five fractions with aging time are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the kinetic processes of the five fractions were well fitted by exponential model and the results are summarized in table 4 the approximate 100 of extraction recoveries at various aging times as shown in fig 8 demonstrated the validness of the sequential extraction process it can be seen from figs 8 and 9 the equilibrium time of speciation transformation of the suspended colloidal pu was 80 d the absolute amount of each fraction decreased with aging time in 30 days and then changed little note that the measurement uncertainty may be great for very low pu concentration the fe mn oxide fraction f3 and carbonate fraction f2 account for the most part of colloidal pu at the early time but carbonates with slower deposited rate see table 4 r t 6 9 10 12e 0 149t became dominant 82 at equilibrium state with the other relative fractions coming as f3 12 7 f4 4 1 f5 2 4 f1 0 8 the chemical speciation of the suspended colloidal pu for different c 0 exp e exp f and additional exp 1 and exp 2 are compared in fig 10 it is seen that c 0 has little effect on the chemical speciation distribution of the colloidal pu however high initial pu concentration tends to have a higher percentage of f3 fraction which may suggest the formation of pu intrinsic colloids under high c 0 to clarify this perception the chemical speciation of the colloidal pu in original groundwater exp g and that in ultra pure water exp j after 1 year s aging were compared in fig 11 the results show that f2 dominated the colloidal pu in the groundwater while f3 is the main speciation of colloidal pu in the ultra pure water as we know there were no carbonates and fe mn oxides in ultra pure water so it can be deduced that dissolvability of f3 fraction for exp j should be similar with the pu intrinsic colloids in other words pu intrinsic colloids have similar dissolvability to the colloidal fe mn oxides in the extraction it should be noted that chemical speciation of the colloidal pu for exp 1 and exp 2 giving a relative high percentage of f4 fraction were measured after 200 days aging instead of 120 d for exp e and exp f furthermore exp 1 and exp 2 are parallel experiments and the consistent results also demonstrated that the chemical speciation analysis procedure is valid and applicable for this study 3 4 valence transformation ant its kinetics of the dissolved pu with aging time the valence transformation ant its kinetics of the dissolved pu with aging time were examined and the results are presented in fig 12 it shows that pu iv dominated the dissolved pu in early time 10 d see fig 12a as the spiked pu was originally tetravalent however the percent of pu iv for dissolved pu decreased gradually over aging while pu v vi increased accordingly as shown in fig 12b it means that the weakly reductive atmosphere of the groundwater eh 75 mv cannot maintain the dissolved pu of less than 1 at pu iv state which would still be oxidized to pu v vi slowly during aging the transformation marched with a half conversion time of 12 4 days and reached equilibrium after 120 d with pu v vi percentage of 95 which is more soluble while pu iv could not be found due to adsorption and coprecipitation with natural aquatic colloids in the groundwater the rate constant k 0 056 d 1 of valence transformation is much less than those of total or colloidal pu concentration changes e g for exp b k for both total pu and colloidal pu was 0 25 d 1 implying that slow oxidation of pu iv did occur during aging and the pu iv fraction decrease was not simply due to the readily adsorption or precipitation of pu iv however the reason of oxidation of pu iv in the groundwater under weakly reductive condition is not clear yet and needs further study 4 conclusion highly saline granitic groundwater with ionic strength 1 m from dunhuang region nw china was collected for investigating the speciation transformation kinetics and fate of spiked pu iv with initial concentration c 0 range 2 5 10 10 7 8 10 7 mol l 1 the results show that 99 of the spiked pu iv was easily associated with the natural aquatic colloids and transformed into relatively unstable pu pseudo colloids in 1 day and then gradually deposited and or adsorbed by the container walls with aging the suspended pu pseudo colloids decreased in similar exponential models with the rate equations of r t 3 1 10 10e t 4 and r t 1 3 10 8e t 3 for c 0 of 1 25 10 9 mol l 1and 4 17 10 8 mol l 1 respectively the colloidal pu was dominated by fe mn oxides at the early time but carbonates with slower depositing rate r t 6 9 10 12e 0 149t dominated it 82 at equilibrium state whatever the c 0 is the dissolved pu kept at 0 7 10 11 mol l 1 over aging and was dominated by pu iv at early time but by pu v vi 95 at equilibrium state with r t 92 9e t 16 6 96 9 the equilibrium times of the deposition and or adsorption and the speciation transformation of the colloidal and dissolved pu were 30 d 80 d and 120 d respectively the kinetic processes for each of the pu species could well be fitted by exponential model besides the dissolved pu increased with increasing c 0 due to the increase of the amount of puo2 c with particle size of 3 nm not separable with the dissolved pu in this study under higher c 0 by comparison of the observations for ultrapure water and groundwater with natural colloids removed it was sure that natural aquatic colloids could easily associate and facilitate pu to suspend a long time in the groundwater the mobile pu was dominated by pu pseudo colloids with main particle size of 100 kd for groundwater with natural colloids while it was dominated by pu intrinsic colloids with particle size of 100 kd in ultrapure water which had similar solubility to fe mn oxides the results imply that majority of released pu iv in highly saline groundwater will be easily associated with natural aquatic colloids and then become immobile in short time due to deposition and or adsorption of the environmental medium but potential migration risk caused by stable suspended pu colloids cannot be ignored acknowledgements the authors would like to thank ruirong zhang wei liang yaoqin wang and xiufang zhai for their assistance in the experiments this research was supported

1576,the mobility of plutonium pu in groundwater is dependent of its speciation distribution and transformation the speciation and transformation kinetics of pu iv and its colloids in highly saline groundwater have however been rarely studied in the present study groundwater ionic strength 1 m from dunhuang region nw china was collected for investigating the speciation transformation kinetics and fate of spiked pu iv with aging time the results showed that 99 of the spiked pu iv over initial concentration c 0 range 2 5 10 10 7 8 10 7 mol l 1 was easily associated with the natural colloids and transformed into relatively unstable pu pseudo colloids in 1 day which then gradually deposited and or adsorbed on the container walls with aging the suspended pu pseudo colloids decreased in similar exponential models with rate equations r t 3 1 10 10e t 4 and 1 3 10 8e 3 for c 0 1 25 10 9 mol l 1and 4 17 10 8 mol l 1 respectively the chemical speciation of the suspended colloidal pu was dominated by fe mn oxides at the early time while carbonates with slower depositing rate r t 6 9 10 12e 0 149t dominated it 82 at equilibrium state whatever the c 0 was the concentration of dissolved pu i e the apparent solubility of pu kept at 0 7 10 11 mol l 1 over aging the valence of dissolved pu was dominated by pu iv at early time while pu v vi would become dominant 95 at equilibrium state with transformation rate of r t 92 9e t 16 6 96 9 the equilibrium times of pu deposition and or adsorption speciation transformation of the suspended colloidal pu and valence change of the dissolved pu were 30 d 80 d and 120 d respectively the kinetic process for each pu species could be well fitted with exponential model these results suggest that the majority of released pu iv into highly saline groundwater will be easily associated with natural aquatic colloids and then become immobile in short time due to deposition and or adsorption onto the environmental medium but potential

2001 wang 2010 due to its hypertoxicity the transport of plutonium pu in the groundwater is an indispensable research subject xie et al 2014 kersting 2013 novikov et al 2006 salbu and skipperud 2009 for the siting and safety assessment of an hlw repository pu released into groundwater can exist in various physicochemical forms ranging from simple pu iv pu v cations and puo2 am hy to complex pu polymers and pu colloids include pu intrinsic colloids and pu pseudo colloids choppin 2006 salbu 2007 the mobility of pu strongly depends on its speciation in groundwater choppin 2006 for example aqueous pu iv readily hydrolyzes and forms amorphous oxyhydroxides polymeric species i e pu intrinsic colloid which then associates easily with the migratory natural aquatic colloids walther et al 2009 zhao et al 2016 kersting and reimus 2003 van de weerd and leijnse 1997 while pu v usually exists as dissolved species and can migrate along with the flow of groundwater powell et al 2014 runde et al 2002 orlandini et al 1986 the speciation and fate of pu are significantly affected by physicochemical parameters of groundwater including eh ph ion strength especially the content and component of natural aquatic colloids kersting and reimus 2003 hu et al 2008 kunze et al 2008 therefore in case of a leakage of a repository it is crucial to examine the speciation transformation and the fate of released pu under specific hydrochemical environment previous investigations were carried out mainly focusing on the physicochemical species solubility and aquatic environment behavior of pu in natural groundwaters but excluding the speciation transformation rate of pu iv stepan et al 2011 buesseler et al 2009 efurd et al 1998 hu et al 2008 kersting et al 1999 and in simulated groundwaters t

assess its stability and mobility in groundwater systems e g how did the concentration of total pu vary and the pu iv disproportionate with aging in contaminated groundwater moreover a final nuclear waste repository may be located in a highly saline geology region usually accompanied by highly saline groundwater environment wang 2010 remi marsac et al 2017 and references therein which can affect the fate of released pu salbu and skipperud 2009 choppin 2006 xie et al 2012 besides knowledge of natural aquatic colloids is crucial for understanding the environmental mobility sorptivity redox processes of pu in the groundwater which perform a significant control on pu transport in natural waters saito et al 2013 kersting et al 1999 as pu iv can easily associate with natural aquatic colloids the chemical species of colloidal pu and its transformation rateaffect its stability and mobility in aquatic system however they are also rarely investigated n stepan et al 2011 in the present study highly saline groundwater from dunhuang region nw china was collected for investigating the speciation transformation kinetics and the fate of spiked pu iv we mainly examined the transformation rates and equilibrium times of the suspended colloidal and dissolved pu oxidation states of the dissolved pu and chemical species of the colloidal pu through nitrogen protection of the groundwater over the whole sampling transportation and experiment process the results are expected to be more unique and representative for a specific highly saline groundwater from the most potential site of chinese waste repository 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and characterization of the groundwater five liter groundwater 100 m depth was collected into a protective container with a self designed nitrogen assistant sampling equipment from a monitoring well in dunhuang region under sampling flow rate of 0 5 l min and kept in an anaerobic glove box in lab shown as fig 1 the sampling operation with small flow rate would not disturb the groundwater system because the water level was not found to be lowered after the sampling the groundwater have a tds total dissolved solids content of 9 2 0 4 g l 1 ionic strength of 1 m eh of 75 5 mv and ph of 7 4 0 1 see table s1 in the supporting information the salt content in the sample in significantly higher than for simulated groundwater

samples were kept in the glove box over the whole experiment period up to 180 d to ensure that the small changes of ph from 7 5 to7 8 and eh from 70 to 50 mv have less impact on the speciation of pu see fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 in the supporting information the concentration and particle size distribution of natural colloids in the groundwater were measured by direct filtration method combined with dls dynamic light scattering zeta sizer nano zs malvern instruments analysis giving a colloid concentration of 9 4 2 0 mg l 1 and a two component size distribution with the major one 65 of 450 nm 800 nm and a minor one 35 of 220 nm 450 nm the mineral composition of natural colloids was characterized by x ray diffraction xrd measurements showing that the colloids were mainly consisting of carbonate sulfate and silicate see fig s4 in the supporting information 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 experimental design 239pu stock solution 1 μg g 1 95 of 239pu iv checked by solvent extraction schramke et al 1989 wang et al 2014 was purified using dowex 1 4 anion exchange resin to remove the decay products and other impurities and adjusted to pu iv groundwater sample was divided into several subsamples into which various amounts of pu iv were added as soon as possible the details of the experiments are listed in table 1 briefly exp a to exp f were designed to study the speciation transformation kinetics of pu iv in the groundwater with aging time under different initial concentrations exp h and exp j with natural colloids removed by untrafiltration using 10 kd ultra filter were contrast experiments to examine the effect of natural colloids on the speciation of pu in addition the changes of ph and eh were monitored in the exp c and exp e to confirm the effectiveness of the protective measures on the groundwater exp g and exp i were performed as parallel experiments for exp b and exp h to confirm the accuracy of the experimentation the distribution and kinetic processes of multiple pu speciation were examined at various aging times during the experiment mainly including the transformation rates and equilibrium times of the suspended colloidal pu and dissolved pu oxidation states of the dissolved pu and chemical species of the colloidal pu the adsorption of pu on the membrane and ultrafiltration tube and the uniformity of pu concentration in water samples were checked before experiment the results show that these factors have negligible influences on the investigation results of 239pu speciation transformation see table s2 fig s5 and table s3

fractionation technique 4 ml sample solution was filtrated with 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm millipore filters 100 kd and 10 kd ultrafiltration tubes amicon ultra 4 ml millipore in order the concentration of 239pu in each filtrate was analyzed using isotope dilution inductivity coupled plasma mass spectrometric method id icp ms to calculate the particle size distribution of the colloidal pu 2 2 3 analysis

kaplan et al 2004 in this study the pu permeated through the 10 kd ultrafiltration tube was regarded as dissolved pu the oxidation states of which were investigated using solvent extraction method as described in the literatures schramke et al 1989 wang et al 2014 briefly samples containing pu were adjusted to 1 m hcl solution from which pu iv and pu iv vi were extracted by tta xylene and hdehp xylene solutions respectively the concentrations of pu iv pu iv and pu vi were calculated by determination of plutonium remained in the aqueous phase after extraction 2 2 5 sample pretreatment for 239pu determination of samples containing pu colloids the samples containing pu colloids was first acid digested three digestion methods were investigated and the digestion method using 8 m hno3 for 2

colloidal and dissolved pu in the groundwater solutions with aging time concentrations of total colloidal and dissolved pu in the groundwater were determined at various aging times for exp b exp c and exp e as shown in fig 2 the kinetic processes were fitted with a first order mechanism exponential decay profile for the concentration change including total pu c t colloidal pu c c and dissolved pu c

0 25 d 1 during 30 d and a steady dissolved pu concentration level around 0 8 10 11 mol l 1 meanwhile most of pu in the solution is in colloidal form with c c decreased as decreasing c t accordingly with nearly asame decrease rate r t and r c fig 2 b and c show similar change trends suggesting that shaking and pu initial concentration c 0 do not greatly affect the concentration change trends but the dynamic process has been obviously accelerated by shaking exp c which was evidenced by a greater rate constant 0 44 d 1 compared to that for exp b 0 25 d 1 besides a higher c 0 4 17 10 8 mol l 1 for exp e could result in greater c c c d and k than those for exp b c 0 1 25 10 9 mol l 1 which means that colloidal pu can be formed easily for higher initial pu concentration see fig 3 meanwhile fig 4 shows that although both exp b in the presence of natural colloids and exp h in absence of natural colloids for same initial pu concentration have decreasing c t and c c the rate constant k of c c for exp b 0 26 d 1 was less than that for exp h 0 4 d 1 this indicated that pu would suspend a longer time in groundwater containing colloids and thus might migrate for a relative long distance in the favor of the colloids it can be seen from table 2 that if the aging time t went to infinity c d in exp b exp c and exp e would be 0 7 10 11 mol l 1 0 7 10 11 mol l 1 and 4 1 10 11 mol l 1 respectively this indicated an apparent solubility of 0 7 10 11 4 1 10 11 mol l 1 for pu in the investigated groundwater and 0 7 10 11 mol l 1 may be more closer to the intrinsic solubility taking into consideration of the formation of very fine intrinsic pu colloids under higher pu concentration see fig 5 the fraction of colloidal pu in groundwater increased with initial pu concentration c 0 the solubility obtained is obviously lower than that of pu iv hydroxide calculated by xie et al 2015 for ionic strength i 0 and pu iv pu v vi and pu iv coll calculated and experimentally determined by

was mostly in dissolved form 77 except exp e exp f and exp j while the rest was in colloidal form 23 the decrease of c t in the solutions during aging may be also partly accounted by coprecipitation of pu iv with other elements and or sorption to container walls the coprecipitation may occur because the ground water collected is over saturated the activity products of some natural compounds which

it show that caso4 caco3 and fe oh 3 were all in saturated state and a part of which may precipitate and remove pu from the solutions when the groundwater was kept away from its habitat environment it should be noted that colloidal pu 63 4 would dominate in pu solution for very high initial pu concentration for exp e and exp f this may be due to the forming of pu intrinsic colloid quickly before pu

with initial concentration presented in fig 6 was mainly consisting of colloidal pu with particle size of 3 nm formed under high initial pu concentration which was also demonstrated by the increasing c c c t with increasing c 0 from exp b to exp f as presented in fig 5 3 2 particle size distribution of the suspended colloidal pu the particle size distribution of the suspended colloidal pu after 180 days aging for exp b was measured as shown in fig 7 it is seen that the majority of the colloidal pu particle size 10 kd or 3 nm in the groundwater has particle size 450 nm while the minority of it with particle size ranging from 10 nm 100 kd to 450 nm the particle size distribution of colloidal pu was very similar to that of natural colloids in the groundwater examined so it is deduced that spiked pu was first adsorbed onto natural colloids and then deposited at the bottom of the container and or adsorbed by the container walls the results obtained matched the particle distribution of pu associated colloids in the groundwater at mayak site with anoxic condition examined by stepan et al 2011 it is well recognized that natural aquatic colloids in groundwater is one of the main factors affecting the speciation distribution and migration of pu kersting and reimus 2003 van de weerd and leijnse 1997 degueldre et al 1996 but the difference in pu partition in granitic groundwater with natural colloids present or removed is not very clear so we compared the particle size distributions of the suspended colloidal pu with and without natural colloids as shown in fig 7 exp b vs exp h it can be seen that most of the spiked pu transformed into colloidal pu with particle size of 10 nm in groundwater containing natural colloids while it mainly kept as dissolved species and formed pu intrinsic colloids with particle size mainly of 10 nm in the groundwater free of natural colloids this implied that natural aquatic colloids can easily adsorb pu and thus carries pu to wherever it goes 3 3 speciation transformation ant its kinetics of the suspended colloidal pu with aging time the speciation distribution of the suspended colloidal pu was investigated as function of aging time for exp e by the modified tessier method which categorizes the colloidal pu into five fractions f1 exchangeable f2 carbonate f3 fe mn oxide f4 organic and f5 residual the change trends of the relative percentage and absolute amount of the five fractions with aging time are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the kinetic processes of the five fractions were well fitted by exponential model and the results are summarized in table 4 the approximate 100 of extraction recoveries at various aging times as shown in fig 8 demonstrated the validness of the sequential extraction process it can be seen from figs 8 and 9 the equilibrium time of speciation transformation of the suspended colloidal pu was 80 d the absolute amount of each fraction decreased with aging time in 30 days and then changed little note that the measurement uncertainty may be great for very low pu concentration the fe mn oxide fraction f3 and carbonate fraction f2 account for the most part of colloidal pu at the early time but carbonates with slower deposited rate see table 4 r t 6 9 10 12e 0 149t became dominant 82 at equilibrium state with the other relative fractions coming as f3 12 7 f4 4 1 f5 2 4 f1 0 8 the chemical speciation of the suspended colloidal pu for different c 0 exp e exp f and additional exp 1 and exp 2 are compared in fig 10 it is seen that c 0 has little effect on the chemical speciation distribution of the colloidal pu however high initial pu concentration tends to have a higher percentage of f3 fraction which may suggest the formation of pu intrinsic colloids under high c 0 to clarify this perception the chemical speciation of the colloidal pu in original groundwater exp g and that in ultra pure water exp j after 1 year s aging were compared in fig 11 the results show that f2 dominated the colloidal pu in the groundwater while f3 is the main speciation of colloidal pu in the ultra pure water as we know there were no carbonates and fe mn oxides in ultra pure water so it can be deduced that dissolvability of f3 fraction for exp j should be similar with the pu intrinsic colloids in other words pu intrinsic colloids have similar dissolvability to the colloidal fe mn oxides in the extraction it should be noted that chemical speciation of the colloidal pu for exp 1 and exp 2 giving a relative high percentage of f4 fraction were measured after 200 days aging instead of 120 d for exp e and exp f furthermore exp 1 and exp 2 are parallel experiments and the consistent results also demonstrated that the chemical speciation analysis procedure is valid and applicable for this study 3 4 valence transformation ant its kinetics of the dissolved pu with aging time the valence transformation ant its kinetics of the dissolved pu with aging time were examined and the results are presented in fig 12 it shows that pu iv dominated the dissolved pu in early time 10 d see fig 12a as the spiked pu was originally tetravalent however the percent of pu iv for dissolved pu decreased gradually over aging while pu v vi increased accordingly as shown in fig 12b it means that the weakly reductive atmosphere of the groundwater eh 75 mv cannot maintain the dissolved pu of less than 1 at pu iv state which would still be oxidized to pu v vi slowly during aging the transformation marched with a half conversion time of 12 4 days and reached equilibrium after 120 d with pu v vi percentage of 95 which is more soluble while pu iv could not be found due to adsorption and coprecipitation with natural aquatic colloids in the groundwater the rate constant k 0 056 d 1 of valence transformation is much less than those of total or colloidal pu concentration changes e g for exp b k for both total pu and colloidal pu was 0 25 d 1 implying that slow oxidation of pu iv did occur during aging and the pu iv fraction decrease was not simply due to the readily adsorption or precipitation of pu iv however the reason of oxidation of pu iv in the groundwater under weakly reductive condition is not clear yet and needs further study 4 conclusion highly saline granitic groundwater with ionic strength 1 m from dunhuang region nw china was collected for investigating the speciation transformation kinetics and fate of spiked pu iv with initial concentration c 0 range 2 5 10 10 7 8 10 7 mol l 1 the results show that 99 of the spiked pu iv was easily associated with the natural aquatic colloids and transformed into relatively unstable pu pseudo colloids in 1 day and then gradually deposited and or adsorbed by the container walls with aging the suspended pu pseudo colloids decreased in similar exponential models with the rate equations of r t 3 1 10 10e t 4 and r t 1 3 10 8e t 3 for c 0 of 1 25 10 9 mol l 1and 4 17 10 8 mol l 1 respectively the colloidal pu was dominated by fe mn oxides at the early time but carbonates with slower depositing rate r t 6 9 10 12e 0 149t dominated it 82 at equilibrium state whatever the c 0 is the dissolved pu kept at 0 7 10 11 mol l 1 over aging and was dominated by pu iv at early time but by pu v vi 95 at equilibrium state with r t 92 9e t 16 6 96 9 the equilibrium times of the deposition and or adsorption and the speciation transformation of the colloidal and dissolved pu were 30 d 80 d and 120 d respectively the kinetic processes for each of the pu species could well be fitted by exponential model besides the dissolved pu increased with increasing c 0 due to the increase of the amount of puo2 c with particle size of 3 nm not separable with the dissolved pu in this study under higher c 0 by comparison of the observations for ultrapure water and groundwater with natural colloids removed it was sure that natural aquatic colloids could easily associate and facilitate pu to suspend a long time in the groundwater the mobile pu was dominated by pu pseudo colloids with main particle size of 100 kd for groundwater with natural colloids while it was dominated by pu intrinsic colloids with particle size of 100 kd in ultrapure water which had similar solubility to fe mn oxides the results imply that majority of released pu iv in highly saline groundwater will be easily associated with natural aquatic colloids and then become immobile in short time due to deposition and or adsorption of the environmental medium but potential migration risk caused by stable suspended pu colloids cannot be ignored acknowledgements the authors would like to thank ruirong zhang wei liang yaoqin wang and xiufang zhai for their assistance in the experiments this research was supported

1577,the uniform migration of remedial amendments in an aquifer was negatively influenced by medium heterogeneity and the density effect of amendment this study sought to use a polymer xanthan to enhance the uniformity of amendment distribution in contamination zones visible tank experiments were conducted to investigate the feasibility and performance of xanthan enhanced kmno4 delivery in the simulated aquifer the results showed that the addition of xanthan improved fluid movement into the lower permeability stratum so the overall sweeping efficiency was remarkably increased compared to the fluid control test without polymer using in two layered aquifer systems the smaller the thickness of the low permeability layer is or the greater the permeability contrast between layers is the more obvious the enhancement of the uniform distribution of remedial fluid by xanthan the sinking of kmno4 solution in medium and coarse sand aquifers was obvious and the effect of kmno4 concentration and aquifer medium size on the density effect was evaluated the fluid viscosity increase caused by xanthan addition could stabilize the displacement front and reduce the density effect xanthan kmno4 applications were more effective at penetrating finer grained lenses and played a more obvious role in tce oxidation removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords xanthan heterogeneous aquifer density effect sweeping efficiency enhanced delivery 1 introduction the injection of remedial amendments into aquifers is a popular remediation alternative for groundwater pollution the contaminants in groundwater can be mineralized to carbon dioxide water and other inorganic substances or transformed into compounds that have less mobility or toxicity than their original form through reactions with amendments baciocchi et al 2014 baciocchi 2013 vermeul et al 2003 apart from the amendment properties the contaminant removal efficiency in aquifers mainly depends on the uniform distribution of remediation agents in contamination zones and their contact with contaminants marble et al 2010 yan et al 2011 west and kueper 2012 however heterogeneity which is often encountered in the subsurface causes fluid bypassing by creating preferential flow paths in higher permeability zones zhong et al 2013 mccray et al 2010 furthermore due to the density difference between the injected solution and groundwater the reagents may float or sink during their migration in aquifer swartz and schwartz 1998 konz et al 2009 this density effect is quite common in groundwater solute transport and aquifer remediation schincariol and schwartz 1990 reported that even a small density difference of 0 8 kg m3 could cause very unstable flow displacement in porous media therefore medium heterogeneity and the density effect have adverse influences on the uniform migration and distribution of reagent which will considerably reduce the remedial amendment utilization efficiency significantly prolong the remediation period and increase the cost jeyasingh et al 2011 west and kueper 2012 to address heterogeneity induced bypassing problems water soluble and shear thinning polymers were used as the co injected reagents to enhance the cross flow between porous media that have different permeability the viscosity of shear thinning fluid is a function of the shear rate with higher shear causing lower viscosity the shear rate is typically higher in lower permeability zones than that in higher permeability zones the reduced relative viscosity facilitates the penetration of the fluid into the low permeability zones and balances the overall fluid migration condition zhong et al 2008 zhong et al 2011 zhong et al 2013 this method has been widely implemented to solve the problem of preferential and bypass flow during oil recovery in the petroleum industry lake 1989 johansen 1979 carboxymethylcellulose wang et al 2017 guar gum tiraferri et al 2008 tiraferri et al 2008 hydrolyzed polyacrylamide rahul et al 2014 and slurry pro oostrom et al 2007 truex et al 2011 are all polymer alternatives that have been used for subsurface applications and the most widely investigated and used polymer for remediation purposes is the biopolymer xanthan zhong et al 2008 2013 evaluated the rheological behavior of xanthan solution and studied the effects of medium heterogeneity on fluid migration in a series of two dimensional flow cells with different kinds of formation lenses they found that xanthan solution showed considerable shear thinning properties it can efficiently improve access to lower permeability zones in heterogeneous systems through viscosity modification oostrom et al 2014 also obtained similar results and they identified the crossflow between layers with different permeability as the main reason for the more uniform migration of shear thinning fluid mccray et al 2010 carried out many bench scale experiments to investigate amendment transport characteristics under a controlled viscosity they found that polymer injection remarkably increased the amendment sweeping efficiency especially in the lower permeability zones in order to evaluate the impact of the shear thinning fluid on solutes distribution uniformity truex et al 2015 conducted a field test to compare the data from successive injection of a tracer in water followed by in a shear thinning fluid in the presence of permeability contrasts within the targeted injection zone they found that injection solutions amended by shear thinning fluid arrived faster and to a greater extent in monitoring locations within low permeability zones oostrom et al 2014 validated the use of shear thinning fluid for the enhanced delivery of bioremediation amendments at a department of defense dod site polluted by chlorinated solvents the improved ability of polymers to clean up less accessible zones can greatly reduce the potential for rebounds in contaminant concentration to address unstable flow displacement problems induced by density effect short chain alcohols were used to modify the density of displacing fluids shook et al 1997 1998 and kostarelos et al 1998 conducted laboratory studies to create neutral buoyant surfactant floods by adding alcohol when the dnapl was dissolved the density of the resulting microemulsion was equal to or less than the density of groundwater jawitz et al 1997 reported that cosolvent displacements can minimize density segregation by using 70 ethanol 30 water besides viscosity increasing for the displacing fluid was proposed in order to reduce the downward migration of micro emulsions during surfactant flushing kostarelos et al 1998 it restricts the motion of micro emulsions by trapping them within the network of polymer chains thus preventing the sinking of amendments polymer has also been used in zvi particles delivery through porous media under the same mechanism truex 2011 hung et al 2012 vecchia et al 2009 xin et al 2016 although the preliminary experimental results look promising the relationship between formation properties and viscous fluid migration needs to be further studied in addition most of researchers mainly used the method of viscosity increasing to solve the sinking problem of colloidal solution without mentioning using this method to solve the problem of solute sinking caused by density effect therefore the influence of fluid viscosity modifications on the density effect of remediation agents is still not clear as a common and strong oxidant potassium permanganate kmno4 has been used for a long time in environmental remediation it was used as the oxidant in this experiment meanwhile trichloroethylene tce and xanthan were used as the target contaminant and shear thinning polymer respectively tce was oxidized by kmno4 through the following reaction equation kao et al 2008 coolidge 2009 2kmno 4 c 2 hcl 3 2co 2 2mno 2 2 k h 3cl in this series of experiments firstly different heterogeneous formations were simulated to visually investigate the effect of layer thickness and differing permeability on viscous fluid migration secondly the effect of kmno4 concentration aquifer medium size and fluid viscosity on the density effect was evaluated finally the improvement in kmno4 induced oxidation of tce in the presence of xanthan was quantified by using a two dimensional flow cell containing contaminated lower permeability zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials xanthan shanghai pengteng company china the polymer used in this test was a clarified food grade polysaccharide in the form of yellow powder permanganate kmno4 in the form of violet black crystals was supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent company china brilliant blue and erythrosin are biological dyes they were purchased from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china brilliant blue was used as a visible nonreactive tracer in these experiments erythrosin dye was used to color the xanthan solutions to visualize solution transport within the quartz sands porous media experiments showed that the two dyes had little effect on the rheological behavior of the xanthan solution tce at 99 purity was obtained from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china the equilibrium solubility of tce is 1000 mg l in water deionized di water was used throughout the experiments four kinds of quartz sands with different particle sizes were used as the packing materials for the column and tank models the physical characteristics of the four types of sands used in experiments are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 the sweeping efficiency improvements by xanthan in two layer heterogeneity structure a schematic of the two dimensional experimental setup is presented in fig 1a the tank was constructed of plexiglass with stainless steel frames fixed outside to prevent the deformation of the tank caused by excessive pressure during the experiments the interior dimensions of the tank were 450 mm in length 300 mm in height and 50 mm in width fluids were viscosity tested and then injected through four evenly spaced 60 cm distance inflow ports each inflow port connected with a heavy gauge perforated plexiglass screen that allowed influent to evenly and freely enter the sand chamber outflow also occurred through four equally spaced effluent ports the quartz sands were wet packed during sand packing water was added to the tank to maintain a depth 3 4 cm higher than the sand layer the dry sands were slowly filled into the tank and were tamped to drive out air bubbles in order to promote complete saturation the total height of the packed sand was 30 cm two different permeability layers layer1 and 2 were constructed in the sand tank the top of the sand layer was sealed with 10 mm thick bentonite as an upper capillary barrier then the tank was sealed with a plexiglass cap which was tightened with screws to prevent any air or liquid leakage by the excessive pressure during experiments four high pressure constant current pumps dalian elite analytical instruments company p230p china were used to drive fluids from left to right through the sand tank at a constant flow rate of 0 5 ml min the effluent fluids were collected at a constant height similar to the water level in the tank when the tank was completely saturated with di water 200 mg l brilliant blue solution was injected by pumps the position of the blue dye at regular time intervals was recorded by tracing the dye position on the tank and by photo documentation until the solution completely swept the pore volume pv of the sand after the complete saturation of blue dye xanthan solutions with erythrosin dye were injected to observe their transport characteristics and sweeping efficiency under modified viscosity the concentration of xanthan and erythrosin dye was 300 and 200 mg l respectively similarly the positions of the red xanthan solutions were visually observed digital photographs documenting temporal dye front positions within the tanks were processed using auto cad 2007 software thus the sweeping efficiency and fluid migration rate in each layer could be calculated in addition to photo documenting these experiments the temporal positions of the dye fronts for both the tracers were physically traced on the front of the tank using a marker pen the sweeping efficiency se and fluid migration rate were determined based on the following se swept area total area of tank 100 fluid migration rate migration distance at regulat time migration time se and migration rate were evaluated at the dye concentration of 20 mg l because the dye could not be seen below that concentration the migration distance was determined based on the midpoint of the dye front penetrating each layer there were four kinds of media settings in this set of experiments they were as follows 1 50 medium sand 50 fine sand means the ratio of each layer s thickness to the total height of the media 2 25 medium sand 75 fine sand 3 75 medium sand 25 fine sand and 4 50 medium sand 50 silty sand through comparisons among these experiments the effect of layer thickness and differing permeability on the improvement of polymer sweeping efficiency can be evaluated 2 2 2 kmno4 migration properties in an aquifer under the influence of the density effect and modified viscosity twelve tank experiments were conducted in this section the conditions for each group of experiments are presented in table 2 the experimental setup was generally similar to that in fig 1a except that the media were homogeneous before the tank experiments started experimental solutions were density and viscosity tested at room temperature 22 c the fluid was injected at a constant flow rate of 0 5 ml min by pumps the distribution of kmno4 was visually noted by tracing the purple color the color of the kmno4 solution position in the tank at corresponding times the migration front of kmno4 in porous media were evaluated at the kmno4 concentration of 50 mg l because kmno4 could not be seen below that concentration in quartz sand packed tank 2 2 3 improvement in kmno4 induced oxidation of tce in lower permeability zones in the presence of xanthan the main component of this experiment equipment was shown in fig 1b and c other auxiliary experimental equipments were generally similar to that in fig 1a there was a finer grained lens 0 1 0 25 mm in the main aquifer medium 0 5 1 mm after sand packing the tank was sealed with a plexiglass cap and the tank was saturated with di water then 8 ml of pure phase tce was injected into the finer grained lens through a silicone tube the injection point was shown in fig 1b this series of experiments consisted of five consecutive procedures 1 injecting di water from the four left inlets to the tank until tce was monitored in one of the outlets after which the distribution of tce in the tank was evaluated 2 injecting 2 pv kmno4 solution at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 3 injecting 3 pv di water to flush most of the kmno4 out of the tank 4 injecting 2 pv xanthan kmno4 mixed solution into the tank at the same flow rate as that used in procedure 2 and 5 injecting 3 pv di water to remove kmno4 from the tank the kmno4 and xanthan concentrations were 2 5 g l and 300 mg l respectively the tce mno4 and cl concentrations ph and orp were monitored at different time intervals during these experiments following the experiment the sand profile was disassembled and sand samples were collected from the aquifer at the locations of each sampling port 2 3 analytical methods the measuring procedure for the determination of porosity is to slowly saturate the tank with di water from the bottom to the top surface of the sand in order to displace all the gas in the tank then the porosity of the sand tank is the ratio of the water volume introduced to the volume of the sand tank a densitometer beyong test precision instrument da 130 n china was used to test the densities of experimental solutions and a viscometer brookfield dv2t lvcj0 america was used for their viscosity measurements the range of shear rate was between 1 s 1 and 200 s 1 a spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific 8a6t america was used to measure the concentration of kmno4 at wavelength of 525 nm a 1 5 ml water sample was collected by a 2 5 ml syringe and filtered samples were collected using 42 ml headspace bottle and then analyzed for tce kmno4 and cl concentrations each sand sample 0 2 g collected from the aquifers after remediation experiments was placed in a headspace bottle for subsequent measurement water and sand tce samples were measured by purge and trap gas chromatography thermo scientific trace isq gc america the chromatograph operating conditions were as follows hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm inlet temperature 200 c column temperature 50 c detector temperature 280 c fid detector the purge and trap conditions were as follows trap temperature 25 c blow off time 10 min analytical temperature 180 c blowing gas high purity n2 blowing flow rate 40 ml min 3 results and discussion 3 1 improvement of sweeping efficiency by xanthan in a two layer heterogeneous structure 3 1 1 effect of formation thickness on media sweeping efficiency 3 1 1 1 equal thickness of medium sand and fine sand fig s1 shows the apparent viscosity shear rate relationship of different solutions at room temperature the 300 mg l xanthan solution showed considerable shear thinning at 1 s 1 shear rate its viscosity was 36 84 cp when the shear rate approached 200 s 1 the viscosity reduced to 5 cp and the addition of kmno4 to the solution had negligible influence on its rheological behavior the fluid migration and distribution in the 50 medium sand 50 fine sand tank in the absence of xanthan were shown in fig 2a it was clearly observed that the brilliant blue dye migrated much faster in higher permeability media coarse sand than in lower permeability media fine sand moreover the migration of blue dye almost independently occurred within each layer after blue dye had completely swept the tank 300 mg l xanthan dyed with 200 mg l erythrosin solution was injected into the tank from the left side fig 2b illustrates that the addition of xanthan significantly improved the sweeping efficiency the increased viscosity of the xanthan solution promoted cross flow between the two aquifer systems as a result of the mobility reduction in higher permeability media and the mobility increase in the lower permeability media the total pv required to completely sweep the tank without and with xanthan was 2 26 and 1 7 pv respectively this means that compared to the fluid control test without the use of polymer although the dosage of the remedial agent was reduced by 25 the viscous fluid could achieve the same sweeping efficiency in the lower permeability formation 3 1 1 2 varying thickness of medium sand and fine sand two additional two layer tanks were prepared to study the effect of layer thicknesses on improvements to polymer sweeping efficiency the fluid migration and distribution in the 75 medium sand 25 fine sand tank and the 25 medium sand 75 fine sand tank were shown in fig s2 the addition of xanthan significantly improved the sweeping efficiency in both group experiments for the 25 medium sand 75 fine sand tank the addition of 300 mg l xanthan reduced the number of pv required to completely sweep the tank from 1 98 pv brilliant blue dye to 1 62 pv xanthan dyed with erythrosine for the 75 medium sand 25 fine sand tank the number of pv required to completely sweep the tank was reduced from 3 9 pv to 1 78 pv compared to the xanthan enhancements in the layered aquifer systems with 25 medium sand 75 fine sand and 50 medium sand 50 fine sand the reduction in the number of pvs required to completely sweep the tank was the highest 54 in the 75 medium sand 25 fine sand layered system in addition the 75 medium sand 25 fine sand layered system had the highest increase in migration rate in the lower permeability medium caused by xanthan enhancement a summary of the experimental results for all three two layer tanks is presented in table 3 as shown in table 3 the relative thickness of the sediment layer had a significant influence on the enhancement of sweeping effectiveness by xanthan that is the smaller the thickness of the lower permeability layer was the more clearly xanthan enhanced uniform distribution 3 1 2 effect of permeability contrast on media sweeping efficiency an additional 2 layer tank 50 medium sand 50 silty sand experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of different media permeability on sweeping efficiency the experimental results are shown in fig 2c and d the number of pv required to completely sweep the tank was 3 8 pv when xanthan was injected as opposed to the 7 8 pv needed for the nonpolymer case in the 50 medium sand 50 silty sand tank this represented a better than a 50 improvement in the utilization efficiency of the remedial fluid the rate of fluid migration in silty sand increased from 0 0052 cm min to 0 020 cm min or by a factor of 284 increment the effect of permeability differences on the sweeping efficiency of in a two layer system is summarized in table 3 it can be seen that the effect of increasing the relative permeability difference between the two layers was an increase in the number of pv required to completely sweep the tank e g 2 26 pv vs 7 8 pv and 1 7 pv vs 3 8 pv furthermore the enhancement of fluid infiltration into the lower permeability layer and of the uniform distribution of fluid by xanthan was more obvious in the two layer system with a greater permeability difference e g 0 0052 0 020 cm min vs 0 023 0 027 cm min and 7 8 3 8 pv vs 2 26 1 7 pv overall heterogeneity in aquifer often present as stratification of various permeability can adversely affect the sweeping efficiency and remediation performance of remedial amendments by creating preferential flow into the higher permeability stratum thus leaving important non swept zones in lower permeability layers the use of polymer solutions to increase the sweeping efficiency of remedial amendments in lower permeability zones or to improve uniform amendment distribution in contamination zones is an effective technique in heterogeneous contaminated site remediation the smaller the thickness of the low permeability layer is or the greater the permeability contrast between layers is the more obvious the enhancement of the uniform distribution of remedial fluid by polymer 3 2 kmno4 migration properties in an aquifer under the influence of the density effect and modified viscosity 3 2 1 distribution of kmno4 in the absence of xanthan from table 2 the densities of different solutions increased with the increment of both kmno4 and xanthan concentrations the density differences between 2 5 5 0 g l kmno4 solutions and distilled water approached 1 5 kg m3 and 3 2 kg m3 respectively which were greater than the threshold of 0 8 kg m3 0 8 kg m3 could cause very unstable flow displacement in porous media when kmno4 solution migrates forward in aquifer there would be an angle β between the displacement front and the horizontal direction this angle can indicate the degree of fluid sinking specifically 90 is for an ideal uniform flow and the smaller the β value the more obvious the sinking phenomenon kmno4 migration and distribution in aquifers in the absence of xanthan were shown fig 3 density effect had little influence on the migration of kmno4 in aquifers of fine sand and medium sand 1 g l kmno4 so we didn t present them in the figure for other experiments the photographs showed different degrees of kmno4 sinking in addition the sinking phenomenon became increasingly obvious during kmno4 migration taking the coarse sand 1 g l kmno4 aquifer as an example the solute migration pattern gradually changed from plug flow to stratified flow from 0 35pv to 0 85pv this would result in serious nonuniform distribution of kmno4 in aquifers the changes in β under different injection concentrations of kmno4 in the absence of xanthan are shown in fig 4a β decreased continuously during kmno4 migration for all three experimental concentrations furthermore sinking occurred much faster in the initial experimental period then gradually slowed down throughout the experiment the order of the angle β was as follows β1 0g l β2 5g l β5 0g l that means that the greater the kmno4 concentration was the more obvious the density effect was 3 2 2 distribution of kmno4 in the presence of xanthan the distribution of kmno4 xanthan mixed solutions in the coarse sand tank is shown in fig 5 the changes in β under different injection concentrations of kmno4 and xanthan mixed solutions are presented in fig 4b and c the experimental results showed that for a given concentration of kmno4 the higher the concentration of xanthan was the smaller the influence of the density effect it means that the migration of kmno4 in the tank was closer to the form of plug flow and that the vertical distribution of kmno4 was more uniform this study shows that viscous fluids are effective for uniformly transporting solutes in porous media comparing with single kmno4 solutions the kmno4 xanthan mixed solutions have higher apparent viscosity which can produce stronger friction force and viscous force between the fluid and porous media thus providing a stronger drag force against the gravity of the denser fluid such effect results in a lower sinking rate for the amendment compared to that in water in other words weakens its density effect in aquifer 3 3 improvement in the kmno4 induced oxidation of tce in lower permeability zones in the presence of xanthan 3 3 1 tce contaminated aquifer remediation by kmno4 without xanthan the tce concentration distribution before injecting kmno4 is shown in fig 6a combined with fig 7a it can be seen that the tce concentration at each sampling port in the lower permeability media was not identical the reason for the different tce concentration distribution is that tce is a dnapl which leads to its downward migration by gravity therefore the tce concentrations at 4 3 4 4 and 4 5 were relatively higher meanwhile a small amount of aqueous tce migrated into the coarse sand medium due to the flushing effect of groundwater overall tce was mainly distributed in the lower permeability area which would continuously release pollutants in the absence of effective control and remediation the kmno4 migration and distribution during the injection of 2 5 g l kmno4 are shown in fig s3 the kmno4 concentrations at upstream sampling ports and effluent ports are shown in fig s4 clearly the kmno4 produced significant bypass flow and sinking phenomena in the heterogeneous formation after injecting 2 0pv kmno4 solution the sweeping efficiency was only 23 3 in the lower permeability formation most of the kmno4 entered into the lens from left side because of groundwater advection abnormal infiltration from the bottom right corner of the lower permeability formation was also observed this may be due to the uneven filling of the media during sand packing through fig 7a it can be seen that a certain amount of kmno4 reacted with tce to reduce the tce concentrations at 3 3 4 3 and 4 4 by 14 7 15 7 and 14 6 respectively after the injection of 2 0 pv kmno4 the largest tce concentration reduction 30 8 occurred at sampling port 4 5 due to the high kmno4 concentration there because kmno4 was not detected at sampling ports 3 4 and 3 5 tce only slowly decreased under groundwater flushing in the downstream area of the lower permeability formations as the kmno4 concentration increased the tce concentration began to decrease until its concentration reached 0 mg l after 2 0 pv kmno4 injection except for sampling port 4 5 the tce concentrations were all reduced by 20 at other sampling ports in lower permeability region as shown in fig 6b and 7a therefore it is noteworthy that kmno4 had a poor sweeping efficiency in the lens the tce concentration was reduced to 0 mg l at the downstream sampling port indicating that nearly all tce was oxidized by kmno4 in the higher permeability region the changes in cl ph and eh are shown in fig s5 kmno4 reacted with a relatively larger amount of tce at sampling port 4 5 therefore more hydrogen ions and cl were produced in this area and the ph value changed from 6 68 to 5 88 accordingly the eh value also increased from 362 mv to 506 mv because of change in kmno4 concentration the increase in kmno4 concentration and amount of tce oxidation in other sampling ports were smaller so the changes in cl ph and eh were less obvious than those at sampling port 4 5 3 3 2 tce contaminated aquifer remediation by kmno4 in the presence of xanthan after the injection of 2 pv kmno4 solution 3 pv di water was used to flush the kmno4 out of the tank most of the kmno4 flowed out with the groundwater only a very small amount of kmno4 inevitably remained in the interface area between the two different media as shown in fig s6a the tce distributions after flushing with 3 0 pv di water just before injecting kmno4 xanthan mixed fluids are shown in fig 6c in the lower permeability media the tce concentrations at 3 3 3 4 3 5 4 3 and 4 4 were 258 6 225 9 181 5 467 8 536 6 mg l respectively which were 10 3 14 4 lower than those before pure kmno4 injection fig 6a only the tce concentration in 4 5 353 6 mg l was 28 6 lower than that before pure kmno4 injection after flushing with 3 0 pv di water the tce concentrations at 3 6 3 7 4 6 and 4 7 increased from 0 mg l fig 6b to 27 6 11 6 81 8 and 32 4 mg l respectively which clearly reflected the rebound effect of the pollutants from lower permeability media as shown in fig s6 in the presence of xanthan the migration and distribution of kmno4 in the simulation tank were more uniform it is noteworthy that the kmno4 xanthan solution could enter into the lens from every direction apart from the regular entrance from the left side the infiltrations from the top and bottom were obvious and nearly consistent after 2 0 pv kmno4 xanthan mixed solution was injected the kmno4 sweeping efficiency increased to 48 in the lower permeability formation which was much higher than that 23 3 after 2 0 pv injection of pure kmno4 the tce and kmno4 distributions in lower permeability media and the downstream area of the simulated aquifer are shown in fig 7c and d in the lower permeability region kmno4 was detected at all the sampling ports with a concentration of 700 mg l compared to the kmno4 concentration in the lower permeability region during pure kmno4 injection both distribution and concentration of the remedial amendment were greatly improved for the downstream sampling ports the kmno4 concentration differences in the same vertical row 3 6 vs 4 6 3 7 vs 4 7 were much smaller than those in fig 7a combined with kmno4 concentration at upstream sampling ports and effluent ports fig s7 this indicates the resistance to the density effect conferred by modified viscosity in addition kmno4 detected in these four downstream sampling ports were later than those during pure kmno4 injection this is because of increased kmno4 infiltration into the lens which reduced the bypass flow around the lower permeability region therefore the kmno4 migration rate in the main aquifer medium decreased the tce concentration at the 3 5 sampling port decreased from 176 5 mg l to 60 3 mg l or a reduction in concentration of better than 65 8 meanwhile the reduction in tce concentration increased to approximately 30 in other sampling ports in the lower permeability region through a comparison between fig 7a and c the tce concentration changes in the lens clearly demonstrated that polymer could significantly enhance remediation in the lower permeability region the cl concentration ph and eh are shown in fig s8 the variation trends of cl ph and eh were almost identical at sampling ports 3 3 3 5 and 4 5 respectively the range of changes in these three parameters was much higher at sampling port 3 5 this was due to the highly increased reaction between kmno4 and tce near this sampling port following the experiment the sand profile was disassembled and sand samples were collected from the aquifer at each sampling port through measurement it was found that no contaminants were detected in most of the sand samples sand samples contaminated by tce are shown in fig s9 it is clear that most of the residual tce was in the lower permeability region especially near sampling port 4 4 this is consistent with the aqueous tce distribution before the remediation experiment started 8 ml tce 11 68 g was injected into the system through area partitioning and concentration averaging 2 74 g of tce i e 23 5 of the initial tce mass was calculated to be in the aquifer 2 17 g of tce i e 18 6 of the initial tce mass migrated out of the tank that means that most of the pollutants 57 8 were degraded by kmno4 with or without xanthan although we can not exactly determine the relative contribution of tce removal with or without xanthan the role of the polymer in the uniform distribution of the remedial amendment and tce removal enhancement in lower permeability media is considerably obvious xanthan is a shear thinning polymer due to the larger pore space in higher permeability media lower shear rates could be expected in the main region of the simulated aquifer in contrast higher shear thinning occurred in the lens with the lower permeability the apparent viscosity and pore pressure difference between the coarse and fine sands caused cross flow between the different porous media furthermore the macromolecular structure and higher viscosity of xanthan provide a strong flow resistance to the density effect both of these advantages of xanthan accelerate tce removal performance by kmno4 4 conclusions the uniform migration and distribution of remedial amendments are the key factors determining groundwater remediation efficiency groundwater remediation is often inefficient in heterogeneous formations because amendments bypass lower permeability strata and gravitational sinking occurs into the deep aquifer the increase in solution viscosity through the addition of shear thinning polymer into groundwater not only accelerates fluid movement into lower permeability strata but also stabilizes the displacement front and reduces the density effect the smaller the thickness of the low permeability layer is or the greater the permeability contrast between layers is the more obvious the enhancement of the uniform distribution of remedial fluid by xanthan the larger the concentration of xanthan is the closer the amendment migration pattern is to plug flow and so the vertical distribution of the amendment in the aquifer is more uniform after coinjection of kmno4 and xanthan into aquifer kmno4 will react with contaminants to form manganese dioxide while the xanthan as a carbon source could be biodegraded by indigenous microorganism this biostimulation by xanthan may have some positive effect on the residual contaminant degradation overall polymer enhanced kmno4

1577,the uniform migration of remedial amendments in an aquifer was negatively influenced by medium heterogeneity and the density effect of amendment this study sought to use a polymer xanthan to enhance the uniformity of amendment distribution in contamination zones visible tank experiments were conducted to investigate the feasibility and performance of xanthan enhanced kmno4 delivery in the simulated aquifer the results showed that the addition of xanthan improved fluid movement into the lower permeability stratum so the overall sweeping efficiency was remarkably increased compared to the fluid control test without polymer using in two layered aquifer systems the smaller the thickness of the low permeability layer is or the greater the permeability contrast between layers is the more obvious the enhancement of the uniform distribution of remedial fluid by xanthan the sinking of kmno4 solution in medium and coarse sand aquifers was obvious and the effect of kmno4 concentration and aquifer medium size on the density effect was evaluated the fluid viscosity increase caused by xanthan addition could stabilize the displacement front and reduce the density effect xanthan kmno4 applications were more effective at penetrating finer grained lenses and played a more obvious role in tce oxidation removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords xanthan heterogeneous aquifer density effect sweeping efficiency enhanced delivery 1 introduction the injection of remedial amendments into aquifers is a popular remediation alternative for groundwater pollution the contaminants in groundwater can be mineralized to carbon dioxide water and other inorganic substances or transformed into compounds that have less mobility or toxicity than their original form through reactions with amendments baciocchi et al 2014 baciocchi 2013 vermeul et al 2003 apart from the amendment properties the contaminant removal efficiency in aquifers mainly depends on the uniform distribution of remediation agents in contamination zones and their contact with contaminants marble et al 2010 yan et al 2011 west and kueper 2012 however heterogeneity which is often encountered in the subsurface causes fluid bypassing by creating preferential flow paths in higher permeability zones zhong et al 2013 mccray et al 2010 furthermore due to the density difference between the injected solution and groundwater the reagents may float or sink during their migration in aquifer swartz and schwartz 1998 konz et al 2009 this density effect is quite common in groundwater solute transport and aquifer remediation schincariol and schwartz 1990 reported that even a small density difference of 0 8 kg m3 could cause very unstable flow displacement in porous media therefore medium heterogeneity and the density effect have adverse influences on the uniform migration and distribution of reagent which will considerably reduce the remedial amendment utilization efficiency significantly prolong the remediation period and increase the cost jeyasingh et al 2011 west and kueper 2012 to address heterogeneity induced bypassing problems water soluble and shear thinning polymers were used as the co injected reagents to enhance the cross flow between porous media that have different permeability the viscosity of shear thinning fluid is a function of the shear rate with higher shear causing lower viscosity the shear rate is typically higher in lower permeability zones than that in higher permeability zones the reduced relative viscosity facilitates the penetration of the fluid into the low permeability zones and balances the overall fluid migration condition zhong et al 2008 zhong et al 2011 zhong et al 2013 this method has been widely implemented to solve the problem of preferential and bypass flow during oil recovery in the petroleum industry lake 1989 johansen 1979 carboxymethylcellulose wang et al 2017 guar gum tiraferri et al 2008 tiraferri et al 2008 hydrolyzed polyacrylamide rahul et al 2014 and slurry pro oostrom et al 2007 truex et al 2011 are all polymer alternatives that have been used for subsurface applications and the most widely investigated and used polymer for remediation purposes is the biopolymer xanthan zhong et al 2008 2013 evaluated the rheological behavior of xanthan solution and studied the effects of medium heterogeneity on fluid migration in a series of two dimensional flow cells with different kinds of formation lenses they found that xanthan solution showed considerable shear thinning properties it can efficiently improve access to lower permeability zones in heterogeneous systems through viscosity modification oostrom et al 2014 also obtained similar results and they identified the crossflow between layers with different permeability as the main reason for the more uniform migration of shear thinning fluid mccray et al 2010 carried out many bench scale experiments to investigate amendment transport characteristics under a controlled viscosity they found that polymer injection remarkably increased the amendment sweeping efficiency especially in the lower permeability zones in order to evaluate the impact of the shear thinning fluid on solutes distribution uniformity truex et al 2015 conducted a field test to compare the data from successive injection of a tracer in water followed by in a shear thinning fluid in the presence of permeability contrasts within the targeted injection zone they found that injection solutions amended by shear thinning fluid arrived faster and to a greater extent in monitoring locations within low permeability zones oostrom et al 2014 validated the use of shear thinning fluid for the enhanced delivery of bioremediation amendments at a department of defense dod site polluted by chlorinated solvents the improved ability of polymers to clean up less accessible zones can greatly reduce the potential for rebounds in contaminant concentration to address unstable flow displacement problems induced by density effect short chain alcohols were used to modify the density of displacing fluids shook et al 1997 1998 and kostarelos et al 1998 conducted laboratory studies to create neutral buoyant surfactant floods by adding alcohol when the dnapl was dissolved the density of the resulting microemulsion was equal to or less than the density of groundwater jawitz et al 1997 reported that cosolvent displacements can minimize density segregation by using 70 ethanol 30 water besides viscosity increasing for the displacing fluid was proposed in order to reduce the downward migration of micro emulsions during surfactant flushing kostarelos et al 1998 it restricts the motion of micro emulsions by trapping them within the network of polymer chains thus preventing the sinking of amendments polymer has also been used in zvi particles delivery through porous media under the same mechanism truex 2011 hung et al 2012 vecchia et al 2009 xin et al 2016 although the preliminary experimental results look promising the relationship between formation properties and viscous fluid migration needs to be further studied in addition most of researchers mainly used the method of viscosity increasing to solve the sinking problem of colloidal solution without mentioning using this method to solve the problem of solute sinking caused by density effect therefore the influence of fluid viscosity modifications on the density effect of remediation agents is still not clear as a common and strong oxidant potassium permanganate kmno4 has been used for a long time in environmental remediation it was used as the oxidant in this experiment meanwhile trichloroethylene tce and xanthan were used as the target contaminant and shear thinning polymer respectively tce was oxidized by kmno4 through the following reaction equation kao et al 2008 coolidge 2009 2kmno 4 c 2 hcl 3 2co 2 2mno 2 2 k h 3cl in this series of experiments firstly different heterogeneous formations were simulated to visually investigate the effect of layer thickness and differing permeability on viscous fluid migration secondly the effect of kmno4 concentration aquifer medium size and fluid viscosity on the density effect was evaluated finally the improvement in kmno4 induced oxidation of tce in the presence of xanthan was quantified by using a two dimensional flow cell containing contaminated lower permeability zones 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials xanthan shanghai pengteng company china the polymer used in this test was a clarified food grade polysaccharide in the form of yellow powder permanganate kmno4 in the form of violet black crystals was supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent company china brilliant blue and erythrosin are biological dyes they were purchased from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china brilliant blue was used as a visible nonreactive tracer in these experiments erythrosin dye was used to color the xanthan solutions to visualize solution transport within the quartz sands porous media experiments showed that the two dyes had little effect on the rheological behavior of the xanthan solution tce at 99 purity was obtained from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china the equilibrium solubility of tce is 1000 mg l in water deionized di water was used throughout the experiments four kinds of quartz sands with different particle sizes were used as the packing materials for the column and tank models the physical characteristics of the four types of sands used in experiments are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 the sweeping efficiency improvements by xanthan in two layer heterogeneity structure a schematic of the two dimensional experimental setup is presented in fig 1a the tank was constructed of plexiglass with stainless steel frames fixed outside to prevent the deformation of the tank caused by excessive pressure during the experiments the interior dimensions of the tank were 450 mm in length 300 mm in height and 50 mm in width fluids were viscosity tested and then injected through four evenly spaced 60 cm distance inflow ports each inflow port connected with a heavy gauge perforated plexiglass screen that allowed influent to evenly and freely enter the sand chamber outflow also occurred through four equally spaced effluent ports the quartz sands were wet packed during sand packing water was added to the tank to maintain a depth 3 4 cm higher than the sand layer the dry sands were slowly filled into the tank and were tamped to drive out air bubbles in order to promote complete saturation the total height of the packed sand was 30 cm two different permeability layers layer1 and 2 were constructed in the sand tank the top of the sand layer was sealed with 10 mm thick bentonite as an upper capillary barrier then the tank was sealed with a plexiglass cap which was tightened with screws to prevent any air or liquid leakage by the excessive pressure during experiments four high pressure constant current pumps dalian elite analytical instruments company p230p china were used to drive fluids from left to right through the sand tank at a constant flow rate of 0 5 ml min the effluent fluids were collected at a constant height similar to the water level in the tank when the tank was completely saturated with di water 200 mg l brilliant blue solution was injected by pumps the position of the blue dye at regular time intervals was recorded by tracing the dye position on the tank and by photo documentation until the solution completely swept the pore volume pv of the sand after the complete saturation of blue dye xanthan solutions with erythrosin dye were injected to observe their transport characteristics and sweeping efficiency under modified viscosity the concentration of xanthan and erythrosin dye was 300 and 200 mg l respectively similarly the positions of the red xanthan solutions were visually observed digital photographs documenting temporal dye front positions within the tanks were processed using auto cad 2007 software thus the sweeping efficiency and fluid migration rate in each layer could be calculated in addition to photo documenting these experiments the temporal positions of the dye fronts for both the tracers were physically traced on the front of the tank using a marker pen the sweeping efficiency se and fluid migration rate were determined based on the following se swept area total area of tank 100 fluid migration rate migration distance at regulat time migration time se and migration rate were evaluated at the dye concentration of 20 mg l because the dye could not be seen below that concentration the migration distance was determined based on the midpoint of the dye front penetrating each layer there were four kinds of media settings in this set of experiments they were as follows 1 50 medium sand 50 fine sand means the ratio of each layer s thickness to the total height of the media 2 25 medium sand 75 fine sand 3 75 medium sand 25 fine sand and 4 50 medium sand 50 silty sand through comparisons among these experiments the effect of layer thickness and differing permeability on the improvement of polymer sweeping efficiency can be evaluated 2 2 2 kmno4 migration properties in an aquifer under the influence of the density effect and modified viscosity twelve tank experiments were conducted in this section the conditions for each group of experiments are presented in table 2 the experimental setup was generally similar to that in fig 1a except that the media were homogeneous before the tank experiments started experimental solutions were density and viscosity tested at room temperature 22 c the fluid was injected at a constant flow rate of 0 5 ml min by pumps the distribution of kmno4 was visually noted by tracing the purple color the color of the kmno4 solution position in the tank at corresponding times the migration front of kmno4 in porous media were evaluated at the kmno4 concentration of 50 mg l because kmno4 could not be seen below that concentration in quartz sand packed tank 2 2 3 improvement in kmno4 induced oxidation of tce in lower permeability zones in the presence of xanthan the main component of this experiment equipment was shown in fig 1b and c other auxiliary experimental equipments were generally similar to that in fig 1a there was a finer grained lens 0 1 0 25 mm in the main aquifer medium 0 5 1 mm after sand packing the tank was sealed with a plexiglass cap and the tank was saturated with di water then 8 ml of pure phase tce was injected into the finer grained lens through a silicone tube the injection point was shown in fig 1b this series of experiments consisted of five consecutive procedures 1 injecting di water from the four left inlets to the tank until tce was monitored in one of the outlets after which the distribution of tce in the tank was evaluated 2 injecting 2 pv kmno4 solution at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 3 injecting 3 pv di water to flush most of the kmno4 out of the tank 4 injecting 2 pv xanthan kmno4 mixed solution into the tank at the same flow rate as that used in procedure 2 and 5 injecting 3 pv di water to remove kmno4 from the tank the kmno4 and xanthan concentrations were 2 5 g l and 300 mg l respectively the tce mno4 and cl concentrations ph and orp were monitored at different time intervals during these experiments following the experiment the sand profile was disassembled and sand samples were collected from the aquifer at the locations of each sampling port 2 3 analytical methods the measuring procedure for the determination of porosity is to slowly saturate the tank with di water from the bottom to the top surface of the sand in order to displace all the gas in the tank then the porosity of the sand tank is the ratio of the water volume introduced to the volume of the sand tank a densitometer beyong test precision instrument da 130 n china was used to test the densities of experimental solutions and a viscometer brookfield dv2t lvcj0 america was used for their viscosity measurements the range of shear rate was between 1 s 1 and 200 s 1 a spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific 8a6t america was used to measure the concentration of kmno4 at wavelength of 525 nm a 1 5 ml water sample was collected by a 2 5 ml syringe and filtered samples were collected using 42 ml headspace bottle and then analyzed for tce kmno4 and cl concentrations each sand sample 0 2 g collected from the aquifers after remediation experiments was placed in a headspace bottle for subsequent measurement water and sand tce samples were measured by purge and trap gas chromatography thermo scientific trace isq gc america the chromatograph operating conditions were as follows hp 5 capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm inlet temperature 200 c column temperature 50 c detector temperature 280 c fid detector the purge and trap conditions were as follows trap temperature 25 c blow off time 10 min analytical temperature 180 c blowing gas high purity n2 blowing flow rate 40 ml min 3 results and discussion 3 1 improvement of sweeping efficiency by xanthan in a two layer heterogeneous structure 3 1 1 effect of formation thickness on media sweeping efficiency 3 1 1 1 equal thickness of medium sand and fine sand fig s1 shows the apparent viscosity shear rate relationship of different solutions at room temperature the 300 mg l xanthan solution showed considerable shear thinning at 1 s 1 shear rate its viscosity was 36 84 cp when the shear rate approached 200 s 1 the viscosity reduced to 5 cp and the addition of kmno4 to the solution had negligible influence on its rheological behavior the fluid migration and distribution in the 50 medium sand 50 fine sand tank in the absence of xanthan were shown in fig 2a it was clearly observed that the brilliant blue dye migrated much faster in higher permeability media coarse sand than in lower permeability media fine sand moreover the migration of blue dye almost independently occurred within each layer after blue dye had completely swept the tank 300 mg l xanthan dyed with 200 mg l erythrosin solution was injected into the tank from the left side fig 2b illustrates that the addition of xanthan significantly improved the sweeping efficiency the increased viscosity of the xanthan solution promoted cross flow between the two aquifer systems as a result of the mobility reduction in higher permeability media and the mobility increase in the lower permeability media the total pv required to completely sweep the tank without and with xanthan was 2 26 and 1 7 pv respectively this means that compared to the fluid control test without the use of polymer although the dosage of the remedial agent was reduced by 25 the viscous fluid could achieve the same sweeping efficiency in the lower permeability formation 3 1 1 2 varying thickness of medium sand and fine sand two additional two layer tanks were prepared to study the effect of layer thicknesses on improvements to polymer sweeping efficiency the fluid migration and distribution in the 75 medium sand 25 fine sand tank and the 25 medium sand 75 fine sand tank were shown in fig s2 the addition of xanthan significantly improved the sweeping efficiency in both group experiments for the 25 medium sand 75 fine sand tank the addition of 300 mg l xanthan reduced the number of pv required to completely sweep the tank from 1 98 pv brilliant blue dye to 1 62 pv xanthan dyed with erythrosine for the 75 medium sand 25 fine sand tank the number of pv required to completely sweep the tank was reduced from 3 9 pv to 1 78 pv compared to the xanthan enhancements in the layered aquifer systems with 25 medium sand 75 fine sand and 50 medium sand 50 fine sand the reduction in the number of pvs required to completely sweep the tank was the highest 54 in the 75 medium sand 25 fine sand layered system in addition the 75 medium sand 25 fine sand layered system had the highest increase in migration rate in the lower permeability medium caused by xanthan enhancement a summary of the experimental results for all three two layer tanks is presented in table 3 as shown in table 3 the relative thickness of the sediment layer had a significant influence on the enhancement of sweeping effectiveness by xanthan that is the smaller the thickness of the lower permeability layer was the more clearly xanthan enhanced uniform distribution 3 1 2 effect of permeability contrast on media sweeping efficiency an additional 2 layer tank 50 medium sand 50 silty sand experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of different media permeability on sweeping efficiency the experimental results are shown in fig 2c and d the number of pv required to completely sweep the tank was 3 8 pv when xanthan was injected as opposed to the 7 8 pv needed for the nonpolymer case in the 50 medium sand 50 silty sand tank this represented a better than a 50 improvement in the utilization efficiency of the remedial fluid the rate of fluid migration in silty sand increased from 0 0052 cm min to 0 020 cm min or by a factor of 284 increment the effect of permeability differences on the sweeping efficiency of in a two layer system is summarized in table 3 it can be seen that the effect of increasing the relative permeability difference between the two layers was an increase in the number of pv required to completely sweep the tank e g 2 26 pv vs 7 8 pv and 1 7 pv vs 3 8 pv furthermore the enhancement of fluid infiltration into the lower permeability layer and of the uniform distribution of fluid by xanthan was more obvious in the two layer system with a greater permeability difference e g 0 0052 0 020 cm min vs 0 023 0 027 cm min and 7 8 3 8 pv vs 2 26 1 7 pv overall heterogeneity in aquifer often present as stratification of various permeability can adversely affect the sweeping efficiency and remediation performance of remedial amendments by creating preferential flow into the higher permeability stratum thus leaving important non swept zones in lower permeability layers the use of polymer solutions to increase the sweeping efficiency of remedial amendments in lower permeability zones or to improve uniform amendment distribution in contamination zones is an effective technique in heterogeneous contaminated site remediation the smaller the thickness of the low permeability layer is or the greater the permeability contrast between layers is the more obvious the enhancement of the uniform distribution of remedial fluid by polymer 3 2 kmno4 migration properties in an aquifer under the influence of the density effect and modified viscosity 3 2 1 distribution of kmno4 in the absence of xanthan from table 2 the densities of different solutions increased with the increment of both kmno4 and xanthan concentrations the density differences between 2 5 5 0 g l kmno4 solutions and distilled water approached 1 5 kg m3 and 3 2 kg m3 respectively which were greater than the threshold of 0 8 kg m3 0 8 kg m3 could cause very unstable flow displacement in porous media when kmno4 solution migrates forward in aquifer there would be an angle β between the displacement front and the horizontal direction this angle can indicate the degree of fluid sinking specifically 90 is for an ideal uniform flow and the smaller the β value the more obvious the sinking phenomenon kmno4 migration and distribution in aquifers in the absence of xanthan were shown fig 3 density effect had little influence on the migration of kmno4 in aquifers of fine sand and medium sand 1 g l kmno4 so we didn t present them in the figure for other experiments the photographs showed different degrees of kmno4 sinking in addition the sinking phenomenon became increasingly obvious during kmno4 migration taking the coarse sand 1 g l kmno4 aquifer as an example the solute migration pattern gradually changed from plug flow to stratified flow from 0 35pv to 0 85pv this would result in serious nonuniform distribution of kmno4 in aquifers the changes in β under different injection concentrations of kmno4 in the absence of xanthan are shown in fig 4a β decreased continuously during kmno4 migration for all three experimental concentrations furthermore sinking occurred much faster in the initial experimental period then gradually slowed down throughout the experiment the order of the angle β was as follows β1 0g l β2 5g l β5 0g l that means that the greater the kmno4 concentration was the more obvious the density effect was 3 2 2 distribution of kmno4 in the presence of xanthan the distribution of kmno4 xanthan mixed solutions in the coarse sand tank is shown in fig 5 the changes in β under different injection concentrations of kmno4 and xanthan mixed solutions are presented in fig 4b and c the experimental results showed that for a given concentration of kmno4 the higher the concentration of xanthan was the smaller the influence of the density effect it means that the migration of kmno4 in the tank was closer to the form of plug flow and that the vertical distribution of kmno4 was more uniform this study shows that viscous fluids are effective for uniformly transporting solutes in porous media comparing with single kmno4 solutions the kmno4 xanthan mixed solutions have higher apparent viscosity which can produce stronger friction force and viscous force between the fluid and porous media thus providing a stronger drag force against the gravity of the denser fluid such effect results in a lower sinking rate for the amendment compared to that in water in other words weakens its density effect in aquifer 3 3 improvement in the kmno4 induced oxidation of tce in lower permeability zones in the presence of xanthan 3 3 1 tce contaminated aquifer remediation by kmno4 without xanthan the tce concentration distribution before injecting kmno4 is shown in fig 6a combined with fig 7a it can be seen that the tce concentration at each sampling port in the lower permeability media was not identical the reason for the different tce concentration distribution is that tce is a dnapl which leads to its downward migration by gravity therefore the tce concentrations at 4 3 4 4 and 4 5 were relatively higher meanwhile a small amount of aqueous tce migrated into the coarse sand medium due to the flushing effect of groundwater overall tce was mainly distributed in the lower permeability area which would continuously release pollutants in the absence of effective control and remediation the kmno4 migration and distribution during the injection of 2 5 g l kmno4 are shown in fig s3 the kmno4 concentrations at upstream sampling ports and effluent ports are shown in fig s4 clearly the kmno4 produced significant bypass flow and sinking phenomena in the heterogeneous formation after injecting 2 0pv kmno4 solution the sweeping efficiency was only 23 3 in the lower permeability formation most of the kmno4 entered into the lens from left side because of groundwater advection abnormal infiltration from the bottom right corner of the lower permeability formation was also observed this may be due to the uneven filling of the media during sand packing through fig 7a it can be seen that a certain amount of kmno4 reacted with tce to reduce the tce concentrations at 3 3 4 3 and 4 4 by 14 7 15 7 and 14 6 respectively after the injection of 2 0 pv kmno4 the largest tce concentration reduction 30 8 occurred at sampling port 4 5 due to the high kmno4 concentration there because kmno4 was not detected at sampling ports 3 4 and 3 5 tce only slowly decreased under groundwater flushing in the downstream area of the lower permeability formations as the kmno4 concentration increased the tce concentration began to decrease until its concentration reached 0 mg l after 2 0 pv kmno4 injection except for sampling port 4 5 the tce concentrations were all reduced by 20 at other sampling ports in lower permeability region as shown in fig 6b and 7a therefore it is noteworthy that kmno4 had a poor sweeping efficiency in the lens the tce concentration was reduced to 0 mg l at the downstream sampling port indicating that nearly all tce was oxidized by kmno4 in the higher permeability region the changes in cl ph and eh are shown in fig s5 kmno4 reacted with a relatively larger amount of tce at sampling port 4 5 therefore more hydrogen ions and cl were produced in this area and the ph value changed from 6 68 to 5 88 accordingly the eh value also increased from 362 mv to 506 mv because of change in kmno4 concentration the increase in kmno4 concentration and amount of tce oxidation in other sampling ports were smaller so the changes in cl ph and eh were less obvious than those at sampling port 4 5 3 3 2 tce contaminated aquifer remediation by kmno4 in the presence of xanthan after the injection of 2 pv kmno4 solution 3 pv di water was used to flush the kmno4 out of the tank most of the kmno4 flowed out with the groundwater only a very small amount of kmno4 inevitably remained in the interface area between the two different media as shown in fig s6a the tce distributions after flushing with 3 0 pv di water just before injecting kmno4 xanthan mixed fluids are shown in fig 6c in the lower permeability media the tce concentrations at 3 3 3 4 3 5 4 3 and 4 4 were 258 6 225 9 181 5 467 8 536 6 mg l respectively which were 10 3 14 4 lower than those before pure kmno4 injection fig 6a only the tce concentration in 4 5 353 6 mg l was 28 6 lower than that before pure kmno4 injection after flushing with 3 0 pv di water the tce concentrations at 3 6 3 7 4 6 and 4 7 increased from 0 mg l fig 6b to 27 6 11 6 81 8 and 32 4 mg l respectively which clearly reflected the rebound effect of the pollutants from lower permeability media as shown in fig s6 in the presence of xanthan the migration and distribution of kmno4 in the simulation tank were more uniform it is noteworthy that the kmno4 xanthan solution could enter into the lens from every direction apart from the regular entrance from the left side the infiltrations from the top and bottom were obvious and nearly consistent after 2 0 pv kmno4 xanthan mixed solution was injected the kmno4 sweeping efficiency increased to 48 in the lower permeability formation which was much higher than that 23 3 after 2 0 pv injection of pure kmno4 the tce and kmno4 distributions in lower permeability media and the downstream area of the simulated aquifer are shown in fig 7c and d in the lower permeability region kmno4 was detected at all the sampling ports with a concentration of 700 mg l compared to the kmno4 concentration in the lower permeability region during pure kmno4 injection both distribution and concentration of the remedial amendment were greatly improved for the downstream sampling ports the kmno4 concentration differences in the same vertical row 3 6 vs 4 6 3 7 vs 4 7 were much smaller than those in fig 7a combined with kmno4 concentration at upstream sampling ports and effluent ports fig s7 this indicates the resistance to the density effect conferred by modified viscosity in addition kmno4 detected in these four downstream sampling ports were later than those during pure kmno4 injection this is because of increased kmno4 infiltration into the lens which reduced the bypass flow around the lower permeability region therefore the kmno4 migration rate in the main aquifer medium decreased the tce concentration at the 3 5 sampling port decreased from 176 5 mg l to 60 3 mg l or a reduction in concentration of better than 65 8 meanwhile the reduction in tce concentration increased to approximately 30 in other sampling ports in the lower permeability region through a comparison between fig 7a and c the tce concentration changes in the lens clearly demonstrated that polymer could significantly enhance remediation in the lower permeability region the cl concentration ph and eh are shown in fig s8 the variation trends of cl ph and eh were almost identical at sampling ports 3 3 3 5 and 4 5 respectively the range of changes in these three parameters was much higher at sampling port 3 5 this was due to the highly increased reaction between kmno4 and tce near this sampling port following the experiment the sand profile was disassembled and sand samples were collected from the aquifer at each sampling port through measurement it was found that no contaminants were detected in most of the sand samples sand samples contaminated by tce are shown in fig s9 it is clear that most of the residual tce was in the lower permeability region especially near sampling port 4 4 this is consistent with the aqueous tce distribution before the remediation experiment started 8 ml tce 11 68 g was injected into the system through area partitioning and concentration averaging 2 74 g of tce i e 23 5 of the initial tce mass was calculated to be in the aquifer 2 17 g of tce i e 18 6 of the initial tce mass migrated out of the tank that means that most of the pollutants 57 8 were degraded by kmno4 with or without xanthan although we can not exactly determine the relative contribution of tce removal with or without xanthan the role of the polymer in the uniform distribution of the remedial amendment and tce removal enhancement in lower permeability media is considerably obvious xanthan is a shear thinning polymer due to the larger pore space in higher permeability media lower shear rates could be expected in the main region of the simulated aquifer in contrast higher shear thinning occurred in the lens with the lower permeability the apparent viscosity and pore pressure difference between the coarse and fine sands caused cross flow between the different porous media furthermore the macromolecular structure and higher viscosity of xanthan provide a strong flow resistance to the density effect both of these advantages of xanthan accelerate tce removal performance by kmno4 4 conclusions the uniform migration and distribution of remedial amendments are the key factors determining groundwater remediation efficiency groundwater remediation is often inefficient in heterogeneous formations because amendments bypass lower permeability strata and gravitational sinking occurs into the deep aquifer the increase in solution viscosity through the addition of shear thinning polymer into groundwater not only accelerates fluid movement into lower permeability strata but also stabilizes the displacement front and reduces the density effect the smaller the thickness of the low permeability layer is or the greater the permeability contrast between layers is the more obvious the enhancement of the uniform distribution of remedial fluid by xanthan the larger the concentration of xanthan is the closer the amendment migration pattern is to plug flow and so the vertical distribution of the amendment in the aquifer is more uniform after coinjection of kmno4 and xanthan into aquifer kmno4 will react with contaminants to form manganese dioxide while the xanthan as a carbon source could be biodegraded by indigenous microorganism this biostimulation by xanthan may have some positive effect on the residual contaminant degradation overall polymer enhanced kmno4

2 6 sequential extraction procedure modified bcr sequential extraction procedures pérez moreno et al 2018 were used to determine the speciation transformation of pb cu and zn before and after mechanical treatment the bcr procedure is summarized in table 2 and its specific details can be found elsewhere gbw07437 2016 hj 832 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 immobilization of hms at a milling speed of 500 rpm and bpr 12 the leaching concentrations of pb cu and zn decreased with increasing milling time as shown in fig 2 the leaching concentrations of pb cu and zn in untreated soil were 13 92 mg l 1 2 71 mg l 1 and 114 31 mg l 1 which were 273 times 2 6 times and 113 times higher than the class iii level of the chinese surface water environmental quality standards the concentration of hms in the leachate decreased markedly as the milling time prolonged from fig 2 it can be clearly seen that when ball milling time was just 0 25 h pb cu and zn leachate concentrations decreased from 13 92 mg l 1 2 83 mg l 1 and 114 42 mg l 1 to 3 45 mg l 1 0 74 mg l 1 and 11 01 mg l 1 respectively with immobilization rates of 75 22 73 85 and 90 38 for pb the leaching concentration decreased from 13 92 mg l 1 to 0 027 mg l 1 after 2 h of ball milling which meets regulatory standards lower than 0 05 mg l 1 the concentration of cu decreased from 2 83 mg l 1 to 0 74 mg l 1after 0 25 h of milling also lower than the regulatory threshold however 1 h of ball milling is needed to decrease the zn content in leachate to the standard value in fact solidification action can account for the reduction of hms concentrations in leachates after mechanical treatment montinaro et al 2007 2008 and 2009 advanced three reasons that explain this phenomenon induced by mechanical treatment i a stable aggregate with compact structures can be obtained after mechanical treatment through ball milling resulting in efficient entrapment of hms within the soil particles ii the increase of defects dislocations and vacancies in the crystalline reticulum under the action of ball milling results in an increase of diffusivity thereby decreasing the leaching toxicity mobility and bioavailability of hms in the soil iii a higher irreversible adsorption onto fresh surfaces produced through soil particle breakage may be properly taken into account for the phenomenon of decreasing the concentration of hms in leachate 3 2 influence of ph on leaching characteristics of hms in order to make the ph of final leachate reach the target values pre test titration tests were carried out according to epa method m1313 2009 based on those results the influence of the ph of leachate on leaching characteristics of pb cu and zn was investigated table 3 shows that the final ph of leachate meets the accuracy required by target ph at leaching ending 0 5 ph unit several environmental factors such as speciation of hms and solubility the physicochemical properties of the soil the contact form of solid liquid the categories of liquid and the solution ph can all contribute to the release of hms in contaminated soil méndez et al 2012 lu et al 2017 furthermore ph value is one of the most important factors in governing the leaching process of hms the bioavailability and toxicity of hms at different ph values were influenced directly by their speciation caused by dissolution precipitation condensation adsorption and complexation suzuki and ono 2008 jaroå et al 2017 at present the effectiveness of hms contaminated soil remediation using solidification was evaluated by analyzing their leachable fraction from the treated soil obtained using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp or synthetic precipitation leaching procedure splp proposed by usepa usepa 2012 however neither method tclp or splp involves ph variation these methods evaluate effectiveness at a single ph value which is insufficient to evaluate their potential risks therefore a clear understanding of the influence of ph value on leaching characteristics of hms is important for risk assessment of soil remediation the results in fig 3 show that the leaching concentrations of pb cu and zn change with the ph of leachate it was found that the leaching concentrations reached the lowest values at ph 7 12 and their release relied heavily on the ph variation of leachate the concentrations of pb cu and zn in the leachate increased significantly at strongly acidic or basic ph conditions fig 3 shows that pb cu and zn concentrations in the leachate increased significantly at strongly acidic conditions before and after mechanical treatment which may be ascribed to adsorption sites of hms miss due to the dissolution of clays and mineral oxides at strongly basic conditions the leaching amounts of pb and zn increased but the leaching concentration of cu did not the dissolution of pb and zn was found to be amphoteric and controlled by oxide minerals at either high or low ph value pb oh 2 zn oh 2 can combine with oh to form hydroxides pb oh 3 pb oh 4 2 zn oh 3 thus increasing their solubility goswami and mahanta 2007 compared with untreated soil the anti base ability of soil significantly increased after mechanical treatment in the case of untreated soil the leaching concentration of pb was 291 75 mg l 1 at ph 13 while the treated soil was just 4 00 mg l 1 suggesting that the anti base activity of soil was greatly enhanced nevertheless when the leachate was strongly acidic the leaching concentrations of hms in the treated soil were close to the untreated soil which indicated that the anti acid ability of soil has not significantly improved after ball milling low leaching behavior of hms was observed at slightly acidic to basic ph 6 9 in treated soil so the treated soil after ball milling has little environmental risk however the environmental risk increased significantly at very low ph values 3 3 sequential extraction procedure analysis the toxicity of hms in soil not only relates to the total content but also depends on their speciation to a great extent different speciation of hms in soil has different environmental effect which leads to different biotoxicity mobility bioavailability and biogeochemical behaviors shahid et al 2017 bogusz and oleszczuk 2018 in fact it is very important to get more information about the mount of potentially mobile fractions of hms when launching assessment of environmental risks kierczak et al 2008 therefore speciation analysis should be considered in the evaluation of environmental hazards of hms the individual forms contribution of pb cu zn in the contaminated soil before and after mechanical treatment is shown in fig 4 the unstable f1 component of pb cu and zn weak acid soluble predominates in original soil containing 63 96 80 97 and 84 13 respectively of these metals the reducible fraction accounts for 35 21 17 77 and 13 44 respectively however the proportion of pb cu and zn in the oxidizable and residual fraction is very low indicating that it is very difficult to form stable fraction for exogenous hms at short periods the speciation of hms in untreated soil is governed by the weak acid soluble fraction and their concentrations in leachates are relatively high fig 4 clearly shows that the soluble part in weak acid soluble form converted into stable state gradually f2 f3 f4 increases as the milling time increases and may help explain the reduction of pb cu and zn leaching concentrations fig 4 also shows that the percentage of pb cu and zn in the f1 component significantly increased after a short milling time 0 25 h it was especially evident for pb as the contribution of f1 increased from 63 96 to 80 03 this is likely due to the breakdown of soil particles via ball milling nevertheless the f1 component of pb cu and zn gradually converted to the relatively stable forms f2 f3 and residual fraction f4 as the milling time increased as the milling time increased so did the amount of the residual fraction in the case of pb after one h milling time the f2 content of pb increased significantly suggesting that ball milling facilitated the specific adsorption of iron and manganese oxyhydroxides for pb izquierdo et al 2017 saleem et al 2015 however the f3 and f4 fractions produced with additional milling improved the immobilized the hms in the soil additionally the amount of f3 and f4 components clearly increased as the milling time increased when the milling time increased to 4 h the f3 fraction for pb significantly increased from 0 44 to 13 97 it indicated that an extended milling time contributes to the chelation of pb with organic matter in contaminated soil additionally the f4 fraction increased from 0 39 to 13 31 which can be ascribed to the fact that the dislocation vacancy and crystalline defects all occurred during ball milling and facilitates the diffusion of pb ion it s worth noting that although the concentration of pb in leachate decreased significantly pb comes primarily from the f2 and f3 fractions which are potentially bioavailable after 4 h of milling the total f2 and f3 fraction increased to 63 44 which means the immobilized pb in treated soil may be remobilized and became available similar results were obtained for cu and zn however it s also worth noting that the f1 fraction of zn still accounts for 51 95 of the total amount and it suggests that zinc risk in release and mobility is greater than pb and cu under acidic conditions the results of the bcr analysis showed that the primary reason for the reduction of leaching concentration is the speciation transformation of hms longer milling time promotes the formation of the residual fraction therefore immobilization is enhanced as the milling time increases in addition some materials can be added during ball milling in order to increase the formation of the residual fraction in fact soluble phosphate was widely investigated as a means of stabilizing agent for the transformation of hms into insoluble compounds nzihou and sharrock 2010 several phosphates sodium dihydrogen phosphate disodium hydrogen phosphate and trisodium phosphate have been investigated with the aim of scavenging soluble hms from polluted soils cao 2016 found that the formation of lead phosphate precipitate and chloride phosphate minerals enhances the conversion of leachable fraction into residual state similar results were verified by fu et al 2017 therefore grinding contaminated soil with the addition of stabilizing agents brings new perspectives for immobilization of hms 4 conclusions this work provides a promising approach to remediate hms contaminated soil using ball milling technique the results of extraction procedure showed that the leaching concentration of pb cu and zn sharply decreased as milling time increased after mechanical treatment of 2 h the concentrations of pb cu and zn in leachate were 0 027 mg l 1 0 59 mg l 1 and 0 16 mg l 1 respectively all of these levels meet surface water class iii standard regulatory thresholds additionally ph dependent tests indicated that the anti acid ability of soil significantly improved after ball milling treatment furthermore the bcr sequential procedure revealed that speciation transformation of pb cu and zn could explain the immobilization phenomenon in soil induced by

milling speed of 500 rpm and bpr 12 the leaching concentrations of pb cu and zn decreased with increasing milling time as shown in fig 2 the leaching concentrations of pb cu and zn in untreated soil were 13 92 mg l 1 2 71 mg l 1 and 114 31 mg l 1 which were 273 times 2 6 times and 113 times higher than the class iii level of the chinese surface water environmental quality standards the concentration of hms in the leachate decreased markedly as the milling time prolonged from fig 2 it can be clearly seen that when ball milling time was just 0 25 h pb cu and zn leachate concentrations decreased from 13 92 mg l 1 2 83 mg l 1 and 114 42 mg l 1 to 3 45 mg l 1 0 74 mg l 1 and 11 01 mg l 1 respectively with immobilization rates of 75 22 73 85 and 90 38 for pb the leaching concentration decreased from 13 92 mg l 1 to 0 027 mg l 1 after 2 h of ball milling which meets regulatory standards lower than 0 05 mg l 1 the concentration of cu decreased from 2 83 mg l 1 to 0 74 mg l 1after 0 25 h of milling also lower than the regulatory threshold however 1 h of ball milling is needed to decrease the zn content in leachate to the standard value in fact solidification action can account for the reduction of hms concentrations in leachates after mechanical treatment montinaro et al 2007 2008 and 2009 advanced three reasons that explain this phenomenon induced by mechanical treatment i a stable aggregate with compact structures can be obtained after mechanical treatment through ball milling resulting in efficient entrapment of hms within the soil particles ii the increase of defects dislocations and vacancies in the crystalline reticulum under the action of ball milling results in an increase of diffusivity thereby decreasing the leaching toxicity mobility and bioavailability of hms in the soil iii a higher irreversible adsorption onto fresh surfaces produced through soil particle breakage may be properly taken into account for the phenomenon of decreasing the concentration of hms in leachate 3 2 influence of ph on leaching characteristics of hms in order to make the ph of final leachate reach the target values pre test titration tests were carried out according to epa method m1313 2009 based on those results the influence of the ph of leachate on leaching characteristics of pb cu and zn was investigated table 3 shows that the final ph of leachate meets the accuracy required by target ph at leaching ending 0 5 ph unit several environmental factors such as speciation of hms and solubility the physicochemical properties of the soil the contact form of solid liquid the categories of liquid and the solution ph can all contribute to the release of hms in contaminated soil méndez et al 2012 lu et al 2017 furthermore ph value is one of the most important factors in governing the leaching process of hms the bioavailability and toxicity of hms at different ph values were influenced directly by their speciation caused by dissolution precipitation condensation adsorption and complexation suzuki and ono 2008 jaroå et al 2017 at present the effectiveness of hms contaminated soil remediation using solidification was evaluated by analyzing their leachable fraction from the treated soil obtained using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp or synthetic precipitation leaching procedure splp proposed by usepa usepa 2012 however neither method tclp or splp involves ph variation these methods evaluate effectiveness at a single ph value which is insufficient to evaluate their potential risks therefore a clear understanding of the influence of ph value on leaching characteristics of hms is important for risk assessment of soil remediation the results in fig 3 show that the leaching concentrations of pb cu and zn change with the ph of leachate it was found that the leaching concentrations reached the lowest values at ph 7 12 and their release relied heavily on the ph variation of leachate the concentrations of pb cu and zn in the leachate increased significantly at strongly acidic or basic ph conditions fig 3 shows that pb cu and zn concentrations in the leachate increased significantly at strongly acidic conditions before and after mechanical treatment which may be ascribed to adsorption sites of hms miss due to the dissolution of clays and mineral oxides at strongly basic conditions the leaching amounts of pb and zn increased but the leaching concentration of cu did not the dissolution of pb and zn was found to be amphoteric and controlled by oxide minerals at either high or low ph value pb oh 2 zn oh 2 can combine with oh to form hydroxides pb oh 3 pb oh 4 2 zn oh 3 thus increasing their solubility goswami and mahanta 2007 compared with untreated soil the anti base ability of soil significantly increased after mechanical treatment in the case of untreated soil the leaching concentration of pb was 291 75 mg l 1 at ph 13 while the treated soil was just 4 00 mg l 1 suggesting that the anti base activity of soil was greatly enhanced nevertheless when the leachate was strongly acidic the leaching concentrations of hms in the treated soil were close to the untreated soil which indicated that the anti acid ability of soil has not significantly improved after ball milling low leaching behavior of hms was observed at slightly acidic to basic ph 6 9 in treated soil so the treated soil after ball milling has little environmental risk however the environmental risk increased significantly at very low ph values 3 3 sequential extraction procedure analysis the toxicity of hms in soil not only relates to the total content but also depends on their speciation to a great extent different speciation of hms in soil has different environmental effect which leads to different biotoxicity mobility bioavailability and biogeochemical behaviors shahid et al 2017 bogusz and oleszczuk 2018 in fact it is very important to get more information about the mount of potentially mobile fractions of hms when launching assessment of environmental risks kierczak et al 2008 therefore speciation analysis should be considered in the evaluation of environmental hazards of hms the individual forms contribution of pb cu zn in the contaminated soil before and after mechanical treatment is shown in fig 4 the unstable f1 component of pb cu and zn weak acid soluble predominates in original soil containing 63 96 80 97 and 84 13 respectively of these metals the reducible fraction accounts for 35 21 17 77 and 13 44 respectively however the proportion of pb cu and zn in the oxidizable and residual fraction is very low indicating that it is very difficult to form stable fraction for exogenous hms at short periods the speciation of hms in untreated soil is governed by the weak acid soluble fraction and their concentrations in leachates are relatively high fig 4 clearly shows that the soluble part in weak acid soluble form converted into stable state gradually f2 f3 f4 increases as the milling time increases and may help explain the reduction of pb cu and zn leaching concentrations fig 4 also shows that the percentage of pb cu and zn in the f1 component significantly increased after a short milling time 0 25 h it was especially evident for pb as the contribution of f1 increased from 63 96 to 80 03 this is likely due to the breakdown of soil particles via ball milling nevertheless the f1 component of pb cu and zn gradually converted to the relatively stable forms f2 f3 and residual fraction f4 as the milling time increased as the milling time increased so did the amount of the residual fraction in the case of pb after one h milling time the f2 content of pb increased significantly suggesting that ball milling facilitated the specific adsorption of iron and manganese oxyhydroxides for pb izquierdo et al 2017 saleem et al 2015 however the f3 and f4 fractions produced with additional milling improved the immobilized the hms in the soil additionally the amount of f3 and f4 components clearly increased as the milling time increased when the milling time increased to 4 h the f3 fraction for pb significantly increased from 0 44 to 13 97 it indicated that an extended milling time contributes to the chelation of pb with organic matter in contaminated soil additionally the f4 fraction increased from 0 39 to 13 31 which can be ascribed to the fact that the dislocation vacancy and crystalline defects all occurred during ball milling and facilitates the diffusion of pb ion it s worth noting that although the concentration of pb in leachate decreased significantly pb comes primarily from the f2 and f3 fractions which are potentially bioavailable after 4 h of milling the total f2 and f3 fraction increased to 63 44 which means the immobilized pb in treated soil may be remobilized and became available similar results were obtained for cu and zn however it s also worth noting that the f1 fraction of zn still accounts for 51 95 of the total amount and it suggests that zinc risk in release and mobility is greater than pb and cu under acidic conditions the results of the bcr analysis showed that the primary reason for the reduction of leaching concentration is the speciation transformation of hms longer milling time promotes the formation of the residual fraction therefore immobilization is enhanced as the milling time increases in addition some materials can be added during ball milling in order to increase the formation of the residual fraction in fact soluble phosphate was widely investigated as a means of stabilizing agent for the transformation of hms into insoluble compounds nzihou and sharrock 2010 several phosphates sodium dihydrogen phosphate disodium hydrogen phosphate and trisodium phosphate have been investigated with the aim of scavenging soluble hms from polluted soils cao 2016 found that the formation of lead phosphate precipitate and chloride phosphate minerals enhances the conversion of leachable fraction into residual state similar results were verified by fu et al 2017 therefore grinding contaminated soil with the addition of stabilizing agents brings new perspectives for immobilization of hms 4 conclusions this work provides a promising approach to remediate hms contaminated soil using ball milling technique the results of extraction procedure showed that the leaching concentration of pb cu and zn sharply decreased as milling time increased after mechanical treatment of 2 h the concentrations of pb cu and zn in leachate were 0 027 mg l 1 0 59 mg l 1 and 0 16 mg l 1 respectively all of these levels meet surface water class iii standard regulatory thresholds additionally ph dependent tests indicated that the anti acid ability of soil significantly improved after ball milling treatment furthermore the bcr sequential procedure revealed that speciation transformation of pb cu and zn could explain the immobilization phenomenon in soil induced by

1579,low permeability source zones sustain long term trichloroethene tce groundwater contamination in anaerobic environments tce is transformed by both biological reductive dechlorination and abiotic reactions with reactive minerals little is known about the relative contribution of these two pathways as tce diffuses from low permeability zones lpzs into high permeability zones hpzs this study combines a flow cell experiment batch experiments and a diffusion reaction model to evaluate the contributions of biotic and abiotic tce transformation in lpzs natural clay lpz and sand hpz from a former air force base were used in all experiments in batch the lpz material transformed tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce to acetylene with pseudo first order rate constants of 8 57 10 6 day 1 and 1 02 10 6 day 1 respectively biotic and abiotic pathways were then evaluated together in a bench scale flow cell 16 5 cm 2 cm 16 5 cm that contained a lpz layer with a source of tce at the base overlain by a hpz continuously purged with lactate amended groundwater diffusion controlled mass transfer in the lpz while advection controlled migration in the hpz the mass discharge rate of tce and its biotic cis dce and vinyl chloride and abiotic acetylene transformation products were measured over 180 days in the flow cell effluent depth profiles of these compounds through the lpz were determined after terminating the experiment a one dimensional diffusion reaction model was used to interpret the effluent and depth profile data and constrain reaction parameters abiotic transformation rate constants for tce to acetylene normalized to in situ solids loading were approximately 13 times greater in batch than in the flow cell slower transformation rates in the flow cell indicate elevated tce concentration and or further degradation of acetylene to other reduced gas compounds in the flow cell lpz thereby partially masking tce abiotic transformation biotic and abiotic parameters used to interpret the flow cell data were then used to simulate a field site with a 300 cm thick lpz abiotic processes contributed to a 2 reduction in tce flux after 730 days when abiotic rate constants were changed to that observed in batch or to rate constants previously reported for a pyrite rich mudstone the tce flux reduction was 21 and 53 respectively after 730 days though biotic processes dominated tce transformation in the flow cell experiment the simulations indicate that abiotic processes have potential to significantly contribute to tce attenuation in electron donor limited environments provided suitable reactive minerals are present keywords low permeability back diffusion trichloroethene biotic abiotic numerical model 1 introduction back diffusion of trichloroethene tce from low permeability zones lpzs such as silt and clay lenses has allowed groundwater contamination to persist for decades at many hazardous waste sites chapman and parker 2005 liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2008 this often creates an unacceptable risk because tce in lpzs represents a continuous contaminant source to groundwater resources with the potential to adversely affect the human liver kidneys and central nervous system both biotic cupples et al 2004a 2003 löffler et al 2000 1999 maymó gatell et al 1999 1997 mccarty et al 1994 vogel and mccarty 1985 and abiotic

trichloroethene transformation the former requires a suitable electron donor and bacteria in the dehalococcoides genus or other bacteria with necessary dehalogenase enzymes to completely dechlorinate tce as illustrated in fig 1 transformation products in order of reaction are cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce vinyl chloride vc and ethene c2h4 in natural anaerobic systems abiotic transformation often depends on the presence of reactive minerals e g mackinawite pyrite green rust ferrous clay some iron oxides etc and results in chloroacetylene production via β elimination reactions or other short chain hydrocarbons via hydrogenation and coupling reactions prior studies have evaluated the transformation of tce in low permeability clays though most have focused on biotic transformation pathways or the influence of fractures or other heterogeneities on transport of contaminants and electron donor in the clay matrix chambon et al 2010 damgaard et al 2013 manoli et al 2012 this study explores the relative contributions of both biotic and abiotic pathways on the flux of tce and its transformation products in relatively homogeneous low permeability source zones in which diffusion controls mass transfer reactant mixing and redox zonation this is important for predicting tce persistence in the subsurface and evaluating the potential for remedial action via enhanced natural processes biological reductive dechlorination often accounts for considerable transformation of tce at contaminated sites semprini et al 1990 major et al 2002 hood et al 2008 scheutz et al 2008 the first reduction step to cis dce can be mediated by amendment with acetate or hydrogen h2 depending on the microbial community present he et al 2002 the second and third reduction steps to vc and c2h4 are promoted by h2 cupples et al 2004b abiotic β elimination or dihaloelimination of tce does not progress through cis dce and vc fig 1 instead it involves a two electron transfer to form chloroacetylene which quickly undergoes hydrogenolysis cleavage of chloride by hydrogen to acetylene which is considered innocuous butler and hayes 1999 show that most tce mass is recovered as acetylene when reacted with iron sulfide several minerals have been found to promote this reaction e g pyrite green rusts as well as ferrous iron containing natural clays elsner et al 2004 ferrey et al 2004 lee and batchelor 2002a b weerasooriya and dharmasena 2001 acetylene can be further transformed biotically koene cottaar and schraa 1998 mcmillan et al 1979 or abiotically arnold and roberts 2000 roberts et al 1996 to ethene and ethane the abiotic production of acetylene ethene and ethane has been associated with small amounts of propylene propane and butane arnold and roberts 2000 schaefer et al 2017 these latter c3 and c4 compounds are presumed to result from coupling reactions whose pathways have not been fully determined mass transfer limitations concentration gradients of reactive species and related redox gradients influence the spatial distribution of biotic and abiotic tce transformation processes in lpzs electron donors e g lactate acetate h2 required for biological reduction are often delivered via adjacent high permeability zones hpzs and diffuse into lpzs chlorinated ethenes electron acceptors persisting in lpzs near the interface between an lpz and hpz diffuse in the opposite direction of supplied electron donors reactive minerals which can also vary in oxidation state spatially promote abiotic transformation of chlorinated ethenes solute concentrations and mineral oxidation states control the redox potential as biotic and abiotic reactions occur a reducing front progresses through the lpz further changing the contributions of biotic and abiotic reactions throughout the lpz profile previous studies have explored biotic degradation of tce in diffusive systems cápiro et al 2015 philips et al 2013 or focused on diffusive transport of solutes yang et al 2016 2015 but few studies have attempted to evaluate the combined effects of mass transfer limitations and biotic and abiotic redox reactions in lpzs to our knowledge no previous studies have quantified the role of abiotic reduction processes in attenuating the flux of tce to adjacent hpzs in this complex system the primary objective of this work is to determine the contributions of both biotic and abiotic reduction to overall tce transformation during back diffusion from a lpz specifically when the adjacent hpz is amended with lactate for bioremediation we hypothesize that abiotic tce degradation will only marginally contribute to decreasing the flux of tce from lpzs during active electron donor amendment to the hpz but can become important during long term natural attenuation when biological reactions are electron donor limited and as the length scale of tce diffusion through the lpz and the amount of reactive minerals increase a natural clay was chosen for the lpz and a sand from the same site was chosen for the hpz anaerobic batch experiments were performed with the clay to assess abiotic reaction rates a quasi two dimensional flow experiment was then performed with adjacent lpz and hpz zones dechlorination products were monitored in the effluent groundwater and quantified spatially in the lpz at the conclusion of the experiment a one dimensional reactive transport model was developed and used to identify mechanisms controlling rates of tce mass attenuation and the contribution of abiotic reactions on the flux of tce from lpzs under flow cell and

nitrogen sparged groundwater from pease afb 1 mm lactate and 100 μm tce 2 4 batch reactors batch experiments were conducted to determine the abiotic reactivity of the pease clay with tce and cis dce glass serum bottles 160 ml were filled with 100 ml nanopure water npw and degassed with nitrogen for 30 min the bottles were then crimp sealed with teflon lined butyl stoppers and autoclaved after returning to room temperature 10 g of gamma irradiated pease clay oregon state university radiation center 2 5 mrad was added to the serum bottles in an anaerobic chamber to minimize oxidation of the ferrous clay minerals tce or cis dce was added neat to obtain an initial aqueous concentration of 400 μm after partitioning between phases concentrations of volatile compounds were then measured over time in the headspace of the batch reactors and the total mass of reactants and products in the batch bottles was determined assuming equilibrium partitioning batch reactors were stored upside down in water to minimize losses through the stoppers both tce and cis dce spiked batch reactors were performed in triplicate the batch reactors were mixed every three to four days by shaking for 30 s 2 5 flow cell a stainless steel and glass flow cell shown in fig 2 similar to previous studies suchomel et al 2007 cavanagh et al 2014 cápiro et al 2015 was used to create a representative pseudo two dimensional lpz hpz interface two 0 64 cm thick sheets of glass were placed on the front and back faces of a stainless steel frame separated with viton gaskets to prevent leaks aluminum windows were bolted to the outside using holes bored through the windows and frame one eighth inch fittings tapped in the frame on the edges were used to introduce groundwater and a thin rectangular opening in the top of the frame was used to pack sand and clay a stainless steel plate was used to seal the top of the flow cell the inside dimensions of the flow cell were 16 5 cm 2 cm 16 5 cm lxwxh during flow cell setup a thin layer 0 25 cm of tenax beads pre equilibrated with tce in a serum bottle for a week were placed at the base of the flow cell equilibration details are described in section s 1 of supporting information pease clay was mixed with 20 ml of dcc inoculum in an anaerobic chamber and aggregated into 1 cm balls these were then placed in the bottom of the flow cell in approximately 1 cm lifts and compacted together into a composite layer using a stainless steel rod the top of the clay was then smoothed with the rod for the hpz pease sand was packed on top of the clay with stainless steel mesh on the left and right edges to distribute flow through the sand uniformly during packing the groundwater level in the flow cell was always maintained above the solids the groundwater was sparged with nitrogen before adding to the flow cell to maintain anoxic conditions after packing a top plate was used to seal the flow cell the flow cell was then transferred to a fume hood and the experiment was performed influent groundwater amended with 1 mm lactate was continuously sparged with nitrogen and introduced to the hpz with a reciprocating push pull syringe pump harvard apparatus phd ultra at 50 ml day retention time in sand is 1 5 days lactate in the hpz diffused into the lpz at the interface and tce initially on the tenax diffused through the lpz from the base reaction products that diffused out of the lpz were quickly removed from the flow cell via advection in the hpz flow cell effluent was either collected in a 180 cm 4 5 ml volume stainless steel sample loop or a 200 ml effluent container which was replaced with a clean container regularly effluent in the stainless steel sample loop was purged directly into a bottle and the headspace was analyzed for volatiles solution in the bottle was analyzed for inorganic anions to estimate reducing conditions and organic acids to monitor utilization of electron donor the flow cell experiment was terminated after 180 days by closing the flow valves and freezing at 80 c the flow cell was then unbolted the glass was removed and the frozen lpz and hpz material was removed from the frame the frozen clay comprising the lpz was cut into 1 cm wide vertical sections with a band saw ryobi 9 in and then further cut into 0 5 cm depth increments each 1 cm 2 cm 0 5 cm frozen block was placed in an 8 5 ml vial crimp sealed with a teflon lined butyl stopper and allowed to thaw overnight at room temperature headspace in the vials was then analyzed for volatiles each vertical profile was evaluated in triplicate and the concentrations reported at each depth are an average of the three measurements a fourth vertical profile was used to determine ferrous iron content these profiles were also determined from frozen blocks 1 cm 2 cm 0 75 cm cut from the flow cell material a replicate flow cell experiment was performed for 70 days and the effluent was similarly monitored results for the first flow cell are presented in the manuscript and results for the second flow cell are shown for comparison in the supporting information fig s 9 6 clay samples cut from the frozen lpz in vertical

fe b which utilizes 1 10 phenanthroline and xrd analysis was done by premier oilfield laboratories using x ray diffraction xrd with a bruker d2 phaser further method details and data are provided in supporting information sections s 3 and s 5 2 7 numerical model a 1d diffusion reaction model was developed and coded in matlab to simulate flow cell effluent concentrations and the corresponding depth profiles in the lpz operator splitting was used to separately solve for transport and reactions barry et al 1996 steefel and macquarrie 1996 for diffusive transport a standard second order finite difference spatial approximation and first order fully implicit temporal approximation were used the matlab routine used to solve the coupled system of equations was ode15s a fully implicit variable order solver that is well suited for stiff systems biological dechlorination of tce to cis dce to vc and to ethene biotic pathway indicated in fig 1 was considered and reactions were modeled using dual monod kinetics based on initial modeling of the diffusion profiles of donor and acceptor without reaction it was apparent that both donor and acceptor could be limiting in the clay profile during the experiment previous work bagley 1998 cupples et al 2004b has shown that dual monod kinetics is well suited when both substrates have the potential to limit biological reactions abiotic reactions of tce and cis dce with reactive minerals were considered and modeled using 1st order kinetics with respect to tce or cis dce see previous work reviewed in he et al 2015 reactive mineral concentrations were assumed to remain constant because rates of abiotic reduction in batch experiments appeared to be constant for over 3 months see fig 5 in results and interpretation section it is assumed that lactate is completely fermented and oxidized to acetate h2 and propionate in the hpz and this is supported by groundwater effluent measurements see fig s 6 1 in supporting information the fermentation products diffuse into the lpz and it is also assumed that only acetate and hydrogen serve as electron donors for dechlorination propionate is not a direct electron donor for dechlorination and hydrogen produced from propionate fermentation was determined to be insignificant due to the high concentrations of acetate available tce degraders are known to use both acetate and hydrogen whereas cis dce and vc degraders use only hydrogen therefore it is assumed that one microbial community uses either hydrogen or acetate for the first dechlorination step and a second community uses only hydrogen but can facilitate all three dechlorination steps this assumption is based on previous work lee et al 2007 which concludes that dechlorinating communities can be generally split into two groups 1 organisms from a wide genus range that can use acetate and or hydrogen to dechlorinate tce to cis dce and 2 organisms specifically dehalococcoides that use hydrogen to dechlorinate from tce to ethene the governing equation is shown in eq 2 solute concentration ci is in units of μmoles per liter of fluid deff i is the effective diffusion coefficient in porous media reaction terms r i vary for each species i an example is shown in eq 3 for the cis dce reaction term similar reaction terms for the other species which have been used in previous work such as that by bagley 1998 or cupples et al 2004b can be found in the supporting information section s 7 in eq 3 cis dce is formed biologically from reaction of tce with either acetate or hydrogen the first three terms is degraded biologically with hydrogen to form vc the fourth term and reacts abiotically to form acetylene last term d effdce is the effective diffusion coefficient r uttce and r utdce are the maximum utilization rates k tce k dce and k h2 are the half saturation constants and k abiodce is the pseudo first order rate constant two biological communities for tce are indicated the x1 community represents the concentration of cells that use both acetate and hydrogen as electron donors for the first dechlorination reaction and x2 represents the concentration of cells that use hydrogen only for all three dechlorinations an initial concentration of cells throughout the lpz was assumed and the model allowed for cell growth and decay over time maximum specific growth rates and decay

summarized in fig 3 and the initial conditions for all species are zero concentration in the lpz matrix the tce concentration was set equal to its aqueous solubility limit 9 74 mm at the base of the lpz and acetate and hydrogen were held constant at the lpz hpz interface their values were determined from the hpz effluent data and electron donor balance calculations both included in section s 6 of the supporting information the bcs for all other compounds at the lpz hpz interface were set to zero based on the assumption that flow in the hpz is fast residence time is 35 h relative to diffusion time scales in the lpz days to weeks for tce and its products the bcs for other chlorinated compounds at the base of the lpz were set to zero assuming tenax acts as a sink zero flux bcs were used for ethene acetylene and acetate at the base of the lpz which is based on the assumption that these compounds do not sorb to tenax parameters used in the model are in table s 8 1 of supporting information and biological parameters fall in the range of previously reported parameters table s 8 2 the abiotic rate constant for cis dce in the model was assumed to be 1 10th of the tce rate constant per batch experiment data and the first order rate constant for acetylene conversion to ethene kacetylene for fe oxides from jeong et al 2007 was used model validation was done using an analytical solution for diffusion and reaction validation results are included in the supporting information fig s 7 1 and confidence intervals were determined for each of the seven fitting parameters indicated in table s 8

less reactive than the clay i e initial half life t1 2 sand 7 t1 2clay with the sand showing decreased acetylene production after 30 days the relative inactivity of the sand is due to its lower ferrous iron concentration 746 mg kg for the sand as opposed to 2625 mg kg for the clay results for batch experiments containing pease clay spiked with either tce or cis dce are shown in fig 4 the molar fraction of the initial tce or cis dce reduced to acetylene increases linearly for up to 100 days the rate of acetylene production from cis dce is approximately 1 10th the rate from tce the tce and cis dce reduction rate constants were rescaled to match the estimated solid water ratio in the flow cell and results are listed in fig 4 as knorm this was done by dividing kbatch by the solid water ratio gsolid lwater in the batch experiments and multiplying by the solid water ratio in the flow cell determined from clay density and water content after the flow cell experiment in fig 4 the data are presented as a mole ratio of acetylene mass produced to initial tce or dce mass present when this ratio is small a regression of the data in fig 4 gives the pseudo first order rate constant this is summarized in eqs 4 and 5 4 ln 1 m acet m initial k batch t 5 ln 1 m acet m initial m acet m initial pseudo first order kinetics were assumed based on previous studies he et al 2015 schaefer et al 2017 2013 zero order kinetics also fit the data but controls indicated acetylene production depended on the presence of tce or cis dce the kinetics are assumed to be pseudo first order because the reactive minerals are assumed to never limit the reaction during the time period of study these results confirmed those from a previous study that showed that a similar pease clay sample promotes tce abiotic reduction via β elimination to produce acetylene schaefer et al 2018 that study reports slower rates however which may be due to higher initial loading of initial tce and langmuir type sorption to reaction sites results herein also showed that a natural clay can promote abiotic cis dce transformation to acetylene via β elimination albeit at a much slower rate than tce this expands on previous work which showed that other minerals and metals can facilitate the reaction of cis dce to acetylene and ethene arnold and roberts 2000 lee and batchelor 2002a b jeong et al 2007 small amounts of ethane propane and butane were also produced but at concentrations at least one order of magnitude less than acetylene data not shown methane also increased in the batch experiments on the same order of magnitude as acetylene but had more variability data not shown 3 2 flow cell experiment the flow cell effluent data shown in fig 5 is expressed as mass discharge rate mass time of tce and its reaction products over 180 days the tce decreased to below detection levels in the first 30 days the cis dce rapidly increased during this same time and then reached an approximately steady value of 6 1 μmol day after 40 days this value is close to the expected mass discharge rate of tce 8 μmol day into the hpz if it was diffusing without reaction from saturation conditions at the bottom of the clay to an approximately zero concentration boundary at the lpz hpz interface suggesting that almost all of the tce was being converted to cis dce in the lpz before diffusing into the overlying hpz near 80 days there was an increase in vc and near 110 days there was an increase in ethene the vc mass discharge rate almost reached the level of cis dce but appeared to plateau near 140 days the sum of cis dce and vc mass discharge rate remains 8 μmol day after days the ethene increased over 20 days and then stayed relatively constant and at a low concentration after 130 days acetylene mass discharge was observed over the entire experiment at a low rate of 2 5 10 3 μmol day this represented 0 04 of the maximum possible tce mass discharge rate from the lpz assuming the aforementioned boundary conditions and no tce reaction and indicates abiotic reduction of tce and or dce was sustained but low during the study period the presence of acetylene throughout the experiment and potential inhibition pon et al 2003 may explain the persistence of vc and slower ethene production during the last 40 days of the experiment no lactate was measured in the flow cell effluent after the first week instead propionate and acetate were measured fig s 6 1 lactate is known to ferment and oxidize to acetate propionate and hydrogen the propionate and acetate levels measured matched those expected for complete lactate fermentation and oxidation to these products detailed calculations are included in the supporting information section s 6 the flow rate through the hpz was doubled at approximately 130 days and there was no significant impact on chlorinated ethene or acetylene mass discharge rate this indicates that the approximately zero concentration boundary assumed for chlorinated ethenes at the lpz hpz interface is correct and that the reactions of interest are occurring in the lpz rather than the hpz due to the very short residence time in the latter depth profiles of the chlorinated ethenes and reduced gases in the lpz at the conclusion of the experiment are shown in fig 6 where the clay extends from zero bottom to 8 cm lpz hpz interface and samples closest to the bottom start at 1 cm to avoid artifacts from tenax the tce concentration is high at the base of the flow cell and low at the interface this is expected because the source of tce is on tenax beads at the base cis dce increases in concentration close to 7 cm and vc has a peak closer to 7 5 cm these peaks are likely due to the availability of acetate and hydrogen closer to the interface acetylene like tce is higher at the lpz base and low near the interface indicating its transformation does not depend on the electron donor the results indicate that acetylene production is directly related to the tce concentration but not a strong function of cis dce concentration this makes sense as acetylene production rates knorm from cis dce are only 1 10th of those from tce and tce is present at much higher concentrations than cis dce in the flow cell in contrast to chlorinated compounds and acetylene the ethene concentration profile shows two regions of higher concentration one near the lpz hpz interface and another toward the lpz base the ethene concentration peak at the lpz hpz interface is expected as a dechlorination product of vc the ethene concentration increase near the lpz base is expected if acetylene undergoes hydrogenation to ethene hence ethene production appears to be coming from both vc and acetylene depth profiles for four other reduced gases were measured that are strikingly similar to ethene they are ethane propylene propane propyne hence they too appear to be produced from both vc and acetylene this finding suggests that we could be underestimating the amount of abiotic tce reduction in natural systems by ignoring quantification of reduced gas transformation products nevertheless when accounting for the mass of all the reduced gas transformation products the abiotic products are still orders of magnitude less than the biotic products the last gas measured was methane and its depth profile only peaks near the lpz hpz interface this is likely due to tce controlling the reducing conditions deeper in the clay profile conditions may be more reducing near the interface where tce does not dominate allowing for more methanogenesis also the methane concentration profile peak coincides with the highest concentrations of electron donor this makes sense because lactate is introduced in the hpz and its fermentation products diffuse into the top of the clay at the interface 8 cm 3 3 flow cell model the 1d diffusion reaction model was used to simulate flow cell results parameter values were adjusted to match both the time dependent effluent data from zero to 180 days as well as the depth profiles at 180 days the maximum specific growth rate and biomass decay constant were initially fit to the effluent data as they were more sensitive to the temporal changes further fitting was done using depth profile data for the maximum utilization rates for the two dechlorinating communities as well as the first order rate constant for the elimination reaction of tce to acetylene the fitting was optimized for the depth profiles to minimize the sum of the residual squared error srse the error was not minimized for the effluent mass discharge rate a complete list of model parameters is included in table s 8 1 additionally table s 8 2 compares monod kinetic parameters fit in this study with those of previous studies in most cases parameter values from this study are in the range of those in the literature model generated mass discharge rates are compared to effluent data in fig 5 the model profiles generally capture the experimental data trends but do not always match their values the experimental tce data points at early time are not captured by the model based on expected tce transport rates tce mass discharge rate should not have exceeded 0 1 μmol day until day 10 if the initial tce concentration in the lpz is zero this indicates that tce in the pore water adjacent to the tenax beads likely mixed throughout the lpz depth during flow cell packing leading to early time hpz breakthrough from the lpz the experimental cis dce trends are well captured by the model the upward trends of the experimental vc and ethene data points also are captured by the model but the former are characterized by sharp increases after 80 and 100 days respectively while the model profiles increase more gradually the mass discharge rate of acetylene is over predicted by the model which may be due to subsequent acetylene degradation that could not be completely accounted for in the model model profiles are compared to depth profiles in fig 6 and results show good agreement the model profiles match the general shapes and magnitudes of most species these profiles modestly underestimate or overestimate experimental cis dce and vc data points at various depths and do not capture the extent of the decrease in ethene near the center the model appears to represent the acetylene depth profile well despite failing to adequately describe the acetylene effluent data model outputs for donors and microbial community concentration are included in figs s 9 1 and s 9 2 in the supporting information generally community x1 has a higher initial biomass and dominates at early time but after a few months community x2 makes a larger contribution to the effluent and profile behavior one indication of this is the inflection point in vc and ethene around 150 days in fig 5 it is also important to note that the abiotic rate constants that fit the batch experiment data are greater by more than an order of magnitude than the rate constants that satisfy the flow cell depth profile data table 1 the abiotic tce transformation rate constant determined in batch is 13 times greater than the rate constant determined in the flow cell some possible reasons for this discrepancy are 1 abiotic processes are diffusion limited in the flow cell 2 the abiotic processes are limited by biotic competition for tce 3 acetylene produced is further transformed to other reduced gases or 4 the mass loading of tce influences rate constants with lower rates observed at higher tce loading the fourth option would indicate that uptake of tce onto reactive mineral surfaces may be described by a langmuir surface site model previous work by schaefer et al 2018 utilizing the same clay at a higher tce loading in batch experiments showed a tce to acetylene rate constant of 3 1 10 5 1 day which compares well with the abiotic rate constant for tce to acetylene fit in the flow cell this makes sense as the tce concentrations near the tce source on tenax see fig 2 were more similar to the concentrations used in batch in the study by schaefer et al 2018 the differences between the model and the data could also be influenced by different types of inhibition ex redox inhibition more chlorinated compounds inhibiting transformation of less chlorinated compounds yu et al 2005 or acetylene inhibiting dechlorination pon et al 2003 the inhibition of more chlorinated compounds on less chlorinated compound transformation was considered but did not significantly improve the model fit it was not included in the model fitting and simulations in order to reduce model complexity figs s 9 4 and s 9 5 in the supporting information show profiles with inhibition included inconsistencies may also exist because of assumptions made about the use of electron donor hydrogen produced from propionate was not considered competition for acetate and hydrogen by non dechlorinating organisms was not considered in the lpz and calculations show that the electron donor utilized by iron reducing organisms could have been relevant during the first couple weeks of the flow cell experiment a more complex model including all these processes could potentially fit the experimental data better but increasing the complexity also increases the number of parameters and unknowns capturing all the biological processes in the mixed community potentially resulting in different donor gradients or other undetected species was outside of the scope of this work future work may focus on further characterizing the microbial community dynamics supported with data from dna extractions to look at the spatial distribution of the microbial community 3 4 field scale implications the 1d model with parameter values estimated from flow cell experimental data was used to simulate back diffusion and reaction from a lpz at a representative field site while the model does not appear to account for all reaction mechanisms affecting the fate of tce and its transformation products it does approximately capture the dominant reactants and products as well as the relevant time scales of reaction to better represent the conditions at a field site that is experiencing back diffusion the initial conditions and boundary conditions for tce were modified from the conditions used to model the flow cell the initial tce profile was determined from boring wcp 70 at an industrial site in connecticut fig 7c where samples were taken in the late 1990s parker et al 2004 based on boring wcp 70 the lpz thickness is 300 cm for the simulation it is assumed that there is no tce initially in the hpz and flow in the hpz is fast relative to diffusion in the lpz tce boundary conditions at the lpz hpz interface and base of the domain are zero concentration and zero flux respectively simulations were run for 365 days 1 year to evaluate biotic and abiotic reaction contributions to chlorinated ethene fluxes from the lpz model results showing fluxes of tce cis 1 2 dce vc ethene and acetylene from the lpz to the hpz are presented in fig 7 with amended lactate abiotic biotic simulation fluxes of chlorinated ethenes decrease at least five orders of magnitude to 10 4 μmol day cm2 after 300 days and cis dce and vc are released into the hpz for a period of approximately 220 days before ethene dominates the fluxes fig 7a in contrast without amended lactate the tce flux decreases less than two orders of magnitude to 1 17 10 1 μmol day cm2 after 365 days and this decrease is mostly due to diffusion the small inset in the upper right of fig 7b shows the abiotic contribution to decreasing flux near the end of the simulation which is minimal using the abiotic rate constant from the flow cell experiments as expected the flux of acetylene in the presence of lactate at 365 days 4 16 10 4 μmol day cm2 is less than when lactate is absent 6 81 10 4 μmol day cm2 this is because abiotic processes are first order with respect to tce concentration and tce concentrations are higher in the absence of lactate the continued increase in ethene in the absence of electron donor is due to the first order reaction of acetylene to ethene that was included in the model further analysis would be necessary to fully understand the fate and transport of the different species released into the hpz in addition to the abiotic simulation with the rate constant determined from the flow cell two more simulations were conducted to evaluate fluxes from the lpz in the absence of an electron donor in one simulation the abiotic batch rate constant of 3 23 10 4 1 day was used and in another simulation a rate constant of 1 04 10 3 1 day was used which represents a highly reactive pyrite rich mudstone schaefer et al 2013 simulations for all three rate constants are shown in fig 8 over a two year period 730 days flux simulation results are presented as a percent reduction in tce flux from the diffusion only case after 730 days tce fluxes determined using the rate constant of 2 50 10 5 1 day showed a tce flux reduction of only 2 however after 730 days with rate constants of 3 23 10 4 1 day batch fit and 1 04 10 3 1 day pyrite rich mudstone the tce flux reductions were 21 and 53 respectively in the presence of highly reactive minerals abiotic reactions can have a significant impact on tce flux values from lpzs though most subsurface low permeability environments do not consist of a pyrite rich mudstone this analysis shows that materials other than the clay used in this study may have a greater potential to abiotically decrease chlorinated ethene flux from lpzs there may be issues with some assumptions implied in this simulation such as constant mineral reactivity over time but it is still useful to consider how more reactive mineral species could maintain faster reaction rates for longer periods of time 4 conclusions in an lpz hpz system with a natural clay a healthy dechlorinating community and access to electron donors the abiotic contributions to tce transformation were relatively small compared to the biotic contributions depth profiles through the lpz in the flow cell experiment showed that cis dce and vc production were greater near the interface of the flow cell indicating that the biotic processes are more important near the electron donor source the depth profiles also showed higher concentrations of acetylene near the base of the depth profile where the tce was highest indicating that abiotic degradation of tce to acetylene was occurring simultaneously but contributing much less to total tce mass reduction a 1d diffusion reaction model was able to adequately capture these depth profiles and the time scales of dominant products and reactants in the flow cell effluent however it failed to capture the magnitude of some product mass discharge rates additional complexities could be added to the model to improve its capabilities albeit with more model parameters many lpz environments contaminated with tce may not have a dechlorinating community and electron donor present in those environments it is important to consider the contribution of abiotic reactions to acetylene and other reduced gases when estimating natural attenuation based on our simulation for a 300 cm lpz the reactive minerals in a natural clay could decrease the tce flux to hpzs by 2 53 after 2 years depending on the reactive minerals and their rate constants it is difficult to evaluate the contributions of abiotic reactions in mitigating long term chlorinated ethene flux without site specific data therefore the reactivity of subsurface materials should be screened for reactive mineral species at sites with limited biotic transformation potential it may be informative to do regular dissolved gas sampling despite challenges with gas sampling and expenses involved with cryogenic cores measurements of acetylene and other reduced gases such as methane ethene ethane propylene propane propyne and butane could allow for a better understanding of abiotic transformation pathways future work related to abiotic degradation of tce could make use of radiolabeled carbon to gain better insight into the production of ethane and coupling reactions that produce c3 and c4 products also aerobic abiotic tce degradation at the lpz hpz interface needs to be explored more oxygenated hpzs are often adjacent to anaerobic lpzs promoting an oxygen gradient through the lpz and allowing tce degradation to small organic acids and carbon dioxide aerobic abiotic reactions could also have a significant influence on the mass of tce fluxing into hpzs finally more work is needed to better understand how biotic and abiotic transformation pathways enhance and limit one another microorganisms may participate in cycling reactive minerals or mineral species may promote reducing environments that further promote biological reductive dechlorination as these processes become better understood we will be able to more accurately estimate the timescale and magnitude of natural attenuation processes and ultimately inform decision

1579,low permeability source zones sustain long term trichloroethene tce groundwater contamination in anaerobic environments tce is transformed by both biological reductive dechlorination and abiotic reactions with reactive minerals little is known about the relative contribution of these two pathways as tce diffuses from low permeability zones lpzs into high permeability zones hpzs this study combines a flow cell experiment batch experiments and a diffusion reaction model to evaluate the contributions of biotic and abiotic tce transformation in lpzs natural clay lpz and sand hpz from a former air force base were used in all experiments in batch the lpz material transformed tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce to acetylene with pseudo first order rate constants of 8 57 10 6 day 1 and 1 02 10 6 day 1 respectively biotic and abiotic pathways were then evaluated together in a bench scale flow cell 16 5 cm 2 cm 16 5 cm that contained a lpz layer with a source of tce at the base overlain by a hpz continuously purged with lactate amended groundwater diffusion controlled mass transfer in the lpz while advection controlled migration in the hpz the mass discharge rate of tce and its biotic cis dce and vinyl chloride and abiotic acetylene transformation products were measured over 180 days in the flow cell effluent depth profiles of these compounds through the lpz were determined after terminating the experiment a one dimensional diffusion reaction model was used to interpret the effluent and depth profile data and constrain reaction parameters abiotic transformation rate constants for tce to acetylene normalized to in situ solids loading were approximately 13 times greater in batch than in the flow cell slower transformation rates in the flow cell indicate elevated tce concentration and or further degradation of acetylene to other reduced gas compounds in the flow cell lpz thereby partially masking tce abiotic transformation biotic and abiotic parameters used to interpret the flow cell data were then used to simulate a field site with a 300 cm thick lpz abiotic processes contributed to a 2 reduction in tce flux after 730 days when abiotic rate constants were changed to that observed in batch or to rate constants previously reported for a pyrite rich mudstone the tce flux reduction was 21 and 53 respectively after 730 days though biotic processes dominated tce transformation in the flow cell experiment the simulations indicate that abiotic processes have potential to significantly contribute to tce attenuation in electron donor limited environments provided suitable reactive minerals are present keywords low permeability back diffusion trichloroethene biotic abiotic numerical model 1 introduction back diffusion of trichloroethene tce from low permeability zones lpzs such as silt and clay lenses has allowed groundwater contamination to persist for decades at many hazardous waste sites chapman and parker 2005 liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2008 this often creates an unacceptable risk because tce in lpzs represents a continuous contaminant source to groundwater resources with the potential to adversely affect

trichloroethene transformation the former requires a suitable electron donor and bacteria in the dehalococcoides genus or other bacteria with necessary dehalogenase enzymes to completely dechlorinate

depends on the presence of reactive minerals e g mackinawite pyrite green rust ferrous clay some iron oxides etc and results in chloroacetylene production via β elimination reactions or other short chain hydrocarbons via hydrogenation and coupling reactions prior studies have evaluated the transformation of tce in low permeability clays though most have focused on biotic transformation pathways or the influence of fractures or other heterogeneities on transport of contaminants and electron donor in the clay matrix chambon et al 2010 damgaard et al 2013 manoli et al 2012 this study explores the relative contributions of both biotic and abiotic pathways on the flux of tce and its transformation products in relatively homogeneous low permeability source zones in which diffusion controls mass transfer reactant mixing and redox zonation this is important for predicting tce persistence in the subsurface and evaluating the potential for remedial action via enhanced natural processes biological reductive dechlorination often accounts for considerable transformation of tce at contaminated sites semprini et al 1990 major et al 2002 hood et al 2008 scheutz et al 2008 the first reduction step to cis dce can be mediated by amendment with acetate or hydrogen h2 depending on the microbial community present he et al 2002 the second and third reduction steps to vc and c2h4 are promoted by h2 cupples et al 2004b abiotic β elimination or dihaloelimination of tce does not progress through cis dce and vc fig 1 instead it involves a two electron transfer to form chloroacetylene which quickly undergoes hydrogenolysis cleavage of chloride by hydrogen to acetylene which is considered innocuous butler and hayes 1999 show that most tce mass is recovered as acetylene when reacted with iron sulfide several minerals have been found to promote this reaction e g pyrite green rusts as well as ferrous iron containing natural clays elsner et al 2004 ferrey et al 2004 lee and

these latter c3 and c4 compounds are presumed to result from coupling reactions whose pathways have not been fully determined mass transfer limitations concentration gradients of reactive species and related redox gradients influence the spatial distribution of biotic and abiotic tce transformation processes in lpzs electron donors e g lactate acetate h2 required for biological reduction are often delivered via adjacent high permeability zones hpzs and diffuse into lpzs chlorinated ethenes electron acceptors persisting in lpzs near the interface between an lpz and hpz diffuse in the opposite direction of supplied electron donors reactive minerals which can also vary in oxidation state spatially promote abiotic transformation of chlorinated ethenes solute concentrations and mineral oxidation states control the redox potential as biotic and abiotic reactions occur a reducing front progresses through the lpz further changing the contributions of biotic and abiotic reactions throughout the lpz profile previous studies have explored biotic degradation of tce in diffusive systems cápiro et al 2015 philips et al 2013 or focused on diffusive transport of solutes yang et al 2016 2015 but few studies have attempted to evaluate the combined effects of mass transfer limitations and biotic and abiotic redox reactions in lpzs to our knowledge no previous studies have quantified the role of abiotic reduction processes in attenuating the flux of tce to adjacent hpzs in this complex system the primary objective of this work is to determine the contributions of both biotic and abiotic reduction to overall tce transformation during back diffusion from a lpz specifically when the adjacent hpz is amended with lactate for bioremediation we hypothesize that abiotic tce degradation will only marginally contribute to decreasing the flux of tce from lpzs during active electron donor amendment to the hpz but can become important during long term natural attenuation when biological reactions are electron donor limited and as the length scale of tce diffusion through the lpz and the amount of reactive minerals increase a natural clay was chosen for the lpz and a sand from the same site was chosen for the hpz anaerobic batch experiments were performed with the clay to assess abiotic reaction rates a quasi two dimensional flow experiment was then performed with adjacent lpz and hpz zones dechlorination products were monitored in the effluent groundwater and quantified spatially in the lpz at the conclusion of the experiment a one dimensional reactive transport model was developed and used to identify mechanisms controlling rates of tce mass attenuation and the contribution of abiotic reactions on the flux of tce from lpzs under flow cell and

nitrogen sparged groundwater from pease afb 1 mm lactate and 100 μm tce 2 4 batch reactors batch experiments were conducted to determine the abiotic reactivity of the pease clay with tce and cis dce glass serum bottles 160 ml were filled with 100 ml nanopure water npw and degassed with nitrogen for 30 min the bottles were then crimp sealed with teflon lined butyl stoppers and autoclaved after returning to room temperature 10 g of gamma irradiated pease clay oregon state university radiation center 2 5 mrad was added to the serum bottles in an anaerobic chamber to minimize oxidation of the ferrous clay minerals tce or cis dce was added neat to obtain an initial aqueous concentration of 400 μm after partitioning between phases concentrations of volatile compounds were then measured over time in the headspace of the batch reactors and the total mass of reactants and products in the batch bottles was determined assuming equilibrium partitioning batch reactors were stored upside down in water to minimize losses through the stoppers both tce and cis dce spiked batch reactors were performed in triplicate the batch reactors were mixed every three to four days by shaking for 30 s 2 5 flow cell a stainless steel and glass flow cell shown in fig 2 similar to previous studies suchomel et al 2007 cavanagh et al 2014 cápiro et al 2015 was used to create a representative pseudo two dimensional lpz hpz interface two 0 64 cm thick sheets of glass were placed on the front and back faces of a stainless steel frame separated with viton gaskets to prevent leaks aluminum windows were bolted to the outside using holes bored through the windows and frame one eighth inch fittings tapped in the frame on the edges were used to introduce groundwater and a thin rectangular opening in the top of the frame was used to pack sand and clay a stainless steel plate was used to seal the top of the flow cell the inside dimensions of the flow cell were 16 5 cm 2 cm 16 5 cm lxwxh during flow cell setup a thin layer 0 25 cm of tenax beads pre equilibrated with tce in a serum bottle for a week were placed at the base of the flow cell equilibration details are described in section s 1 of supporting information pease clay was mixed with 20 ml of dcc inoculum in an anaerobic chamber and aggregated into 1 cm balls these were then placed in the bottom of the flow cell in approximately 1 cm lifts and compacted together into a composite layer using a stainless steel rod the top of the clay was then smoothed with the rod for the hpz pease sand was packed on top of the clay with stainless steel mesh on the left and right edges to distribute flow through the sand uniformly during packing the groundwater level in the flow cell was always maintained above the solids the groundwater was sparged with nitrogen before adding to the flow cell to maintain anoxic conditions after packing a top plate was used to seal the flow cell the flow cell was then transferred to a fume hood and the experiment was performed influent groundwater amended with 1 mm lactate was continuously sparged with nitrogen and introduced to the hpz with a reciprocating push pull syringe pump harvard apparatus phd ultra at 50 ml day retention time in sand is 1 5 days lactate in the hpz diffused into the lpz at the interface and tce initially on the tenax diffused through the lpz from the base reaction products that diffused out of the lpz were quickly removed from the flow cell via advection in the hpz flow cell effluent was either collected in a 180 cm 4 5 ml volume stainless steel sample loop or a 200 ml effluent container which was replaced with a clean container regularly effluent in the stainless steel sample loop was purged directly into a bottle and the headspace was analyzed for volatiles solution in the bottle was analyzed for inorganic anions to estimate reducing conditions and organic acids to monitor utilization of electron donor the flow cell experiment was terminated after 180 days by closing the flow valves and freezing at 80 c the flow cell was then unbolted the glass was removed and the frozen lpz and hpz material was removed from the frame the frozen clay comprising the lpz was cut into 1 cm wide vertical sections with a band saw ryobi 9 in and then further cut into 0 5 cm depth increments each 1 cm 2 cm 0 5 cm frozen block was placed in an 8 5 ml vial crimp sealed with a teflon lined butyl stopper and allowed to thaw overnight at room temperature headspace in the vials was then analyzed for volatiles each vertical profile was evaluated in triplicate and the concentrations reported at each depth are an average of the three measurements a fourth vertical profile was used to determine ferrous iron content these profiles were also determined from frozen blocks 1 cm 2 cm 0 75 cm cut from the flow cell material a replicate flow cell experiment was performed for 70 days and the effluent was similarly monitored results for the first flow cell are presented in the manuscript and results for the second flow cell are shown for comparison in the supporting information fig s 9 6 clay samples cut from the frozen lpz in vertical

supporting information sections s 3 and s 5 2 7 numerical model a 1d diffusion reaction model was developed and coded in matlab to simulate flow cell effluent concentrations and the corresponding depth profiles in the lpz operator splitting was used to separately solve for transport and reactions barry et al 1996 steefel and macquarrie 1996 for diffusive transport a standard second order finite difference spatial approximation and first order fully implicit temporal approximation were used the matlab routine used to solve the coupled system of equations was ode15s a fully implicit variable order solver that is well suited for stiff systems biological dechlorination of tce to cis dce to vc and to ethene biotic pathway indicated in fig 1 was considered and reactions were modeled using dual monod kinetics based on initial modeling of the diffusion profiles of donor and acceptor without reaction it was apparent that both donor and acceptor could be limiting in the clay profile during the experiment previous work bagley 1998 cupples et al 2004b has shown that dual monod kinetics is well suited when both substrates have the potential to limit biological reactions abiotic reactions of tce and cis dce with reactive minerals were considered and modeled using 1st order kinetics with respect to tce or cis dce see previous work reviewed in he et al 2015 reactive mineral concentrations were assumed to remain constant because rates of abiotic reduction in batch experiments appeared to be constant for over 3 months see fig 5 in results and interpretation section it is assumed that lactate is completely fermented and oxidized to acetate h2 and propionate in the hpz and this is supported by groundwater effluent measurements see fig s 6 1 in supporting information the fermentation products diffuse into the lpz and it is also assumed that only acetate and hydrogen serve as electron donors for dechlorination propionate is not a direct electron donor for dechlorination and hydrogen produced from propionate fermentation was determined to be insignificant due to the high concentrations of acetate available tce degraders are known to use both acetate and hydrogen whereas cis dce and vc degraders use only hydrogen therefore it is assumed that one microbial community uses either hydrogen or acetate for the first dechlorination step and a second community uses only hydrogen but can facilitate all three dechlorination steps this assumption is based on previous work lee et al 2007 which concludes that dechlorinating communities can be generally split into two groups 1 organisms from a wide genus range that can use acetate and or hydrogen to dechlorinate tce to cis dce and 2 organisms specifically dehalococcoides that use hydrogen to dechlorinate from tce to ethene the governing equation is shown in eq 2 solute concentration ci is in units of μmoles per liter of fluid deff i is the effective diffusion coefficient in porous media reaction terms r i vary for each species i an example is shown in eq 3 for the cis dce reaction term similar reaction terms for the other species which have been used in previous work such as that by bagley 1998 or cupples et al 2004b can be found in the supporting information section s 7 in eq 3 cis dce is formed biologically from reaction of tce with either acetate or hydrogen the first three terms is degraded biologically with hydrogen to form vc the fourth term and reacts abiotically to form acetylene last term d effdce is the effective diffusion coefficient r uttce and r utdce are the maximum utilization rates k tce k dce and k h2 are the half saturation constants and k abiodce is the pseudo first order rate constant two biological communities for tce are indicated the x1 community represents the concentration of cells that use both acetate and hydrogen as electron donors for the first dechlorination reaction and x2 represents the concentration of cells that use hydrogen only for all three dechlorinations an initial concentration of cells throughout the lpz was assumed and the model allowed for cell growth and decay over time maximum specific growth rates and decay

summarized in fig 3 and the initial conditions for all species are zero concentration in the lpz matrix the tce concentration was set equal to its aqueous solubility limit 9 74 mm at the base of the lpz and acetate and hydrogen were held constant at the lpz hpz interface their values were determined from the hpz effluent data and electron donor balance calculations both included in section s 6 of the supporting information the bcs for all other compounds at the lpz hpz interface were set to zero based on the assumption that flow in the hpz is fast residence time is 35 h relative to diffusion time scales in the lpz days to weeks for tce and its products the bcs for other chlorinated compounds at the base of the lpz were set to zero assuming tenax acts as a sink zero flux bcs were used for ethene acetylene and acetate at the base of the lpz which is based on the assumption that these compounds do not sorb to tenax parameters used in the model are in table s 8 1 of supporting information and biological parameters fall in the range of previously reported parameters table s 8 2 the abiotic rate constant for cis dce in the model was assumed to be 1 10th of the tce rate constant per batch experiment data and the first order rate constant for acetylene conversion to ethene kacetylene for fe oxides from jeong et al 2007 was used model validation was done using an analytical solution for diffusion and reaction validation results are included in the supporting information fig s 7 1 and confidence intervals were determined for each of the seven fitting parameters indicated in table s 8 1 to gain an understanding of model sensitivity to these fitting parameters the model was simulated for 180 days the same length of time the experiment was conducted 3 results and interpretation 3 1 batch experiments batch experiments for the clay or lpz were conducted to evaluate the potential for abiotic transformation of tce initial tests with the sand data not included here showed that it was less reactive than the clay i e initial half life t1 2 sand 7 t1 2clay with the sand showing decreased acetylene production after 30 days the relative inactivity of the sand is due to its lower ferrous iron concentration 746 mg kg for the sand as opposed to 2625 mg kg for the clay results for batch experiments containing pease clay spiked with either tce or cis dce are shown in fig 4 the molar fraction of the initial tce or cis dce reduced to acetylene increases linearly for up to 100 days the rate of acetylene production from cis dce is approximately 1 10th the rate from tce the tce and cis dce reduction rate constants were rescaled to match the estimated solid water ratio in the flow cell and results are listed in fig 4 as knorm this was done by dividing kbatch by the solid water ratio gsolid lwater in the batch experiments and multiplying by the solid water ratio in the flow cell determined from clay density and water content after the flow cell experiment in fig 4 the data are presented as a mole ratio of acetylene mass produced to initial tce or dce mass present when this ratio is small a regression of the data in fig 4 gives the pseudo first order rate constant this is summarized in eqs 4 and 5 4 ln 1 m acet m initial k batch t 5 ln 1 m acet m initial m acet m initial pseudo first order kinetics were assumed based on previous studies he et al 2015 schaefer et al 2017 2013 zero order kinetics also fit the data but controls indicated acetylene production depended on the presence of tce or cis dce the kinetics are assumed to be pseudo first order because the reactive minerals are assumed to never limit the reaction during the time period of study these results confirmed those from a previous study that showed that a similar pease clay sample promotes tce abiotic reduction via β elimination to produce acetylene schaefer et al 2018 that study reports slower rates however which may be due to higher initial loading of initial tce and langmuir type sorption to reaction sites results herein also showed that a natural clay can promote abiotic cis dce transformation to acetylene via β elimination albeit at a much slower rate than tce this expands on previous work which showed that other minerals and metals can facilitate the reaction of cis dce to acetylene and ethene arnold and roberts 2000 lee and batchelor 2002a b jeong et al 2007 small amounts of ethane propane and butane were also produced but at concentrations at least one order of magnitude less than acetylene data not shown methane also increased in the batch experiments on the same order of magnitude as acetylene but had more variability data not shown 3 2 flow cell experiment the flow cell effluent data shown in fig 5 is expressed as mass discharge rate mass time of tce and its reaction products over 180 days the tce decreased to below detection levels in the first 30 days the cis dce rapidly increased during this same time and then reached an approximately steady value of 6 1 μmol day after 40 days this value is close to the expected mass discharge rate of tce 8 μmol day into the hpz if it was diffusing without reaction from saturation conditions at the bottom of the clay to an approximately zero concentration boundary at the lpz hpz interface suggesting that almost all of the tce was being converted to cis dce in the lpz before diffusing into the overlying hpz near 80 days there was an increase in vc and near 110 days there was an increase in ethene the vc mass discharge rate almost reached the level of cis dce but appeared to plateau near 140 days the sum of cis dce and vc mass discharge rate remains 8 μmol day after days the ethene increased over 20 days and then stayed relatively constant and at a low concentration after 130 days acetylene mass discharge was observed over the entire experiment at a low rate of 2 5 10 3 μmol day this represented 0 04 of the maximum possible tce mass discharge rate from the lpz assuming the aforementioned boundary conditions and no tce reaction and indicates abiotic reduction of tce and or dce was sustained but low during the study period the presence of acetylene throughout the experiment and potential inhibition pon et al 2003 may explain the persistence of vc and slower ethene production during the last 40 days of the experiment no lactate was measured in the flow cell effluent after the first week instead propionate and acetate were measured fig s 6 1 lactate is known to ferment and oxidize to acetate propionate and hydrogen the propionate and acetate levels measured matched those expected for complete lactate fermentation and oxidation to these products detailed calculations are included in the supporting information section s 6 the flow rate through the hpz was doubled at approximately 130 days and there was no significant impact on chlorinated ethene or acetylene mass discharge rate this indicates that the approximately zero concentration boundary assumed for chlorinated ethenes at the lpz hpz interface is correct and that the reactions of interest are occurring in the lpz rather than the hpz due to the very short residence time in the latter depth profiles of the chlorinated ethenes and reduced gases in the lpz at the conclusion of the experiment are shown in fig 6 where the clay extends from zero bottom to 8 cm lpz hpz interface and samples closest to the bottom start at 1 cm to avoid artifacts from tenax the tce concentration is high at the base of the flow cell and low at the interface this is expected because the source of tce is on tenax beads at the base cis dce increases in concentration close to 7 cm and vc has a peak closer to 7 5 cm these peaks are likely due to the availability of acetate and hydrogen closer to the interface acetylene like tce is higher at the lpz base and low near the interface indicating its transformation does not depend on the electron donor the results indicate that acetylene production is directly related to the tce concentration but not a strong function of cis dce concentration this makes sense as acetylene production rates knorm from cis dce are only 1 10th of those from tce and tce is present at much higher concentrations than cis dce in the flow cell in contrast to chlorinated compounds and acetylene the ethene concentration profile shows two regions of higher concentration one near the lpz hpz interface and another toward the lpz base the ethene concentration peak at the lpz hpz interface is expected as a dechlorination product of vc the ethene concentration increase near the lpz base is expected if acetylene undergoes hydrogenation to ethene hence ethene production appears to be coming from both vc and acetylene depth profiles for four other reduced gases were measured that are strikingly similar to ethene they are ethane propylene propane propyne hence they too appear to be produced from both vc and acetylene this finding suggests that we could be underestimating the amount of abiotic tce reduction in natural systems by ignoring quantification of reduced gas transformation products nevertheless when accounting for the mass of all the reduced gas transformation products the abiotic products are still orders of magnitude less than the biotic products the last gas measured was methane and its depth profile only peaks near the lpz hpz interface this is likely due to tce controlling the reducing conditions deeper in the clay profile conditions may be more reducing near the interface where tce does not dominate allowing for more methanogenesis also the methane concentration profile peak coincides with the highest concentrations of electron donor this makes sense because lactate is introduced in the hpz and its fermentation products diffuse into the top of the clay at the interface 8 cm 3 3 flow cell model the 1d diffusion reaction model was used to simulate flow cell results parameter values were adjusted to match both the time dependent effluent data from zero to 180 days as well as the depth profiles at 180 days the maximum specific growth rate and biomass decay constant were initially fit to the effluent data as they were more sensitive to the temporal changes further fitting was done using depth profile data for the maximum utilization rates for the two dechlorinating communities as well as the first order rate constant for the elimination reaction of tce to acetylene the fitting was optimized for the depth profiles to minimize the sum of the residual squared error srse the error was not minimized for the effluent mass discharge rate a complete list of model parameters is included in table s 8 1 additionally table s 8 2 compares monod kinetic parameters fit in this study with those of previous studies in most cases parameter values from this study are in the range of those in the literature model generated mass discharge rates are compared to effluent data in fig 5 the model profiles generally capture the experimental data trends but do not always match their values the experimental tce data points at early time are not captured by the model based on expected tce transport rates tce mass discharge rate should not have exceeded 0 1 μmol day until day 10 if the initial tce concentration in the lpz is zero this indicates that tce in the pore water adjacent to the tenax beads likely mixed throughout the lpz depth during flow cell packing leading to early time hpz breakthrough from the lpz the experimental cis dce trends are well captured by the model the upward trends of the experimental vc and ethene data points also are captured by the model but the former are characterized by sharp increases after 80 and 100 days respectively while the model profiles increase more gradually the mass discharge rate of acetylene is over predicted by the model which may be due to subsequent acetylene degradation that could not be completely accounted for in the model model profiles are compared to depth profiles in fig 6 and results show good agreement the model profiles match the general shapes and magnitudes of most species these profiles modestly underestimate or overestimate experimental cis dce and vc data points at various depths and do not capture the extent of the decrease in ethene near the center the model appears to represent the acetylene depth profile well despite failing to adequately describe the acetylene effluent data model outputs for donors and microbial community concentration are included in figs s 9 1 and s 9 2 in the supporting information generally community x1 has a higher initial biomass and dominates at early time but after a few months community x2 makes a larger contribution to the effluent and profile behavior one indication of this is the inflection point in vc and ethene around 150 days in fig 5 it is also important to note that the abiotic rate constants that fit the batch experiment data are greater by more than an order of magnitude than the rate constants that satisfy the flow cell depth profile data table 1 the abiotic tce transformation rate constant determined in batch is 13 times greater than the rate constant determined in the flow cell some possible reasons for this discrepancy are 1 abiotic processes are diffusion limited in the flow cell 2 the abiotic processes are limited by biotic competition for tce 3 acetylene produced is further transformed to other reduced gases or 4 the mass loading of tce influences rate constants with lower rates observed at higher tce loading the fourth option would indicate that uptake of tce onto reactive mineral surfaces may be described by a langmuir surface site model previous work by schaefer et al 2018 utilizing the same clay at a higher tce loading in batch experiments showed a tce to acetylene rate constant of 3 1 10 5 1 day which compares well with the abiotic rate constant for tce to acetylene fit in the flow cell this makes sense as the tce concentrations near the tce source on tenax see fig 2 were more similar to the concentrations used in batch in the study by schaefer et al 2018 the differences between the model and the data could also be influenced by different types of inhibition ex redox inhibition more chlorinated compounds inhibiting transformation of less chlorinated compounds yu et al 2005 or acetylene inhibiting dechlorination pon et al 2003 the inhibition of more chlorinated compounds on less chlorinated compound transformation was considered but did not significantly improve the model fit it was not included in the model fitting and simulations in order to reduce model complexity figs s 9 4 and s 9 5 in the supporting information show profiles with inhibition included inconsistencies may also exist because of assumptions made about the use of electron donor hydrogen produced from propionate was not considered competition for acetate and hydrogen by non dechlorinating organisms was not considered in the lpz and calculations show that the electron donor utilized by iron reducing organisms could have been relevant during the first couple weeks of the flow cell experiment a more complex model including all these processes could potentially fit the experimental data better but increasing the complexity also increases the number of parameters and unknowns capturing all the biological processes in the mixed community potentially resulting in different donor gradients or other undetected species was outside of the scope of this work future work may focus on further characterizing the microbial community dynamics supported with data from dna extractions to look at the spatial distribution of the microbial community 3 4 field scale implications the 1d model with parameter values estimated from flow cell experimental data was used to simulate back diffusion and reaction from a lpz at a representative field site while the model does not appear to account for all reaction mechanisms affecting the fate of tce and its transformation products it does approximately capture the dominant reactants and products as well as the relevant time scales of reaction to better represent the conditions at a field site that is experiencing back diffusion the initial conditions and boundary conditions for tce were modified from the conditions used to model the flow cell the initial tce profile was determined from boring wcp 70 at an industrial site in connecticut fig 7c where samples were taken in the late 1990s parker et al 2004 based on boring wcp 70 the lpz thickness is 300 cm for the simulation it is assumed that there is no tce initially in the hpz and flow in the hpz is fast relative to diffusion in the lpz tce boundary conditions at the lpz hpz interface and base of the domain are zero concentration and zero flux respectively simulations were run for 365 days 1 year to evaluate biotic and abiotic reaction contributions to chlorinated ethene fluxes from the lpz model results showing fluxes of tce cis 1 2 dce vc ethene and acetylene from the lpz to the hpz are presented in fig 7 with amended lactate abiotic biotic simulation fluxes of chlorinated ethenes decrease at least five orders of magnitude to 10 4 μmol day cm2 after 300 days and cis dce and vc are released into the hpz for a period of approximately 220 days before ethene dominates the fluxes fig 7a in contrast without amended lactate the tce flux decreases less than two orders of magnitude to 1 17 10 1 μmol day cm2 after 365 days and this decrease is mostly due to diffusion the small inset in the upper right of fig 7b shows the abiotic contribution to decreasing flux near the end of the simulation which is minimal using the abiotic rate constant from the flow cell experiments as expected the flux of acetylene in the presence of lactate at 365 days 4 16 10 4 μmol day cm2 is less than when lactate is absent 6 81 10 4 μmol day cm2 this is because abiotic processes are first order with respect to tce concentration and tce concentrations are higher in the absence of lactate the continued increase in ethene in the absence of electron donor is due to the first order reaction of acetylene to ethene that was included in the model further analysis would be necessary to fully understand the fate and transport of the different species released into the hpz in addition to the abiotic simulation with the rate constant determined from the flow cell two more simulations were conducted to evaluate fluxes from the lpz in the absence of an electron donor in one simulation the abiotic batch rate constant of 3 23 10 4 1 day was used and in another simulation a rate constant of 1 04 10 3 1 day was used which represents a highly reactive pyrite rich mudstone schaefer et al 2013 simulations for all three rate constants are shown in fig 8 over a two year period 730 days flux simulation results are presented as a percent reduction in tce flux from the diffusion only case after 730 days tce fluxes determined using the rate constant of 2 50 10 5 1 day showed a tce flux reduction of only 2 however after 730 days with rate constants of 3 23 10 4 1 day batch fit and 1 04 10 3 1 day pyrite rich mudstone the tce flux reductions were 21 and 53 respectively in the presence of highly reactive minerals abiotic reactions can have a significant impact on tce flux values from lpzs though most subsurface low permeability environments do not consist of a pyrite rich mudstone this analysis shows that materials other than the clay used in this study may have a greater potential to abiotically decrease chlorinated ethene flux from lpzs there may be issues with some assumptions implied in this simulation such as constant mineral reactivity over time but it is still useful to consider how more reactive mineral species could maintain faster reaction rates for longer periods of time 4 conclusions in an lpz hpz system with a natural clay a healthy dechlorinating community and access to electron donors the abiotic contributions to tce transformation were relatively small compared to the biotic contributions depth profiles through the lpz in the flow cell experiment showed that cis dce and vc production were greater near the interface of the flow cell indicating that the biotic processes are more important near the electron donor source the depth profiles also showed higher concentrations of acetylene near the base of the depth profile where the tce was highest indicating that abiotic degradation of tce to acetylene was occurring simultaneously but contributing much less to total tce mass reduction a 1d diffusion reaction model was able to adequately capture these depth profiles and the time scales of dominant products and reactants in the flow cell effluent however it failed to capture the magnitude of some product mass discharge rates additional complexities could be added to the model to improve its capabilities albeit with more model parameters many lpz environments contaminated with tce may not have a dechlorinating community and electron donor present in those environments it is important to consider the contribution of abiotic reactions to acetylene and other reduced gases when estimating natural attenuation based on our simulation for a 300 cm lpz the reactive minerals in a natural clay could decrease the tce flux to hpzs by 2 53 after 2 years depending on the reactive minerals and their rate constants it is difficult to evaluate the contributions of abiotic reactions in mitigating long term chlorinated ethene flux without site specific data therefore the reactivity of subsurface materials should be screened for reactive mineral species at sites with limited biotic transformation potential it may be informative to do regular dissolved gas sampling despite challenges with gas sampling and expenses involved with cryogenic cores measurements of acetylene and other reduced gases such as methane ethene ethane propylene propane propyne and butane could allow for a better understanding of abiotic transformation pathways future work related to abiotic degradation of tce could make use of radiolabeled carbon to gain better insight into the production of ethane and coupling reactions that produce c3 and c4 products also aerobic abiotic tce degradation at the lpz hpz interface needs to be explored more oxygenated hpzs are often adjacent to anaerobic lpzs promoting an oxygen gradient through the lpz and allowing tce degradation to small organic acids and carbon dioxide aerobic abiotic reactions could also have a significant influence on the mass of tce fluxing into hpzs finally more work is needed to better understand how biotic and abiotic transformation pathways enhance and limit one another microorganisms may participate in cycling reactive minerals or mineral species may promote reducing environments that further promote biological reductive dechlorination as these processes become better understood we will be able to more accurately estimate the timescale and magnitude of natural attenuation processes and ultimately inform decision
