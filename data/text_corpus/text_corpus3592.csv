17960,the increasing global occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms attributed primarily to human induced nutrient enrichment significantly degrades freshwater ecosystems and poses serious risks to human health the current study examined environmental variables and cyanobacterial biovolume bcyano of 28 shallow lakes in the eastern china plains during the spring and summer of 2018 we used a 95 quantile regression model to explore season specific response of bcyano to total nitrogen tn or total phosphorus tp and robust linear relationships were observed between log bcyano 0 001 and log tn or log tp in both spring and summer periods based on these regressions regional scale and season specific tn and tp thresholds are proposed for these lakes to ensure the safety for recreational waters and drinking water source however actual bcyano for a given concentration of tn or tp for many observations were considerably lower than the results of the 95 regression model predict indicating that other factors significantly modulated nutrient limitation of bcyano generalized additive model and quantile regression model were used together to explore potentially significant modulating factors of which lake retention time macrophytes cover and n p ratio were identified as most important thus it is necessary to develop type specific nutrient thresholds with the consideration of these significant modulating factors furthermore nutrient bcyano relationships of our studied lakes with lake retention time 100 days and no macrophyte were further explored and nutrient thresholds of this lake type were proposed nutrient thresholds proposed in this study may play an essential role in achieving a cost effective eutrophication management for shallow lakes both in the eastern china plains and elsewhere with similar climatic background on a broader scale the approaches and findings of this study may provide valuable reference to formulate reasonable nutrient reduction targets for other

invertebrates and fishes huisman et al 2018 le moal et al 2019 toxins associated with cyanobacterial blooms also pose a range of risks to human health from mild skin irritations to digestive stress liver disease impairment of neurological function and even death codd et al 2005 giani et al 2005 there is strong evidence that cyanobacterial blooms are increasing in frequency and intensity in lakes and reservoirs worldwide hallegraeff 1993 qin et al 2010 ho et al 2019 resulting in a pressing need for knowledge as to when and where such events are likely to occur and to what extent management can mitigate the problems they cause it is widely believed that cyanobacterial blooms are driven mainly by human induced nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus over enrichment beaulieu et al 2013 carvalho et al 2013 paerl and otten 2013 studies exploring the quantitative responses of cyanobacteria to nutrient enrichment have therefore been a key aspect of eutrophication management in recent decades most of these studies focus on the relationship between cyanobacterial dominance abundance and nutrient levels smith 1986 ptacnik et al 2008 wagner and adrian 2009 while relatively few studies consider the response of actual cyanobacterial biovolume bcyano to nutrient enrichment despite this being more relevant to the health and functioning of aquatic ecosystems dolman et al 2012 carvalho et al 2013 of these few studies majority have been based on a statistical approach of data averaging followed by ordinary least squares regression olsr model smith 1986 downing et al 2001 lars et al 2007 however olsr derived models are unlikely to yield meaningful results if datasets exhibit a wedge shaped scatter of points which indicates that cause effect relationships are confounded by stressors other than nutrient levels cade and noon 2003 philips et al 2019 the relationship between chlorophyll a chla and total phosphorus tp is one example ideally a robust linear relationship between log chla and log tp would be observed if algal growth was primarily limited by tp fig 1 a however in winter observations chla exhibited insensitive response to tp due to the considerably modulating effect of temperature as a result olsr derived model tend to exhibit large uncertainty where the datasets include winter observations fig 1b therefore to explore the essential relationship between chla and tp it might be more appropriate to regard nutrients as an upper limit for chla and to apply instead a 95 quantile regression model cade and noon 2003 xu et al 2015a b in shallow lakes there are number of regional scale factors e g flushing in addition to temperature that may interact significantly with nutrient limitation to exert a modulating effect on cyanobacterial growth during growing seasons liu et al 2016 qin et al 2020 this suggests that more specific information regarding ecological background of individual lakes may be necessary in order to contextualize monitoring data and establish cost effective nutrient reduction targets however for developing world e g china the vast majority of current lake nutrient management strategies are based on very general criteria china state environmental protection administration 2002 a practice may easily lead to over or under protection of individual lakes xu et al 2015a identification and quantification of significant modulating factors will help identify which lakes are more susceptible to cyanobacterial blooms under nutrient enrichment process and provide important information for lake subdivision and development of type specific nutrient reduction target in this study environmental variables and phytoplankton samples were collected from 28 subtropical temperate shallow lakes in the eastern china plains during spring and summer of 2018 fig 2 our objectives were 1 to explore the season specific maximal 95 quantiles and average responses of bcyano to total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp using 95 quantile regression and olsr derived models 2 to quantify the effect of hydromorphological and biogeochemical background on nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria during the growing periods and identify the significant modulating factors and 3 to provide useful information for the development of cost effective nutrient reduction targets for lakes both in our studied ecoregion and elsewhere we hypothesized that while nutrient levels may define the growth potential of bcyano in growing seasons in most cases this potential would not be reached because of other modulating and controlling factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we conducted our study in the eastern china plains which is across the subtropical and warm temperature zone wang and dou 1998 this ecoregion comprises a vast area of floodplain along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river plain and downstream of the huai river plain which are the most densely populated and agricultural productive region of china ma et al 2010 the total area of natural lakes larger than 1 km2 in the ecoregion is 21 053 km2 accounting for 25 9 of total freshwater lake area in china ma et al 2010 and lake area varied greatly in this ecoregion for lake depth these lakes are very shallow generally 1 5 m and exhibit intensive wind induced resuspension of sediment hamilton and mitchell 1996 huo et al 2013 in addition yangtze river connected lakes and some lakes in the huai river basin were observed with rapid flushing while the rest of them e g yangtze river isolated lakes tend to have longer residence time wang and dou 1998 in the past several decades the anthropogenic activities including urbanization agriculture aquaculture and industrial development have led to declines in water quality ma et al 2010 human induced nutrient enrichment and its associated cyanobacterial blooms are key environmental concerns and challenges facing local governments le et al 2010 shi et al 2015 duan et al 2017 2 2 data acquisition environmental variables and phytoplankton samples were collected from 28 shallow lakes 184 sites in the eastern china plains during summer months 2018 fig 2 moreover 27 shallow lakes 169 sites were investigated in spring months 2018 and shijiu lake number 19 in fig 2 was not sampled due to very low water depth on each sampling site water depth wd and secchi depth sd were measured using a speedtech sm 5 portable depth sounder and secchi disk and macrophytes cover mc was estimated in situ water temperature wt ph and electric conductivity ec of the upper 0 5 m of the water column were measured with an ysi 6600 v2 multi sensor sonde additional water samples were collected within 50 cm of the surface for chemical analysis in the laboratory total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp and chla were determined according to standard methods apha 2012 the suspended solids in quantified water samples were collected on 0 70 Î¼m porosity membrane filters whatman gf f with tared weight 1 w1 and combusted in a muffle furnace 550 c for 4 h to determine ash free weight inorganic suspended solids iss were derived by subtraction from values for pre and post filtered samples phytoplankton were sampled within 50 cm of the surface and fixed with lugol s iodine solution 1 v v followed by 48 h settling apha 2012 cell density was counted directly in a 0 1 ml counting chamber using an olympus bx53 microscope at 400 magnification the taxonomic identification of algae and the calculation of bcyano were conducted according to hu and wei 2007 lake retention times lrt were acquired from previously published data for some lakes lrt are readily available in the literatures wang and dou 1998 cai et al 2012 liu et al 2016 while for others the lrt were calculated previous studies demonstrated that the ratio of average annual precipitation in the basin to lake volume was significantly correlated with lrt calculated the traditional way i e by dividing lake volume by flow in or out of the lake the equation was expressed as y 0 25x 25 38 r2 0 99 p 0 001 n 27 where y is the ratio of average annual precipitation in the basin to lake volume and x represents lrt calculated by the traditional method ranging from 18 to 13977 days shi et al 2018 in most cases average annual precipitation in the basin and lake volume could be obtained from the literature wang and dou 1998 but there remained four lakes in this study including wuchang east lake number 6 in fig 2 wushan lake number 9 in fig 2 zhu lake number 12 in fig 2 and huangda lake number 14 in fig 2 for which the lrt values are not available hence the four lakes were removed in the later difference analysis and generalized additive model analysis 2 3 statistical analysis 2 3 1 difference analysis and regression models the temporal differences between environmental variables and bcyano were tested using pared sample t test both olsr derived and quantile regression models were used to explore relationships between bcyano and nutrient levels tn or tp the quantile regression model can be viewed as an extension of classical least squares estimation of conditional mean models to estimate an ensemble of models for several conditional quantile functions cade and noon 2003 recognizing that certain undetermined factors may limit the accuracy of bcyano values estimated from nutrient levels cade and noon 2003 carvalho et al 2013 95 quantile regression model was used to explore the response of cyanobacteria to nutrient enrichment under ideal conditions where cyanobacterial growth was limited primarily by tn or tp the difference analysis and olsr derived models were performed using spss 19 0 and the 95 quantile regression model were conducted with the quantreg package of r software 2 3 2 generalized additive model the generalized additive model gam is an analysis which assumes that the response variable for covariates depends on smoothing splines rather than linear coefficients hastie and tibshirani 1987 in this study gam was used to identify the factors that significantly modulated tn or tp limitation of cyanobacterial growth in spring and summer we assumed that the response of bcyano to tn or tp under ideal conditions in which cyanobacterial growth is limited primarily by tn or tp could be quantified using the 95 quantile regression model meanwhile on a regional scale other factors e g lrt may have a significantly modulating effect on the nutrient limitation of cyanobacterial growth even during the growing season liu et al 2016 as a result the actual values of bcyano at a given tn or tp concentration may exhibit considerable difference compared to those derived from the 95 quantile regression model this difference deemed to reflect the total modulating effect of the other factors on the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria fig 3 was used as a response variable y in the gam analysis in this study we explored season specific spring and summer responses of bcyano to nutrient levels tn and tp theoretically there are four distinctive response y1 y4 variables for the analysis of gam y1 is the difference between the expected bcyano derived from 95 quantile regression at a given tn concentration and actual bcyano in spring y2 is the difference between expected bcyano derived from 95 quantile regression at a given tp concentration and actual bcyano in spring y3 is the difference between expected bcyano from 95 quantile regression at a given tn and actual bcyano in summer and y4 is the difference between expected bcyano from 95 quantile regression at a given tp and actual bcyano in summer to our knowledge wd is closely related with sediment resuspension hamilton and mitchell 1996 thus it may interfere the nutrient cyanobacteria relationships by indirectly influencing underwater light conditions bioavailability of nutrient to phytoplankton lind 1986 havens et al 2001 for similar reason iss content is likely to affect cyanobacterial response to nutrient dzialowski et al 2011 as to lrt previous studies showed that rapid flushing can directly inhibit the algal response to nutrient input reynolds 2006 liu et al 2016 in addition previous study showed that in lakes with high n p ratio insignificant relationships between chla and tn have been observed thus we hypothesize that nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria may also be modulated by lrt and n p ratio nÃµges et al 2008 carvalho et al 2011 as to biological variables macrophytes is most likely to affect nutrient cyanobacteria relationships nakai et al 2000 therefore these five variables were considered as explanatory variables in gam analysis to identify those which exerted significant influence on the nutrient cyanobacteria relationships i e variations in the total modulating effect limited multiple collinearity was observed between the five explanatory variables indicated by very low value of variance inflation factor 2 the analysis of gam using all explanatory variables mentioned above were performed four times namely y1 wd lrt iss n p mc y2 wd lrt iss n p mc y3 wd lrt iss n p mc and y4 wd lrt iss n p mc and p 0 05 of an explanatory variable e g lrt indicated the flushing have significantly modulated the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria moreover the r2 adjusted were also used to identify significant modulating factors in our study the analysis of gam was thus performed using each single explanatory variable the estimated degrees of freedom edf used to determine the amount of smoothing for each explanatory variable were automatically selected by the model fitting procedure using restricted maximum likelihood hastie and tibshirani 1990 before analysis of regression and gam values for bcyano and mc were log10 transformed with an additional small arbitrary constant of 0 001 to eliminate zeros before transformation and the remaining variables were log10 transformed straightforwardly gam was performed using the mgcv package of r software 2 4 bcyano thresholds of recreational waters and drinking water source in our study the nutrient thresholds of shallow lakes were calculated based on cyanobacterial abundance targets established for recreational waters and drinking water source in the eastern china plains in recreational waters cyanobacterial cell densities of 20 000 and 100 000 cells ml 1 are considered to pose a low and moderate risk to health respectively associated with symptoms such as skin irritations and gastrointestinal illness bartram et al 1999 who 2003 we adopted these thresholds and multiplied the cell densities by a typical cyanobacterial cell volume assuming a spherical cell with a diameter of 5 7 Î¼m to achieve equivalent biovolumes of 2 mm3 l 1 and 10 mm3 l 1 bartram et al 1999 as to drinking water source thresholds of cyanobacterial cell densities were proposed by burch 1993 bartram et al 1999 and again by house et al 2004 in this most recent revision thresholds of cell densities of 2000 and 5000 cells ml 1 the equivalent biovolumes of 0 2 mm3 l 1 and 0 5 mm3 l 1 amount to low and moderate health risk for drinking water source and were used in the current study 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics of nutrient and bcyano in spring the wt of our study lakes ranged from 13 80 to 25 24 c with an average value of 20 63 2 57 c average values of tn tdn tp and tdp in this season were 1 73 0 91 mg l 1 1 38 0 83 mg l 1 94 59 68 70 Î¼g l 1 and 44 03 32 29 Î¼g l 1 respectively in summer significantly higher p 0 001 wt were observed with average values of 30 31 1 54 c tdn values were significantly p 0 001 lower than in spring averaging 0 97 0 65 mg l 1 while tp increased by about 30 from spring to summer p 0 03 no significant seasonal differences were observed in tn and tdp p 0 05 but the average bcyano increased considerably p 0 001 from 0 51 2 16 mm3 l 1 in spring to 3 14 11 62 mm3 l 1 in summer table 1 more details of the season specific nutrient levels and bcyano as well as other important variables i e lake area wd lrt sd ec iss and chla of each lake are provided in table s1 3 2 regression analysis between bcyano and nutrient concentrations a significant positive linear relationship was observed between log bcyano 0 001 and log tn or log tp based on the 95 quantile regression model for both spring and summer datasets p 0 001 these regression lines exhibited a relatively high determination coefficient r2 range from 0 49 to 0 52 implying that both tn and tp limit the maximum capacity of bcyano for the shallow lakes in spring and summer as expected a wedge shaped scatter of points between log bcyano 0 001 and log tn or log tp was observed in both two growing seasons meanwhile olsr derived regression lines exhibited with low r2 in addition for most sites in both growing seasons considerable differences were observed between actual bcyano values at a given tn or tp and those derived from the 95 quantile regression model fig 4 3 3 identification of the modulating factors for spring observations the gam using all selected explanatory variables explained 51 3 of deviance in y1 r2 adjusted 0 45 n 169 and 58 1 of deviance in y2 r2 adjusted 0 52 n 169 respectively moreover lrt iss n p ratio and mc were identified as significant explanatory variables in both models p 0 01 in terms of summer observations the gam using all possible explanatory variables explained 68 7 of deviance in y3 r2 adjusted 0 66 n 184 and 58 1 of deviance in y4 r2 adjusted 0 55 n 184 respectively correspondingly the results of gam analysis indicated that lrt and n p ratio were the significant modulating factors p 0 05 table 2 the results of gam analysis incorporating single explanatory variable for spring observations showed that the lrt accounted for the largest variations in y1 r2 adjusted 0 30 followed by mc r2 adjusted 0 06 for y2 lrt also exhibited largest accountability for its variations r2 adjusted 0 28 n p ratio and mc accounted for relatively low variations in y2 with the r2 adjusted of 0 13 and 0 09 respectively as to summer datasets the results of gam analysis incorporating single explanatory variable showed that more than half variations of y3 was accounted by lrt r2 adjusted 0 64 and n p ratio also accounted for relatively high variations in y2 with the r2 adjusted of 0 25 for y4 lrt also exhibited largest accountability for its variations r2 adjusted 0 33 followed by n p ratio with r2 adjusted of 0 09 table 3 on the other hand the sites with short lrt were generally associated with high values of y1 y2 y3 and y4 in contrast higher values of y1 and y2 were observed in the sites with abundant mc as to n p ratio on the whole this variable exhibited positive relationships with y1 or y3 in contrast negative relationships were observed between n p ratio and y2 or y4 in addition our results also showed linear negative correlation between iss content and y1 or y2 fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 the nutrient limitation of bcyano and potential modulating factors studies exploring the responses of actual bcyano to nutrient enrichment mostly conducted on small number of lakes as a result the nutrient abundance was generally considered to be the single dominant limiting factor for cyanobacterial growth for these lakes and robust nutrient bcyano relationships r2 0 50 0 70 derived from olsr model were observed smith 1985 1990 trimbee and prepas 1987 dzialowski et al 2011 in current region scale study however olsr derived models between log bcyano 0 001 and log tn or log tp exhibited very low r2 in contrast robust linear responses of log bcyano 0 001 to log tn or log tp were observed using 95 quantile regression model for both spring and summer observations p 0 001 these results indicate that nutrient levels tn and tp set the maximal capacity of bcyano in our study lakes on the other hand actual bcyano at a given tn or tp were considerably lower than those derived from the 95 quantile regression model in both spring and summer pointing to a significant modulation of cyanobacterial growth by other factors based on the results of gam analysis we verified that lrt is the most significant factor modulating tn or tp limitations of cyanobacteria in our study lakes tables 2 and 3 in fact it is well known that short lrt can suppress algal blooms by flushing biomass before the standing crop reaches the maximum permitted by the available nutrient dillon 1975 however a total absence of bcyano was recorded in the most study sites with lrt less than 35 days such as yangtze river connected lakes upper quartile 0 fig 6 indicating that rapid flushing may especially suppresses cyanobacterial growth previous studies have demonstrated that small phytoplankton cells tend to dominate the community in rapid flushing lakes dickman 1969 bailey watts et al 2010 providing a possible explanation for much greater controls of cyanobacteria compared to fast growing diatoms small chlorophytes and flagellates overall bloom forming cyanobacteria have relatively slow reproductive rates which in such cases are not sufficient to compensate for removal by flushing reynolds 2006 in contrast to lrt wd was not identified as significant explanatory variable in any of the gam analysis table 2 this may be because the range of wd in the studied shallow lakes is small table s1 our results also indicated that n p ratio has significantly modulated the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria tables 2 and 3 both in spring and summer specifically bcyano response to tn or tp would be closer to the lines derived from 95 quantile regressions with decrease of n p ratio or with increase of n p ratio fig 5 these results are reasonable because both tn and tp co limited cyanobacterial growth in our study lakes take the response of bcyano to tp as an example increasing n p ratio indicates that cyanobacterial growth is more likely to be limited by tp therefore the bcyano theoretically exhibit higher utilization efficiency of tp and the difference between actual bcyano and those derived from the 95 quantile regression models at a given tp would decrease with the increase of n p ratio furthermore the gam analysis tables 2 and 3 indicated that in spring mc exerted significant p 0 05 effect on the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria and boxplot analysis upper quartile 0 fig 6 revealed that cyanobacterial response to nutrient were considerably suppressed in the sites with abundant macrophytes the mechanisms for this inhibitive effect may include shading allelopathy and increasing grazing pressure as abundant macrophytes beds can provide shelter for large zooplankton nakai et al 2000 pakdel et al 2013 by contrast no macrophytes were observed in the majority of our sampling sites during summer due to the massive mortality of the spring predominating macrophytes species i e potamogeton crispus cao et al 2018 as a result insignificant p 0 05 effect of mc on nutrient cyanobacteria relationships were observed as the small range of mc in terms of non algal turbidity analysis of gam also indicated that in spring cyanobacteria exhibited more sensitive response to tn or tp when higher iss content were recorded to our knowledge however high iss content can reduce water transparency brezonik et al 2019 causing photoinhibition in cyanobacterial growth lind 1986 moreover increased iss often represents a high proportion of particulate nutrient with relatively low bioavailability havens et al 2001 chung et al 2009 correspondingly previous studies have demonstrated that cyanobacterial biomass in sites with high iss contents are less responsive to nutrient enrichment smith 1990 dzialowski et al 2011 we suggest that the contrasting current results may be because that the sites with low iss content were typically associated with abundant macrophytes the influence of macrophytes may be sufficient to account for the larger difference between actual bcyano and that predicted for a given a tn or tp by the 95 quantile regression model in sites with lower iss content in spring thus iss may in essence exert limited effect on nutrient cyanobacteria relationships in shallow lakes in contrast as the decline of macrophytes p crispus in summer iss alone was not identified as significant modulating factor because its values remained generally high and exhibited relatively small gradients in shallow lakes hamilton and mitchell 1996 4 2 implications for nutrient management the fundamental question in nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus management is the extent to which variations will promote good ecological status or reduce the potential threat to human health poikane et al 2019 thus the thresholds of bcyano for safe recreational waters and drinking water source were used to derive nutrient reduction targets however the wedge shaped scatter points on a plot of bcyano and nutrient levels i e tn and tp indicate that the traditional binary regression lines based on olsr derived model are of limited relevance for nutrient management our results support that the 95 quantile regression model may be more suitable for exploring the essential response of bcyano to nutrient levels cade and noon 2003 philips et al 2019 in addition the results using 95 quantile regression model demonstrated robust linear relationships between log bcyano 1 and log tn or log tp in both spring and summer suggesting that reductions in both n and p are needed to control cyanobacterial blooms in shallow lakes xu et al 2014 paerl et al 2016 thus to ensure the safety for recreational waters and drinking water source of our study lakes regional specific and season specific thresholds for tn and tp thresholds were established based these 95 quantile regression models table 4 bartram et al 1999 who 2003 however it should be noted that the generalized regional nutrient thresholds proposed above may be considered overly restrictive for some lakes for individual lakes the significant modulating factors may should also be taken into the consideration and establish type specific nutrient thresholds carvalho et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 it seems that we need to make subdivision of our lakes based on lrt mc and n p ratio because gam analysis indicated all three factors have significantly modulated nutrient cyanobacteria relationships on a regional scale but the truth may be more nuanced in our study the sites with rapid flushing and abundant macrophytes were generally observed with the total absence of cyanobacteria fig 6 indicating that the two factors can cause considerable difference between actual bcyano and those derived from the 95 quantile regression model for individual sites however if the sites with relatively short lrt 100 days and with macrophytes were removed in this case the effect of lrt and macrophytes on the nutrient cyanobacteria relationships is theoretically limited small difference between the actual bcyano and those derived from the 95 quantile regression model were observed fig 7 these results indicate that for individual sites the modulating effect of n p on the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria seems not very eye catching in this condition there is no need to subdivide lakes with the consideration of n p ratio previous study indicate that in lakes with a lrt higher than 100 days flushing is likely to have limited effect on cyanobacterial abundance reynolds 2006 thus olsr derived models were further performed to estimated nutrient bcyano relationships using the datasets with lrt 100 days and no macrophytes as a result the significant nutrient bcyano relationships with relatively high r2 were observed especially for summer datasets fig 7 and season specific thresholds of tn and tp were further proposed for this lake type table 5 in contrast in lakes with rapid flushing most for the yangtze connected lakes in our study or abundant macrophytes where cyanobacteria are generally absent or present in very low abundance blooms control measures should focus more on significant these non nutrient modulating factors for the rest lakes the current study may not go so far as to estimate nutrient cyanobacteria relationship due to the relatively small sampling size after lake subdivision and further research may be needed in order to obtain corresponding nutrient reduction targets in addition we emphasize that the summer thresholds proposed in current study have more practical significance because for a large lake it is difficult to significantly reduce the nutrient levels in short time 5 conclusion in current study the response of bcyano to nutrient of shallow lakes in the eastern china plains were examined we demonstrated that at regional scale nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria was seriously modulated by other factors in such condition classical olsr derived models are ill suited to explore the essential nutrient bcyano relationships and it might be more appropriate to regard nutrient as an upper limit for bcyano for our studies lakes robust nutrient bcyano relationships were observed using 95 quantile regression model we therefore used these relationships to establish regional specific tn and tp reduction targets of the shallow lakes on the other hand regional specific nutrient thresholds may be overly restrictive for some lakes for example yangtze river connected lakes are not susceptible to cyanobacterial blooms under nutrient enrichment process due to rapid flushing thus for individual lake management it is advisable that nutrient reduction targets should be considered in relation to other important modulating factors e g lake retention time in this study quantile regression model and generalized additive model were used together to explore potentially significant modulating factors of which lake retention time macrophytes cover and n p ratio were identified as most important the subdivision of our studied lakes was performed based on the most significant non nutrient modulating factors as expected robust nutrient bcyano relationship were observed in a specific lake type shallow lakes with retention time 100 days and no macrophyte given the fact that the nutrient management in many countries including china are based on one size fits all policy a practice which may easily lead to over or under protection in individual lakes thus nutrient thresholds proposed in our study may provide essential information for cost effective eutrophication management of shallow lakes both in the eastern china plains and in elsewhere with similar climatic background on a broader scale it may be not rare to see that regional scale nutrient cyanobacteria relationships were affected by other modulating factor thus the approaches and findings of this study can also serve as a valuable reference to develop reasonable nutrient reduction targets for lakes in other ecoregions

17960,the increasing global occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms attributed primarily to human induced nutrient enrichment significantly degrades freshwater ecosystems and poses serious risks to human health the current study examined environmental variables and cyanobacterial biovolume bcyano of 28 shallow lakes in the eastern china plains during the spring and summer of 2018 we used a 95 quantile regression model to explore season specific response of bcyano to total nitrogen tn or total phosphorus tp and robust linear relationships were observed between log bcyano 0 001 and log tn or log tp in both spring and summer periods based on these regressions regional scale and season specific tn and tp thresholds are proposed for these lakes to ensure the safety for recreational waters and drinking water source however actual bcyano for a given concentration of tn or tp for many observations were considerably lower than the results of the 95 regression model predict indicating that other factors significantly modulated nutrient limitation of bcyano generalized additive model and quantile regression model were used together to explore potentially significant modulating factors of

these studies focus on the relationship between cyanobacterial dominance abundance and nutrient levels smith 1986 ptacnik et al 2008 wagner and adrian 2009 while relatively few studies consider the response of actual cyanobacterial biovolume bcyano to nutrient enrichment despite this being more relevant to the health and functioning of aquatic ecosystems dolman et al 2012 carvalho et al 2013 of these few studies majority have been based on a statistical approach of data averaging followed by ordinary least squares regression olsr model smith 1986 downing et al 2001 lars et al 2007 however olsr derived models are unlikely to yield meaningful results if datasets exhibit a wedge shaped scatter of points which indicates that cause effect relationships are confounded by stressors other than nutrient levels cade and noon 2003 philips et al 2019 the relationship between chlorophyll a chla and total phosphorus tp is one example ideally a robust linear relationship between log chla and log tp would be observed if algal growth was primarily limited by tp fig 1 a however in winter observations chla exhibited insensitive response to tp due to the considerably modulating effect of temperature as a result olsr derived model tend to exhibit large uncertainty where the datasets include winter observations fig 1b therefore to explore the essential relationship between chla and tp it might be more appropriate to regard nutrients as an upper limit for chla and to apply instead a 95 quantile regression model cade and noon 2003 xu et al 2015a b in shallow lakes there are number of regional scale factors e g flushing in addition to temperature that may interact significantly with nutrient limitation to exert a modulating effect on cyanobacterial growth during growing seasons liu et al 2016 qin et al 2020 this suggests that more specific information regarding ecological background of individual lakes may be necessary in order to contextualize monitoring data and establish cost effective nutrient reduction targets however for developing world e g china the vast majority of current lake nutrient management strategies are based on very general criteria china state environmental protection administration 2002 a practice may easily lead to over or under protection of individual lakes xu et al 2015a identification and quantification of significant modulating factors will help identify which lakes are more susceptible to cyanobacterial blooms under nutrient enrichment process and provide important information for lake subdivision and development of type specific nutrient reduction target in this study environmental variables and phytoplankton samples were collected from 28 subtropical temperate shallow lakes in the eastern china plains during spring and summer of 2018 fig 2 our objectives were 1 to explore the season specific maximal 95 quantiles and average responses of bcyano to total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp using 95 quantile regression and olsr derived models 2 to quantify the effect of hydromorphological and biogeochemical background on nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria during the growing periods and identify the significant modulating factors and 3 to provide useful information for the development of cost effective nutrient reduction targets for lakes both in our studied ecoregion and elsewhere we hypothesized that while nutrient levels may define the growth potential of bcyano in growing seasons in most cases this potential would not be reached because of other modulating and controlling factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we conducted our study in the eastern china plains which is across the subtropical and warm temperature zone wang and dou 1998 this ecoregion comprises a vast area of floodplain along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river plain and downstream of the huai river plain which are the most densely populated and agricultural productive region of china ma et al 2010 the total area of natural lakes larger than 1 km2 in the ecoregion is 21 053 km2 accounting for 25 9 of total freshwater lake area in china ma et al 2010 and lake area varied greatly in this ecoregion for lake depth these lakes are very shallow generally 1 5 m and exhibit intensive wind induced resuspension of sediment hamilton and mitchell 1996 huo et al 2013 in addition yangtze river connected lakes and some lakes in the huai river basin were observed with rapid flushing while the rest of them e g yangtze river isolated lakes tend to have longer residence time wang and dou 1998 in the past several decades the anthropogenic activities including urbanization agriculture aquaculture and industrial development have led to declines in water quality ma et al 2010 human induced nutrient enrichment and its associated cyanobacterial blooms are key environmental concerns and challenges facing local governments le et al 2010 shi et al 2015 duan et al 2017 2 2 data acquisition environmental variables and phytoplankton samples were collected from 28 shallow lakes 184 sites in the eastern china plains during summer months 2018 fig 2 moreover 27 shallow lakes 169 sites were investigated in spring months 2018 and shijiu lake number 19 in fig 2 was not sampled due to very low water depth on each sampling site water depth wd and secchi depth sd were measured using a speedtech sm 5 portable depth sounder and secchi disk and macrophytes cover mc was estimated in situ water temperature wt ph and electric conductivity ec of the upper 0 5 m of the water column were measured with an ysi 6600 v2 multi sensor sonde additional water samples were collected within 50 cm of the surface for chemical analysis in the laboratory total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp and chla were determined according to standard methods apha 2012 the suspended solids in quantified water samples were collected on 0 70 Î¼m porosity membrane filters whatman gf f with tared weight 1 w1 and combusted in a muffle furnace 550 c for 4 h to determine ash free weight inorganic suspended solids iss were derived by subtraction from values for pre and post filtered samples phytoplankton were sampled within 50 cm of the surface and fixed with lugol s iodine solution 1 v v followed by 48 h settling apha 2012 cell density was counted directly in a 0 1 ml counting chamber using an olympus bx53 microscope at 400 magnification the taxonomic identification of algae and the calculation of bcyano were conducted according to hu and wei 2007 lake retention times lrt were acquired from previously published data for some lakes lrt are readily available in the literatures wang and dou 1998 cai et al 2012 liu et al 2016 while for others the lrt were calculated previous studies demonstrated that the ratio of average annual precipitation in the basin to lake volume was significantly correlated with lrt calculated the traditional way i e by dividing lake volume by flow in or out of the lake the equation was expressed as y 0 25x 25 38 r2 0 99 p 0 001 n 27 where y is the ratio of average annual precipitation in the basin to lake volume and x represents lrt calculated by the traditional method ranging from 18 to 13977 days shi et al 2018 in most cases average annual precipitation in the basin and lake volume could be obtained from the literature wang and dou 1998 but there remained four lakes in this study including wuchang east lake number 6 in fig 2 wushan lake number 9 in fig 2 zhu lake number 12 in fig 2 and huangda lake number 14 in fig 2 for which the lrt values are not available hence the four lakes were removed in the later difference analysis and generalized additive model analysis 2 3 statistical analysis 2 3 1 difference analysis and regression models the temporal differences between environmental variables and bcyano were tested using pared sample t test both olsr derived and quantile regression models were used to explore relationships between bcyano and nutrient levels tn or tp the quantile regression model can be viewed as an extension of classical least squares estimation of conditional mean models to estimate an ensemble of models for several conditional quantile functions cade and noon 2003 recognizing that certain undetermined factors may limit the accuracy of bcyano values estimated from nutrient levels cade and noon 2003 carvalho et al 2013 95 quantile regression model was used to explore the response of cyanobacteria to nutrient enrichment under ideal conditions where cyanobacterial growth was limited primarily by tn or tp the difference analysis and olsr derived models were performed using spss 19 0 and the 95 quantile regression model were conducted with the quantreg package of r software 2 3 2 generalized additive model the generalized additive model gam is an analysis which assumes that the response variable for covariates depends on smoothing splines rather than linear coefficients hastie and tibshirani 1987 in this study gam was used to identify the factors that significantly modulated tn or tp limitation of cyanobacterial growth in spring and summer we assumed that the response of bcyano to tn or tp under ideal conditions in which cyanobacterial growth is limited primarily by tn or tp could be quantified using the 95 quantile regression model meanwhile on a regional scale other factors e g lrt may have a significantly modulating effect on the nutrient limitation of cyanobacterial growth even during the growing season liu et al 2016 as a result the actual values of bcyano at a given tn or tp concentration may exhibit considerable difference compared to those derived from the 95 quantile regression model this difference deemed to reflect the total modulating effect of the other factors on the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria fig 3 was used as a response variable y in the gam analysis in this study we explored season specific spring and summer responses of bcyano to nutrient levels tn and tp theoretically there are four distinctive response y1 y4 variables for the analysis of gam y1 is the difference between the expected bcyano derived from 95 quantile regression at a given tn concentration and actual bcyano in spring y2 is the difference between expected bcyano derived from 95 quantile regression at a given tp concentration and actual bcyano in spring y3 is the difference between expected bcyano from 95 quantile regression at a given tn and actual bcyano in summer and y4 is the difference between expected bcyano from 95 quantile regression at a given tp and actual bcyano in summer to our knowledge wd is closely related with sediment resuspension hamilton and mitchell 1996 thus it may interfere the nutrient cyanobacteria relationships by indirectly influencing underwater light conditions bioavailability of nutrient to phytoplankton lind 1986 havens et al 2001 for similar reason iss content is likely to affect cyanobacterial response to nutrient dzialowski et al 2011 as to lrt previous studies showed that rapid flushing can directly inhibit the algal response to nutrient input reynolds 2006 liu et al 2016 in addition previous study showed that in lakes with high n p ratio insignificant relationships between chla and tn have been observed thus we hypothesize that nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria may also be modulated by lrt and n p ratio nÃµges et al 2008 carvalho et al 2011 as to biological variables macrophytes is most likely to affect nutrient cyanobacteria relationships nakai et al 2000 therefore these five variables were considered as explanatory variables in gam analysis to identify those which exerted significant influence on the nutrient cyanobacteria relationships i e variations in the total modulating effect limited multiple collinearity was observed between the five explanatory variables indicated by very low value of variance inflation factor 2 the analysis of gam using all explanatory variables mentioned above were performed four times namely y1 wd lrt iss n p mc y2 wd lrt iss n p mc y3 wd lrt iss n p mc and y4 wd lrt iss n p mc and p 0 05 of an explanatory variable e g lrt indicated the flushing have significantly modulated the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria moreover the r2 adjusted were also used to identify significant modulating factors in our study the analysis of gam was thus performed using each single explanatory variable the estimated degrees of freedom edf used to determine the amount of smoothing for each explanatory variable were automatically selected by the model fitting procedure using restricted maximum likelihood hastie and tibshirani 1990 before analysis of regression and gam values for bcyano and mc were log10 transformed with an additional small arbitrary constant of 0 001 to eliminate zeros before transformation and the remaining variables were log10 transformed straightforwardly gam was performed using the mgcv package of r software 2 4 bcyano thresholds of recreational waters and drinking water source in our study the nutrient thresholds of shallow lakes were calculated based on cyanobacterial abundance targets established for recreational waters and drinking water source in the eastern china plains in recreational waters cyanobacterial cell densities of 20 000 and 100 000 cells ml 1 are considered to pose a low and moderate risk to health respectively associated with symptoms such as skin irritations and gastrointestinal illness bartram et al 1999 who 2003 we adopted these thresholds and multiplied the cell densities by a typical cyanobacterial cell volume assuming a spherical cell with a diameter of 5 7 Î¼m to achieve equivalent biovolumes of 2 mm3 l 1 and 10 mm3 l 1 bartram et al 1999 as to drinking water source thresholds of cyanobacterial cell densities were proposed by burch 1993 bartram et al 1999 and again by house et al 2004 in this most recent revision thresholds of cell densities of 2000 and 5000 cells ml 1 the equivalent biovolumes of 0 2 mm3 l 1 and 0 5 mm3 l 1 amount to low and moderate health risk for drinking water source and were used in the current study 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics of nutrient and bcyano in spring the wt of our study lakes ranged from 13 80 to 25 24 c with an average value of 20 63 2 57 c average values of tn tdn tp and tdp in this season were 1 73 0 91 mg l 1 1 38 0 83 mg l 1 94 59 68 70 Î¼g l 1 and 44 03 32 29 Î¼g l 1 respectively in summer significantly higher p 0 001 wt were observed with average values of 30 31 1 54 c tdn values were significantly p 0 001 lower than in spring averaging 0 97 0 65 mg l 1 while tp increased by about 30 from spring to summer p 0 03 no significant seasonal differences were observed in tn and tdp p 0 05 but the average bcyano increased considerably p 0 001 from 0 51 2 16 mm3 l 1 in spring to 3 14 11 62 mm3 l 1 in summer table 1 more details of the season specific nutrient levels and bcyano as well as other important variables i e lake area wd lrt sd ec iss and chla of each lake are provided in table s1 3 2 regression analysis between bcyano and nutrient concentrations a significant positive linear relationship was observed between log bcyano 0 001 and log tn or log tp based on the 95 quantile regression model for both spring and summer datasets p 0 001 these regression lines exhibited a relatively high determination coefficient r2 range from 0 49 to 0 52 implying that both tn and tp limit the maximum capacity of bcyano for the shallow lakes in spring and summer as expected a wedge shaped scatter of points between log bcyano 0 001 and log tn or log tp was observed in both two growing seasons meanwhile olsr derived regression lines exhibited with low r2 in addition for most sites in both growing seasons considerable differences were observed between actual bcyano values at a given tn or tp and those derived from the 95 quantile regression model fig 4 3 3 identification of the modulating factors for spring observations the gam using all selected explanatory variables explained 51 3 of deviance in y1 r2 adjusted 0 45 n 169 and 58 1 of deviance in y2 r2 adjusted 0 52 n 169 respectively moreover lrt iss n p ratio and mc were identified as significant explanatory variables in both models p 0 01 in terms of summer observations the gam using all possible explanatory variables explained 68 7 of deviance in y3 r2 adjusted 0 66 n 184 and 58 1 of deviance in y4 r2 adjusted 0 55 n 184 respectively correspondingly the results of gam analysis indicated that lrt and n p ratio were the significant modulating factors p 0 05 table 2 the results of gam analysis incorporating single explanatory variable for spring observations showed that the lrt accounted for the largest variations in y1 r2 adjusted 0 30 followed by mc r2 adjusted 0 06 for y2 lrt also exhibited largest accountability for its variations r2 adjusted 0 28 n p ratio and mc accounted for relatively low variations in y2 with the r2 adjusted of 0 13 and 0 09 respectively as to summer datasets the results of gam analysis incorporating single explanatory variable showed that more than half variations of y3 was accounted by lrt r2 adjusted 0 64 and n p ratio also accounted for relatively high variations in y2 with the r2 adjusted of 0 25 for y4 lrt also exhibited largest accountability for its variations r2 adjusted 0 33 followed by n p ratio with r2 adjusted of 0 09 table 3 on the other hand the sites with short lrt were generally associated with high values of y1 y2 y3 and y4 in contrast higher values of y1 and y2 were observed in the sites with abundant mc as to n p ratio on the whole this variable exhibited positive relationships with y1 or y3 in contrast negative relationships were observed between n p ratio and y2 or y4 in addition our results also showed linear negative correlation between iss content and y1 or y2 fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 the nutrient limitation of bcyano and potential modulating factors studies exploring the responses of actual bcyano to nutrient enrichment mostly conducted on small number of lakes as a result the nutrient abundance was generally considered to be the single dominant limiting factor for cyanobacterial growth for these lakes and robust nutrient bcyano relationships r2 0 50 0 70 derived from olsr model were observed smith 1985 1990 trimbee and prepas 1987 dzialowski et al 2011 in current region scale study however olsr derived models between log bcyano 0 001 and log tn or log tp exhibited very low r2 in contrast robust linear responses of log bcyano 0 001 to log tn or log tp were observed using 95 quantile regression model for both spring and summer observations p 0 001 these results indicate that nutrient levels tn and tp set the maximal capacity of bcyano in our study lakes on the other hand actual bcyano at a given tn or tp were considerably lower than those derived from the 95 quantile regression model in both spring and summer pointing to a significant modulation of cyanobacterial growth by other factors based on the results of gam analysis we verified that lrt is the most significant factor modulating tn or tp limitations of cyanobacteria in our study lakes tables 2 and 3 in fact it is well known that short lrt can suppress algal blooms by flushing biomass before the standing crop reaches the maximum permitted by the available nutrient dillon 1975 however a total absence of bcyano was recorded in the most study sites with lrt less than 35 days such as yangtze river connected lakes upper quartile 0 fig 6 indicating that rapid flushing may especially suppresses cyanobacterial growth previous studies have demonstrated that small phytoplankton cells tend to dominate the community in rapid flushing lakes dickman 1969 bailey watts et al 2010 providing a possible explanation for much greater controls of cyanobacteria compared to fast growing diatoms small chlorophytes and flagellates overall bloom forming cyanobacteria have relatively slow reproductive rates which in such cases are not sufficient to compensate for removal by flushing reynolds 2006 in contrast to lrt wd was not identified as significant explanatory variable in any of the gam analysis table 2 this may be because the range of wd in the studied shallow lakes is small table s1 our results also indicated that n p ratio has significantly modulated the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria tables 2 and 3 both in spring and summer specifically bcyano response to tn or tp would be closer to the lines derived from 95 quantile regressions with decrease of n p ratio or with increase of n p ratio fig 5 these results are reasonable because both tn and tp co limited cyanobacterial growth in our study lakes take the response of bcyano to tp as an example increasing n p ratio indicates that cyanobacterial growth is more likely to be limited by tp therefore the bcyano theoretically exhibit higher utilization efficiency of tp and the difference between actual bcyano and those derived from the 95 quantile regression models at a given tp would decrease with the increase of n p ratio furthermore the gam analysis tables 2 and 3 indicated that in spring mc exerted significant p 0 05 effect on the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria and boxplot analysis upper quartile 0 fig 6 revealed that cyanobacterial response to nutrient were considerably suppressed in the sites with abundant macrophytes the mechanisms for this inhibitive effect may include shading allelopathy and increasing grazing pressure as abundant macrophytes beds can provide shelter for large zooplankton nakai et al 2000 pakdel et al 2013 by contrast no macrophytes were observed in the majority of our sampling sites during summer due to the massive mortality of the spring predominating macrophytes species i e potamogeton crispus cao et al 2018 as a result insignificant p 0 05 effect of mc on nutrient cyanobacteria relationships were observed as the small range of mc in terms of non algal turbidity analysis of gam also indicated that in spring cyanobacteria exhibited more sensitive response to tn or tp when higher iss content were recorded to our knowledge however high iss content can reduce water transparency brezonik et al 2019 causing photoinhibition in cyanobacterial growth lind 1986 moreover increased iss often represents a high proportion of particulate nutrient with relatively low bioavailability havens et al 2001 chung et al 2009 correspondingly previous studies have demonstrated that cyanobacterial biomass in sites with high iss contents are less responsive to nutrient enrichment smith 1990 dzialowski et al 2011 we suggest that the contrasting current results may be because that the sites with low iss content were typically associated with abundant macrophytes the influence of macrophytes may be sufficient to account for the larger difference between actual bcyano and that predicted for a given a tn or tp by the 95 quantile regression model in sites with lower iss content in spring thus iss may in essence exert limited effect on nutrient cyanobacteria relationships in shallow lakes in contrast as the decline of macrophytes p crispus in summer iss alone was not identified as significant modulating factor because its values remained generally high and exhibited relatively small gradients in shallow lakes hamilton and mitchell 1996 4 2 implications for nutrient management the fundamental question in nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus management is the extent to which variations will promote good ecological status or reduce the potential threat to human health poikane et al 2019 thus the thresholds of bcyano for safe recreational waters and drinking water source were used to derive nutrient reduction targets however the wedge shaped scatter points on a plot of bcyano and nutrient levels i e tn and tp indicate that the traditional binary regression lines based on olsr derived model are of limited relevance for nutrient management our results support that the 95 quantile regression model may be more suitable for exploring the essential response of bcyano to nutrient levels cade and noon 2003 philips et al 2019 in addition the results using 95 quantile regression model demonstrated robust linear relationships between log bcyano 1 and log tn or log tp in both spring and summer suggesting that reductions in both n and p are needed to control cyanobacterial blooms in shallow lakes xu et al 2014 paerl et al 2016 thus to ensure the safety for recreational waters and drinking water source of our study lakes regional specific and season specific thresholds for tn and tp thresholds were established based these 95 quantile regression models table 4 bartram et al 1999 who 2003 however it should be noted that the generalized regional nutrient thresholds proposed above may be considered overly restrictive for some lakes for individual lakes the significant modulating factors may should also be taken into the consideration and establish type specific nutrient thresholds carvalho et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 it seems that we need to make subdivision of our lakes based on lrt mc and n p ratio because gam analysis indicated all three factors have significantly modulated nutrient cyanobacteria relationships on a regional scale but the truth may be more nuanced in our study the sites with rapid flushing and abundant macrophytes were generally observed with the total absence of cyanobacteria fig 6 indicating that the two factors can cause considerable difference between actual bcyano and those derived from the 95 quantile regression model for individual sites however if the sites with relatively short lrt 100 days and with macrophytes were removed in this case the effect of lrt and macrophytes on the nutrient cyanobacteria relationships is theoretically limited small difference between the actual bcyano and those derived from the 95 quantile regression model were observed fig 7 these results indicate that for individual sites the modulating effect of n p on the nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria seems not very eye catching in this condition there is no need to subdivide lakes with the consideration of n p ratio previous study indicate that in lakes with a lrt higher than 100 days flushing is likely to have limited effect on cyanobacterial abundance reynolds 2006 thus olsr derived models were further performed to estimated nutrient bcyano relationships using the datasets with lrt 100 days and no macrophytes as a result the significant nutrient bcyano relationships with relatively high r2 were observed especially for summer datasets fig 7 and season specific thresholds of tn and tp were further proposed for this lake type table 5 in contrast in lakes with rapid flushing most for the yangtze connected lakes in our study or abundant macrophytes where cyanobacteria are generally absent or present in very low abundance blooms control measures should focus more on significant these non nutrient modulating factors for the rest lakes the current study may not go so far as to estimate nutrient cyanobacteria relationship due to the relatively small sampling size after lake subdivision and further research may be needed in order to obtain corresponding nutrient reduction targets in addition we emphasize that the summer thresholds proposed in current study have more practical significance because for a large lake it is difficult to significantly reduce the nutrient levels in short time 5 conclusion in current study the response of bcyano to nutrient of shallow lakes in the eastern china plains were examined we demonstrated that at regional scale nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria was seriously modulated by other factors in such condition classical olsr derived models are ill suited to explore the essential nutrient bcyano relationships and it might be more appropriate to regard nutrient as an upper limit for bcyano for our studies lakes robust nutrient bcyano relationships were observed using 95 quantile regression model we therefore used these relationships to establish regional specific tn and tp reduction targets of the shallow lakes on the other hand regional specific nutrient thresholds may be overly restrictive for some lakes for example yangtze river connected lakes are not susceptible to cyanobacterial blooms under nutrient enrichment process due to rapid flushing thus for individual lake management it is advisable that nutrient reduction targets should be considered in relation to other important modulating factors e g lake retention time in this study quantile regression model and generalized additive model were used together to explore potentially significant modulating factors of which lake retention time macrophytes cover and n p ratio were identified as most important the subdivision of our studied lakes was performed based on the most significant non nutrient modulating factors as expected robust nutrient bcyano relationship were observed in a specific lake type shallow lakes with retention time 100 days and no macrophyte given the fact that the nutrient management in many countries including china are based on one size fits all policy a practice which may easily lead to over or under protection in individual lakes thus nutrient thresholds proposed in our study may provide essential information for cost effective eutrophication management of shallow lakes both in the eastern china plains and in elsewhere with similar climatic background on a broader scale it may be not rare to see that regional scale nutrient cyanobacteria relationships were affected by other modulating factor thus the approaches and findings of this study can also serve as a valuable reference to develop reasonable nutrient reduction targets for lakes in other ecoregions

17961,in order to improve the dissolved organic matter removal efficiency an electro hybrid ozonation coagulation e hoc system was developed in this study in which the electro coagulation ec and ozonation occurred simultaneously in one integrated unit higher removal efficiency was observed for the e hoc process compared with those of ec ozonation and pre ozonation ec process for the treatment of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent and ibuprofen ibp 58 6 dissolved organic carbon doc removal efficiency was achieved in the e hoc process for the treatment of wwtp effluent at optimal operational condition current density 15 ma cm2 initial ph 5 and ozone dosage 1 5 mg o3 mg doc based on the reactive oxygen species ros detection and reactions on the electrodes the synergistic effects between ozone and coagulants soc were found to be involved in the e hoc process according to pseudo first order rate constant analyses the contribution of five possible organic removal pathways was quantified it was revealed that the peroxone and soc effects exhibited almost equal contribution to ibp removal at initial ph 5 under different current densities both of which played the dominant role in the e hoc process however the contribution of the soc effects decreased significantly when the initial ph increased to 7 and 9 as an important pathway for organic removal in the e hoc process at initial ph 5 the mechanism of the soc effects was analysed at initial ph 5 it was revealed the soc effects can further improve hydroxyl radicals oh generation and the surface hydroxyl groups of the hydrolysed al species generated from anode electrolysis were determined to be the active sites to generate ros in the soc effects graphical abstract image 1 keywords electro hoc process reactive oxygen species synergistic effects surface hydroxyl groups 1 introduction the combination of ultraviolet radiation hydrogen peroxide h2o2 metal ions metal oxides electrochemistry etc with the conventional ozonation process is an effective way to improve the organic matter removal efficiency because of the enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals oh nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 among these catalytic ozonation processes combining electrochemistry and ozone e g electro peroxone is an efficient process due to its simplicity strong oxidation potential environment friendly and do not require addition reagents akbari et al 2016 barzegar et al 2019 xiong et al 2018 for the electro peroxone process h2o2 is produced electrochemically from oxygen o2 reduction in cathode during ozonation xia et al 2017 yao et al 2019 the in situ generated h2o2 can then enhance the decomposition of ozone o3 to oh bakheet et al 2013 guo et al 2018 our previous study found that al based coagulants can also enhance oh generation during ozonation and there are synergistic effects between ozone and coagulants soc jin et al 2017 2019a 2019b because of the addition of al based coagulants during the ozonation process ozonation and coagulation simultaneously occur within a single unit consequently the hybrid ozonation coagulation hoc process was put forward in our previous work jin et al 2017 in which chemical coagulation played an important role however in addition to chemical coagulation electro coagulation ec is gaining recognition as an alternative process due to the electric induction ec involves the electrolytic oxidation of an appropriate anode material aluminum and iron and in situ generation of metal ions which act as coagulants lakshmanan et al 2009 ratna kumar et al 2004 wan et al 2011 therefore electro hoc process e hoc can be proposed based on the integration of ec and hoc process however little data can be obtained related to the quantitative contribution of soc effects in the e hoc process for the organic matter removal actually similar to the e hoc process several studies integrated ozonation process with ec process to form electrolysis

dÃ­az et al 2012 and greywater barzegar et al 2019 with the use of the iron anode when ozone bubbled into the ec aqueous solution fe eco process redox reactions took place in which ozone decomposes after its reaction with fe2 ions to form the intermediate ion feo2 which consequently reacts with water to form oh and fe3 ions bernal martÃ­nez et al 2010 xiong et al 2018 consequently the eco process exhibited higher organic removal efficiency compared with ozonation and ec process asaithambi et al 2016a it was revealed that the possible reactions in the fe eco process included homogeneous catalytic ozonation fe2 o3 peroxone reactions o3 h2o2 fenton reactions fe2 h2o2 molecular ozone oxidation and coagulation xiong et al 2018 homogeneous catalytic ozonation and fenton reactions were dominant reactions in the fe eco process under initial ph 3 and homogeneous catalytic ozonation and peroxone reactions were pivotal reactions in the fe eco process under initial ph 6 6 xiong et al 2018 despite of the structural similarities the interactions between electrolytically generated hydrolysed metal species and ozone were not considered in the previously proposed eco process nevertheless besides al and fe anodes most of the anodes in the eco process could be stable electrodes such as ruo2 ti tio2 ti etc kishimoto et al 2005 li et al 2019 2020 the organic removal using the stable anodes is mainly through direct electron transfer from organic matter and water oxidation to form oh on the surface of anodes different from the e hoc process there are no ec effects in the eco process using stable electrodes in addition most studies applied iron anodes for the treatment of industrial wastewater asaithambi et al 2016b biliÅska et al 2019 or greywater barzegar et al 2019 in the eco process nevertheless al based coagulants are the most commonly used coagulants in water and wastewater treatment jarvis et al 2012 sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ et al 2018 matilainen et al 2010 reported that aluminum based coagulants tend to have higher color and turbidity removal efficiencies in comparison with the ferric ones if al anodes are applied the dissolution of the al anodes resulted in the formation of mononuclear species aloh2 al oh 2 al oh 3 al oh 4 polynuclear species al2 oh 2 4 al3 oh 4 5 al7 oh 17 4 al13o4 oh 24 7 fournier et al 2009 lin et al 2019 previous study also indicated that the ec with al anodes exhibited higher removal efficiency in the treatment of three different natural organic matter nom samples than that with fe anodes ulu et al 2015 moreover devlin et al 2019 found that ec process with al electrode provided the best and most reliable removal of chemical oxygen demand cod in comparison with iron and magnesium electrodes in the treatment of primary influent from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp this can be attributed to the higher neutralization ability of al coagulants compared with fe coagulants wan et al 2019 therefore the performance of the e hoc process using al anodes is worth investigation in this study the e hoc system using aluminium anode and stainless steel cathode was developed to investigate the removal performance of wwtp effluent and ibuprofen ibp the optimal operational condition of the e hoc process was determined quantitative evaluation of reactions involved in the e hoc system was conducted including the soc effects in addition the active reaction sites and reactive oxygen species ros generation were also revealed in the soc effects to further elucidate the mechanism of the e hoc process 2 materials and methods 2 1

thickness the interelectrode gap was maintained as 2 cm the electrodes were vertically installed through a slit in the lid of the reactor and suspended into the solution the electrodes were polished with sandpapers and then cleaned with a 1 m hcl solution for 10 min which were followed successively by rinsing with deionized water and finally drying for use the electrodes were connected to a direct current dc power supply jp5200d annaisi china the current density is obtained by dividing the imposed current intensity by the effective surface area of the anode the reactor was stirred magnetically with a gentle stirring rate of 100 rpm to create enough reaction time a schematic diagram of the reactor is presented in fig 1 the al anodes were replaced by ti ruo2 iro2 zhiming special metal co ltd china with same dimensional size of 7 6 0 1 cm length width thickness to evaluate the contribution of generated al species phosphate buffer was transferred to the water sample to achieve a final concentration of 0 2 mm and the initial ph of the water samples was adjusted by 0 1 m naoh or 1 9 hno3 1 43 m ozone stock solution was added to the proper concentration via an inlet tube ibp

the removal performance of the e hoc process 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 dissolved organic carbon doc analysis doc was measured using a shimadzu tocvcph analyser with infrared detection all samples were filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m filter acidified with h2so4 and purged with nitrogen for 3 min to remove inorganic carbon before the measurement all the measurements were performed in duplicate or triplicates and all points in the figures were the average of the obtained results 2 3 2 ibp analysis the concentration of ibp was analysed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system

70 30 was used the flow rate was maintained at 1 0 ml min 2 3 3 zeta potential analysis the zeta potential measurements were conducted using a laser zeta analyser malvern zetasizer nano zs90 uk the samples were obtained at 3 cm above the bottom of reactor and analysed immediately to prevent zeta potential variation each result was the average of three readings 2 3 4 x ray photoelectron

time constant of 81 92 ms sweep time of 35 s and receiver gain 30 db the radical trapping agent added to the reaction system was 100 mm dmpo 3 results and discussions 3 1 removal performance in the e hoc process to test the removal performance and obtain the optimal operational conditions of the e hoc process a series of experiments were conducted at different initial ph values initial ph 5 7 and 9 the ph variation during the e hoc process at different initial ph values can be seen in fig s1 ozone dosages 1 1 5 and 2 0 mg o3 mg doc and current densities 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 15 ma cm2 and 20 ma cm2 the results are shown in fig 2 with increasing of the current densities the removal efficiency of doc increased and then reached a peak value of 58 6 at 15 ma cm2 the current density is directly proportional to the coagulant dosage according to faraday s law therefore the rate of dissolution of aluminum electrode increased with the increasing current density however further increasing current density above 15 ma cm2 reduced the doc removal efficiency zhu et al 2007 reported that at high current density the rapid release of al3 and oh ions from the surface of electrode will make the solution around the anode and cathode extremely acidic or basic respectively which will decrease the removal efficiency in addition an excessive current density may also cause the excess oxygen evolution and other adverse effects such as heat generation mollah and pathak 2004 according to fig 2 the optimal ozone dosage was 1 5 mg o3 mg doc higher ozone dosage 2 0 mg o3 mg doc can deteriorate the e hoc removal performance this can be attributed to the over oxidation of macromolecular organics to generate the small molecule organic matters of high hydrophilicity bose and reckhow 2007 reckhow and legube 1986 in addition excessive ozonation can reduce the surface charge of flocs and hinder adsorptive removal of the anionic organic molecules by floc surfaces which decreased the doc removal efficiency edwards et al 1993 therefore according to fig 2 the optimal current density and ozone dosage for the e hoc process were 15 ma cm2 and 1 5 mg o3 mg doc respectively in addition fig 2d compared the doc removal performance of the ec e hoc pre ozonation ec and single ozonation processes according to fig 2d the e hoc process exhibited the highest doc removal efficiency at different initial ph values the averaged doc removal efficiency increased by 20 0 14 8 and 8 6 relative to that of the ec process at initial ph 5 7 and 9 respectively moreover the averaged doc removal efficiency of the e hoc exhibited 19 4 17 5 and 10 2 higher than the pre ozonation ec process at initial ph 5 7 and 9 respectively in contrast only approximate 13 doc removal efficiency was achieved at different initial ph values by the ozonation process the little improvement of pre ozonation ec process compared with ec process can be attributed to the deteriorated ec performance after pre ozonation asaithambi et al 2016a also observed that the combination of ozonation and ec process was the most effective process resulting in 100 color removal and 97 50 cod removal efficiency for the treatment of distillery industrial effluent compared with those of the ozonation and ec processes alone in particular the average doc removal efficiency of the e hoc process reached 58 6 at 1 5 mg o3 mg doc at initial ph 5 while only 45 2 and 42 2 removal efficiencies can be obtained at initial ph 7 and 9 respectively with the increasing ph value the amount of hydroxide ions increased in the solution consequently some of the hydroxide ions may be oxidized at the anode which reduced the production of aluminium ions mouedhen et al 2008 picard et al 2000 moreover the soluble al oh 4 ions may be produced at high ph omwene and kobya 2018 which reduced the electrical neutralization capacity thereby decreasing the doc removal efficiency under weak acidic conditions abundant positively charged aluminium polyhydroxo complexes al oh 2 al oh 2 al3 oh 4 5 al13o4 oh 24 7 etc and al oh 3 s are formed these gelatinous charged al hydroxo cationic complexes can effectively remove pollutants by adsorption to produce charge neutralization and by enmeshment in a precipitate omwene and kobya 2018 hence based on the removal performance of the e hoc process for the treatment of wwtp effluent initial ph 5 was selected as the optimal ph value in the further analyses for this study the doc removal performance during the e hoc process at different current densities was further investigated at 1 5 mg o3 mg doc and initial ph 5 as shown in fig 3 the doc removal efficiency increased sharply within first 5 min beyond which no significant improvement was observed according to fig 3 favorable doc removal performance was achieved at the current density of 15 ma cm2 however further increasing of the current density above 15 ma cm2 reduced the doc removal efficiency which is consistent with fig 2 the zeta potential evolution during the e hoc process at different current densities was further analysed in this study at initial ph 5 fig 4 the initial zeta potential of the suspension is 12 6 mv at initial ph 5 as aluminium anodic dissolution proceeds a sharp rise in the zeta potential was measured for all current densities which indicated positively charged hydrolysed species formation the adsorption of the positively charged hydrolysed species on the negatively charged particles led to charge neutralization and lower zeta potential values which resulted in better coagulation performance as depicted by the increasing doc removal efficiencies in addition with excess amount of positively charged aluminium hydrolysed species the zeta potential values were close to zero charge reversal was observed at 8 9 min 6 3 min and 4 3 min during the ec process while in the e hoc process charge reversal occurred at 8 5 min 5 4 min and 4 1 min for current densities of 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 respectively it was worth noting that a shift forward of the isoelectric point iep can be observed in the e hoc process which indicated that doc removal can be achieved in a shorter time nevertheless when the current density was 5 ma cm2 the zeta potential of formed flocs was negative and almost constant for the ec or e hoc process in this study furthermore fig 4 showed that a small drop in the zeta potential was observed for all the current densities at the end of reaction this can be attributed to the generation of aluminate ions al oh 4 which became the predominant species and cannot be adsorbed on the negatively charged particles hence the doc removal efficiencies were no longer improved to further test the removal performance of the e hoc process ibp was selected as the target contaminant to evaluate the removal performance at current densities of 5 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 and initial ph 5 the ozone dosage for the treatment of ibp was 10 9 mg l which was calculated from the optimal ozone dosage for the treatment of wwtp effluent based on average doc 7 276 1 943 mg l the results are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that the removal efficiency improved with the increasing current density because ibp exhibited high reactivity to oh k ibp oh 7 4 109 m 1s 1 but low reactivity to o3 molecule k ibp o3 9 1 m 1s 1 huber et al 2003 and ibp cannot be removed by ec fig 6 the ibp removal can be attributed to oh oxidation the higher current density indicated higher aluminium generation in the anode and more oh formation in the cathode it is well known that ozone can react with oh to initiate the chain reactions to generate oh liu et al 2015 staehelin and hoigne 1982 yong and lin 2012 based on our previous study al based coagulants could also act as catalysts to enhance oh generation during ozonation jin et al 2017 2019b additionally ozone decomposition can also generate o2 through chain reactions eqs 1 4 ernst et al 2004 sridharan et al 2013 h2o2 can be formed through the bimolecular decay reactions of o2 eq 5 zhang et al 2011 and the disproportionation of single electron reduced species o2 eq 6 during ozone decomposition xiong et al 2018 however according to fig 5 the e hoc process exhibited obviously higher removal efficiency than the e hoc process using ti ruo2 iro2 anode which is a kind of stable electrode and few metal ions can be released into the solution sun et al 2020 xiong et al 2018 the comparison between the e hoc with al anode and the e hoc with ti ruo2 iro2 anode further demonstrated that there were soc effects from anode and oh can be generated through the synergistic interactions in addition compared with the single ozonation process the higher removal performance in the e hoc with ti ruo2 iro2 anode can be attributed to the higher conductivity and enhanced generation of oh in the cathode 1 o3 oh o2 ho2 2 o2 o3 o2 o3 3 o3 h ho3 4 ho3 o2 oh 5 2 ho2 o2 h2o2 6 o2 ho2 h2o h2o2 o2 oh 3 2 ros generation in electrolysis ozone process according to fig 5 the higher ibp removal efficiency could be attributed to the enhanced ros formation in the e hoc process in order to verify the ros generation in the e hoc process a series of trapping experiments were carried out by adding isopropanol ipa oh scavenger catalase cat h2o2 scavenger and p benzoquinone bq o2 scavenger the results can be seen in fig 6 it was found that the ibp removal efficiency was inhibited after adding ipa cat or bq which indicated the generation of oh h2o2 and o2 respectively it has long been known that h2o2 can be electro generated on the suitable carbon based cathode brillas et al 2009 nevertheless h2o2 cannot be directly generated on the stainless steel cathode in the reaction of electrolysis system according to existing theories xiong et al 2018 therefore there are two possible ways to generate h2o2 i e the bimolecular decay reaction of o2 during ozone decomposition and single electron transfer derived from o2 in the presence of o2 o2 o2 h2o2 however as shown in fig 6 the electrolysis oxygen ec o2 process was applied for the treatment of ibp and very poor ibp removal efficiency can be obtained which is almost the same removal performance as that achieved by the ec process as a result the h2o2 generated during the e hoc process can be only derived from ozone decomposition in this study because of the formation of h2o2 peroxone reactions o3 h2o2 eq 7 could occur during the e hoc process and as a consequence oh can also be generated from the peroxone reactions in addition to the soc effects the generation of oh was also verified through epr analyses using dmpo as a trapping agent for ozonation e hoc with al anode and e hoc with ti ruo2 iro2 anode under the current density of 15 ma cm2 at initial ph 5 fig s2 it was observed that the generation of oh in the e hoc process with al anode was the highest among the three processes which further proved the occurrence of the soc effects in the e hoc process 7 2o3 h2o2 2 oh 3o2 3 3 quantitative evaluation of reactions in the e hoc process according to the abovementioned analyses there could be multiple reactions during the e hoc process in addition to the soc effects which was the key focus in this study there are also ec molecular ozone oxidation mo reactions peroxone o3 h2o2 and oh oxidation from chain reactions during ozone decomposition ho reactions in the e hoc process in order to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the different reactions for ibp removal at different current densities the proportion of the pseudo first order rate constant k obs of each reaction in the whole e hoc process was applied based on the conducted experiments and inhibitory efficiency of different scavengers liu et al 2014 mu et al 2017 xiong et al 2018 the k obs of each reaction obtained from the different experiments at initial ph 5 was summarized in table 1 the k obs analysis can be seen in fig s3 for the ec process although very poor ibp removal efficiency was obtained fig 6 coagulation was the only way for ibp removal additionally at the same current density the amount of generated al was almost the same in the ec and e hoc process fig s4 therefore the contribution of coagulation in the e hoc process can be calculated based on the proportion of k obs of coagulation to the whole e hoc process and the contribution of coagulation in the e hoc process was 0 23 0 36 0 30 and 0 42 at current densities of 5 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 respectively furthermore the proportion of oh oxidation can be calculated according to the oh trapping experiments e hoc ipa and the contribution of oh oxidation was 90 8 93 0 94 2 and 95 1 at current densities of 5 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 respectively which further demonstrated that most of the ibp was removed by oh oxidation subsequently the contribution of direct molecular ozone oxidation mo reactions could be calculated by the proportion of oh oxidation and coagulation in the whole e hoc system and the result of the calculation was 8 9 6 6 5 4 and 4 5 for different current densities of 5 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 respectively because of the generation of h2o2 peroxone reactions could occur and the contribution 41 4 44 4 46 5 and 48 4 can be acquired according to k obs of the h2o2 trapping experiments e hoc cat the role of peroxone reactions became increasingly important because oh could be continuously generated from the stainless steel cathode in the e hoc system according to eq 8 and enhanced oh formation was expected with the increasing current density to boost the h2o2 generation via o3 decomposition furthermore the contribution of the soc effects between ozone and the generated hydrolysed al species can be quantified by replacing the anode with a ti ruo2 iro2 electrode and therefore the soc effects can be scavenged after the deduction of k obs of ec the contribution of the soc effects can be obtained i e 45 9 46 3 45 3 and 45 5 corresponding to current densities of 5 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 respectively it was found that the contribution of the soc effects was stable with the increasing current density 8 2h2o 2e h2 2oh the aforementioned analyses quantified the roles of the ec molecular ozone oxidation peroxone and the soc effects in the e hoc process however during ozonation without electrolysis oh can be generated either from chain reactions eqs 1 4 or peroxone reactions o3 h2o2 by using the intermediate product h2o2 of o3 decomposition eqs 5 6 therefore besides the peroxone reactions during ozone decomposition oh oxidation from the chain reactions during ozone decomposition ho reactions eqs 1 4 should also be considered in the e hoc process the contribution can be calculated based on the rest of the ec molecular ozone oxidation peroxone and the soc effects in the e hoc process thus the results were 3 6 2 4 2 5 and 1 2 for 5 10 15 20 ma cm2 current densities respectively because ph is a critical factor for ozone decomposition staehelin and hoigne 1982 the stable contribution of the ho reactions can be attributed to the same initial ph value the overall contribution of different reactions can be seen in fig 7 the contribution of the soc effects peroxone reactions mo reactions ho reactions and ec is 46 5 45 3 5 4 2 5 and 0 3 respectively at initial ph 5 under current density 15 ma cm2 for the ibp removal it can be seen that the peroxone reactions and the soc effects played major roles in the e hoc process at initial ph 5 as an important part of the e hoc process the soc effects were elucidated in the following part of this study at initial ph 5 in addition the contribution of the involved reactions in the e hoc process at initial ph 7 and 9 under current density of 15 ma cm2 was also calculated the results of k obs at initial ph 7 and 9 can be seen in fig s5 the k obs of each reaction obtained from different experiments at initial ph 7 and 9 under current density of 15 ma cm2 was summarized in table s1 the contribution of the involved reactions in the e hoc process at different initial ph values can be seen in fig 7b the peroxone reactions and ho reactions played major roles in the e hoc process at initial ph 7 and 9 it was found that the contribution of the soc effects 7 45 at initial ph 7 and 5 91 at initial ph 9 decreased significantly when the initial ph increased to 7 and 9 the ho reactions 51 84 at initial ph 7 and 56 16 at initial ph 9 exhibited the highest and dominant removal contribution at initial ph 7 and 9 this can be attributed to the increased oh ion concentration obtained with the increasing initial ph which initiated the chain reactions to decompose ozone to generate oh chen et al 2017 staehelin and hoigne 1982 because of the electrolysis in the e hoc process oh can be further formed in the stainless steel cathode eq 8 therefore the oh generation through the chain reactions during ozone decomposition was further enhanced 3 4 active sites on hydrolysed al species it was revealed that the soc effects exhibited a stable and major contribution to the ibp removal in the e hoc process at initial ph 5 therefore the mechanism of the soc effects were mainly analysed at initial ph 5 in this study based on the results above and our previous study jin et al 2017 generated al hydrolysed species could act as catalysts to accelerate ozone decomposition therefore enhancing the generation of oh for the soc effects in the e hoc process active sites are considered to be the potential catalytic centres responsible for ozone decomposition in catalytic ozonation nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation many studies have confirmed the interaction between adsorbed ozone and active sites to generate ros brodu et al 2013 yuan et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 therefore identifying the active sites on the hydrolysed al species is critical for elucidating the mechanism of soc effects 3 4 1 effects of phosphate lewis acid sites were proved to be the reactive centre in the catalytic ozonation system wang and bai 2017 in order to verify the catalytic active sites on the surfaces of the hydrolysed species of the coagulants phosphate a common ligand and strong lewis base can lead to the substitution of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface which are considered to be the lewis acid sites jeanine et al 1997 zhu et al 2017 the effect of phosphate on the doc removal performance was investigated in this study 500 mg l phosphate po4 3 was introduced into the e hoc process at initial ph 5 fig 8 a showed the effects of phosphate on wwtp effluent organic matter removal in the e hoc process as indicated in fig 8a the removal efficiency of the e hoc process was decreased by 24 5 26 1 31 4 and 27 3 at current densities of 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 15 ma cm2 and 20 ma cm2 respectively the results revealed that the doc removal efficiency was significantly suppressed at each current density when phosphate was introduced into the system moreover phosphate addition had little effect on the ec process fig s6 these suggested that phosphate occupied the hydroxyl groups on the hydrolysed al species zhu et al 2017 and the interaction between ozone and the generated hydrolysed al species could be inhibited this can verify the importance of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the hydrolysed al species during the interaction between ozone and the coagulants it is generally acknowledged that the po4 al interaction is dependent on the charge density of the hydrolysed al species increased the cationic charge on the hydrolysed al species usually leads to a stronger adsorption of po4 3 diamadopoulos and benedek 1984 lijklema 1980 according to the zeta potential analysis fig 4 the hydrolysed al species with cationic charge were higher as the current density increased which is beneficial for phosphate adsorption leading to more significant inhibition effects nevertheless boisvert et al 1997 reported that phosphate binding is weaker at high ph and high current density will increase the formation of oh at the cathode asaithambi et al 2012 this may be the reason for the slightly decreased inhibition effect of phosphate at 20 ma cm2 furthermore fig 8b shows the effect of phosphate on the e hoc process for the removal of ibp at initial ph 5 and with a current density of 15 ma cm2 it can be seen that the addition of phosphate decreased the ibp removal efficiency at each current density which further proved that phosphate was adsorbed on the hydrolysed al species surface and then held the surface hydroxyl groups leading to a low catalytic activity zhao et al 2015 therefore the results verified that the surface hydroxyl groups of the hydrolysed al species derived from anode electrolysis were supposed to be the active sites for ros generation during the interaction between ozone and the hydrolysed al species in the e hoc process the effect of phosphate on the e hoc process for the removal of ibp at current density 5 10 and 20 ma cm2 can be seen in fig s7 3 4 2 xps analysis in order to further investigate the function of the surface hydroxyl groups in the e hoc process the surface properties of the hydrolysed al species during the different processes were characterized using xps the high resolution al 2p spectra are presented in fig s8 there was a small difference in the characteristic peaks of xps in the different processes a shift less than 0 5 ev is within the range of the typical precision of the xps instrument lin et al 2014 two overlapping bands associated with the two different al 2p transitions generally with binding energies of 74 2 and 73 1 ev respectively thus the al 2p peaks were decomposed into two peaks one for tetrahedral al and the other for octahedral al duong et al 2005 lin et al 2014 the ratio of the different al species can be obtained after gaussian fitting using xpspeak software as illustrated in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the content of tetrahedral al reduced in the e hoc process compared with that obtained during the ec process at different current densities there was a slightly decline at 5 ma cm2 whereas a distinct change appeared at 10 ma cm2 15 ma cm2 and 20 ma cm2 which corresponded to 7 4 11 5 7 9 respectively this suggested that the addition of ozone can accelerate the reaction of tetrahedral al it was proved that the surface al in tetrahedral sites is stronger lewis acid sites than the surface al in octahedral sites aurÃ©lien flura et al 2012 therefore tetrahedral al can effectively react with ozone and rapidly decompose molecular ozone into ros fig s9 represents the spectral peak appeared at 530 7 531 5 and 532 4 ev attributed to the peak of the o 1s of lattice oxygen oÎ± surface hydroxyl group oÎ² and adsorbed water oÎ³ respectively ding et al 2016 it should be noted here that the peak area of the surface hydroxyl group is much larger than that of the lattice oxygen and adsorbed water fig 10 this means that the majority of oxygen on the coagulant surface exists as hydroxyl groups meanwhile the proportions of the surface hydroxyl groups on the hydrolysed al species had a significant drop when ozone was introduced this result was consistent with the conclusions obtained by the phosphate experiment fig 8 due to the dipole nature of ozone ozone can be chemically adsorbed on the lewis acid sites of catalysts bing et al 2015 yang et al 2009 additionally al combined hydroxyl groups al oh are strong lewis acid sites wang et al 2018 thus in the e hoc process one oxygen atom of ozone with high electron density could be adsorbed onto al oh and further decomposed into ros which led to the significant drop of the surface hydroxyl group proportions 3 5 proposed mechanism in the e hoc process based on the abovementioned results the mechanism underlying the e hoc process at initial ph 5 was proposed fig 11 during the e hoc process al3 can be generated from the al anode and al3 will form hydrolysed al species via in situ hydrolysis fournier et al 2009 lin et al 2019 therefore coagulation could occur in the e hoc system moreover besides molecular ozone oxidation the ozone in the system can react with oh in the bulk solution or the oh electrolytically generated on the cathode eq 8 to initiate the chain reactions eqs 1 4 the oh generated through the chain reactions during ozone decomposition can also take effect for the ibp removal in addition to the chain reactions during ozone decomposition h2o2 can be formed based on through bimolecular decay reactions of o2 eq 5 zhang et al 2011 and the disproportionation of single electron reduced species o2 eq 6 xiong et al 2018 as a result the peroxone reactions eq 7 played an important role for the ibp removal in the e hoc process based on results above fig 5 and fig s2 the existence of the interaction between ozone and the generated hydrolysed al species was verified in the e hoc system moreover comparable to the peroxone reactions it was revealed that the soc effects played a dominant role in the e hoc process at initial ph 5 fig 7 it was also verified that the surface hydroxyl groups are the active sites for promoting ros generation during the soc reactions the dissolved o3 molecules can interact with the surface hydroxyl groups via electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions to form the al oh o3 configuration with an oxygen bridge connection ren et al 2012 then the surface hydroperoxyl anion ho2 forms via electron transfer and o2 release eq 9 ernst et al 2004 it has been reported that ozone reacts with ho2 approximately 40 000 times faster than with oh and therefore strongly boosts the chain reactions staehelin and hoigne 1982 therefore the reaction between surface ho2 and another molecular ozone results in the formation of one ho3 radical which is released into the bulk solution and one surface adsorbed superoxide anion radical o2 eq 10 jin et al 2019b either ho3 or o2 can initiate chain reactions to form more oxidative oh radicals eq 11 13 zhao et al 2009 the contribution of the involved reactions at the optimal operational condition current density of 15 ma cm2 and initial ph 5 was also demonstrated in fig 11 9 al oh o3 al oh o3 al o2h o2 10 al o2h o3 al o2 ho3 11 ho3 oh o2 12 al o2 o3 oh al oh o3 o2 13 o3 h ho3 oh o2 4 conclusion the e hoc process exhibited higher organic removal efficiency compared with the ec ozonation and pre ozonation ec processes for the treatment of wwtp effluent at optimal operational condition current density of 15 ma cm2 initial ph 5 and ozone dosage of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc 58 6 doc removal efficiency was achieved in the e hoc process based on a series of trapping experiments the formation of oh h2o2 and o2 was confirmed in the e hoc process for the treatment of ibp according to ros detection and the reactions on the electrodes ec molecular ozone oxidation oh oxidation from the chain reactions during ozone decomposition peroxone and soc effects were involved in the e hoc process the quantitative evaluation of the reactions involved in the e hoc process revealed that peroxone reactions and soc effects were the dominant reactions responsible for ibp removal at initial ph 5 with different current densities as an important pathway for organic matter removal in the e hoc process enhanced oh generation can be expected from the soc effects and the surface hydroxyl groups of the hydrolysed al species generated from anode electrolysis were determined to be the active sites responsible for generating ros from the soc effects molecular ozone can interact with surface hydroxyl groups to further generate oh declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17961,in order to improve the dissolved organic matter removal efficiency an electro hybrid ozonation coagulation e hoc system was developed in this study in which the electro coagulation ec and ozonation occurred simultaneously in one integrated unit higher removal efficiency was observed for the e hoc process compared with those of ec ozonation and pre ozonation ec process for the treatment of wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent and ibuprofen ibp 58 6 dissolved organic carbon doc removal efficiency was achieved in the e hoc process for the treatment of wwtp effluent at optimal operational condition current density 15 ma cm2 initial ph 5 and ozone dosage 1 5 mg o3 mg doc based on the reactive oxygen species ros detection and reactions on the electrodes the synergistic effects between ozone and coagulants soc were found to be involved in the e hoc process according to pseudo first order rate constant analyses the contribution of five possible organic removal pathways was quantified it was revealed that the peroxone and soc effects exhibited almost equal contribution to ibp removal at initial ph 5 under different current densities both of which played the dominant role in the e hoc process however the contribution of the soc effects decreased significantly when the initial ph increased to 7 and 9 as an important pathway for organic removal in the e hoc process at initial ph 5 the mechanism of the soc effects was analysed at initial ph 5 it was revealed the soc effects can further improve hydroxyl radicals oh generation and the surface hydroxyl groups of the hydrolysed al species generated from anode electrolysis were determined to be the active sites to generate ros in the soc effects graphical abstract image 1 keywords electro hoc process reactive oxygen species synergistic effects surface hydroxyl groups 1 introduction the combination of ultraviolet radiation hydrogen peroxide h2o2 metal ions metal oxides electrochemistry etc with the conventional ozonation process is an effective way to improve the organic matter removal efficiency because of the enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals oh nawrocki 2013 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 among these catalytic ozonation processes combining electrochemistry and ozone e g electro peroxone is an efficient process due to its simplicity strong oxidation potential environment friendly and do not require addition reagents akbari et al 2016 barzegar et al 2019 xiong et al 2018 for the electro peroxone process h2o2 is produced electrochemically from oxygen o2 reduction in cathode during ozonation xia et al 2017 yao et al 2019 the in situ generated h2o2 can then enhance the decomposition of ozone o3 to oh bakheet et al 2013 guo et al 2018 our previous study found that al based coagulants can also enhance oh generation during ozonation and there are synergistic effects between ozone and coagulants soc jin et al 2017 2019a 2019b because of the addition of al based coagulants during the ozonation process ozonation and coagulation simultaneously occur within a single unit consequently the hybrid ozonation coagulation hoc process was put forward in our previous work jin et al 2017 in which chemical coagulation played an important role however in addition to chemical coagulation electro coagulation ec is gaining recognition as an alternative process due to the electric induction ec involves the electrolytic oxidation of an appropriate anode material aluminum and iron and in situ generation of metal ions which act as coagulants lakshmanan et al 2009 ratna kumar et al 2004 wan et al 2011 therefore electro hoc process e hoc can be proposed based on the integration of ec and hoc process however little data can be obtained related to the quantitative contribution of soc effects in the e hoc process for the organic matter removal actually similar to the e hoc process several studies integrated ozonation process with ec process to form electrolysis ozone eco process for the treatment of distillery industrial effluent asaithambi et al 2016a 2016b textile wastewater biliÅska et al 2019 mixed industrial wastewater from an industrial park barrera dÃ­az et al 2012 and greywater barzegar et al 2019 with the use of the iron anode when ozone bubbled into the ec aqueous solution fe eco process redox reactions took place in which ozone decomposes after its reaction with fe2 ions to form the intermediate ion feo2 which consequently reacts with water to form oh and fe3 ions bernal martÃ­nez et al 2010 xiong et al 2018 consequently the eco process exhibited higher organic removal efficiency compared with ozonation and ec process asaithambi et al 2016a it was revealed that the possible reactions in the fe eco process included homogeneous catalytic ozonation fe2 o3 peroxone reactions o3 h2o2 fenton reactions fe2 h2o2 molecular ozone oxidation and coagulation xiong et al 2018 homogeneous catalytic ozonation and fenton reactions were dominant reactions in the fe eco process under initial ph 3 and homogeneous catalytic ozonation and peroxone reactions were pivotal reactions in the fe eco process under initial ph 6 6 xiong et al 2018 despite of the structural similarities the interactions between electrolytically generated hydrolysed metal species and ozone were not considered in the previously proposed eco process nevertheless besides al and fe anodes most of the anodes in the eco process could be stable electrodes such as ruo2 ti tio2 ti etc kishimoto et al 2005 li et al 2019 2020 the organic removal using the stable anodes is mainly through direct electron transfer from organic matter and water oxidation to form oh on the surface of anodes different from the e hoc process there are no ec effects in the eco process using stable electrodes in addition most studies applied iron anodes for the treatment of industrial wastewater asaithambi et al 2016b biliÅska et al 2019 or greywater barzegar et al 2019 in the eco process nevertheless al based coagulants are the most commonly used coagulants in water and wastewater treatment jarvis et al 2012 sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ et al 2018 matilainen et al 2010 reported that aluminum based coagulants tend to have higher color and turbidity removal efficiencies in comparison with the ferric ones if al anodes are applied the dissolution of the al anodes resulted in the formation of mononuclear species aloh2 al oh 2 al oh 3 al oh 4 polynuclear species al2 oh 2 4 al3 oh 4 5 al7 oh 17 4 al13o4 oh 24 7 fournier et al 2009 lin et al 2019 previous study also indicated that the ec with al anodes exhibited higher removal efficiency in the treatment of three different natural organic matter nom samples than that with fe anodes ulu et al 2015 moreover devlin et al 2019 found that ec process with al electrode provided the best and most reliable removal of chemical oxygen demand cod in comparison with iron and magnesium electrodes in the treatment of primary influent from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp this can be attributed to the higher neutralization ability of al coagulants compared with fe coagulants wan et al 2019 therefore the performance of the e hoc process using al anodes is worth investigation in this study the e hoc system using aluminium anode and stainless steel cathode was developed to investigate the removal performance of wwtp effluent and ibuprofen ibp the optimal operational condition of the e hoc process was determined quantitative evaluation of reactions involved in the e hoc system was conducted including the soc effects in addition the active reaction sites and reactive oxygen species ros generation were also revealed in the soc effects to further elucidate the mechanism of the e hoc process 2 materials and methods 2 1

thickness the interelectrode gap was maintained as 2 cm the electrodes were vertically installed through a slit in the lid of the reactor and suspended into the solution the electrodes were polished with sandpapers and then cleaned with a 1 m hcl solution for 10 min which were followed successively by rinsing with deionized water and finally drying for use the electrodes were connected to a direct current dc power supply jp5200d annaisi china the current density is obtained by dividing the imposed current intensity by the effective surface area of the anode the reactor was stirred magnetically with a gentle stirring rate of 100 rpm to create enough reaction time a schematic diagram of the reactor is presented in fig 1 the al anodes were replaced by ti ruo2 iro2 zhiming special metal co ltd china with same dimensional size of 7 6 0 1 cm length width thickness to evaluate the contribution of generated al species phosphate buffer was transferred to the water sample to achieve a final concentration of 0 2 mm and the initial ph of the water samples was adjusted by 0 1 m naoh or 1 9 hno3 1 43 m ozone stock solution was added to the proper concentration via an inlet tube ibp

the removal performance of the e hoc process 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 dissolved organic carbon doc analysis doc was measured using a shimadzu tocvcph analyser with infrared detection all samples were filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m filter acidified with h2so4 and purged with nitrogen for 3 min to remove inorganic carbon before the measurement all the measurements were performed in duplicate or

70 30 was used the flow rate was maintained at 1 0 ml min 2 3 3 zeta potential analysis the zeta potential measurements were conducted using a laser zeta analyser malvern zetasizer nano zs90 uk the samples were obtained at 3 cm above the bottom of reactor and analysed immediately to prevent zeta potential variation each result was the average of three readings 2 3 4 x ray photoelectron

time constant of 81 92 ms sweep time of 35 s and receiver gain 30 db the radical trapping agent added to the reaction system was 100 mm dmpo 3 results and discussions 3 1 removal performance in the e hoc process to test the removal performance and obtain the optimal operational conditions of the e hoc process a series of experiments were conducted at different initial ph values initial ph 5 7 and 9 the ph variation during the e hoc process at different initial ph values can be seen in fig s1 ozone dosages 1 1 5 and 2 0 mg o3 mg doc and current densities 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 15 ma cm2 and 20 ma cm2 the results are shown in fig 2 with increasing of the current densities the removal efficiency of doc increased and then reached a peak value of 58 6 at 15 ma cm2 the current density is directly proportional to the coagulant dosage according to faraday s law therefore the rate of dissolution of aluminum electrode increased with the increasing current density however further increasing current density above 15 ma cm2 reduced the doc removal efficiency zhu et al 2007 reported that at high current density the rapid release of al3 and oh ions from the surface of electrode will make the solution around the anode and cathode extremely acidic or basic respectively which will decrease the removal efficiency in addition an excessive current density may also cause the excess oxygen evolution and other adverse effects such as heat generation mollah and pathak 2004 according to fig 2 the optimal ozone dosage was 1 5 mg o3 mg doc higher ozone dosage 2 0 mg o3 mg doc can deteriorate the e hoc removal performance this can be attributed to the over oxidation of macromolecular organics to generate the small molecule organic matters of high hydrophilicity bose and reckhow 2007 reckhow and legube 1986 in addition excessive ozonation can reduce the surface charge of flocs and hinder adsorptive removal of the anionic organic molecules by floc surfaces which decreased the doc removal efficiency edwards et al 1993 therefore according to fig 2 the optimal current density and ozone dosage for the e hoc process were 15 ma cm2 and 1 5 mg o3 mg doc respectively in addition fig 2d compared the doc removal performance of the ec e hoc pre ozonation ec and single ozonation processes according to fig 2d the e hoc process exhibited the highest doc removal efficiency at different initial ph values the averaged doc removal efficiency increased by 20 0 14 8 and 8 6 relative to that of the ec process at initial ph 5 7 and 9 respectively moreover the averaged doc removal efficiency of the e hoc exhibited 19 4 17 5 and 10 2 higher than the pre ozonation ec process at initial ph 5 7 and 9 respectively in contrast only approximate 13 doc removal efficiency was achieved at different initial ph values by the ozonation process the little improvement of pre ozonation ec process compared with ec process can be attributed to the deteriorated ec performance after pre ozonation asaithambi et al 2016a also observed that the combination of ozonation and ec process was the most effective process resulting in 100 color removal and 97 50 cod removal efficiency for the treatment of distillery industrial effluent compared with those of the ozonation and ec processes alone in particular the average doc removal efficiency of the e hoc process reached 58 6 at 1 5 mg o3 mg doc at initial ph 5 while only 45 2 and 42 2 removal efficiencies can be obtained at initial ph 7 and 9 respectively with the increasing ph value the amount of hydroxide ions increased in the solution consequently some of the hydroxide ions may be oxidized at the anode which reduced the production of aluminium ions mouedhen et al 2008 picard et al 2000 moreover the soluble al oh 4 ions may be produced at high ph omwene and kobya 2018 which reduced the electrical neutralization capacity thereby decreasing the doc removal efficiency under weak acidic conditions abundant positively charged aluminium polyhydroxo complexes al oh 2 al oh 2 al3 oh 4 5 al13o4 oh 24 7 etc and al oh 3 s are formed these gelatinous charged al hydroxo cationic complexes can effectively remove pollutants by adsorption to produce charge neutralization and by enmeshment in a precipitate omwene and kobya 2018 hence based on the removal performance of the e hoc process for the treatment of wwtp effluent initial ph 5 was selected as the optimal ph value in the further analyses for this study the doc removal performance during the e hoc process at different current densities was further investigated at 1 5 mg o3 mg doc and initial ph 5 as shown in fig 3 the doc removal efficiency increased sharply within first 5 min beyond which no significant improvement was observed according to fig 3 favorable doc removal performance was achieved at the current density of 15 ma cm2 however further increasing of the current density above 15 ma cm2 reduced the doc removal efficiency which is consistent with fig 2 the zeta potential evolution during the e hoc process at different current densities was further analysed in this study at initial ph 5 fig 4 the initial zeta potential of the suspension is 12 6 mv at initial ph 5 as aluminium anodic dissolution proceeds a sharp rise in the zeta potential was measured for all current densities which indicated positively charged hydrolysed species formation the adsorption of the positively charged hydrolysed species on the negatively charged particles led to charge neutralization and lower zeta potential values which resulted in better coagulation performance as depicted by the increasing doc removal efficiencies in addition with excess amount of positively charged aluminium hydrolysed species the zeta potential values were close to zero charge reversal was observed at 8 9 min 6 3 min and 4 3 min during the ec process while in the e hoc process charge reversal occurred at 8 5 min 5 4 min and 4 1 min for current densities of 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 respectively it was worth noting that a shift forward of the isoelectric point iep can be observed in the e hoc process which indicated that doc removal can be achieved in a shorter time nevertheless when the current density was 5 ma cm2 the zeta potential of formed flocs was negative and almost constant for the ec or e hoc process in this study furthermore fig 4 showed that a small drop in the zeta potential was observed for all the current densities at the end of reaction this can be attributed to the generation of aluminate ions al oh 4 which became the predominant species and cannot be adsorbed on the negatively charged particles hence the doc removal efficiencies were no longer improved to further test the removal performance of the e hoc process ibp was selected as the target contaminant to evaluate the removal performance at current densities of 5 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 and initial ph 5 the ozone dosage for the treatment of ibp was 10 9 mg l which was calculated from the optimal ozone dosage for the treatment of wwtp effluent based on average doc 7 276 1 943 mg l the results are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that the removal efficiency improved with the increasing current density because ibp exhibited high reactivity to oh k ibp oh 7 4 109 m 1s 1 but low reactivity to o3 molecule k ibp o3 9 1 m 1s 1 huber et al 2003 and ibp cannot be removed by ec fig 6 the ibp removal can be attributed to oh oxidation the higher current density indicated higher aluminium generation in the anode and more oh formation in the cathode it is well known that ozone can react with oh to initiate the chain reactions to generate oh liu et al 2015 staehelin and hoigne 1982 yong and lin 2012 based on our previous study al based coagulants could also act as catalysts to enhance oh generation during ozonation jin et al 2017 2019b additionally ozone decomposition can also generate o2 through chain reactions eqs 1 4 ernst et al 2004 sridharan et al 2013 h2o2 can be formed through the bimolecular decay reactions of o2 eq 5 zhang et al 2011 and the disproportionation of single electron reduced species o2 eq 6 during ozone decomposition xiong et al 2018 however according to fig 5 the e hoc process exhibited obviously higher removal efficiency than the e hoc process using ti ruo2 iro2 anode which is a kind of stable electrode and few metal ions can be released into the solution sun et al 2020 xiong et al 2018 the comparison between the e hoc with al anode and the e hoc with ti ruo2 iro2 anode further demonstrated that there were soc effects from anode and oh can be generated through the synergistic interactions in addition compared with the single ozonation process the higher removal performance in the e hoc with ti ruo2 iro2 anode can be attributed to the higher conductivity and enhanced generation of oh in the cathode 1 o3 oh o2 ho2 2 o2 o3 o2 o3 3 o3 h ho3 4 ho3 o2 oh 5 2 ho2 o2 h2o2 6 o2 ho2 h2o h2o2 o2 oh 3 2 ros generation in electrolysis ozone process according to fig 5 the higher ibp removal efficiency could be attributed to the enhanced ros formation in the e hoc process in order to verify the ros generation in the e hoc process a series of trapping experiments were carried out by adding isopropanol ipa oh scavenger catalase cat h2o2 scavenger and p benzoquinone bq o2 scavenger the results can be seen in fig 6 it was found that the ibp removal efficiency was inhibited after adding ipa cat or bq which indicated the generation of oh h2o2 and o2 respectively it has long been known that h2o2 can be electro generated on the suitable carbon based cathode brillas et al 2009 nevertheless h2o2 cannot be directly generated on the stainless steel cathode in the reaction of electrolysis system according to existing theories xiong et al 2018 therefore there are two possible ways to generate h2o2 i e the bimolecular decay reaction of o2 during ozone decomposition and single electron transfer derived from o2 in the presence of o2 o2 o2 h2o2 however as shown in fig 6 the electrolysis oxygen ec o2 process was applied for the treatment of ibp and very poor ibp removal efficiency can be obtained which is almost the same removal performance as that achieved by the ec process as a result the h2o2 generated during the e hoc process can be only derived from ozone decomposition in this study because of the formation of h2o2 peroxone reactions o3 h2o2 eq 7 could occur during the e hoc process and as a consequence oh can also be generated from the peroxone reactions in addition to the soc effects the generation of oh was also verified through epr analyses using dmpo as a trapping agent for ozonation e hoc with al anode and e hoc with ti ruo2 iro2 anode under the current density of 15 ma cm2 at initial ph 5 fig s2 it was observed that the generation of oh in the e hoc process with al anode was the highest among the three processes which further proved the occurrence of the soc effects in the e hoc process 7 2o3 h2o2 2 oh 3o2 3 3 quantitative evaluation of reactions in the e hoc process according to the abovementioned analyses there could be multiple reactions during the e hoc process in addition to the soc effects which was the key focus in this study there are also ec molecular ozone oxidation mo reactions peroxone o3 h2o2 and oh oxidation from chain reactions during ozone decomposition ho reactions in the e hoc process in order to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the different reactions for ibp removal at different current densities the proportion of the pseudo first order rate constant k obs of each reaction in the whole e hoc process was applied based on the conducted experiments and inhibitory efficiency of different scavengers liu et al 2014 mu et al 2017 xiong et al 2018 the k obs of each reaction obtained from the different experiments at initial ph 5 was summarized in table 1 the k obs analysis can be seen in fig s3 for the ec process although very poor ibp removal efficiency was obtained fig 6 coagulation was the only way for ibp removal additionally at the same current density the amount of generated al was almost the same in the ec and e hoc process fig s4 therefore the contribution of coagulation in the e hoc process can be calculated based on the proportion of k obs of coagulation to the whole e hoc process and the contribution of coagulation in the e hoc process was 0 23 0 36 0 30 and 0 42 at current densities of 5 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 respectively furthermore the proportion of oh oxidation can be calculated according to the oh trapping experiments e hoc ipa and the contribution of oh oxidation was 90 8 93 0 94 2 and 95 1 at current densities of 5 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 respectively which further demonstrated that most of the ibp was removed by oh oxidation subsequently the contribution of direct molecular ozone oxidation mo reactions could be calculated by the proportion of oh oxidation and coagulation in the whole e hoc system and the result of the calculation was 8 9 6 6 5 4 and 4 5 for different current densities of 5 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 respectively because of the generation of h2o2 peroxone reactions could occur and the contribution 41 4 44 4 46 5 and 48 4 can be acquired according to k obs of the h2o2 trapping experiments e hoc cat the role of peroxone reactions became increasingly important because oh could be continuously generated from the stainless steel cathode in the e hoc system according to eq 8 and enhanced oh formation was expected with the increasing current density to boost the h2o2 generation via o3 decomposition furthermore the contribution of the soc effects between ozone and the generated hydrolysed al species can be quantified by replacing the anode with a ti ruo2 iro2 electrode and therefore the soc effects can be scavenged after the deduction of k obs of ec the contribution of the soc effects can be obtained i e 45 9 46 3 45 3 and 45 5 corresponding to current densities of 5 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 respectively it was found that the contribution of the soc effects was stable with the increasing current density 8 2h2o 2e h2 2oh the aforementioned analyses quantified the roles of the ec molecular ozone oxidation peroxone and the soc effects in the e hoc process however during ozonation without electrolysis oh can be generated either from chain reactions eqs 1 4 or peroxone reactions o3 h2o2 by using the intermediate product h2o2 of o3 decomposition eqs 5 6 therefore besides the peroxone reactions during ozone decomposition oh oxidation from the chain reactions during ozone decomposition ho reactions eqs 1 4 should also be considered in the e hoc process the contribution can be calculated based on the rest of the ec molecular ozone oxidation peroxone and the soc effects in the e hoc process thus the results were 3 6 2 4 2 5 and 1 2 for 5 10 15 20 ma cm2 current densities respectively because ph is a critical factor for ozone decomposition staehelin and hoigne 1982 the stable contribution of the ho reactions can be attributed to the same initial ph value the overall contribution of different reactions can be seen in fig 7 the contribution of the soc effects peroxone reactions mo reactions ho reactions and ec is 46 5 45 3 5 4 2 5 and 0 3 respectively at initial ph 5 under current density 15 ma cm2 for the ibp removal it can be seen that the peroxone reactions and the soc effects played major roles in the e hoc process at initial ph 5 as an important part of the e hoc process the soc effects were elucidated in the following part of this study at initial ph 5 in addition the contribution of the involved reactions in the e hoc process at initial ph 7 and 9 under current density of 15 ma cm2 was also calculated the results of k obs at initial ph 7 and 9 can be seen in fig s5 the k obs of each reaction obtained from different experiments at initial ph 7 and 9 under current density of 15 ma cm2 was summarized in table s1 the contribution of the involved reactions in the e hoc process at different initial ph values can be seen in fig 7b the peroxone reactions and ho reactions played major roles in the e hoc process at initial ph 7 and 9 it was found that the contribution of the soc effects 7 45 at initial ph 7 and 5 91 at initial ph 9 decreased significantly when the initial ph increased to 7 and 9 the ho reactions 51 84 at initial ph 7 and 56 16 at initial ph 9 exhibited the highest and dominant removal contribution at initial ph 7 and 9 this can be attributed to the increased oh ion concentration obtained with the increasing initial ph which initiated the chain reactions to decompose ozone to generate oh chen et al 2017 staehelin and hoigne 1982 because of the electrolysis in the e hoc process oh can be further formed in the stainless steel cathode eq 8 therefore the oh generation through the chain reactions during ozone decomposition was further enhanced 3 4 active sites on hydrolysed al species it was revealed that the soc effects exhibited a stable and major contribution to the ibp removal in the e hoc process at initial ph 5 therefore the mechanism of the soc effects were mainly analysed at initial ph 5 in this study based on the results above and our previous study jin et al 2017 generated al hydrolysed species could act as catalysts to accelerate ozone decomposition therefore enhancing the generation of oh for the soc effects in the e hoc process active sites are considered to be the potential catalytic centres responsible for ozone decomposition in catalytic ozonation nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation many studies have confirmed the interaction between adsorbed ozone and active sites to generate ros brodu et al 2013 yuan et al 2016 zhao et al 2015 therefore identifying the active sites on the hydrolysed al species is critical for elucidating the mechanism of soc effects 3 4 1 effects of phosphate lewis acid sites were proved to be the reactive centre in the catalytic ozonation system wang and bai 2017 in order to verify the catalytic active sites on the surfaces of the hydrolysed species of the coagulants phosphate a common ligand and strong lewis base can lead to the substitution of hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface which are considered to be the lewis acid sites jeanine et al 1997 zhu et al 2017 the effect of phosphate on the doc removal performance was investigated in this study 500 mg l phosphate po4 3 was introduced into the e hoc process at initial ph 5 fig 8 a showed the effects of phosphate on wwtp effluent organic matter removal in the e hoc process as indicated in fig 8a the removal efficiency of the e hoc process was decreased by 24 5 26 1 31 4 and 27 3 at current densities of 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 15 ma cm2 and 20 ma cm2 respectively the results revealed that the doc removal efficiency was significantly suppressed at each current density when phosphate was introduced into the system moreover phosphate addition had little effect on the ec process fig s6 these suggested that phosphate occupied the hydroxyl groups on the hydrolysed al species zhu et al 2017 and the interaction between ozone and the generated hydrolysed al species could be inhibited this can verify the importance of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the hydrolysed al species during the interaction between ozone and the coagulants it is generally acknowledged that the po4 al interaction is dependent on the charge density of the hydrolysed al species increased the cationic charge on the hydrolysed al species usually leads to a stronger adsorption of po4 3 diamadopoulos and benedek 1984 lijklema 1980 according to the zeta potential analysis fig 4 the hydrolysed al species with cationic charge were higher as the current density increased which is beneficial for phosphate adsorption leading to more significant inhibition effects nevertheless boisvert et al 1997 reported that phosphate binding is weaker at high ph and high current density will increase the formation of oh at the cathode asaithambi et al 2012 this may be the reason for the slightly decreased inhibition effect of phosphate at 20 ma cm2 furthermore fig 8b shows the effect of phosphate on the e hoc process for the removal of ibp at initial ph 5 and with a current density of 15 ma cm2 it can be seen that the addition of phosphate decreased the ibp removal efficiency at each current density which further proved that phosphate was adsorbed on the hydrolysed al species surface and then held the surface hydroxyl groups leading to a low catalytic activity zhao et al 2015 therefore the results verified that the surface hydroxyl groups of the hydrolysed al species derived from anode electrolysis were supposed to be the active sites for ros generation during the interaction between ozone and the hydrolysed al species in the e hoc process the effect of phosphate on the e hoc process for the removal of ibp at current density 5 10 and 20 ma cm2 can be seen in fig s7 3 4 2 xps analysis in order to further investigate the function of the surface hydroxyl groups in the e hoc process the surface properties of the hydrolysed al species during the different processes were characterized using xps the high resolution al 2p spectra are presented in fig s8 there was a small difference in the characteristic peaks of xps in the different processes a shift less than 0 5 ev is within the range of the typical precision of the xps instrument lin et al 2014 two overlapping bands associated with the two different al 2p transitions generally with binding energies of 74 2 and 73 1 ev respectively thus the al 2p peaks were decomposed into two peaks one for tetrahedral al and the other for octahedral al duong et al 2005 lin et al 2014 the ratio of the different al species can be obtained after gaussian fitting using xpspeak software as illustrated in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the content of tetrahedral al reduced in the e hoc process compared with that obtained during the ec process at different current densities there was a slightly decline at 5 ma cm2 whereas a distinct change appeared at 10 ma cm2 15 ma cm2 and 20 ma cm2 which corresponded to 7 4 11 5 7 9 respectively this suggested that the addition of ozone can accelerate the reaction of tetrahedral al it was proved that the surface al in tetrahedral sites is stronger lewis acid sites than the surface al in octahedral sites aurÃ©lien flura et al 2012 therefore tetrahedral al can effectively react with ozone and rapidly decompose molecular ozone into ros fig s9 represents the spectral peak appeared at 530 7 531 5 and 532 4 ev attributed to the peak of the o 1s of lattice oxygen oÎ± surface hydroxyl group oÎ² and adsorbed water oÎ³ respectively ding et al 2016 it should be noted here that the peak area of the surface hydroxyl group is much larger than that of the lattice oxygen and adsorbed water fig 10 this means that the majority of oxygen on the coagulant surface exists as hydroxyl groups meanwhile the proportions of the surface hydroxyl groups on the hydrolysed al species had a significant drop when ozone was introduced this result was consistent with the conclusions obtained by the phosphate experiment fig 8 due to the dipole nature of ozone ozone can be chemically adsorbed on the lewis acid sites of catalysts bing et al 2015 yang et al 2009 additionally al combined hydroxyl groups al oh are strong lewis acid sites wang et al 2018 thus in the e hoc process one oxygen atom of ozone with high electron density could be adsorbed onto al oh and further decomposed into ros which led to the significant drop of the surface hydroxyl group proportions 3 5 proposed mechanism in the e hoc process based on the abovementioned results the mechanism underlying the e hoc process at initial ph 5 was proposed fig 11 during the e hoc process al3 can be generated from the al anode and al3 will form hydrolysed al species via in situ hydrolysis fournier et al 2009 lin et al 2019 therefore coagulation could occur in the e hoc system moreover besides molecular ozone oxidation the ozone in the system can react with oh in the bulk solution or the oh electrolytically generated on the cathode eq 8 to initiate the chain reactions eqs 1 4 the oh generated through the chain reactions during ozone decomposition can also take effect for the ibp removal in addition to the chain reactions during ozone decomposition h2o2 can be formed based on through bimolecular decay reactions of o2 eq 5 zhang et al 2011 and the disproportionation of single electron reduced species o2 eq 6 xiong et al 2018 as a result the peroxone reactions eq 7 played an important role for the ibp removal in the e hoc process based on results above fig 5 and fig s2 the existence of the interaction between ozone and the generated hydrolysed al species was verified in the e hoc system moreover comparable to the peroxone reactions it was revealed that the soc effects played a dominant role in the e hoc process at initial ph 5 fig 7 it was also verified that the surface hydroxyl groups are the active sites for promoting ros generation during the soc reactions the dissolved o3 molecules can interact with the surface hydroxyl groups via electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions to form the al oh o3 configuration with an oxygen bridge connection ren et al 2012 then the surface hydroperoxyl anion ho2 forms via electron transfer and o2 release eq 9 ernst et al 2004 it has been reported that ozone reacts with ho2 approximately 40 000 times faster than with oh and therefore strongly boosts the chain reactions staehelin and hoigne 1982 therefore the reaction between surface ho2 and another molecular ozone results in the formation of one ho3 radical which is released into the bulk solution and one surface adsorbed superoxide anion radical o2 eq 10 jin et al 2019b either ho3 or o2 can initiate chain reactions to form more oxidative oh radicals eq 11 13 zhao et al 2009 the contribution of the involved reactions at the optimal operational condition current density of 15 ma cm2 and initial ph 5 was also demonstrated in fig 11 9 al oh o3 al oh o3 al o2h o2 10 al o2h o3 al o2 ho3 11 ho3 oh o2 12 al o2 o3 oh al oh o3 o2 13 o3 h ho3 oh o2 4 conclusion the e hoc process exhibited higher organic removal efficiency compared with the ec ozonation and pre ozonation ec processes for the treatment of wwtp effluent at optimal operational condition current density of 15 ma cm2 initial ph 5 and ozone dosage of 1 5 mg o3 mg doc 58 6 doc removal efficiency was achieved in the e hoc process based on a series of trapping experiments the formation of oh h2o2 and o2 was confirmed in the e hoc process for the treatment of ibp according to ros detection and the reactions on the electrodes ec molecular ozone oxidation oh oxidation from the chain reactions during ozone decomposition peroxone and soc effects were involved in the e hoc process the quantitative evaluation of the reactions involved in the e hoc process revealed that peroxone reactions and soc effects were the dominant reactions responsible for ibp removal at initial ph 5 with different current densities as an important pathway for organic matter removal in the e hoc process enhanced oh generation can be expected from the soc effects and the surface hydroxyl groups of the hydrolysed al species generated from anode electrolysis were determined to be the active sites responsible for generating ros from the soc effects molecular ozone can interact with surface hydroxyl groups to further generate oh declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17962,predicting recreational water quality is one of the most difficult tasks in water management with major implications for humans and society many data driven models have been used to predict water quality indicators to allow a real time assessment of public health risk this assessment is most commonly based on faecal indicator bacteria fib with the value of fib compared with thresholds published in guidelines however fib values usually tend to be unbalanced within water quality datasets with small proportions of data exceeding guideline thresholds and far larger numbers that do not this can be a limiting factor in the uptake of model predictions since even if the overall accuracy is high the sensitivity of the predictions can be low to address this issue this paper proposes an adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm adasyn to generate synthetic above threshold fib instances and test the validity of the approach for the prediction of recreational water quality the models in this paper are based on four machine learning techniques k mean nearest neighbour boosting decision tree support vector machine and multi layer perceptron artificial neural network and are applied to five different locations in auckland new zealand aside from support vector machine all models provide favourable predictions with relatively high sensitivity around 75 and overall accuracy over 90 indicating that both the compliant and exceedance conditions can be effectively predicted through the use of more sophisticated model training which involves artificial data considering the model accuracy and stability boosting decision trees bdt and multi layer perceptron artificial neural mlp ann network are the best two models and the multi layer perceptron is the most efficient with the shortest computation time graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm nearest neighbour boosting decision tree support vector machine artificial neural network 1 introduction robust and reliable information about the water quality at beaches is of vital importance as it is used to inform managers about public health risk from recreation in water thoe and lee 2013 stidson et al 2012 francy et al 2013 wade et al 2008 beach water quality is widely monitored using faecal indicator bacteria fib which commonly involves the measurement of enterococci or escherichia coli concentrations in water monitoring results are usually assessed for compliance with guidelines and guideline exceedances trigger advisories or warnings for beach users de brauwere et al 2014 castelletti et al 2014 marshall et al 1997 king and richardson 2003 the laboratory tests for fib typically take up to 24 h using the most probable method mpn however once the time for sample collection and interpretation and communication of results are included the test result is not publicly available probably for up to 48 h after sample collection this results in water quality information that is potentially out of date because water quality can change faster than the analysis time for this reason much effort has been invested in trying to predict fib concentrations in real time with a range of process and data driven based models utilised for this purpose e g bae et al 2010 abyaneh 2014 thoe and lee 2013 he and he 2008 the vast majority of models used to predict water quality are data driven statistical and categorical and are therefore sensitive to the data used in their development thoe et al 2014 chen and liu 2015 li et al 2019 for example all these models faced the issue of unbalanced datasets whereby the number of data points that are compliant with guidelines is always much more than the data exceeding the guideline thresholds for fib therefore the models are usually good at predicting compliant conditions rather exceedance condition chandramouli et al 2007 and tufail et al 2008 used artificial neural networks ann to predict water quality and found that they slightly outperformed traditional regression models however they only considered the overall accuracy which can lead to a significant bias due to the original dataset which contains a disproportionately large proportion of compliant data points i e when the fib is below the guideline threshold in 2010 kazemi yazdi and scholz assessed water quality based on surface runoff through an ann model and compared the ann with a multi linear regression model mlr the ann outperformed mlr in predicting the runoff treatment since it has a higher ability to capture the nonlinear relationship between water quality and microbial factors they focused on the exploration of the relation between the quality indicator and the impact factor but failed to provide details on the model validation aspect qin et al 2012 introduced an advanced boosting tree based machine learning model but did not compare their results to other models thoe et al 2014 applied three regression models as well as classification trees ct and ann they assessed model results in terms of overall accuracy but also sensitivity and specificity and concluded that ct and ann performed better than regression models here the overall accuracy refers to the model successfully predicting below and above threshold data sensitivity assesses the model s ability to predict only exceeding data and specificity assesses the prediction of compliant data even in this case sensitivity was still low probably as a result of the bias to the much more non exceeding data in the training dataset bedri et al 2016 wang et al 2016 shaw et al 2017 besides these models the capability of multi layer perceptron ann to predict water quality has been demonstrated in recent years zhang et al 2015 garcÃ­a alba et al 2019 however such studies considered ann as a component to be integrated within other models and did not present comparisons with other machine learning techniques granata et al 2017 and haghiabi et al 2018 used several machine learning methods to forecast water quality and reported a significant overestimation of good water quality but did not explore the reasoning moreover the data sets they used to training the networks were still unbalanced it is well known that ann and other machine learning methods need a good quality training dataset to provide reliable and accurate results in 2012 motamarri and boccelli developed a machine learning model to classify the recreational water quality at a river scale they found that a neural based learning vector quantization model outperformed both mlr and ann and revealed that all the predictions heavily relied on the validity of the characteristics of the training samples however the biggest issue for recreational water quality datasets stay unsloved that they are always unbalanced with the vast majority of the dataset below guideline thresholds and only a very small amount of data exceeding the guideline thresholds thoe et al 2012 garcÃ­a alba et al 2019 when training data driven models an unbalanced dataset increases the possibility of information loss in the minority class and overfitting in the majority class which cannot be easily addressed by only reducing or duplicating data samples batista et al 2004 kim et al 2014 also pointed out to this problem when trying to monitor the water quality using satellite data using three machine learning approaches the limited training data especially for bad water conditions weakened the predictions to address the unbalanced sample issue the synthetic minority over sampling technique smote is often used in other fields han et al 2005 luengo et al 2011 smote generates artificial samples by interpolating values between majority and minority classes however using this method the synthetic samples are still more likely to be distributed in the interior of the minority class luengo et al 2011 this limitation can be overcome through the advanced adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm adasyn adasyn which can create more samples at the boundary between the two classes and improve training accuracy he et al 2008 gosain and sardana 2017 however in the published adasyn studies the data dimension is usually low with no more than three input variables therefore its efficiency on high dimensional data still needs to be assessed in addition most studies focus on one site and one model or at best compare two types of models at one location usually ann and linear regression are compared thoe et al 2012 chan et al 2013 thoe et al 2014 and danades et al 2016 addressed the issue by comparing three or more different models to reveal their strengths and weaknesses but only at one location other studies focused on multiple locations but considered only one model garcÃ­a alba et al 2019 therefore a sensitivity analysis using different locations and different algorithms has not yet been performed to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies our study provides a comprehensive comparison of four machine learning algorithms predicting fib at five beaches in auckland new zealand the objectives are 1 to address the problem of unbalanced water quality datasets by applying adasyn to improve the training of the predictive algorithm 2 to assess the ability of machine learning models when using a balanced dataset 3 to compare the different model results at different locations using different machine learning models by completing these objectives we try to answer two questions can we use artificial water samples to balance the original dataset for machine learning models and does a balanced dataset improve prediction capability 2 study area and data 2 1 study sites the five study sites milford beach narrow neck beach judges bay weymouth beach and clarks beach are distributed around the coastline of auckland new zealand and are characterized by distinct geographical conditions fig 1 the first two are open coast beaches facing the pacific ocean and are wave dominated the remaining three sites are in sheltered bays and harbours so are dominated by tidal processes in 2017 auckland council launched a revised model based beach water quality programme safeswim the use of models was guided by their ability to meet performance standards published by the united states geological survey usgs francy et al 2013 based on this guidance a model with accuracy over 85 along with sensitivity at 50 and specificity at 80 should be considered as a qualified model to predict the water quality at a standard level for a water quality predictive model to be included into the safeswim platform it must meet the benchmarks in terms of overall accuracy sensitivity ability to predict above threshold and specificity ability to predict below threshold models are in a constant state of review and are refined regularly in response to auckland council s ongoing beach sampling 2 2 data long term water quality monitoring data is available from 1995 to 2018 with accompanying environmental variables 2019 is also available for clarks for the five study sites each dataset contains eight variables fig 2 fib which is used as a threshold to identify the water quality single sample threshold 280 fib 280 exceedance and fib 280 compliance as prescribed in the new zealand guidelines rainfall accumulations for the proceeding twenty four forty eight and seventy two hours one two three days and the total accumulated precipitation wind direction and speed and solar hours per day fig 2 shows that weymouth has the most balanced dataset comparing to other four locations while narrow neck has the most unbalanced dataset with less than 2 5 samples found to be above the threshold the wind direction is evenly distributed for clarks and weymouth however the other three locations experience more southern winds the average solar hours of milford is the smallest with about 6 5 h day and judges bay has the longest average sunshine time with almost 7 h day the average rainfall accumulation within 72 h in weymouth is the greatest almost 8 2 cm while it is the smallest at narrow neck with an average rainfall of 5 6 cm in 72 h see fig 3 3 methodology unlike regression models that usually predict the absolute fib value as a continuous function and then reclassify the value based on threshold four machine learning algorithms are applied to predict whether the fib of a water sample has exceeded the threshold or not through a binary classification process 3 1 k nearest neighbors algorithm k nn the k nearest neighbors algorithm is a non parametric method used for classification and regression in both cases the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space the neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class for k nn classification or the object property value for k nn regression is known fig 3 this approach is widely used in classification problems babbar and babbar 2017 3 2 boosting decision trees bdt a decision tree is a flowchart like structure in which each internal node represents a test on an attribute e g whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails each branch represents the outcome of the test and each leaf node represents a class label decision taken after computing all attributes the paths from root to leaf represent classification rules boosting is a method that combines many weak learners trees into a strong classifier and the boosting decision trees fig 4 are popular because of their excellent accuracy and fast operation prakash et al 2018 shoaran et al 2018 3 3 support vector machine svm a support vector machine svm is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane in other words given labelled training data the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples in two dimensional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where each class lays on a different side fig 5 3 4 artificial neural network ann anns are a widely used modelling technique with self adapting self organizing and self learning abilities pijanowski et al 2002 anctil et al 2004 anns include an input layer where variables are inputted into the algorithm one or more hidden layers where input variables are combined and an output layer the prediction because of its simplicity ease of training and its ability for reasonable associative memory and prediction rumelhart et al 1986 we used a feed forward error back propagation three layer perceptron bp tlp ann architecture fig 6 the most significant character of a bp tlp is that during the training stage the information is transiting forward while the error is back propagating during the feed forward transition the information values features of the input layer is processed by the hidden layer s and then transitions back to the output layer every node in a layer affects the node state in the following layer s if the value of the output layer does not meet the expected outcome it turns to the back propagation process depending on the expected error the bp tlp ann begins to adjust the weights and threshold values of the network allowing for the predicted outcome to approach the expected result 3 5 adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm adasyn adasyn is an improved version of the synthetic minority over sampling technique smote which is used to avoid overfitting occurring when exact replicas of minority instances are added to the main dataset gosain and sardana 2017 the key idea of the adasyn algorithm is to use the density distribution as a criterion to automatically determine the appropriate number of synthetic samples that need to be generated for each minority data example the density distribution can be obtained from the knn function based on an n dimensional vector euclidean distance between majority and minority samples a subset of data is taken from the minority class as an example and then new synthetic similar instances are created fig 7 smote stops here but with adasyn a random small value is added to the faked samples making the new sample more realistic instead of being linearly correlated to the original sample more details on the adasyn application procedures can be found in appendix i 3 6 modelling framework fig 8 illustrates the workflow we used showing how the data are processed and applied to the models the sampled data makes the original database containing two parts as seven training fields and one label field fib using fib values the samples are classified into two classes fib above or below 280 to maintain consistency with the new zealand guidelines adasyn is then applied to generate synthetic samples above the threshold to balance the dataset to form the training dataset data samples are randomly selected from the samples below the threshold 280 and combined with the synthesised samples the new training sample dataset is then fed as input data into the four machine learning algorithms as input data the unselected remaining samples below the threshold 280 are coupled with the original not generated through adasyn over threshold samples 280 to form the validation and testing dataset and are applied to the validation process of the model results the four classifiers k nearest neighbourhood knn boosting decision tree bdt support vector machine svm and multilayer perceptron mlp ann were implemented with matlab the first three used optimized hyper parameters with bayesian optimization process to find the best parameters the bayesian optimization is a built in function of matlab that can optimize most critical parameters hyperparameter automatically the optimization process can minimize the cross validation loss by varying the parameter iteratively for each individual machine learning algorithm the critical parameters are different table 1 describes the critical parameters and the optimization results while mlp ann used different method to decide the parameters first the number of hidden nodes significantly affects ann performance too few nodes will cause a significant prediction error while too many will prolong the training process and lead to overfitting based on the rule that the number of hidden neuron should not be less than 2n 3 1 n the number of input nodes we tried the number 6 7 8 9 and the optimal number of hidden neurons 8 was our final choice in terms of both the model performance and the network simplicity then the levenberg marquardt algorithm function was implemented in matlab to train the network that updates weights and biases due to its powerful computation with relatively small datasets and the high efficiency for backpropagation in addition the transfer functions for hidden layer and output layer are a sigmoid tansig and a linear function purelin respectively each model was run 100 times for each study site to assess the model capability and stability a confusion matrix is used to calculate the overall accuracy sensitivity and specificity of each model the running time is also recorded to evaluate the computation efficiency overall as shown in fig 8 for a data d with n samples na and nb are the number of water samples above and below the fib threshold where na plus nb equals n notice that na is much smaller than nb and their difference is nd in our study the total demand number of synthesised samples also equals nd then we randomly selected below threshold samples from nb and combine them with an equal amount of the synthesised samples to make the new training water sample dataset ntrain 2nd the original above threshold samples combined with the remaining below samples equal to nb nd are used for model validation before applying the modelling framework to the five locations a simplified under and over sampling method was also applied to reduce the number of below samples and equal the number of below and above samples 4 result and discussion 4 1 original dataset table 2 describes the water quality monitoring data samples and table 3 reveals the training results from all the algorithms using the original dataset table 2 shows that all the monitoring sites have a quite unbalanced water samples and only weymouth has a slightly better balances the number of samples above and below the threshold according to table 3 even though the overall accuracy is high none of the 5 locations can be well modelled with the four ml methods since none of the above threshold samples exceedances were successfully predicted this high model overall accuracy can be problematic because of the unbalance dataset issue since all the datasets have very limited occurrences of above threshold samples algorithms only focus on the below threshold samples the high overall accuracy of each model is due to the correct prediction of below threshold samples compliance while the above samples are not well predicted hence all of these four models can precisely predict the below samples but none of the algorithms can identify the water samples with fib above the 280 threshold 4 2 under over sampling methods the under sampling method is first used to balance the data before applying the adasyn we reduced the number of below samples through a random selection process until it equalled the number of the above samples based on this under sampling dataset the results table 4 indicate that the four aforementioned algorithms can predict the water quality more accurately knn and bdt have the same results for all the four locations and predict sample groups from clarks with a 0 75 overall accuracy svm and ann are also useful to predict the water sample groups from weymouth and milford with an overall accuracy at 0 73 and 0 75 these results make much more sense than using the original data since both the above and below samples can be predicted however other models significantly underestimate the below samples at different locations taking milford for example the svm underestimated three above samples while overestimated two below samples the underestimation of below samples is due to the loss of potentially useful information with the under sampling method the training sample may be insufficient as well as it may not be a representative example of the samples below the threshold thereby even the overall accuracy is acceptable the result is inaccurate and inadequate to be used to predict the water quality the over sampling method is the opposite of under sampling for every location we duplicated the above samples and then combined them with the below samples to make a new dataset the results of the over sampling prediction are shown in table 5 in table 5 we can see that bdt outperformed the other three algorithms in terms of the best overall accuracy while svm performed the worst bdt knn and ann all display relatively high modelling accuracies at all locations except for weymouth however results are still deceiving because only replicating the same above samples with the unchanged sample values can increase the likelihood of overfitting in addition if there is some error in the samples above threshold the over sampling method will simply amplify the bias 4 3 adasyn approach adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm adasyn was used to improve data balance adasyn synthetically creates new samples from the above samples via linear interpolation this approach created more samples in the vicinity of the boundary between the two classes than in the interior of the above samples this approach mitigates the problem of overfitting caused by duplicated over sampling as synthetic new samples are generated artificially so that there is no loss of useful information and less risk of overfitting fig 9 illustrates the dataset obtained with the adasyn approach we first applied the four ml algorithms using the adasyn dataset and validated and tested with the original dataset for clarks bay the results significantly improve see fig 10 we show results using mlp ann as an example results for other algorithms can be found in appendix ii in fig 10 1 1 and 0 0 represent how many water samples are correctly predicted classified the first value indicates the correct prediction for above threshold water samples sensitivity and the second value mirrors the accuracy of below sample modelling specificity overestimation and underestimation are indicated with 0 1 and 1 0 the above and below threshold samples are both precisely predicted by knn using the adasyn dataset for training and the original dataset for validation the overall accuracy is 88 43 the accuracy of specificity below samples and sensitivity above samples is 89 25 and 76 47 respectively both are higher than the under sample methods and other models with this balanced dataset the underestimation and overestimation are also acceptable since only 10 75 of the above threshold samples were missed and 23 53 of below samples were false alarmed to be above compared to other studies the specificity accuracy does not increase significantly but the sensitivity prediction accuracy improved to over 70 the difference between over sampling and adasyn is the data sample itself for over sampling we simply duplicate the existing minority class samples above 280 until the number equals to the majority class below 280 for example assume there are 200 samples below the threshold value 280 and only 20 samples with a value greater than 280 the simplified over sampling will only copy these 20 above samples for 10 times until reaching the same number as the below samples and these duplicated samples will feed into the training and validation process therefore the final model validation result could be really high simply because of using the same data samples in both training and validation process in addition this approach magnifies overfitting however with the adasyn method the dataset will be balanced with brand new artificial above threshold data samples by producing new values rather than simply replicating the existing ones there is no conflict between training and validation dataset the synthetic samples will only be used to train the model and the true data will only be applied to the model validation based on above explanations even if the accuracy value of over sampling is higher than adasyn we cannot say that the over sampling model outperforms the adasyn due to the data duplication issue in contrast the results from adasyn are more reliable because the dataset is balanced and separates the training and validation datasets by creating artificial data 4 4 comparison four model results among the five locations fig 11 at the end of this article displays the validation results between models and original data for all the locations using four ml algorithms with adasyn dataset boxplot diagrams used to reveal the model accuracy we performed 100 runs with each algorithm show the highest accuracy top line the mean accuracy middle line the lowest accuracy bottom line and the accuracy range box size the red crosses indicate any eventual outlier in the model predictions knn precisely predicted the above and below samples for all the beaches with an average accuracy around 80 except for weymouth at least one knn can predict the above and below samples correctly nearly reaching a 100 accuracy however the box size of knn is always larger than the other three models the lowest accuracy for each site is always associated to knn indicating that a large variation existed for the 100 runs of knn we conclude that the results are not as robust and reliable as the other models svm is the algorithm showing the worst performance with very low mean model accuracy values never higher than 0 7 this model should not be considered as an appropriate prediction model because of its inferior performance at all the locations some of the svm based predictions are below 0 5 bdt and mlp ann predictions are less variable than knn and svm relatively smaller box sizes in fig 11 the results from bdt and mlp ann are very similar for clarks weymouth and milford bdt outperformed ann slightly at judges bay smaller box size higher mean 0 85 and minimum accuracy values 0 70 however the ann provides a better result at narrow neck with a much higher mean accuracy value 0 92 than bdt 0 82 at different location model performance is also different both bdt and mlp can be used to predict the above and below water samples for clarks beach high average accuracy 0 89 and stability small box size for judges bay bdt should be considered as the most appropriate model because of the second highest mean accuracy value 0 85 and least variation among all the models for narrow neck mlp has the highest mean accuracy 0 92 nearly 10 higher than the bdt 0 83 and the results are stable weymouth has the worst modelled results compared to other locations the best prediction in weymouth is obtained using knn while the bdt has the highest mean accuracy with relatively stable results so that overall they could both be taken into consideration when predicting at this location similar to clarks both bdt and mlp can provide solid results for milford with almost the same highest and mean accuracy 0 96 0 89 however mlp is more stable than bdt with a smaller box size and a higher minimum accuracy value so that it is the first choice for predicting above and below water samples at this location our results demonstrate that there is no unique model that fits all sites and the reason can be attribute to the different conditions and settings of each location see also shaw et al 2017 different models should always be tested and the results should be compared to look for the most appropriate solution model choice also depends on which effect of the results is considered for example if we are only concerned with model accuracy knn can be used as it provides the best results and can predict the above and below samples with nearly a 100 accuracy if we care more about the model stability knn then should be eliminated and bdt and mlp ann should be considered because of their relatively low variation between lowest and highest accuracy even svm could be considered as it is the most stable model for weymouth regardless the accuracy adasyn created a balanced samples dataset by generating artificial above samples through a linear interpolation at the boundary between below and above samples with the half faked data set the accuracy of model predictions significantly improved however this approach may raise some other issues which need to be further addressed for example the artificial samples could either be invading or expanding too much to the below class which will cause overfitting problem luengo et al 2011 5 conclusion to help resolve the issue of unbalanced datasets in water quality models which result in loss of information on the above threshold samples exceedance and overfitting for the below threshold sample compliance we used an adasyn sample balancing method to generate artificial data of above threshold samples together with machine learning techniques this sample balancing resulted in more accurate predictions of water quality compared with the original unbalanced datasets the balanced dataset was applied to four machine learning algorithms and resulted in much higher accuracy in terms of both sensitivity over 75 and specificity over 90 compared to past studies thoe et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 k nn bdt svm and mlp ann were applied to five beach sites in auckland and the results were compared to determine which model is the most appropriate for each individual location judging in terms of model accuracy robustness and stability bdt and mlp ann outperformed knn and svm at all locations models perform differently at different locations and many reasons could explain this result e g environmental conditions data quality and model suitability this study provided a potential solution to the data balance issue and compared various models to test the predictions at five sites future studies could focus on the role of individual variables or on reducing uncertainties in the synthetic generation of data in addition the tidal information which is very important for predicting fib is not included in this study due to lack of detailed data tidal data should be added into future models and it is likely it would further improve model performance declaration of competing interest the

this can be a limiting factor in the uptake of model predictions since even if the overall accuracy is high the sensitivity of the predictions can be low to address this issue this paper proposes an adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm adasyn to generate synthetic above threshold fib instances and test the validity of the approach for the prediction of recreational water quality the models in this paper are based on four machine learning techniques k mean nearest neighbour boosting decision tree support vector machine and multi layer perceptron artificial neural network and are applied to five different locations in auckland new zealand aside from support vector machine all models provide favourable predictions with relatively high sensitivity around 75 and overall accuracy over 90 indicating that both the compliant and exceedance conditions can be effectively predicted through the use of more sophisticated model training which involves artificial data considering the model accuracy and stability boosting decision trees bdt and multi layer perceptron artificial neural mlp ann network are the best two models and the multi layer perceptron is the most efficient with the shortest computation time graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm nearest neighbour boosting decision tree support vector machine artificial neural network 1 introduction robust and reliable information about the water quality at beaches is of vital importance as it is used to inform managers about public health risk from recreation in water thoe and lee 2013 stidson et al 2012 francy et al 2013 wade et al 2008 beach water quality is widely monitored using faecal indicator bacteria fib which commonly involves the measurement of enterococci or escherichia coli concentrations in water monitoring results are usually assessed for compliance with guidelines and guideline exceedances trigger advisories or warnings for beach users de brauwere et al 2014 castelletti et al 2014 marshall et al 1997 king and richardson 2003 the laboratory tests for fib typically take up to 24 h using the most probable method mpn however once the time for sample collection and interpretation and communication of results are included the test result is not publicly available probably for up to 48 h after sample collection this results in water quality information that is potentially out of date because water quality can change faster than the analysis time for this reason much effort has been invested in trying to predict fib concentrations in real time with a range of process and data driven based models utilised for this purpose e g bae et al 2010 abyaneh 2014 thoe and lee 2013 he and he 2008 the vast majority of models used to predict water quality are data driven statistical and categorical and are therefore sensitive to the data used in their development thoe et al 2014 chen and liu 2015 li et al 2019 for example all these models faced the issue of unbalanced datasets whereby the number of data points that are compliant with guidelines is always much more than the data exceeding the guideline thresholds for fib therefore the models are usually good at predicting compliant conditions rather exceedance condition chandramouli et al 2007 and tufail et al 2008 used artificial neural networks ann to predict water quality and found that they slightly outperformed traditional regression models however they only considered the overall accuracy which can lead to a significant bias due to the original dataset which contains a disproportionately large proportion of compliant data points i e when the fib is below the guideline threshold in 2010 kazemi yazdi and scholz assessed water quality based on surface runoff through an ann model and compared the ann with a multi linear regression model mlr the ann outperformed mlr in predicting the runoff treatment since it has a higher ability to capture the nonlinear relationship between water quality and microbial factors they focused on the exploration of the relation between the quality indicator and the impact factor but failed to provide details on the model validation aspect qin et al 2012 introduced an advanced boosting tree based machine learning model but did not compare their results to other models thoe et al 2014 applied three regression models as well as classification trees ct and ann they assessed model results in terms of overall accuracy but also sensitivity and specificity and concluded that ct and ann performed better than regression models here the overall accuracy refers to the model successfully predicting below and above threshold data sensitivity assesses the model s ability to predict only exceeding data and specificity assesses the prediction of compliant data even in this case sensitivity was still low probably as a result of the bias to the much more non exceeding data in the training dataset bedri et al 2016 wang et al 2016 shaw et al 2017 besides these models the capability of multi layer perceptron ann to predict water quality has been demonstrated in recent years zhang et al 2015 garcÃ­a alba et al 2019 however such studies considered ann as a component to be integrated within other models and did not present comparisons with other machine learning techniques granata et al 2017 and haghiabi et al 2018 used several machine learning methods to forecast water quality and reported a significant overestimation of good water quality but did not explore the reasoning moreover the data sets they used to training the networks were still unbalanced it is well known that ann and other machine learning methods need a good quality training dataset to provide reliable and accurate results in 2012 motamarri and boccelli developed a machine learning model to classify the recreational water quality at a river scale they found that a neural based learning vector quantization model outperformed both mlr and ann and revealed that all the predictions heavily relied on the validity of the characteristics of the training samples however the biggest issue for recreational water quality datasets stay unsloved that they are always unbalanced with the vast majority of the dataset below guideline thresholds and only a very small amount of data exceeding the guideline thresholds thoe et al 2012 garcÃ­a alba et al 2019 when training data driven models an unbalanced dataset increases the possibility of information loss in the minority class and overfitting in the majority class which cannot be easily addressed by only reducing or duplicating data samples batista et al 2004 kim et al 2014 also pointed out to this problem when trying to monitor the water quality using satellite data using three machine learning approaches the limited training data especially for bad water conditions weakened the predictions to address the unbalanced sample issue the synthetic minority over sampling technique smote is often used in other fields han et al 2005 luengo et al 2011 smote generates artificial samples by interpolating values between majority and minority classes however using this method the synthetic samples are still more likely to be distributed in the interior of the minority class luengo et al 2011 this limitation can be overcome through the advanced adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm adasyn adasyn which can create more samples at the boundary between the two classes and improve training accuracy he et al 2008 gosain and sardana 2017 however in the published adasyn studies the data dimension is usually low with no more than three input variables therefore its efficiency on high dimensional data still needs to be assessed in addition most studies focus on one site and one model or at best compare two types of models at one location usually ann and linear regression are compared thoe et al 2012 chan et al 2013 thoe et al 2014 and danades et al 2016 addressed the issue by comparing three or more different models to reveal their strengths and weaknesses but only at one location other studies focused on multiple locations but considered only one model garcÃ­a alba et al 2019 therefore a sensitivity analysis using different locations and different algorithms has not yet been performed to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies our study provides a comprehensive comparison of four machine learning algorithms predicting fib at five beaches in auckland new zealand the objectives are 1 to address the problem of unbalanced water quality datasets by applying adasyn to improve the training of the predictive algorithm 2 to assess the ability of machine learning models when using a balanced dataset 3 to compare the different model results at different locations using different machine learning models by completing these objectives we try to answer two questions can we use artificial water samples to balance the original dataset for machine learning models and does a balanced dataset improve prediction capability 2 study area and data 2 1 study sites the five study sites milford beach narrow neck beach judges bay weymouth beach and clarks beach are distributed around the coastline of auckland new zealand and are characterized by distinct geographical conditions fig 1 the first two are open coast beaches facing the pacific ocean and are wave dominated the remaining three sites are in sheltered bays and harbours so are dominated by tidal processes in 2017 auckland council launched a revised model based beach water quality programme safeswim the use of models was guided by their ability to meet performance standards published by the united states geological survey usgs francy et al 2013 based on this guidance a model with accuracy over 85 along with sensitivity at 50 and specificity at 80 should be considered as a qualified model to predict the water quality at a standard level for a water quality predictive model to be included into the safeswim platform it must meet the benchmarks in terms of overall accuracy sensitivity ability to predict above threshold and specificity ability to predict below threshold models are in a constant state of review and are refined regularly in response to auckland council s ongoing beach sampling 2 2 data long term water quality monitoring data is available from 1995 to 2018 with accompanying environmental variables 2019 is also available for clarks for the five study sites each dataset contains eight variables fig 2 fib which is used as a threshold to identify the water quality single sample threshold 280 fib 280 exceedance and fib 280 compliance as prescribed in the new zealand guidelines rainfall accumulations for the proceeding twenty four forty eight and seventy two hours one two three days and the total accumulated precipitation wind direction and speed and solar hours per day fig 2 shows that weymouth has the most balanced dataset comparing to other four locations while narrow neck has the most unbalanced dataset with less than 2 5 samples found to be above the threshold the wind direction is evenly distributed for clarks and weymouth however the other three locations experience more southern winds the average solar hours of milford is the smallest with about 6 5 h day and judges bay has the longest average sunshine time with almost 7 h day the average rainfall accumulation within 72 h in weymouth is the greatest almost 8 2 cm while it is the smallest at narrow neck with an average rainfall of 5 6 cm in 72 h see fig 3 3 methodology unlike regression models that usually predict the absolute fib value as a continuous function and then reclassify the value based on threshold four machine learning algorithms are applied to predict whether the fib of a water sample has exceeded the threshold or not through a binary classification process 3 1 k nearest neighbors algorithm k nn the k nearest neighbors algorithm is a non parametric method used for classification and regression in both cases the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space the neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class for k nn classification or the object property value for k nn regression is known fig 3 this approach is widely used in classification problems babbar and babbar 2017 3 2 boosting decision trees bdt a decision tree is a flowchart like structure in which each internal node represents a test on an attribute e g whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails each branch represents the outcome of the test and each leaf node represents a class label decision taken after computing all attributes the paths from root to leaf represent classification rules boosting is a method that combines many weak learners trees into a strong classifier and the boosting decision trees fig 4 are popular because of their excellent accuracy and fast operation prakash et al 2018 shoaran et al 2018 3 3 support vector machine svm a support vector machine svm is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane in other words given labelled training data the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples in two dimensional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where each class lays on a different side fig 5 3 4 artificial neural network ann anns are a widely used modelling technique with self adapting self organizing and self learning abilities pijanowski et al 2002 anctil et al 2004 anns include an input layer where variables are inputted into the algorithm one or more hidden layers where input variables are combined and an output layer the prediction because of its simplicity ease of training and its ability for reasonable associative memory and prediction rumelhart et al 1986 we used a feed forward error back propagation three layer perceptron bp tlp ann architecture fig 6 the most significant character of a bp tlp is that during the training stage the information is transiting forward while the error is back propagating during the feed forward transition the information values features of the input layer is processed by the hidden layer s and then transitions back to the output layer every node in a layer affects the node state in the following layer s if the value of the output layer does not meet the expected outcome it turns to the back propagation process depending on the expected error the bp tlp ann begins to adjust the weights and threshold values of the network allowing for the predicted outcome to approach the expected result 3 5 adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm adasyn adasyn is an improved version of the synthetic minority over sampling technique smote which is used to avoid overfitting occurring when exact replicas of minority instances are added to the main dataset gosain and sardana 2017 the key idea of the adasyn algorithm is to use the density distribution as a criterion to automatically determine the appropriate number of synthetic samples that need to be generated for each minority data example the density distribution can be obtained from the knn function based on an n dimensional vector euclidean distance between majority and minority samples a subset of data is taken from the minority class as an example and then new synthetic similar instances are created fig 7 smote stops here but with adasyn a random small value is added to the faked samples making the new sample more realistic instead of being linearly correlated to the original sample more details on the adasyn application procedures can be found in appendix i 3 6 modelling framework fig 8 illustrates the workflow we used showing how the data are processed and applied to the models the sampled data makes the original database containing two parts as seven training fields and one label field fib using fib values the samples are classified into two classes fib above or below 280 to maintain consistency with the new zealand guidelines adasyn is then applied to generate synthetic samples above the threshold to balance the dataset to form the training dataset data samples are randomly selected from the samples below the threshold 280 and combined with the synthesised samples the new training sample dataset is then fed as input data into the four machine learning algorithms as input data the unselected remaining samples below the threshold 280 are coupled with the original not generated through adasyn over threshold samples 280 to form the validation and testing dataset and are applied to the validation process of the model results the four classifiers k nearest neighbourhood knn boosting decision tree bdt support vector machine svm and multilayer perceptron mlp ann were implemented with matlab the first three used optimized hyper parameters with bayesian optimization process to find the best parameters the bayesian optimization is a built in function of matlab that can optimize most critical parameters hyperparameter automatically the optimization process can minimize the cross validation loss by varying the parameter iteratively for each individual machine learning algorithm the critical parameters are different table 1 describes the critical parameters and the optimization results while mlp ann used different method to decide the parameters first the number of hidden nodes significantly affects ann performance too few nodes will cause a significant prediction error while too many will prolong the training process and lead to overfitting based on the rule that the number of hidden neuron should not be less than 2n 3 1 n the number of input nodes we tried the number 6 7 8 9 and the optimal number of hidden neurons 8 was our final choice in terms of both the model performance and the network simplicity then the levenberg marquardt algorithm function was implemented in matlab to train the network that updates weights and biases due to its powerful computation with relatively small datasets and the high efficiency for backpropagation in addition the transfer functions for hidden layer and output layer are a sigmoid tansig and a linear function purelin respectively each model was run 100 times for each study site to assess the model capability and stability a confusion matrix is used to calculate the overall accuracy sensitivity and specificity of each model the running time is also recorded to evaluate the computation efficiency overall as shown in fig 8 for a data d with n samples na and nb are the number of water samples above and below the fib threshold where na plus nb equals n notice that na is much smaller than nb and their difference is nd in our study the total demand number of synthesised samples also equals nd then we randomly selected below threshold samples from nb and combine them with an equal amount of the synthesised samples to make the new training water sample dataset ntrain 2nd the original above threshold samples combined with the remaining below samples equal to nb nd are used for model validation before applying the modelling framework to the five locations a simplified under and over sampling method was also applied to reduce the number of below samples and equal the number of below and above samples 4 result and discussion 4 1 original dataset table 2 describes the water quality monitoring data samples and table 3 reveals the training results from all the algorithms using the original dataset table 2 shows that all the monitoring sites have a quite unbalanced water samples and only weymouth has a slightly better balances the number of samples above and below the threshold according to table 3 even though the overall accuracy is high none of the 5 locations can be well modelled with the four ml methods since none of the above threshold samples exceedances were successfully predicted this high model overall accuracy can be problematic because of the unbalance dataset issue since all the datasets have very limited occurrences of above threshold samples algorithms only focus on the below threshold samples the high overall accuracy of each model is due to the correct prediction of below threshold samples compliance while the above samples are not well predicted hence all of these four models can precisely predict the below samples but none of the algorithms can identify the water samples with fib above the 280 threshold 4 2 under over sampling methods the under sampling method is first used to balance the data before applying the adasyn we reduced the number of below samples through a random selection process until it equalled the number of the above samples based on this under sampling dataset the results table 4 indicate that the four aforementioned algorithms can predict the water quality more accurately knn and bdt have the same results for all the four locations and predict sample groups from clarks with a 0 75 overall accuracy svm and ann are also useful to predict the water sample groups from weymouth and milford with an overall accuracy at 0 73 and 0 75 these results make much more sense than using the original data since both the above and below samples can be predicted however other models significantly underestimate the below samples at different locations taking milford for example the svm underestimated three above samples while overestimated two below samples the underestimation of below samples is due to the loss of potentially useful information with the under sampling method the training sample may be insufficient as well as it may not be a representative example of the samples below the threshold thereby even the overall accuracy is acceptable the result is inaccurate and inadequate to be used to predict the water quality the over sampling method is the opposite of under sampling for every location we duplicated the above samples and then combined them with the below samples to make a new dataset the results of the over sampling prediction are shown in table 5 in table 5 we can see that bdt outperformed the other three algorithms in terms of the best overall accuracy while svm performed the worst bdt knn and ann all display relatively high modelling accuracies at all locations except for weymouth however results are still deceiving because only replicating the same above samples with the unchanged sample values can increase the likelihood of overfitting in addition if there is some error in the samples above threshold the over sampling method will simply amplify the bias 4 3 adasyn approach adaptive synthetic sampling algorithm adasyn was used to improve data balance adasyn synthetically creates new samples from the above samples via linear interpolation this approach created more samples in the vicinity of the boundary between the two classes than in the interior of the above samples this approach mitigates the problem of overfitting caused by duplicated over sampling as synthetic new samples are generated artificially so that there is no loss of useful information and less risk of overfitting fig 9 illustrates the dataset obtained with the adasyn approach we first applied the four ml algorithms using the adasyn dataset and validated and tested with the original dataset for clarks bay the results significantly improve see fig 10 we show results using mlp ann as an example results for other algorithms can be found in appendix ii in fig 10 1 1 and 0 0 represent how many water samples are correctly predicted classified the first value indicates the correct prediction for above threshold water samples sensitivity and the second value mirrors the accuracy of below sample modelling specificity overestimation and underestimation are indicated with 0 1 and 1 0 the above and below threshold samples are both precisely predicted by knn using the adasyn dataset for training and the original dataset for validation the overall accuracy is 88 43 the accuracy of specificity below samples and sensitivity above samples is 89 25 and 76 47 respectively both are higher than the under sample methods and other models with this balanced dataset the underestimation and overestimation are also acceptable since only 10 75 of the above threshold samples were missed and 23 53 of below samples were false alarmed to be above compared to other studies the specificity accuracy does not increase significantly but the sensitivity prediction accuracy improved to over 70 the difference between over sampling and adasyn is the data sample itself for over sampling we simply duplicate the existing minority class samples above 280 until the number equals to the majority class below 280 for example assume there are 200 samples below the threshold value 280 and only 20 samples with a value greater than 280 the simplified over sampling will only copy these 20 above samples for 10 times until reaching the same number as the below samples and these duplicated samples will feed into the training and validation process therefore the final model validation result could be really high simply because of using the same data samples in both training and validation process in addition this approach magnifies overfitting however with the adasyn method the dataset will be balanced with brand new artificial above threshold data samples by producing new values rather than simply replicating the existing ones there is no conflict between training and validation dataset the synthetic samples will only be used to train the model and the true data will only be applied to the model validation based on above explanations even if the accuracy value of over sampling is higher than adasyn we cannot say that the over sampling model outperforms the adasyn due to the data duplication issue in contrast the results from adasyn are more reliable because the dataset is balanced and separates the training and validation datasets by creating artificial data 4 4 comparison four model results among the five locations fig 11 at the end of this article displays the validation results between models and original data for all the locations using four ml algorithms with adasyn dataset boxplot diagrams used to reveal the model accuracy we performed 100 runs with each algorithm show the highest accuracy top line the mean accuracy middle line the lowest accuracy bottom line and the accuracy range box size the red crosses indicate any eventual outlier in the model predictions knn precisely predicted the above and below samples for all the beaches with an average accuracy around 80 except for weymouth at least one knn can predict the above and below samples correctly nearly reaching a 100 accuracy however the box size of knn is always larger than the other three models the lowest accuracy for each site is always associated to knn indicating that a large variation existed for the 100 runs of knn we conclude that the results are not as robust and reliable as the other models svm is the algorithm showing the worst performance with very low mean model accuracy values never higher than 0 7 this model should not be considered as an appropriate prediction model because of its inferior performance at all the locations some of the svm based predictions are below 0 5 bdt and mlp ann predictions are less variable than knn and svm relatively smaller box sizes in fig 11 the results from bdt and mlp ann are very similar for clarks weymouth and milford bdt outperformed ann slightly at judges bay smaller box size higher mean 0 85 and minimum accuracy values 0 70 however the ann provides a better result at narrow neck with a much higher mean accuracy value 0 92 than bdt 0 82 at different location model performance is also different both bdt and mlp can be used to predict the above and below water samples for clarks beach high average accuracy 0 89 and stability small box size for judges bay bdt should be considered as the most appropriate model because of the second highest mean accuracy value 0 85 and least variation among all the models for narrow neck mlp has the highest mean accuracy 0 92 nearly 10 higher than the bdt 0 83 and the results are stable weymouth has the worst modelled results compared to other locations the best prediction in weymouth is obtained using knn while the bdt has the highest mean accuracy with relatively stable results so that overall they could both be taken into consideration when predicting at this location similar to clarks both bdt and mlp can provide solid results for milford with almost the same highest and mean accuracy 0 96 0 89 however mlp is more stable than bdt with a smaller box size and a higher minimum accuracy value so that it is the first choice for predicting above and below water samples at this location our results demonstrate that there is no unique model that fits all sites and the reason can be attribute to the different conditions and settings of each location see also shaw et al 2017 different models should always be tested and the results should be compared to look for the most appropriate solution model choice also depends on which effect of the results is considered for example if we are only concerned with model accuracy knn can be used as it provides the best results and can predict the above and below samples with nearly a 100 accuracy if we care more about the model stability knn then should be eliminated and bdt and mlp ann should be considered because of their relatively low variation between lowest and highest accuracy even svm could be considered as it is the most stable model for weymouth regardless the accuracy adasyn created a balanced samples dataset by generating artificial above samples through a linear interpolation at the boundary between below and above samples with the half faked data set the accuracy of model predictions significantly improved however this approach may raise some other issues which need to be further addressed for example the artificial samples could either be invading or expanding too much to the below class which will cause overfitting problem luengo et al 2011 5 conclusion to help resolve the issue of unbalanced datasets in water quality models which result in loss of information on the above threshold samples exceedance and overfitting for the below threshold sample compliance we used an adasyn sample balancing method to generate artificial data of above threshold samples together with machine learning techniques this sample balancing resulted in more accurate predictions of water quality compared with the original unbalanced datasets the balanced dataset was applied to four machine learning algorithms and resulted in much higher accuracy in terms of both sensitivity over 75 and specificity over 90 compared to past studies thoe et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 k nn bdt svm and mlp ann were applied to five beach sites in auckland and the results were compared to determine which model is the most appropriate for each individual location judging in terms of model accuracy robustness and stability bdt and mlp ann outperformed knn and svm at all locations models perform differently at different locations and many reasons could explain this result e g environmental conditions data quality and model suitability this study provided a potential solution to the data balance issue and compared various models to test the predictions at five sites future studies could focus on the role of individual variables or on reducing uncertainties in the synthetic generation of data in addition the tidal information which is very important for predicting fib is not included in this study due to lack of detailed data tidal data should be added into future models and it is likely it would further improve model performance declaration of competing interest the

17963,true water color twc is an important water quality indicator however despite many efforts for standardization of methods for twc determination there is still no consistency between visual and spectroscopic techniques this study demonstrates that standard spectroscopic methods overestimate visual data from 21 to 47 depending on methods involved to retrieve relevant true water color values from spectral data a new spectroscopic method is proposed the method is based on the mathematical model of color perception by the standard observer implementing the de2000 color difference in the l a b color space as calculated between blank and water samples the method showed good agreement with the visual methods comparator method and determination in nessler cylinders and the mean values between these methods the mean relative difference between the proposed method and the mean of the two visual methods is only 2 the method precision is independent from twc in all measurement ranges and has sr 0 3 mgpt co l 1 df 98 which is at least three times lower than for the standard methods as such it shows higher accuracy and precision as a result the proposed method can be used for twc determination in environmental samples from 3 3 to 500 mgpt co l 1 with sd 0 3 mgpt co l 1 in all measuring ranges making sample dilution unnecessary graphical abstract image 1 keywords water color true color natural water visual method spectroscopic method determination 1 introduction color is an important water quality indicator that defines the organoleptic properties of water together with turbidity and odor water color is usually caused by the presence of dissolved organic substances particularly fulvic and humic acids which originate from decaying vegetable matter accumulated in soil and peatlands dissolved natural minerals such as ferric hydroxide hongve and akesson 1996 and particulate matter such as suspended solids and phytoplankton davies colley et al 1997 water color alternation can be caused by waste discharge or other anthropogenic impact and can act as an environmental marker gost 31868 2012 2014 two terms are usually used to describe the water color apparent color is a result of the combined effect of light absorption by dissolved and particulate matter it is what one actually sees in the water body apparent color can vary from blue green green yellow and yellow to ultimately orange davies colley and nagels 1998 and it can be estimated in situ from digital images using ccd cameras novoa et al 2015 klaveness 2005 true water color twc results from light absorbance by dissolved organic matter and minerals only these substances generally produce water colors of yellow brown gamut the hazen scale based on standards of pt co is used widely to estimate twc iso en 7887 2011 2012 the alternative cr co scale so called imitational has also been employed for this purpose in environmental applications semenov 1977 rd 52 24 497 2005 2005 gost 31868 2012 2014 this paper will highlight the contradictions between existing methods and elaborate a new method for color determination that aims to eliminate them true color can only be measured once a sample has been collected centrifuged or filtered apha 1992 bennett and drikas 1993 moore and caux 1997 initially determination of true color was based on a visual comparison of a filtered water sample with platinum cobalt pt co solutions of the hazen scale and later standard solutions were replaced by color disks that were incorporated into a comparator for measurements facilitation such visual methods were criticized widely because of their subjectivity and low precision hongve and akesson 1996 bennett and drikas 1993 crowther and evans 1981 mitchell and mcdonald 1991 this is why later spectroscopic methods have replaced visual ones bennett and drikas 1993 spectroscopic determination was applied in various methods using a wide range of analytical wavelengths but usually only one wavelength was applied to facilitate the determination procedure hongve and akesson 1996 bennett and drikas 1993 however spectroscopic techniques do not always produce the same results as visual methods do bennett and drikas 1993 hongve and akesson 1996 the core of the contradiction lies in the fact that standard pt co solution does not fully reproduce the color and spectrum of natural water the solution itself is brilliant yellow with a touch of blue while natural water is faded yellow with tints of red and brown crowther and evans 1981 this fact restricted the highest twc as measured with visual methods without dilution to 70 mgpt co l 1 the spectrum of natural water shows an exponential decrease of absorbance with increasing wavelength while the pt co standard has a singular sharp absorbance peak at 460 nm cuthbert and del giorgio 1992 mitchell and mcdonald 1991 as the spectrum of natural water and standard hazen pt co solution differ considerably two spectrum regions where they cross each other were usually applied for color determination with a spectrometer at 400 410 nm hongve and akesson 1996 hautala et al 2000 and near 456 465 nm bennett and drikas 1993 hautala et al 2000 efforts to develop a method based on two wavelengths from both spectral regions where the spectrum of natural water and pt co solution cross each other have also been conducted crowther and evans 1981 however they have not been widely used due to their complexity alternative standard solutions whose spectrum coincides more with that of natural water for example tannic acid equivalents cuthbert and del giorgio 1992 have been also proposed but they are not often used today the hazen scale has been adopted as the reference method by organizations that set standards for water quality examination hongve and akesson 1996 and this paper will be dedicated exclusively to true color determination in hazen units mgpt co l 1 the inconsistency between spectroscopy determination and visual methods has been highlighted by many researchers bennett and drikas 1993 hautala et al 2000 lozovik 2013 cuthbert and del giorgio 1992 in some cases a comparison between spectroscopic and visual methods was performed using relatively low color samples and solutions of less than 70 mgpt co l 1 hongve and akesson 1996 iso en 7887 2011 2012 crowther and evans 1981 using low colored waters to test for authenticity between spectroscopic and visual methods showed a large difference for high colored samples 150 mgpt co l 1 and allowed for spectroscopic methods to be firmly anchored in practice for high colored waters in yorkshire the influence of the site specific features of watershed hydrology on the absorption conversion coefficients at 400 nm on the hazen scale was emphasized watts et al 2001 they also assumed that conversion coefficients might have seasonal variation related to drought and subsequent recovery periods at first sight using light absorption on some wavelengths method a in iso en 7887 2011 2012 or the integral intensity of light absorption lozovik 2013 could be a solution for the problem however since the human eye has different sensitivity in different spectral ranges it is nearly impossible to obtain true color in hazen units by direct conversion of an absorption coefficient into hazen units which complicates the subsequent comparison of the results thus to obtain relevant results for true water color in hazen units spectroscopic measurements should be mathematically transformed and expressed in the same terms as the human eye perceives them such an opportunity is possible in the mathematical model of the standard observer s color perception fairman et al 1997 the standard observer is the mathematical model of the color perception of the average human response to light of different wavelengths it represents a stack of tables xyz coordinates or tristimulus values indicating the dimensionless response on the light of different wavelengths averaged between different observers the aim of this study is to present a new method for true color determination which is based on the mathematical model of color perception of the standard observer and spectroscopic measurements the method will be compared with other standardized techniques widely applied for true color determination including spectroscopic and visual determination to emphasize the difference between the results obtained by these two approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 background of the problem as stated above currently there is still no consensus on whether visual or spectroscopic technique are preferable and spectroscopic methods are standardized along with visual methods in many state and international standards the international standard iso en 7887 2011 2012 has been translated and applied widely in many countries in the eurasian customs union eacu gost 31868 2012 2014 technically corresponds to iso en 7887 2011 2012 but it is not its full equivalent neq it can be applied for twc determination in drinking water including waters from surface and groundwater sources along with the above standards on the territory of the russian federation the federal survey for hydrometeorology and monitoring directive document rd 52 24 497 2005 2005 is also valid for twc determination in surface waters they all standardized the spectroscopic method for twc determination with the pt co standard and visual determination in nessler cylinders iso en 7887 2011 2012 and gost 31868 2012 2014 implement spectroscopic determination using the pt co standard at the 410 nm wavelength and allow determination using an optical instrument comparator directive documents rd 52 24 497 2005 and gost 31868 2012 2014 also accept twc determination using the cr co imitational scale on 440 nm and 380 nm wavelengths respectively in rd 52 24 497 2005 spectroscopic determination must be employed on 440 nm regardless of the standard solution used graduation of the spectroscopic method is also slightly different in these international and state standards in iso en 7887 2011 2012 measurements must be made using only one standard solution 100 mgpt co l 1 while in rd 52 24 497 2005 eighteen graduation solutions from 0 to 500 mgpt co l 1 must be applied in gost 31868 2012 2014 eleven graduation solutions from 0 to 70 mgpt co l 1 are required along with sample dilution for twc above 70 mgpt co l 1 sample dilution in iso en 7887 2011 is also required but only when it is impossible to obtain spectrum due to total light absorption by the sample i e the technical limitations of a particular spectrometer determination of twc by all visual and some spectroscopic gost 31868 2012 2014 methods can be implemented only in the range from 0 to 70 mgpt co l 1 while twc in natural waters widely varies from near zero to 500 mgpt co l 1 and higher to implement such methods for high colored waters the samples must be diluted but this can alter the physical chemical conditions leading to a change in color iso en 7887 2011 2012 cause some non linear structural changes in humic material hautala et al 2000 and lead to lower accuracy in twc determination the errors that appeared during measurement in a narrow range of increases in concentration multiply with sample dilution therefore to obtain relevant results of true water color in hazen units it is necessary not only to incorporate the full visible spectrum but also to model the perception of the standard observer such an approach was realized for apparent water color determinations by applying the color matching method to the munsell standard davies colley et al 1997 crowther and evans 1981 where apparent water color was assessed in relation to three components water hue saturation and brightness however to assess the color in hazen units one independent variable needs to be established it must be isotropic in all visible color space must be associated with the same color difference of the hazen scale standards and must be a function of pt co concentration by beer s law this can be realized with the mathematical model of the standard observer as standardized in 1931 by the international commission on illumination commision internationale de i eclairage cie the basics of this system are still valid and many industrial color evaluation methods are based on cie colorimetry cie 1978 schanda 2007 hunt and pointer 2011 cie introduced an xyz color space that is a completely specified scheme for describing the color of light using three numerical values color coordinates defined widely as tristimulus color space kerr 2010 tristimulus values were defined statistically based on experiments involving human volunteers to assess their color vision and develop an average or standard observer hunt and pointer 2011 experiments were conducted with the 2 and 10 field of view of the human volunteers but currently the 10 standard observer is considered to best represent the average spectral response of human observers hunt and pointer 2011 although human color perception as well as cie xyz system is not linear the new color space cie l a b was introduced to measure the difference between colors cie 1978 in euclidian space although later the l a b system was found to be not completely isotropic the euclidian color difference formula was modified and evolved into the cie de2000 scheme schanda 2007 sharma et al 2005 the light source is a keystone of color measurement technology because as it is known the visible color of an object is a function of the spectral characteristics of both a particular object and a light source the visual identification of color in hazen units can only be conducted under daylight or daylight fluorescent lamps iso 2211 1973 1973 different types of light sources have been standardized by the cie as illuminants which are represented in tables of values of relative illuminant energy versus wavelength hunt and pointer 2011 to represent the daylight the standard illuminants of daylight d series cie d50 d55 d65 are used commonly in color measurement applications iso 3668 1998 1988 iso 3664 2000 2000 they were defined statistically in measurements of daylight and differ mainly by means of correlated color temperature which matches the black body near 5003 5500 and 6504 k respectively hunt and pointer 2011 illuminant d50 represents morning or horizon light at sunrise while d65 illuminant is suggested as average noon light hunt and pointer 2011 illuminant d55 simulates mid morning or mid afternoon daylight and has transitional energy spectrum which is closest to equal energy illuminant e the hypothetical reference radiator hunt and pointer 2011 vik and periyasamy 2018 every daylight illuminant can be reasonably applied to the true color determination model we will determine experimentally whether the model is the most suitable for the visual identification technique the reference white point is another important factor for converting tristimulus values into the l a b color space as a specific reference white point was not identified by the cie for such conversions any appropriate reference white point may be applied thus we will employ reference white points for different d illuminants to achieve the best fit of our model to the experimental data 2 2 proposed method setup the method is based on the mathematical model of color perception by the standard observer which was implemented in this paper to reproduce the visual method for true color determination in nessler cylinders d method in iso en 7887 2011 2012 the standard observer is generally a stack of mathematical functions in the form of tables imitating the dimensionless human response to each wavelength of light and has been widely applied in color calculations hunt and pointer 2011 visual observation with nessler cylinders includes the more than 5 cone of the field of the observer s view which is sufficiently wider than the cie 1931 2 standard observer cone thus we used the latest modification of 10 color matching functions derived from linear transformations of the 10 cone fundamentals of stockman and sharpe 2000 in 5 nm intervals obtained from web dataset http cvrl ioo ucl ac uk colour and vision research labs 2019 the result of the model depended on the spectrum of the light source thus the illuminants d series cie d50 d55 and d65 were tested to obtain the best fit between the results of the standard observer method and the results of visual determination illuminant d series energy spectra were derived from hunt and pointer 2011 the absorbance spectrum was measured as the input value for the model this was the main difference from classical colorimetry where transmittance or reflectance is usually applied to calculate tristimulus values hunt and pointer 2011 absorbance was used because it has a linear relation with chemical concentration according to beer s law this contrasts with transmittance which has a non linear response therefore absorbance was applied for this purpose and it gave us a linear response to changes in pt co concentration in the solution over wide range of concentrations for the implementation of the method the absorbance spectrum the color matching functions and the illuminant energy spectra derived in the extended visible spectrum ranged from 390 to 830 nm with 5 nm increments the cie de2000 color difference between the blank sample and the environmental sample calculated in the l a b color space was chosen as the measurement signal absorbance spectra were acquired using spectrophotometer sf 56 okb spectr russia in a 5 cm quartz measuring cell however any spectrometer capable of measuring transmittance or absorbance in wavelengths ranging from 390 to 830 nm in 5 nm intervals and equipped with software that is able to archive spectra data as an external txt file can be implemented transmittance can be converted to absorbance using log transformation vik and periyasamy 2018 when required text output is required for automatic data procession see appendix b for details as we obtained the linear response of the measuring signal in a wide range of concentrations the method does not require sample dilution for the whole measuring range thus twc standards for the proposed method were prepared according to iso en 7887 2011 2012 on a progressive scale from 0 to 500 mgpt l 0 5 10 30 50 70 100 150 300 500 mgpt l 1 both in pt co hazen and cr co scales 2 3 method implementation to implement the proposed method the absorbance spectra of the sample blank the standards and the environmental samples must be collected relative to a blank fig 1 the spectrum taken from the sample blank against itself represents the blank twc standard and the blank twc sample all spectra must be baseline corrected each value in the absorbance spectrum of the target sample a Î» and the blank sample a0 Î» should be multiplied by normalized weight factors wx Î» wy Î» wz Î» one by one for each wavelength Î» implementing formulas a 1 from appendix a fig 1 for the target and blank spectra tristimulus values should be calculated separately as the area under each of the resulted curves x0 1 y0 1 z0 1 and x2 y2 z2 implementing formulas a 1 from appendix where x0 1 y0 1 z0 1 are tristimulus values for the blank twc sample in the next step tristimulus values must be converted into the l a b color space with the reference white point tristimulus values using formulas a 2 and obtaining coordinates l 0 1 a 0 1 b 0 1 and l 2 a 2 b 2 corresponding to each spectrum formulas a 3 must be applied to calculate the color difference cie de2000 Î´e00 between the blank twc sample and the target twc sample forming the measuring signal fig 1 in order to evaluate the best method setup we tested illuminants d50 d55 and d65 and the white points of these illuminants illuminant d50 and the white point of d65 illuminant gave us the best fit for the experimental data see section 3 3 1 for details color difference must be preliminarily calculated for every twc standard in the same manner as it was stated above for the target sample fig 1 and the linear graduation curve must be obtained by determining the pt co concentration in a solution and the color difference the twc of the environmental sample can be calculated from the graduation curve by determining the color difference Î´e00 between the target sample and the blank twc sample fig 1 the proposed method involves a complex mathematical apparatus making the manual calculation of twc difficult to maintain twc calculation a specialized computer program called watercolour zobkov 2019 was developed using the delphi7 programming language which is freeware and is available at mendeley data https doi org 10 17632 dgdb2gp835 2 see program description in appendix b for details 2 4 environmental and test samples environmental samples were collected from lakes rivers and the drainage waters of a landfill site of petrozavodsk city in 2017 2018 the studied area lies in the northwestern part of the russian federation in the republic of karelia between the coordinates 63 n 31 w and 60 n 36 w it is situated in humid zone thus water bodies have high colored humic substances content and variability ten small lakes four stations on lake onego and five rivers lake onego tributaries were investigated on some water bodies samples were collected in different seasons all studied water bodies differ from each other by organic matter content and composition and watershed area the watershed area varied from 7 9 to 10300 km2 total organic carbon toc concentration varied widely in the environmental samples minimal values were found in small lakes 2 4 17 6 mgc l 1 much higher values in rivers 16 8 35 9 mgc l 1 and maximal values in wastewater 28 5 119 1 mgc l 1 toc concentrations were determined using the uv peroxodisulfate oxidation method employing an original device zobkov and zobkova 2015 test samples were prepared to obtain water solutions of different natural organic matter content with a constant fulvic and humic acids ratio to obtain a concentrate of humic substances they were isolated from a peatland water sample with the deae cellulose technique according to method lozovik and musatova 2013 and humic substances elution was realized with 0 1 n naoh according to method 5510 b apha 1999 to prepare solutions with different humic substances content volumes of concentrate 0 5 1 2 5 10 and 20 ml were diluted to volume 250 ml in a volumetric flask with optical pure distilled water 2 5 sample preparation and instrumentation samples were collected stored and filtered using membrane filters according to iso en 7887 2011 2012 regardless of the method of identification three standard methods of true color determination in agreement with iso en 7887 2011 2012 were applied determination of absorbance at the 410 nm wavelength with a spectrometer the c method spectrometer sf 56 okb spectr russia using an optical instrument the d method using comparator lovibond neslslerizer 2250 and the adopted visual colorimetric titration method for true color determination in nessler cylinders an analogue of the d method all visual measurements in the current work were performed by two independent observers who successfully completed the farnsworth munsell 100 hue test farnsworth 1943 previously it has been demonstrated that inter operator variability has a random nature crowther and evans 1981 therefore two independent observers implementing two different methods were deemed sufficient to represent visual observation techniques while existing spectroscopic methods are numerous and generally differ from each other only in using different wavelengths for twc determination we will represent only two of them as published in state and international standards in this paper however based on our literature survey we assume they represent a wide range of similar methods based on twc determination on a single wavelength spectroscopic twc measurement through the determination of absorbance on the wavelength 410 nm generally followed the iso en 7887 2011 2012 approach with the exception of the graduation procedure which was implemented using ten standard solutions on a progressive scale 0 5 10 30 50 70 100 150 300 500 mgpt l 1 to improve graduation accuracy spectroscopic determination at 440 nm using the cr co standard was followed rd 52 24 497 2005 2005 using ten standard solutions and the same progressive scale 0 5 10 30 50 70 100 150 300 500 mgpt l 1 the visual colorimetric titration method ctm was adopted from semenov 1977 to reproduce the d method iso en 7887 2011 2012 for true color determination in nessler cylinders two 100 ml nessler cylinders 40 cm in length and one 5 ml micro burette were used for this method elaboration the first cylinder was filled up with a sample to the 100 ml mark and fixed in holder the second one was filled up with distilled water to the 95 ml mark and fixed near the first cylinder the water in the second cylinder was titrated with portions of the hazen scale standard 500 mgpt co l 1 using the micro burette afterwards each portion was titrated the second cylinder was lidded and rotated several times to mix the solution the water color in the second cylinder was compared against the same in the first cylinder and the procedure was repeated several times until the colors matched each ml of titrated standard was equal to 5 mgpt co l 1 when implementing visual methods samples with a twc higher than 70 hazen units were diluted with optically pure water the blanks and standards used in the current work were prepared using optically pure water fresh distilled water with mean conductivity 2 Î¼s cm in agreement with iso en 7887 2011 the hazen scale standards were prepared as described in iso en 7887 2011 the standards of the cr co scale were prepared as reference mixture 2 according to rd 52 24 497 2005 gost r 52769 2007 2010 in a following way dilute potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 0 0875 g and cobalt sulfate coso4 7h2o 2 000 g in distilled water in a calibrated 1 l flask adding 1 cm3 of concentrated sulphuric acid density 1 84 g cm3 and make up the volume in the flask with distilled water the reference mixture is valid for three months after preparation and equivalent to 500 10 mgpt co l 1 on the hazen scale 2 6 statistical analysis the standard methods applied for twc determination have their own peculiar drawbacks and none of them can act as a precise reference method thus to represent the agreement between the visual and spectroscopic methods the data obtained with every visual method was plotted against the spectroscopic one using the tukey mean difference m d plot cleveland 1994 also known as the bland altman ba plot bland and altman 2003 where the difference between the two methods is represented relative to their mean while the figures on the plots are numerous we will present only the regression parameters and the correlation coefficients between each pair of methods as well as the parameters of the regression for the difference plot against their mean the key features will be presented in form of plots in most cases the disagreement between the methods altered with twc and had a multiplicative character thus to represent this trend clearly on the plots the difference between the two methods was expressed as the relative difference between the two methods to their mean in the tables the absolute difference the classical m d plot twc expressed in mgpt co l 1 is presented the anova and pearson tests were performed using the sofa statistics software www sofastatistics com 3 results and discussion in total 60 water samples 53 environmental and 7 test were analyzed with different visual and spectroscopic methods test samples produced similar trends with the environmental samples therefore they all were statistically processed as one population regardless of the fact that the test samples were highlighted in the figures 3 1 visual methods in table 1 the parameters of the agreement between each pair of methods are presented regression parameters represent the root square mean deviation between two methods while mean difference parameters regression parameters from m d plot represent how the difference between the two methods varied against their mean using the a coefficient of the regression line we can estimate the bias between values obtained by two different methods or observers thus the a values near the one with a high r2 coefficient represent good agreement between the two methods and replicates and a 1 100 is the rate of disagreement of the first method y against the second x coefficient b represents the additive share of error for the visual methods the standard solution increment is 5 mgpt co l 1 the estimated standard deviation between different laboratories running visual methods hongve and akesson 1996 was also 5 mgpt co l 1 therefore we will take 5 mgpt co l 1 as a boundary value for the additive share of error to evaluate agreement of methods however as discussed above each method has some uncertainties and none of them can act as pure reference the difference between the values observed using the two methods against their mean will be used to represent agreement between methods clearly cleveland 1994 bland and altman 2003 mean difference regression parameters carry core information about the rate of agreement between two methods or replicates the bdiff coefficient represents the additive or constant share of error which does not alter with water color the adiff coefficient demonstrates the multiplicative share of error which does alter with water color when observations from different acquisitions are consistent the adiff coefficient as well as bdiff and r2 diff will tend toward zero demonstrating that the methods produce the same results otherwise they will indicate the rate of disagreement between two acquisitions i e the multiplicative adiff and additive bdiff share of error and the significance of this relation r2 diff the pearson p value represents the statistical significance of the regression in the current paper the statistical significance level was set at 0 01 as can be seen from table 1 the results obtained by different observers are in good agreement with each other m d 5 mgpt co l 1 adiff 0 b 5 mgpt co l 1 r2 diff 0 p 0 01 regardless of the visual determination method this indicates the random share of error introduced by different observers as a result we can arguably calculate the average value obtained by different observers to characterize each method according to table 1 a multiplicative bias was observed between the two visual methods which resulted in twc overestimation with ctm against the comparator the mean difference between the two methods was 8 8 mgpt co l 1 2 56 and twc as estimated by the ctm method was 10 higher than by the comparator the difference is particularly evident for values above 200 mgpt co l 1 fig 2 the values of b and b diff represent a high additive share of error however the error bars on fig 2 demonstrate that this difference is near the acceptable range for method repeatability gost 31868 2012 2014 therefore to make a comparison with spectroscopic methods we will use the average value obtained by both observers employing the two visual methods as the accepted reference value together with the average twc obtained by different observers for each method separately which accounts for 240 independent acquisitions in total 3 2 spectroscopic determination at a single wavelength all spectroscopic methods showed the presence of a multiplicative share of error when compared with visual ones table 2 pearson p value 0 01 the spectroscopic method for twc determination using the cr co standard at the 440 nm wavelength cr440 rd 52 24 497 2005 was found to overestimate the results obtained using the pt co standard with the 410 nm wavelength determination pt410 method c iso en 7887 2011 2012 over 10 table 2 as can be seen from table 2 both spectroscopic methods systematically overestimate twc when compared with the visual ones pearson p value 0 01 r2 diff 0 75 the best fit between the visual and spectroscopic methods was obtained between the pt410 method and ctm where the values received from the first method overestimated the values of the second one by only 21 the worst result was obtained between cr440 and the comparator method where the first one overestimated the second one by almost half 47 for the cr440 method against ctm and the pt410 against the comparator overestimation was 33 and 34 respectively the relative mean difference between the methods was slightly smaller but systematic deviation can be clearly seen table 2 for the mean twc obtained with both visual methods against the spectroscopic ones the results were not much better than for each method separately table 2 figs 3 and 4 note that the figures show the relative difference thus in both cases overestimation had a multiplicative character such difference agrees with the estimation of 20 established by bennett and drikas 1993 for spectroscopic determination at a single wavelength and coincides with the findings of hautala et al 2000 where the difference between the comparator method and spectroscopic determination wavelengths 400 and 465 nm ranged from 10 to 36 watts et al 2001 assessed that the conversion coefficients for ten small catchments in yorkshire varied between 11 05 and 13 01 when converting from au m in hazen units knowing the graduation curve coefficient evaluated from our data 0 0047 400 nm 5 cm cuvette one can estimate the conversion coefficients from spectroscopy to the visual method that vary from underestimation of 3 7 to overestimation of 22 3 on one hand this variation was found to be site specific watts et al 2001 on the other hand it was established for relatively small watersheds from 3 7 to 21 9 km2 in the current work large watersheds and their sub watersheds areas up to 10300 km2 were considered and fluctuations due to the local specifics of micro watersheds should be neglected in conversion coefficient estimation each of the considered studies reported that spectroscopic determination overestimates the results of visual determination which fully coincides with our data therefore knowing the large variation in conversion coefficients as reported in different studies it is obvious that the establishment of a universal conversion coefficient between visual and spectroscopic determination is practically impossible mitchell and mcdonald 1991 due to the large share of error appearing in such conversion taking into account the large share of errors the conversion can be applied only in some specific cases when no other alternatives exist natural water is a combined solution where the proportions and concentration of individual substances vary depending on natural conditions and are mostly unknown however as stated above true color arises mainly from light absorption by fulvic and humic acids the ratio of fulvic to humic acids can vary significantly in different natural waters from 10 1 in low colored surface waters down to 5 1 or less in highly colored surface waters aitkenhead peterson et al 2003 mostofa et al 2012 meanwhile the color value of humic acid is approximately fourfold when compared to that of fulvic acid visser 1984 aside from that the difference in the light absorbance of fulvic and humic acids increase towards the uv zone lawrence 1980 particularly where the spectroscopic determination bands are located and vary with both of them according to beer s law therefore the cross points between the hazen standard and natural water can drift depending on the ratio of fulvic and humic acid content in a sample this introduces undeterminable bias into the color evaluation process which was also previously noted by bennett and drikas 1993 this was also highlighted in work watts et al 2001 where the variation of conversion factors between absorbance at 400 nm and hazen units was explained by the changes in composition and mix of color forming compounds crowther and evans 1981 studied spectra of humic acid lignin sulfonate ferric chloride and natural water in comparison to the pt co standard and concluded that selecting a single wavelength for color measurement would be difficult bennett and drikas 1993 concluded that the single analytical wavelength introduces a negative through to positive error in the determination of low to high colored waters respectively cuthbert and del giorgio 1992 also assumed that color estimates derived by equating the absorption coefficients of water samples with those of standard pt co solutions are incompatible regardless of wavelength applied mitchell and mcdonald 1991 also concluded that it is impossible to calibrate hazen solutions on a spectrometer to determine the conversion factor for placing absorbance units on to the hazen scale these arguments and years of studies indicate that the goal of searching for the best single wavelength for spectroscopic determination of twc in hazen units is unachievable thus it is possible to conclude that the results obtained with standard spectroscopic methods cannot substitute the visual ones and that the precise results of twc estimation in hazen units cannot be directly obtained from existing spectroscopy therefore to retrieve twc in hazen scale units from spectral data a method involving the mathematical model of standard observer perception was developed 3 3 proposed method 3 3 1 method parameters different light sources and reference white points of d50 d55 and d65 illuminants were tested in order to determine the best fit between the proposed method and the visual methods the comparator ctm and mean visual twc obtained with both of them were compared to the proposed method with different combinations of the light sources and reference white points regression parameters a and r2 as well as mean difference and m d regression parameters adiff r2 diff were assumed to be major arbitrary values tables c 1 c 6 the proposed method was found to be sensitive to the combination of the reference white point and light source involved as can be seen from the arbitrary values analysis tables c 1 c 6 the agreement between the proposed method and the visual methods generally increased together with the reference white point illuminant number correlated illuminant energy and conversely agreement decreased with the increasing light source illuminant number the different color scales pt co and cr co produced similar trends consequently the best fit between the proposed method and the visual methods was obtained for the d50 illuminant light source and the d65 illuminant reference white point these attributes were applied further when addressing the proposed method which is also denoted as the d50d65 standard observer method setup the mean relative difference between the mean twc measured by the visual methods and the proposed method was 7 5 for the pt co scale and 5 3 for the cr co scale however for twc values below 20 mgpt co l 1 the relative difference was much higher than 20 and reached up to 130 for the cr co scale and 86 for the pt co scale which was unacceptable to solve the problem the dedicated graduation curve with a range from 0 to 50 mgpt co l 1 was applied for this purpose the previously established values 0 5 10 30 50 mgpt co l 1 were used elaboration of this graduation curve reduced the mean difference down to 0 9 mgpt co l 1 or 7 5 for the pt co scale and 1 6 mgpt co l 1 or 19 5 for cr co in the problematic range from 0 to 20 mgpt co l 1 in further analysis two graduation curves figs 5 6 were applied to calculate twc values in corresponding diapason 3 3 2 agreement with the visual methods both the pt co and cr co scales showed good agreement with the mean twc obtained by the two visual methods average of two observers and two methods however the pt co scale showed better agreement with the comparator method and the cr co with ctm table 3 a multiplicative share of error based on pearson p value was detected only in two cases table 3 however the relative m d and adiff coefficients were very small not exceeding 3 5 and 0 08 respectively which is acceptable thus both scales can be applied for method implementation however the pt co scale gives lower dispersion for small twc values and is applied widely further we will use it as the standard scale for method implementation and evaluation due to its precision and accuracy the mean difference between twc measured by the visual methods and the proposed method using two graduation pt co scale curves was 3 2 mgpt co l 1 sd 11 5 mgpt co l 1 or 2 36 sd 8 8 fig 7 table 3 which is almost one order of magnitude lower than for the standard pt410 method and represents good method fit as can be seen from fig 7 the relative difference for the pt co scale between the visual methods and the proposed method is constant within the whole measuring range from 3 to 500 mgpt co l 1 the relative difference between the methods showed no correlation with their mean adiff 0 0014 r2 0 0003 and the offset was only 2 6 fig 7 which represents a good agreement of the proposed method with the visual method this result demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method when compared with standard spectroscopic methods table 2 figs 3 4 where overestimation of 22 8 and 35 for the pt410 and cr440 methods respectively against the visual methods was obtained therefore in the aspect of agreement with the visual methods the proposed d50d65 method has higher accuracy than existing spectroscopy 3 3 3 method analytical performance the detection limit for the proposed method was estimated with 50 blank samples the mean de2000 signal was 0 0087 with a standard deviation of 0 007 thus the detection limit of the method estimated by the 3Î´ criterion using the 0 50 mgpt co l 1 graduation curve was 3 3 mgpt co l 1 to implement the method two graduation curves must be applied for twc calculation in different measuring ranges the graduation curve 0 50 mgpt co l 1 fig 5 must be applied for twc calculation in range 3 20 mgpt co l 1 and the curve 3 500 mgpt co l 1 fig 6 in range 20 500 mgpt co l 1 the regression coefficients for both curves are higher than 0 999 and the intercepts are lower than detection limit 0 5 and 2 2 mgpt co l 1 correspondingly for the 0 50 and 0 500 graduation curves demonstrating the stability of the measuring signal the precision of the proposed method was estimated by the repeatability of detection results obtained during subsequent measurements of seven environmental samples with mean twcs of 6 10 23 43 94 172 and 381 mgpt co l 1 fifteen replicates were measured for each sample forming 105 acquisitions in total the twc deviation for each replicate from sample mean was not statistically significant between all concentrations anova test p 1 00 0 01 df 98 thus the method precision was constant and independent from twc within all measuring ranges the calculated pooled standard deviation in the measuring range from 6 to 381 mgpt co l 1 for the proposed method was 0 3 mgpt co l 1 with df 98 if comparing the precision of the proposed method with the other standard methods fig 8 the method superiority can be clearly seen in repeatability conditions it demonstrates a standard deviation of at least three times lower than the existing spectroscopy pt410 method according to iso en 7887 2011 2012 six times lower than spectroscopic method in rd 52 24 497 2005 and from four times to two orders of magnitude lower than stated in gost 31868 2012 2014 the precision of the proposed method can be also seen if comparing sd with published data of interlaboratory comparisons of the traditional spectroscopy method hongve and akesson 1996 where sd for different samples varied between 1 6 and 3 5 mgpt co l 1 even when additional quality assurance criterion involving commercially available humic acid was applied the proposed method does not require a preliminary dilution step for samples with twc below 500 mgpt co l 1 this makes it more stable when compared with the standard methods where dilution can change physical chemical conditions in sample leading to twc alteration sample preparation technique was the same as described in the standard methods iso en 7887 2011 2012 therefore it has the same interferences as the standard methods do interferences can mainly occur during the filtration step resulting in the presence of colloidal solids which cannot be removed during filtration iron and manganese compounds can be retained on the filter or transferred to a solute state during oxidation iso en 7887 2011 2012 water ph can also affect water color therefore the ph must be regularly determined in parallel with twc measurements and reported with other results iso en 7887 2011 2012 4 conclusion it was demonstrated that standard spectroscopic methods systematically overestimate visual methods from 21 to 47 depending on the methods involved through a review of previous studies related to the problem of true water color determination it was revealed that because of the unpredictable and multicomponent compound nature of natural water it is impossible to establish some universal and reliable conversion coefficient for color recalculation from absorbance to hazen units as well as to establish a single universal wavelength for precise color determination with existing spectroscopy to retrieve the relevant true water color from spectral data a new spectroscopic method was developed the method showed good agreement with both the comparator method and determination in nessler cylinders two variations of the d method according to iso en 7887 2011 2012 and their mean the mean relative difference between the proposed method and the comparator method was 3 determination in nessler cylinders 8 and mean twc for the two visual methods only 2 which demonstrates high agreement between the proposed method and the standard visual methods the method has a broad measurement range from 3 to 500 mgpt co l 1 which makes it unnecessary to dilute the samples as previously required in some standard methods making the analysis process more accurate and faster the method precision was found to be independent from twc in all measurement ranges with sd 0 3 mgpt co l 1 df 98 which is at least three times lower than stated for standard spectroscopic methods showing higher accuracy and precision as a result the proposed method can be applied for twc determination in environmental samples from 3 3 to 500 mgpt co l 1 with sd 0 3 mgpt

17963,true water color twc is an important water quality indicator however despite many efforts for standardization of methods for twc determination there is still no consistency between visual and spectroscopic techniques this study demonstrates that standard spectroscopic methods overestimate visual data from 21 to 47 depending on methods involved to retrieve relevant true water color values from spectral data a new spectroscopic method is proposed the method is based on the mathematical model of color perception by the standard observer implementing the de2000 color difference in the l a b color space as calculated between blank and water samples the method showed good agreement with the visual methods comparator method and determination in nessler cylinders and the mean values between these methods the mean relative difference between the proposed method and the mean of the two visual methods is only 2 the method precision is independent from twc in all measurement ranges and has sr 0 3 mgpt co l 1 df 98 which is at least three times lower than for the standard methods as such it shows higher accuracy and precision as a result the proposed method can be used for twc determination in environmental samples from 3 3 to 500 mgpt co l 1 with sd 0 3 mgpt co l 1 in all measuring ranges making sample dilution unnecessary graphical abstract image 1 keywords water color true color natural water visual method spectroscopic method determination 1 introduction color is an important water quality indicator that defines the organoleptic properties of water together with turbidity and odor water color is usually caused by the presence of dissolved organic substances particularly fulvic and humic acids which originate from decaying vegetable matter accumulated in soil and peatlands dissolved natural minerals such as ferric hydroxide hongve and akesson 1996 and particulate matter such as suspended solids and phytoplankton davies colley et al 1997 water color alternation can be caused by waste discharge or other anthropogenic impact and can act as an environmental marker gost 31868 2012 2014 two terms are usually used to describe the water color apparent color is a result of the combined effect of light absorption by dissolved and particulate matter it is what one actually sees in the water body apparent color can vary from blue green green yellow and yellow to ultimately orange davies colley and nagels 1998 and it can be estimated in situ from digital images using ccd cameras novoa et al 2015 klaveness 2005 true water color twc results from light absorbance by dissolved organic matter and minerals only these substances generally produce water colors of yellow brown gamut the hazen scale based on standards of pt co is used widely to estimate twc iso en 7887 2011 2012 the alternative cr co scale so called imitational has also been employed for this purpose in environmental applications semenov 1977 rd 52 24 497 2005 2005 gost 31868 2012 2014 this paper will highlight the contradictions between existing methods and elaborate a new method for color determination that aims to eliminate them true color can only be measured once a sample has been collected centrifuged or filtered apha 1992 bennett and drikas 1993 moore and caux 1997 initially determination of true color was based on a visual comparison of a filtered water sample with platinum cobalt pt co solutions of the hazen scale and later standard solutions were replaced by color disks that were incorporated into a comparator for measurements facilitation such visual methods were criticized widely because of their subjectivity and low precision hongve and akesson 1996 bennett and drikas 1993 crowther and evans 1981 mitchell and mcdonald 1991 this is why later spectroscopic methods have replaced visual ones bennett and drikas 1993 spectroscopic determination was applied in various methods using a wide range of analytical wavelengths but usually only one wavelength was applied to facilitate the determination procedure hongve and akesson 1996 bennett and drikas 1993 however spectroscopic techniques do not always produce the same results as visual methods do bennett and drikas 1993 hongve and akesson 1996 the core of the contradiction lies in the fact that standard pt co solution does not fully reproduce the color and spectrum of natural water the solution itself is brilliant yellow with a touch of blue while natural water is faded yellow with tints of red and brown crowther and evans 1981 this fact restricted the highest twc as measured with visual methods without dilution to 70 mgpt co l 1 the spectrum of natural water shows an exponential decrease of absorbance with increasing wavelength while the pt co standard has a singular sharp absorbance peak at 460 nm cuthbert and del giorgio 1992 mitchell and mcdonald 1991 as the spectrum of natural water and standard hazen pt co solution differ considerably two spectrum regions where they cross each other were usually applied for color determination with a spectrometer at 400 410 nm hongve and akesson 1996 hautala et al 2000 and near 456 465 nm bennett and drikas 1993 hautala et al 2000 efforts to develop a method based on two wavelengths from both spectral regions where the spectrum of natural water and pt co solution cross each other have also been conducted crowther and evans 1981 however they have not been widely used due to their complexity alternative standard solutions whose spectrum coincides more with that of natural water for example tannic acid equivalents cuthbert and del giorgio 1992 have been also proposed but they are not often used today the hazen scale has been adopted as the reference method by organizations that set standards for water quality examination hongve and akesson 1996 and this paper will be dedicated exclusively to true color determination in hazen units mgpt co l 1 the inconsistency between spectroscopy determination and visual methods has been highlighted by many researchers bennett and drikas 1993 hautala et al 2000 lozovik 2013 cuthbert and del giorgio 1992 in some cases a comparison between spectroscopic and visual methods was performed using relatively low color samples and solutions of less than 70 mgpt co l 1 hongve and akesson 1996 iso en 7887 2011 2012 crowther and evans 1981 using low colored waters to test for authenticity between spectroscopic and visual methods showed a large difference for high colored samples 150 mgpt co l 1 and allowed for spectroscopic methods to be firmly anchored in practice for high colored waters in yorkshire the influence of the site specific features of watershed hydrology on the absorption conversion coefficients at 400 nm on the hazen scale was emphasized watts et al 2001 they also assumed that conversion coefficients might have seasonal variation related to drought and subsequent recovery periods at first sight using light absorption on some wavelengths method a in iso en 7887 2011 2012 or the integral intensity of light absorption lozovik 2013 could be a solution for the problem however since the human eye has different sensitivity in different spectral ranges it is nearly impossible to obtain true color in hazen units by direct conversion of an absorption coefficient into hazen units which complicates the subsequent comparison of the results thus to obtain relevant results for true water color in hazen units spectroscopic measurements should be mathematically transformed and expressed in the same terms as the human eye perceives them such an opportunity is possible in the mathematical model of the standard observer s color perception fairman et al 1997 the standard observer is the mathematical model of the color perception of the average human response to light of different wavelengths it represents a stack of tables xyz coordinates or tristimulus values indicating the dimensionless response on the light of different wavelengths averaged between different observers the aim of this study is to present a new method for true color determination which is based on the mathematical model of color perception of the standard observer and spectroscopic measurements the method will be compared with other standardized techniques widely applied for true color determination including spectroscopic and visual determination to emphasize the difference between the results obtained by these two approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 background of the problem as stated above currently there is still no consensus on whether visual or spectroscopic technique are preferable and spectroscopic methods are standardized along with visual methods in many state and international standards the international standard iso en 7887 2011 2012 has been translated and applied widely in many countries in the eurasian customs union eacu gost 31868 2012 2014 technically corresponds to iso en 7887 2011 2012 but it is not its full equivalent neq it can be applied for twc determination in drinking water including waters from surface and groundwater sources along with the above standards on the territory of the russian federation the federal survey for hydrometeorology and monitoring directive document rd 52 24 497 2005 2005 is also valid for twc determination in surface waters they all standardized the spectroscopic method for twc determination with the pt co standard and visual determination in nessler cylinders iso en 7887 2011 2012 and gost 31868 2012 2014 implement spectroscopic determination using the pt co standard at the 410 nm wavelength and allow determination using an optical instrument comparator directive documents rd 52 24 497 2005 and gost 31868 2012 2014 also accept twc determination using the cr co imitational scale on 440 nm and 380 nm wavelengths respectively in rd 52 24 497 2005 spectroscopic determination must be employed on 440 nm regardless of the standard solution used graduation of the spectroscopic method is also slightly different in these international and state standards in iso en 7887 2011 2012 measurements must be made using only one standard solution 100 mgpt co l 1 while in rd 52 24 497 2005 eighteen graduation solutions from 0 to 500 mgpt co l 1 must be applied in gost 31868 2012 2014 eleven graduation solutions from 0 to 70 mgpt co l 1 are required along with sample dilution for twc above 70 mgpt co l 1 sample dilution in iso en 7887 2011 is also required but only when it is impossible to obtain spectrum due to total light absorption by the sample i e the technical limitations of a particular spectrometer determination of twc by all visual and some spectroscopic gost 31868 2012 2014 methods can be implemented only in the range from 0 to 70 mgpt co l 1 while twc in natural waters widely varies from near zero to 500 mgpt co l 1 and higher to implement such methods for high colored waters the samples must be diluted but this can alter the physical chemical conditions leading to a change in color iso en 7887 2011 2012 cause some non linear structural changes in humic material hautala et al 2000 and lead to lower accuracy in twc determination the errors that appeared during measurement in a narrow range of increases in concentration multiply with sample dilution therefore to obtain relevant results of true water color in hazen units it is necessary not only to incorporate the full visible spectrum but also to model the perception of the standard observer such an approach was realized for apparent water color determinations by applying the color matching method to the munsell standard davies colley et al 1997 crowther and evans 1981 where apparent water color was assessed in relation to three components water hue saturation and brightness however to assess the color in hazen units one independent variable needs to be established it must be isotropic in all visible color space must be associated with the same color difference of the hazen scale standards and must be a function of pt co concentration by beer s law this can be realized with the mathematical model of the standard observer as standardized in 1931 by the international commission on illumination commision internationale de i eclairage cie the basics of this system are still valid and many industrial color evaluation methods are based on cie colorimetry cie 1978 schanda 2007 hunt and pointer 2011 cie introduced an xyz color space that is a completely specified scheme for describing the color of light using three numerical values color coordinates defined widely as tristimulus color space kerr 2010 tristimulus values were defined statistically based on experiments involving human volunteers to assess their color vision and develop an average or standard observer hunt and pointer 2011 experiments were conducted with the 2 and 10 field of view of the human volunteers but currently the 10 standard observer is considered to best represent the average spectral response of human observers hunt and pointer 2011 although human color perception as well as cie xyz system is not linear the new color space cie l a b was introduced to measure the difference between colors cie 1978 in euclidian space although later the l a b system was found to be not completely isotropic the euclidian color difference formula was modified and evolved into the cie de2000 scheme schanda 2007 sharma et al 2005 the light source is a keystone of color measurement technology because as it is known the visible color of an object is a function of the spectral characteristics of both a particular object and a light source the visual identification of color in hazen units can only be conducted under daylight or daylight fluorescent lamps iso 2211 1973 1973 different types of light sources have been standardized by the cie as illuminants which are represented in tables of values of relative illuminant energy versus wavelength hunt and pointer 2011 to represent the daylight the standard illuminants of daylight d series cie d50 d55 d65 are used commonly in color measurement applications iso 3668 1998 1988 iso 3664 2000 2000 they were defined statistically in measurements of daylight and differ mainly by means of correlated color temperature which matches the black body near 5003 5500 and 6504 k respectively hunt and pointer 2011 illuminant d50 represents morning or horizon light at sunrise while d65 illuminant is suggested as average noon light hunt and pointer 2011 illuminant d55 simulates mid morning or mid afternoon daylight and has transitional energy spectrum which is closest to equal energy illuminant e the hypothetical reference radiator hunt and pointer 2011 vik and periyasamy 2018 every daylight illuminant can be reasonably applied to the true color determination model we will determine experimentally whether the model is the most suitable for the visual identification technique the reference white point is another important factor for converting tristimulus values into the l a b color space as a specific reference white point was not identified by the cie for such conversions any appropriate reference white point may be applied thus we will employ reference white points for different d illuminants to achieve the best fit of our model to the experimental data 2 2 proposed method setup the method is based on the mathematical model of color perception by the standard observer which was implemented in this paper to reproduce the visual method for true color determination in nessler cylinders d method in iso en 7887 2011 2012 the standard observer is generally a stack of mathematical functions in the form of tables imitating the dimensionless human response to each wavelength of light and has been widely applied in color calculations hunt and pointer 2011 visual observation with nessler cylinders includes the more than 5 cone of the field of the observer s view which is sufficiently wider than the cie 1931 2 standard observer cone thus we used the latest modification of 10 color matching functions derived from linear transformations of the 10 cone fundamentals of stockman and sharpe 2000 in 5 nm intervals obtained from web dataset http cvrl ioo ucl ac uk colour and vision research labs 2019 the result of the model depended on the spectrum of the light source thus the illuminants d series cie d50 d55 and d65 were tested to obtain the best fit between the results of the standard observer method and the results of visual determination illuminant d series energy spectra were derived from hunt and pointer 2011 the absorbance spectrum was measured as the input value for the model this was the main difference from classical colorimetry where transmittance or reflectance is usually applied to calculate tristimulus values hunt and pointer 2011 absorbance was used because it has a linear relation with chemical concentration according to beer s law this contrasts with transmittance which has a non linear response therefore absorbance was applied for this purpose and it gave us a linear response to changes in pt co concentration in the solution over wide range of concentrations for the implementation of the method the absorbance spectrum the color matching functions and the illuminant energy spectra derived in the extended visible spectrum ranged from 390 to 830 nm with 5 nm increments the cie de2000 color difference between the blank sample and the environmental sample calculated in the l a b color space was chosen as the measurement signal absorbance spectra were acquired using spectrophotometer sf 56 okb spectr russia in a 5 cm quartz measuring cell however any spectrometer capable of measuring transmittance or absorbance in wavelengths ranging from 390 to 830 nm in 5 nm intervals and equipped with software that is able to archive spectra data as an external txt file can be implemented transmittance can be converted to absorbance using log transformation vik and periyasamy 2018 when required text output is required for automatic data procession see appendix b for details as we obtained the linear response of the measuring signal in a wide range of concentrations the method does not require sample dilution for the whole measuring range thus twc standards for the proposed method were prepared according to iso en 7887 2011 2012 on a progressive scale from 0 to 500 mgpt l 0 5 10 30 50 70 100 150 300 500 mgpt l 1 both in pt co hazen and cr co scales 2 3 method implementation to implement the proposed method the absorbance spectra of the sample blank the standards and the environmental samples must be collected relative to a blank fig 1 the spectrum taken from the sample blank against itself represents the blank twc standard and the blank twc sample all spectra must be baseline corrected each value in the absorbance spectrum of the target sample a Î» and the blank sample a0 Î» should be multiplied by normalized weight factors wx Î» wy Î» wz Î» one by one for each wavelength Î» implementing formulas a 1 from appendix a fig 1 for the target and blank spectra tristimulus values should be calculated separately as the area under each of the resulted curves x0 1 y0 1 z0 1 and x2 y2 z2 implementing formulas a 1 from appendix where x0 1 y0 1 z0 1 are tristimulus values for the blank twc sample in the next step tristimulus values must be converted into the l a b color space with the reference white point tristimulus values using formulas a 2 and obtaining coordinates l 0 1 a 0 1 b 0 1 and l 2 a 2 b 2 corresponding to each spectrum formulas a 3 must be applied to calculate the color difference cie de2000 Î´e00 between the blank twc sample and the target twc sample forming the measuring signal fig 1 in order to evaluate the best method setup we tested illuminants d50 d55 and d65 and the white points of these illuminants illuminant d50 and the white point of d65 illuminant gave us the best fit for the experimental data see section 3 3 1 for details color difference must be preliminarily calculated for every twc standard in the same manner as it was stated above for the target sample fig 1 and the linear graduation curve must be obtained by determining the pt co concentration in a solution and the color difference the twc of the environmental sample can be calculated from the graduation curve by determining the color difference Î´e00 between the target sample and the blank twc sample fig 1 the proposed method involves a complex mathematical apparatus making the manual calculation of twc difficult to maintain twc calculation a specialized computer program called watercolour zobkov 2019 was developed using the delphi7 programming language which is freeware and is available at mendeley data https doi org 10 17632 dgdb2gp835 2 see program description in appendix b for details 2 4 environmental and test samples environmental samples were collected from lakes rivers and the drainage waters of a landfill site of petrozavodsk city in 2017 2018 the studied area lies in the northwestern part of the russian federation in the republic of karelia between the coordinates 63 n 31 w and 60 n 36 w it is situated in humid zone thus water bodies have high colored humic substances content and variability ten small lakes four stations on lake onego and five rivers lake onego tributaries were investigated on some water bodies samples were collected in different seasons all studied water bodies differ from each other by organic matter content and composition and watershed area the watershed area varied from 7 9 to 10300 km2 total organic carbon toc concentration varied widely in the environmental samples minimal values were found in small lakes 2 4 17 6 mgc l 1 much higher values in rivers 16 8 35 9 mgc l 1 and maximal values in wastewater 28 5 119 1 mgc l 1 toc concentrations were determined using the uv peroxodisulfate oxidation method employing an original device zobkov and zobkova 2015 test samples were prepared to obtain water solutions of different natural organic matter content with a constant fulvic and humic acids ratio to obtain a concentrate of humic substances they were isolated from a peatland water sample with the deae cellulose technique according to method lozovik and musatova 2013 and humic substances elution was realized with 0 1 n naoh according to method 5510 b apha 1999 to prepare solutions with different humic substances content volumes of concentrate 0 5 1 2 5 10 and 20 ml were diluted to volume 250 ml in a volumetric flask with optical pure distilled water 2 5 sample preparation and instrumentation samples were collected stored and filtered using membrane filters according to iso en 7887 2011 2012 regardless of the method of identification three standard methods of true color determination in agreement with iso en 7887 2011 2012 were applied determination of absorbance at the 410 nm wavelength with a spectrometer the c method spectrometer sf 56 okb spectr russia using an optical instrument the d method using comparator lovibond neslslerizer 2250 and the adopted visual colorimetric titration method for true color determination in nessler cylinders an analogue of the d method all visual measurements in the current work were performed by two independent observers who successfully completed the farnsworth munsell 100 hue test farnsworth 1943 previously it has been demonstrated that inter operator variability has a random nature crowther and evans 1981 therefore two independent observers implementing two different methods were deemed sufficient to represent visual observation techniques while existing spectroscopic methods are numerous and generally differ from each other only in using different wavelengths for twc determination we will represent only two of them as published in state and international standards in this paper however based on our literature survey we assume they represent a wide range of similar methods based on twc determination on a single wavelength spectroscopic twc measurement through the determination of absorbance on the wavelength 410 nm generally followed the iso en 7887 2011 2012 approach with the exception of the graduation procedure which was implemented using ten standard solutions on a progressive scale 0 5 10 30 50 70 100 150 300 500 mgpt l 1 to improve graduation accuracy spectroscopic determination at 440 nm using the cr co standard was followed rd 52 24 497 2005 2005 using ten standard solutions and the same progressive scale 0 5 10 30 50 70 100 150 300 500 mgpt l 1 the visual colorimetric titration method ctm was adopted from semenov 1977 to reproduce the d method iso en 7887 2011 2012 for true color determination in nessler cylinders two 100 ml nessler cylinders 40 cm in length and one 5 ml micro burette were used for this method elaboration the first cylinder was filled up with a sample to the 100 ml mark and fixed in holder the second one was filled up with distilled water to the 95 ml mark and fixed near the first cylinder the water in the second cylinder was titrated with portions of the hazen scale standard 500 mgpt co l 1 using the micro burette afterwards each portion was titrated the second cylinder was lidded and rotated several times to mix the solution the water color in the second cylinder was compared against the same in the first cylinder and the procedure was repeated several times until the colors matched each ml of titrated standard was equal to 5 mgpt co l 1 when implementing visual methods samples with a twc higher than 70 hazen units were diluted with optically pure water the blanks and standards used in the current work were prepared using optically pure water fresh distilled water with mean conductivity 2 Î¼s cm in agreement with iso en 7887 2011 the hazen scale standards were prepared as described in iso en 7887 2011 the standards of the cr co scale were prepared as reference mixture 2 according to rd 52 24 497 2005 gost r 52769 2007 2010 in a following way dilute potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 0 0875 g and cobalt sulfate coso4 7h2o 2 000 g in distilled water in a calibrated 1 l flask adding 1 cm3 of concentrated sulphuric acid density 1 84 g cm3 and make up the volume in the flask with distilled water the reference mixture is valid for three months after preparation and equivalent to 500 10 mgpt co l 1 on the hazen scale 2 6 statistical analysis the standard methods applied for twc determination have their own peculiar drawbacks and none of them can act as a precise reference method thus to represent the agreement between the visual and spectroscopic methods the data obtained with every visual method was plotted against the spectroscopic one using the tukey mean difference m d plot cleveland 1994 also known as the bland altman ba plot bland and altman 2003 where the difference between the two methods is represented relative to their mean while the figures on the plots are numerous we will present only the regression parameters and the correlation coefficients between each pair of methods as well as the parameters of the regression for the difference plot against their mean the key features will be presented in form of plots in most cases the disagreement between the methods altered with twc and had a multiplicative character thus to represent this trend clearly on the plots the difference between the two methods was expressed as the relative difference between the two methods to their mean in the tables the absolute difference the classical m d plot twc expressed in mgpt co l 1 is presented the anova and pearson tests were performed using the sofa statistics software www sofastatistics com 3 results and discussion in total 60 water samples 53 environmental and 7 test were analyzed with different visual and spectroscopic methods test samples produced similar trends with the environmental samples therefore they all were statistically processed as one population regardless of the fact that the test samples were highlighted in the figures 3 1 visual methods in table 1 the parameters of the agreement between each pair of methods are presented regression parameters represent the root square mean deviation between two methods while mean difference parameters regression parameters from m d plot represent how the difference between the two methods varied against their mean using the a coefficient of the regression line we can estimate the bias between values obtained by two different methods or observers thus the a values near the one with a high r2 coefficient represent good agreement between the two methods and replicates and a 1 100 is the rate of disagreement of the first method y against the second x coefficient b represents the additive share of error for the visual methods the standard solution increment is 5 mgpt co l 1 the estimated standard deviation between different laboratories running visual methods hongve and akesson 1996 was also 5 mgpt co l 1 therefore we will take 5 mgpt co l 1 as a boundary value for the additive share of error to evaluate agreement of methods however as discussed above each method has some uncertainties and none of them can act as pure reference the difference between the values observed using the two methods against their mean will be used to represent agreement between methods clearly cleveland 1994 bland and altman 2003 mean difference regression parameters carry core information about the rate of agreement between two methods or replicates the bdiff coefficient represents the additive or constant share of error which does not alter with water color the adiff coefficient demonstrates the multiplicative share of error which does alter with water color when observations from different acquisitions are consistent the adiff coefficient as well as bdiff and r2 diff will tend toward zero demonstrating that the methods produce the same results otherwise they will indicate the rate of disagreement between two acquisitions i e the multiplicative adiff and additive bdiff share of error and the significance of this relation r2 diff the pearson p value represents the statistical significance of the regression in the current paper the statistical significance level was set at 0 01 as can be seen from table 1 the results obtained by different observers are in good agreement with each other m d 5 mgpt co l 1 adiff 0 b 5 mgpt co l 1 r2 diff 0 p 0 01 regardless of the visual determination method this indicates the random share of error introduced by different observers as a result we can arguably calculate the average value obtained by different observers to characterize each method according to table 1 a multiplicative bias was observed between the two visual methods which resulted in twc overestimation with ctm against the comparator the mean difference between the two methods was 8 8 mgpt co l 1 2 56 and twc as estimated by the ctm method was 10 higher than by the comparator the difference is particularly evident for values above 200 mgpt co l 1 fig 2 the values of b and b diff represent a high additive share of error however the error bars on fig 2 demonstrate that this difference is near the acceptable range for method repeatability gost 31868 2012 2014 therefore to make a comparison with spectroscopic methods we will use the average value obtained by both observers employing the two visual methods as the accepted reference value together with the average twc obtained by different observers for each method separately which accounts for 240 independent acquisitions in total 3 2 spectroscopic determination at a single wavelength all spectroscopic methods showed the presence of a multiplicative share of error when compared with visual ones table 2 pearson p value 0 01 the spectroscopic method for twc determination using the cr co standard at the 440 nm wavelength cr440 rd 52 24 497 2005 was found to overestimate the results obtained using the pt co standard with the 410 nm wavelength determination pt410 method c iso en 7887 2011 2012 over 10 table 2 as can be seen from table 2 both spectroscopic methods systematically overestimate twc when compared with the visual ones pearson p value 0 01 r2 diff 0 75 the best fit between the visual and spectroscopic methods was obtained between the pt410 method and ctm where the values received from the first method overestimated the values of the second one by only 21 the worst result was obtained between cr440 and the comparator method where the first one overestimated the second one by almost half 47 for the cr440 method against ctm and the pt410 against the comparator overestimation was 33 and 34 respectively the relative mean difference between the methods was slightly smaller but systematic deviation can be clearly seen table 2 for the mean twc obtained with both visual methods against the spectroscopic ones the results were not much better than for each method separately table 2 figs 3 and 4 note that the figures show the relative difference thus in both cases overestimation had a multiplicative character such difference agrees with the estimation of 20 established by bennett and drikas 1993 for spectroscopic determination at a single wavelength and coincides with the findings of hautala et al 2000 where the difference between the comparator method and spectroscopic determination wavelengths 400 and 465 nm ranged from 10 to 36 watts et al 2001 assessed that the conversion coefficients for ten small catchments in yorkshire varied between 11 05 and 13 01 when converting from au m in hazen units knowing the graduation curve coefficient evaluated from our data 0 0047 400 nm 5 cm cuvette one can estimate the conversion coefficients from spectroscopy to the visual method that vary from underestimation of 3 7 to overestimation of 22 3 on one hand this variation was found to be site specific watts et al 2001 on the other hand it was established for relatively small watersheds from 3 7 to 21 9 km2 in the current work large watersheds and their sub watersheds areas up to 10300 km2 were considered and fluctuations due to the local specifics of micro watersheds should be neglected in conversion coefficient estimation each of the considered studies reported that spectroscopic determination overestimates the results of visual determination which fully coincides with our data therefore knowing the large variation in conversion coefficients as reported in different studies it is obvious that the establishment of a universal conversion coefficient between visual and spectroscopic determination is practically impossible mitchell and mcdonald 1991 due to the large share of error appearing in such conversion taking into account the large share of errors the conversion can be applied only in some specific cases when no other alternatives exist natural water is a combined solution where the proportions and concentration of individual substances vary depending on natural conditions and are mostly unknown however as stated above true color arises mainly from light absorption by fulvic and humic acids the ratio of fulvic to humic acids can vary significantly in different natural waters from 10 1 in low colored surface waters down to 5 1 or less in highly colored surface waters aitkenhead peterson et al 2003 mostofa et al 2012 meanwhile the color value of humic acid is approximately fourfold when compared to that of fulvic acid visser 1984 aside from that the difference in the light absorbance of fulvic and humic acids increase towards the uv zone lawrence 1980 particularly where the spectroscopic determination bands are located and vary with both of them according to beer s law therefore the cross points between the hazen standard and natural water can drift depending on the ratio of fulvic and humic acid content in a sample this introduces undeterminable bias into the color evaluation process which was also previously noted by bennett and drikas 1993 this was also highlighted in work watts et al 2001 where the variation of conversion factors between absorbance at 400 nm and hazen units was explained by the changes in composition and mix of color forming compounds crowther and evans 1981 studied spectra of humic acid lignin sulfonate ferric chloride and natural water in comparison to the pt co standard and concluded that selecting a single wavelength for color measurement would be difficult bennett and drikas 1993 concluded that the single analytical wavelength introduces a negative through to positive error in the determination of low to high colored waters respectively cuthbert and del giorgio 1992 also assumed that color estimates derived by equating the absorption coefficients of water samples with those of standard pt co solutions are incompatible regardless of wavelength applied mitchell and mcdonald 1991 also concluded that it is impossible to calibrate hazen solutions on a spectrometer to determine the conversion factor for placing absorbance units on to the hazen scale these arguments and years of studies indicate that the goal of searching for the best single wavelength for spectroscopic determination of twc in hazen units is unachievable thus it is possible to conclude that the results obtained with standard spectroscopic methods cannot substitute the visual ones and that the precise results of twc estimation in hazen units cannot be directly obtained from existing spectroscopy therefore to retrieve twc in hazen scale units from spectral data a method involving the mathematical model of standard observer perception was developed 3 3 proposed method 3 3 1 method parameters different light sources and reference white points of d50 d55 and d65 illuminants were tested in order to determine the best fit between the proposed method and the visual methods the comparator ctm and mean visual twc obtained with both of them were compared to the proposed method with different combinations of the light sources and reference white points regression parameters a and r2 as well as mean difference and m d regression parameters adiff r2 diff were assumed to be major arbitrary values tables c 1 c 6 the proposed method was found to be sensitive to the combination of the reference white point and light source involved as can be seen from the arbitrary values analysis tables c 1 c 6 the agreement between the proposed method and the visual methods generally increased together with the reference white point illuminant number correlated illuminant energy and conversely agreement decreased with the increasing light source illuminant number the different color scales pt co and cr co produced similar trends consequently the best fit between the proposed method and the visual methods was obtained for the d50 illuminant light source and the d65 illuminant reference white point these attributes were applied further when addressing the proposed method which is also denoted as the d50d65 standard observer method setup the mean relative difference between the mean twc measured by the visual methods and the proposed method was 7 5 for the pt co scale and 5 3 for the cr co scale however for twc values below 20 mgpt co l 1 the relative difference was much higher than 20 and reached up to 130 for the cr co scale and 86 for the pt co scale which was unacceptable to solve the problem the dedicated graduation curve with a range from 0 to 50 mgpt co l 1 was applied for this purpose the previously established values 0 5 10 30 50 mgpt co l 1 were used elaboration of this graduation curve reduced the mean difference down to 0 9 mgpt co l 1 or 7 5 for the pt co scale and 1 6 mgpt co l 1 or 19 5 for cr co in the problematic range from 0 to 20 mgpt co l 1 in further analysis two graduation curves figs 5 6 were applied to calculate twc values in corresponding diapason 3 3 2 agreement with the visual methods both the pt co and cr co scales showed good agreement with the mean twc obtained by the two visual methods average of two observers and two methods however the pt co scale showed better agreement with the comparator method and the cr co with ctm table 3 a multiplicative share of error based on pearson p value was detected only in two cases table 3 however the relative m d and adiff coefficients were very small not exceeding 3 5 and 0 08 respectively which is acceptable thus both scales can be applied for method implementation however the pt co scale gives lower dispersion for small twc values and is applied widely further we will use it as the standard scale for method implementation and evaluation due to its precision and accuracy the mean difference between twc measured by the visual methods and the proposed method using two graduation pt co scale curves was 3 2 mgpt co l 1 sd 11 5 mgpt co l 1 or 2 36 sd 8 8 fig 7 table 3 which is almost one order of magnitude lower than for the standard pt410 method and represents good method fit as can be seen from fig 7 the relative difference for the pt co scale between the visual methods and the proposed method is constant within the whole measuring range from 3 to 500 mgpt co l 1 the relative difference between the methods showed no correlation with their mean adiff 0 0014 r2 0 0003 and the offset was only 2 6 fig 7 which represents a good agreement of the proposed method with the visual method this result demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method when compared with standard spectroscopic methods table 2 figs 3 4 where overestimation of 22 8 and 35 for the pt410 and cr440 methods respectively against the visual methods was obtained therefore in the aspect of agreement with the visual methods the proposed d50d65 method has higher accuracy than existing spectroscopy 3 3 3 method analytical performance the detection limit for the proposed method was estimated with 50 blank samples the mean de2000 signal was 0 0087 with a standard deviation of 0 007 thus the detection limit of the method estimated by the 3Î´ criterion using the 0 50 mgpt co l 1 graduation curve was 3 3 mgpt co l 1 to implement the method two graduation curves must be applied for twc calculation in different measuring ranges the graduation curve 0 50 mgpt co l 1 fig 5 must be applied for twc calculation in range 3 20 mgpt co l 1 and the curve 3 500 mgpt co l 1 fig 6 in range 20 500 mgpt co l 1 the regression coefficients for both curves are higher than 0 999 and the intercepts are lower than detection limit 0 5 and 2 2 mgpt co l 1 correspondingly for the 0 50 and 0 500 graduation curves demonstrating the stability of the measuring signal the precision of the proposed method was estimated by the repeatability of detection results obtained during subsequent measurements of seven environmental samples with mean twcs of 6 10 23 43 94 172 and 381 mgpt co l 1 fifteen replicates were measured for each sample forming 105 acquisitions in total the twc deviation for each replicate from sample mean was not statistically significant between all concentrations anova test p 1 00 0 01 df 98 thus the method precision was constant and independent from twc within all measuring ranges the calculated pooled standard deviation in the measuring range from 6 to 381 mgpt co l 1 for the proposed method was 0 3 mgpt co l 1 with df 98 if comparing the precision of the proposed method with the other standard methods fig 8 the method superiority can be clearly seen in repeatability conditions it demonstrates a standard deviation of at least three times lower than the existing spectroscopy pt410 method according to iso en 7887 2011 2012 six times lower than spectroscopic method in rd 52 24 497 2005 and from four times to two orders of magnitude lower than stated in gost 31868 2012 2014 the precision of the proposed method can be also seen if comparing sd with published data of interlaboratory comparisons of the traditional spectroscopy method hongve and akesson 1996 where sd for different samples varied between 1 6 and 3 5 mgpt co l 1 even when additional quality assurance criterion involving commercially available humic acid was applied the proposed method does not require a preliminary dilution step for samples with twc below 500 mgpt co l 1 this makes it more stable when compared with the standard methods where dilution can change physical chemical conditions in sample leading to twc alteration sample preparation technique was the same as described in the standard methods iso en 7887 2011 2012 therefore it has the same interferences as the standard methods do interferences can mainly occur during the filtration step resulting in the presence of colloidal solids which cannot be removed during filtration iron and manganese compounds can be retained on the filter or transferred to a solute state during oxidation iso en 7887 2011 2012 water ph can also affect water color therefore the ph must be regularly determined in parallel with twc measurements and reported with other results iso en 7887 2011 2012 4 conclusion it was demonstrated that standard spectroscopic methods systematically overestimate visual methods from 21 to 47 depending on the methods involved through a review of previous studies related to the problem of true water color determination it was revealed that because of the unpredictable and multicomponent compound nature of natural water it is impossible to establish some universal and reliable conversion coefficient for color recalculation from absorbance to hazen units as well as to establish a single universal wavelength for precise color determination with existing spectroscopy to retrieve the relevant true water color from spectral data a new spectroscopic method was developed the method showed good agreement with both the comparator method and determination in nessler cylinders two variations of the d method according to iso en 7887 2011 2012 and their mean the mean relative difference between the proposed method and the comparator method was 3 determination in nessler cylinders 8 and mean twc for the two visual methods only 2 which demonstrates high agreement between the proposed method and the standard visual methods the method has a broad measurement range from 3 to 500 mgpt co l 1 which makes it unnecessary to dilute the samples as previously required in some standard methods making the analysis process more accurate and faster the method precision was found to be independent from twc in all measurement ranges with sd 0 3 mgpt co l 1 df 98 which is at least three times lower than stated for standard spectroscopic methods showing higher accuracy and precision as a result the proposed method can be applied for twc determination in environmental samples from 3 3 to 500 mgpt co l 1 with sd 0 3 mgpt

17964,recreational water quality guidelines protect the public from health risks associated with water recreation by helping to prevent unacceptable concentrations of pathogenic organisms in ambient water however illness risk is associated with both the concentration of pathogens in the water and the degree of contact with those pathogens different recreational activities can result in different levels of contact with ambient water containing water borne pathogens we conducted a systematic literature review and meta analysis to evaluate risks of illness associated with different recreational activities and different levels of contact to ambient surface waters we screened 8 618 potentially relevant studies for quantitative measures of risk using inclusion exclusion criteria established in advance we categorized recreational activities as swimming sports related contact minimal contact and sand contact we combined relative risks using a random effects meta analysis for adverse health outcome categories representing gastrointestinal illness respiratory illness skin eye ear nose throat and cold flu illness we identified 92 studies meeting our inclusion criteria pooled risk estimates indicate significant elevation of gastrointestinal illness with the recreational activity categories swimming 2 19 95 ci 1 82 2 63 and sports related contact 2 69 95 ci 1 04 6 92 and nonsignificant elevation of gastrointestinal illness with minimal contact 1 27 95 ci 0 74 2 16 we also found a significant elevation of respiratory illness with swimming 1 78 95 ci 1 38 2 29 and sports related contact 1 49 95 ci 1 00 2 24 and no elevation of respiratory illness with minimal contact 0 90 95 ci 0 71 1 14 this study suggests that exposures associated with different types of recreational activities are important characteristics of the exposure pathway when assessing illness risk associated with recreation in ambient surface waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords primary secondary contact illness guidelines standards 1 introduction fecal contamination of ambient surface waters is a public health concern usepa 2012 who 2003 epidemiological studies have reported an increased risk of illness associated with exposure to fecally contaminated recreational water arnold et al 2013 2016 colford et al 2007 fleisher et al 2010 lamparelli et al 2015 wade et al 2003 2006 2008 2010 yau et al 2014 swimming paddling boating and fishing account for more than 90 million cases of gastrointestinal respiratory ear eye and skin related illnesses per year in the united states with an estimated annual cost of 2 9 billion deflorio barker et al 2018 to protect the public from illnesses associated with recreational water exposures national water quality guidelines have been developed by assessing relationships between the concentration of indicators of fecal contamination serving as an indirect measurement of fecal pathogens and rates of illness a level of indicator corresponding to an illness rate is then chosen australian government national health and medical research council 2008 brazil national standards 2005 health canada 2012 new zealand ministry for the environment 2002 republic of south africa department of environmental affairs 2012 usepa 2012 who 2003 recreational water quality guidelines provide the allowable concentration of specific pathogen indicators in surface waters used for different recreational activities by the public however the degree of illness risk is related to both the concentration of pathogens in the water and the degree of contact with those pathogens see usepa 2014 for a review of dose response relationships for pathogens thus individuals engaging in activities with a greater degree of contact to ambient recreational water potentially have a higher risk of illness compared to individuals engaging in activities with a lower degree of contact wade et al 2003 2006 2008 2010 most water quality guidelines were established to protect the public during recreational activities described as swimming or bathing with a high degree of water contact some water quality guidelines have also been established in the united states table 1 and internationally brazil national standards 2005 health canada 2012 to protect activities presumed to be associated with a lower degree of water contact however there is a lack of consistency in the way recreational activities and presumed levels of water contact are defined or grouped table 2 for example some guidelines refer to recreational activities with a high degree of water contact as primary contact whole body contact total body contact immersion contact or simply contact recreation other guidelines refer to recreational activities with a lower degree of water contact as secondary contact limited water contact limited body contact partial body contact incidental contact or limited contact recreation some guidelines consider a third category of recreational activities with the lowest potential contact with water they define as no contact not contact or non contact recreation different recreational activity categories may be associated with different water quality values some water quality guidelines assign less stringent water quality values for activity categories with lower potential for water contact on the basis of the presumption that less contact with pathogens in water compensates for a higher concentration of those pathogens in water resulting in the same overall risk of illness recreational activities with less water contact may still carry risk due to inadvertent contact with water poor hygiene following water contact and hand to mouth or hand to eye contact dorevitch et al 2015 however there is limited evidence about the magnitude of health risks associated with recreational activities commonly identified as resulting in less water contact compared to recreational activities commonly identified as resulting in greater water contact dorevitch et al 2012b fewtrell et al 1992 lee et al 1997 previous systematic reviews and meta analyses focused on the risk of illness associated with swimming leonard et al 2018 mannocci et al 2016 wade et al 2003 yau et al 2009 however these studies did not address differences in the risk of illness between different types of recreational activities the purpose of this systematic review and meta analysis is to evaluate the current scientific evidence for differences in risk of illness between recreational activities typically associated with different levels of contact with water the objectives of this study are to 1 assess and summarize the scientific literature on the risk of illness associated with different types of recreational activities and different levels of water contact during recreation 2 quantitatively estimate the pooled risk of illness associated with different categories of recreational activities and levels of water contact and 3 evaluate risk of illness across activity and water contact categories to better understand illness risk associated with different types of recreation in ambient surface waters 2 material and methods 2 1 protocol the protocol for this systematic review and meta analysis was developed with input from a panel of external peer reviewers the protocol is available upon request from the corresponding author and conforms to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma liberati et al 2009 the protocol specified the literature search strategy for identification of relevant studies and management of retrieved studies reference databases searched search terms procedures for hand searches procedures for assessing gray literature information requests inclusion criteria methodology for risk of bias assessment and general methods of synthesis analysis and interpretation of results the hazard of concern in our study was exposure to ambient surface waters during recreation although sand activities typically do not involve direct contact with water we included sand contact as a potential exposure route because sand contact often occurs in conjunction with water recreation especially among children arnold et al 2016 deflorio barker et al 2018 heaney et al 2012 heaney et al 2009 solo gabriele et al 2016 2 2 literature search we searched pubmed web of science and toxline for peer reviewed articles in any language we limited articles to those published during or after 1950 to match wade et al 2003 studies of interest were those related to exposure to ambient surface water during recreational activities and any health outcomes of interest see supplementary material table s1 for all search terms and the boolean operations we applied to them after the first phase of study selection identifying potentially relevant studies described below we reviewed the content and reference lists of potentially relevant studies for additional relevant literature we also manually searched for articles by examining the reference lists of review articles addressing health effects associated with recreational activities however we did not use results presented in any review articles unless they were derived from data that were not previously published we stored all citations with available abstracts in an electronic database 2 3 study selection our study selection procedure had two phases during the first phase we identified potentially relevant studies returned from our literature searches for studies related to the occurrence of any illness following exposure to ambient surface waters during any type of recreational activity we selected potentially relevant studies based on their titles and abstracts and then confirmed those selections by obtaining and reviewing their full text we included gray literature only if publicly available and if they contained enough supporting methodological information that could allow a peer review as if they were manuscripts being considered for publication by a scientific journal during the second phase of study selection we selected those studies identified in the first phase of study selection that met all the following criteria 2 3 1 study participants study participants were human subjects engaging in activities involving exposure to ambient surface waters 2 3 2 health outcomes at least one health outcome was evaluated health outcomes included but were not limited to vomiting diarrhea stomachache nausea fever loose stool sore throat cough runny nose rash itchy skin eye ailments earache i e ear pain ear infection or runny ears symptoms of infection and non symptomatic health outcomes such as antibody responses to infection with waterborne pathogens 2 3 3 water exposures related to ambient surface water exposure we included studies involving exposure to marine i e ocean or fresh waters i e lakes rivers ponds and excluded studies involving exposure to chlorinated waters e g swimming pools hot tubs and splash parks 2 3 4 study designs study designs were observational epidemiologic studies e g cohort case control cross sectional ecological survey and time series designs or randomized trials 2 3 5 data availability studies reported crude or adjusted effect estimates derived from data not previously published or included enough unpublished data to allow calculation of crude relative risk if a study reported both crude and adjusted effect estimates we used only the adjusted estimates 2 4 data extraction we extracted study design methodology and results from studies meeting our inclusion criteria the data we extracted included water type marine or fresh water quality analytical methods quantitative values and qualitative descriptions time over which water quality measurements represented exposure i e same day at the time of swimming or over the entire study period study population study size study design geographic location health outcome s measured covariate s measured water exposure activity description s reported measures of risk and data we could use to calculate crude relative risk data was extracted by two team members one to identify and enter the data into a database and the other to verify accuracy a third team member supervised data extraction and resolved disagreements 2 5 study quality we evaluated study quality using a checklist of 13 questions that assess risk of bias in 7 domains supplementary material table s2 we formulated the list of questions from the national toxicology program office of health assessment and translation risk of bias tool ohat 2015 agency for healthcare research and quality viswanathan et al 2012 cochrane handbook higgins et al 2011 and the clarity group at mcmaster university 2013 two team members independently rated each study on each of the 13 questions using a four point scale definitely low risk probably low risk probably high risk and definitely high risk we compiled and compared all ratings from the two team members and any disagreements between the two team members were resolved by a third senior team member we developed a classification system to determine whether each study has either a low risk of bias or high risk of bias by focusing on 6 of the 13 risk of bias questions that reflect exposure or outcome misclassification biased methods and lack of adequate adjustment for potential confounders they are 1 is the comparison i e control or reference group appropriate 2 does the study design or analysis account for important confounding and modifying variables 3 do researchers adjust or control for other exposures that are anticipated to bias results 4 are we confident in the exposure characterization 5 are we confident in the outcome assessment 6 are there any other potential threats to internal validity e g inappropriate statistical methods we excluded from the meta analysis any study rated as definitely high risk of bias for any of the above 6 questions we included studies in the meta analysis but classified them as having a high risk of bias if they fulfilled any of the following criteria a a rating of probably high risk of bias for all questions 1 2 3 4 and 5 b a rating of probably high risk of bias for any 2 of questions 1 2 3 with a rating of probably high risk of bias for question 6 c a rating of probably high risk of bias for questions 3 5 and 6 d a rating of probably high risk of bias for question 3 with a rating of probably high risk of bias for at least one of questions 1 2 3 and 6 e a rating of probably high risk of bias for question 4 with a rating of probably high risk of bias for any 2 of questions 1 2 3 5 or 6 we classified studies as having a low risk of bias if they did not fulfill any of the above high risk of bias criteria 2 6 meta analysis descriptions of recreational activities study participants health outcomes water quality age groups and types of water contact substantially varied among the studies meeting our inclusion criteria to perform meta analyses we categorized each extracted effect estimate based on recreational activity degree of water contact health outcome water quality study subject age and water type table 3 shows the study specific descriptions and how we categorized them 2 6 1 recreational activities we designed a system for categorizing recreational activities by first evaluating how currently available recreational water quality guidelines defined them we compiled terms and phrases used to define recreational activities by international health organizations national governments and by individual states and territories in the united states most guidelines that distinguish between different categories of recreational activities define two categories on the basis of the probability of contact with ambient water thus we specified in our protocol a strategy to categorize recreational activities into two categories and perform a meta analysis to compare the risk of illness associated with those two categories when considering the descriptions of recreational activities extracted from the studies meeting our inclusion criteria however we found a wide range of recreational activities that we believe were not adequately represented by only two categories instead we grouped recreational activities into 5 specific categories table 3 we categorized activities as swimming if they involved the immersion of any part of the body in water that did not involve the use of specialized sport equipment we categorized activities as sports related contact if they involved immersion or a high probability of immersion or splashing of water on any part of the body while using specialized sport equipment e g surfing water skiing or canoeing kayaking or rafting in rough water we categorized activities as minimal contact if they involved floating on or being near ambient water except for sand contact with a low probability of immersion or splashing of water on any part of the body e g fishing or canoeing kayaking or rafting in tranquil waters we categorized activities as sand contact if the activity only involved contact with sand although we considered combining sand contact and minimal contact activities together we decided to keep them as separate categories because the activities in each of those categories generally involve different types of beachgoers children versus adults and different media sand versus water finally we categorized activities as mixed contact if a study combined participants engaging in activities from more than one of the above activity categories because the primary goal of this systematic review and meta analysis is to evaluate the risk of illness associated with different recreational activity categories representing different levels of water contact we did not analyze effect estimates in the category mixed contact 2 6 2 levels of water contact a subset of studies meeting our inclusion criteria provided estimates of illness risk associated with one or more levels of water contact independent of the recreational activity underlying the contact to analyze water contact related estimates of risk we independently designated a water contact category to every effect estimate including effect estimates associated with a specific recreational activity table 3 we categorized water contact as body immersion head immersion face splashing or swallowing water if a study specifically described those categories of water contact in addition we categorized water contact as unspecified direct contact if a study did not specify a category of water contact but did specify a recreational activity we categorized as either swimming or sports related contact or described water contact consisting of more than one of the specific water contact categories body immersion head immersion face splashing or swallowing water we categorized water contact as unspecified indirect contact if a study did not specify a water contact category but did specify a recreational activity we categorized as minimal contact for analytical purposes we combined all data from specific water contact categories body immersion head immersion face splashing or swallowing water together with data from the category unspecified direct contact into the general water contact category all direct contact we also defined the general water contact category all indirect contact to compare with the general water contact category all direct contact even though the category all indirect contact represents the same set of data as the category unspecified indirect contact because no studies defined a specific water contact level we considered indirect water contact finally we categorized exposure as sand contact if a study reported the effect estimate as related to contact with sand 2 6 3 health outcomes we selected gastrointestinal illness gi and respiratory illness ri as the health outcomes of primary interest before performing our literature search the studies meeting our inclusion criteria contained a total of 143 health outcome descriptors we categorized the gi and ri health outcome descriptors as either general gi highly credible gastrointestinal illness hcgi diarrhea general ri significant respiratory disease srd or cough health outcomes of secondary interest were skin symptoms skin ear symptoms ear combined ear nose and throat symptoms ent eye symptoms eye cold or flu symptoms cold flu other symptoms other and unspecified symptoms any we used the category hcgi because it is a specific category of gi used by several studies to represent a combination of unmistakably recognized individual symptoms of gastrointestinal illness cabelli 1983 hcgi includes the presence of a specific set of symptoms such as vomiting diarrhea with a fever or disabling condition or stomachache or nausea accompanied by a fever the category diarrhea refers to gi specifically described as diarrhea or a set of symptoms where diarrhea is a distinguishing characteristic the category general gi refers to any one or collection of gi symptoms studies did not specifically categorize as hcgi or diarrhea we used the category srd because it is a category of ri used by several studies to clearly identify the occurrences of consequential ri events the category srd includes a specific set of clearly identifiable ri symptoms although there were small variations in the precise definition of srd among studies the category cough refers to a health outcome that studies simply described as a cough the category general ri includes any one or collection of ri symptoms studies did not specifically categorize as srd or cough 2 6 4 water quality because previous studies have shown an association between water quality and rate of illness water quality could be an effect modifier when evaluating risk of illness associated with different recreational activities to evaluate the effects of water quality we extracted water quality data and information from studies meeting our inclusion criteria we categorized water quality as good intermediate or poor based on quantitative measures of fecal indicator bacteria reported in the studies if a study reported multiple risk estimates each linked to a different density of fecal indicator bacteria we categorized risk estimates linked to the lowest density of indicator bacteria as good water quality the highest density of indicator as poor water quality and densities between good and poor as intermediate water quality many studies did not report quantitative measures of water quality but did provide narrative descriptions we used to categorize water quality as good or poor for example we categorized water quality as good if a study described water quality as low pathogen concentration least polluted or lower pollution and we categorized water quality as poor if a study described water quality as high pathogen concentration most polluted or higher pollution see table 3 we also categorized water quality as good or poor based on physical or climatological conditions studies associated with good or poor water quality for example we categorized water quality as good if the study claimed good water quality due to the presence of a sand berm preventing contaminated water from reaching the study area and we categorized water quality as poor if the study claimed poor water quality due to the absence of a sand berm preventing contaminated water from reaching the study area we categorized water quality as any if the study did not provide water quality information or did not relate effect estimates to water quality 2 6 5 age because children may be at a higher risk of illness when recreating in contaminated waters compared to adults arnold et al 2016 heaney et al 2009 2012 wade et al 2013 we evaluated age as an effect modifier on the risk of illness associated with different recreational activities we generally attempted to categorize subjects below 18 20 years of age as children and subjects above 18 20 years of age as adults when studies provided numerical age information we accepted study specific categorizations of children or adults if the study did not provide numerical age information but nonetheless described subjects as children or adults we categorized the age of the study subjects as any if the study did not report any age information or reported age information but did not relate effect estimates with specific age categories we assumed all subjects from studies of athletes from competitive sporting events e g triathlons were adults 2 7 statistical analysis we quantitatively evaluated the risk of illness associated with different categories of recreational activities and water contact by combining the results of multiple studies using meta analysis egger et al 2008 littell et al 2008 we considered odds ratios to be reasonable estimates of relative risk because the probability of infection due to water based recreational activities is generally low we calculated a crude relative risk and 95 confidence interval ci when a study did not report effect estimates but reported sufficient data to calculate one when analyses contained 5 or more studies we used robust variance estimation meta regression tanner smith and tipton 2014 tipton 2015 to allow the utilization of all effect estimates in a single study that fulfill the criteria of the category being evaluated we assumed a within study correlation of 0 8 tanner smith and tipton 2014 because our sensitivity analysis using within study correlations of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 resulted in point estimates and confidence interval limits that varied by less than 0 001 when analyses contained fewer than 5 studies we used the dersimonian and laird random effects approach dersimonian and laird 1986 to first estimate study specific pooled effects and then the overall pooled effect we used excel and stata for data management and the metan metareg and robumeta packages in stata version 14 0 statacorp 2015 for all meta analyses we considered pooled risk estimates significant if their 95 confidence intervals did not overlap 1 and we considered pooled risk estimates significantly different from each other if their 95 confidence intervals did not overlap each other we evaluated heterogeneity by using forest plots and the cochran q test for heterogeneity in conjunction with the i2 index to quantify the degree of variation when heterogeneity was high i2 index 80 we conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the potential sources of heterogeneity including study quality study design activity category water contact category and water type we evaluated impacts of water quality on pooled risk estimates by performing meta regression analyses that include water quality as a covariate and by calculating water quality specific pooled estimates we analyzed publication bias by creating funnel plots of pooled risk estimates from each individual study versus the log standard error of those estimates and inspecting for asymmetry because robust variance estimation meta regression does not report pooled effect estimates for each individual study we used standard meta regression to calculate the pooled risk for each study in the funnel plot we assessed asymmetry in the funnel plot using eggers test egger et al 2008 we considered the results to indicate publication bias if p 0 10 for the bias coefficient in egger s test we conducted sensitivity trim and fill analyses duval and tweedie 2000a b to estimate the number of missing studies in a meta analysis affected by publication bias and the effect of those studies on the effect estimate before performing our analysis we declared any meta analysis result derived from fewer than three studies as inconclusive 3 results 3 1 literature search summary fig 1 illustrates the study selection process our systematic literature search returned 8 618 articles during the first phase of study selection we identified 968 studies as potentially relevant based on their titles and abstracts we identified 629 of those studies as potentially relevant after evaluating their full text during the second phase of study selection we identified 112 of 629 studies as meeting our inclusion criteria of those 112 studies we excluded three studies ferrer et al 2012 kundu et al 2013 rijal et al 2011 because they were quantitative microbial risk assessments and did not provide evidence of quantitative associations between recreational activities and health outcomes we excluded an additional 15 studies amin et al 2017 appleton and bailey 1990 cabelli et al 1982 deflorio barker et al 2018 eze et al 2014 fewtrell and delahunty 1985 fleming et al 2004 kueh et al 1995 lepesteur et al 2006 papastergiou et al 2011 philipp et al 1989 seyfried et al 1985b stevenson 1953 turbow et al 2008 veleizan et al 2016 because they did not report quantitative results or sufficient data to calculate crude relative risk we also excluded one study von schirnding et al 1992 because it contained pilot data published in a follow up paper von schirnding et al 1993 we considered the results of two publications cabelli 1983 cabelli et al 1983 as one study because they each reported a subset of results from a single study the remaining 92 studies are the subject of this systematic review and meta analysis 3 2 study characteristics fig 2 summarizes the key characteristics of the 92 studies meeting our inclusion criteria a complete list of the studies and their characteristics is provided in table 4 most 81 92 studies evaluated at least one of several symptoms related to gi that met our category definition of general gi because 11 studies independently evaluated the rates of illness associated with a more narrowly defined set of gi symptoms termed highly credible gastrointestinal illness hcgi or hcgi 2 and 18 studies independently evaluated risk of diarrhea we analyzed those health outcomes as both separate categories hcgi and diarrhea and together combined with general gi into the single category all gi outcomes combined a minority 18 92 of studies evaluated at least one of several symptoms related to ri that met our category definition of general ri because 9 studies independently evaluated the rates of illness associated with the more narrowly defined set of ri symptoms srd and 4 studies independently evaluated risk of cough we analyzed those health outcomes as both separate categories srd and cough and together combined with general ri into the single category all ri outcomes combined the majority 66 92 of studies meeting our inclusion criteria reported at least one risk estimate in the recreational activity category swimming most 55 66 of those studies reported risk estimates only for swimming substantially fewer studies reported risk estimates for sports related contact 13 92 minimal contact 10 92 and sand contact 6 92 the specific water contact category that studies meeting our inclusion criteria most often explicitly defined was head immersion 31 92 fewer studies reported risk estimates for body immersion 15 92 swallowing water 13 92 and face splashing 1 92 many 44 92 studies meeting our inclusion criteria reported at least one risk estimate in the water contact category unspecified direct contact and fewer 10 92 studies reported at least one risk estimate in the water contact category unspecified indirect contact about one quarter 21 92 of studies meeting our inclusion criteria provided illness risk estimates for more than one water contact category of the 92 studies included in our meta analysis we assessed study quality as low risk of bias for 85 studies and high risk of bias for 7 studies risk of bias assessments for each study are provided in supplementary material table s3 3 3 recreational activities 3 3 1 gastrointestinal illness gi fig 3 shows the pooled risk of gi for each activity category using no contact as the reference group we observe a consistent elevation in risks of gi for all activity categories our literature search retrieved the greatest amount of data for gi health outcomes we categorized as general gi we found a significant elevation in risk of general gi associated with sports related contact 2 70 95 ci 1 08 6 78 and swimming 2 20 95 ci 1 82 2 65 and a nonsignificant elevation in risk of general gi associated with sand contact 1 41 95 ci 0 94 2 11 and minimal contact 1 19 95 ci 0 62 2 31 although our literature search retrieved substantially fewer studies evaluating health outcomes we categorized as hcgi or diarrhea our meta analysis of the available data suggests a pattern of elevation in risk for these health outcome categories consistent with the pattern we found for general gi we found a significant elevation in risk of hcgi associated with swimming 1 58 95 ci 1 08 2 31 and a nonsignificant elevation in risk associated with minimal contact 1 38 95 ci 0 87 2 21 we also found a significant elevation in risk of diarrhea associated with sports related contact 6 70 95 ci 1 09 41 25 swimming 2 03 95 ci 1 40 2 95 and sand contact 1 39 95 ci 1 03 1 86 no studies provided risk estimates for hcgi associated with the activity categories sports related contact or sand contact or for diarrhea associated with the activity category minimal contact as specified in our protocol we deemed the pooled risk estimates for hcgi associated with the category minimal contact and the pooled risk estimates for diarrhea associated with the activity categories sports related contact and sand contact as inconclusive because they were derived from fewer than 3 studies because of the relatively few estimates of illness risk for hcgi and diarrhea we combined data from all 3 gi related health outcome categories for each activity category separately and calculated the pooled risk for the health outcome category all gi outcomes combined as expected the pattern of pooled risk estimates for the category all gi outcomes combined generally follows the pattern of pooled risk estimates for the health outcome category general gi that contributed most of the data we found a significant elevation in risk for all gi outcomes combined associated with sports related contact 2 69 95 ci 1 04 6 92 and swimming 2 19 95 ci 1 82 2 63 and a nonsignificant elevation in risk associated with sand contact 1 42 95 ci 0 97 2 07 and minimal contact 1 27 95 ci 0 74 2 16 we observed high heterogeneity in pooled risk estimates for general gi and all gi outcomes combined associated with the activity category swimming i2 74 and 76 respectively to evaluate potential sources of heterogeneity we performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of study design study quality and water type we evaluated the effect of water quality separately because many studies did not report water quality fig 4 shows the pooled risk estimate for all gi outcomes combined for the activity category swimming using all data top row followed by pooled risk estimates of subgroups selected by study design study quality and water type comparison of pooled risk estimates by study design and water type suggests these variables likely contribute to the heterogeneity enumerated by the i2 values evaluation of heterogeneity due to study quality is inconclusive because we assessed all the studies contributing data except for one that contributed to the analysis of all gi outcomes combined in the activity category swimming as low risk of bias we evaluated publication bias by calculating pooled risk estimates for all gi outcomes combined in each activity category and the standard error of those estimates for each individual study we used meta regression to derive a study specific effect estimate and standard error if a study provided multiple effect estimates for an activity category fig 5 shows the risk of gi obtained from each study plotted against the standard error of those estimates although scatter in the funnel plot for the category swimming appears asymmetrical egger s test fails to reject the null hypothesis of a symmetrical distribution p 0 84 funnel plots for the categories minimal contact and sand contact do not appear asymmetric and egger s test fails to reject the null hypothesis of symmetrical distributions p 0 25 and 0 59 respectively scatter in the funnel plot for sports related contact appears asymmetrical with fewer than expected smaller studies showing smaller risks egger s test rejects the null hypothesis of symmetrical distributions p 0 03 suggesting publication bias trim and fill analysis suggests adding three studies may prevent small study publication bias resulting in a pooled risk estimate for sports related contact of 1 52 95 ci 0 84 2 83 3 3 2 respiratory illness ri fig 6 shows the pooled risk estimates of ri for different categories of recreational activities using no contact as the reference we found fewer studies reporting risk estimates for ri 16 studies compared to gi 43 studies we found a significant elevation in risk of general ri associated with swimming 1 99 95 ci 1 53 2 58 and sports related contact 1 49 95 ci 1 00 2 24 we found a nonsignificant increase in risk of general ri associated with minimal contact 1 33 95 ci 0 59 3 03 although we deemed this result inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies we found a nonsignificant elevation in risk of srd 1 40 95 ci 0 82 2 39 and cough 1 15 95 ci 0 78 1 71 for the activity category swimming we found no elevation in risk of srd for the activity category minimal contact 0 87 95 ci 0 69 1 09 and a small nonsignificant elevation in risk of srd for the activity category sand contact 1 01 95 ci 0 93 1 09 however we deemed these results inconclusive because they were derived from fewer than 3 studies like the outcome category general ri we observed a significant elevation in risk of all ri outcomes combined associated with swimming 1 78 95 ci 1 38 2 29 and sports related contact 1 49 95 ci 1 00 2 24 we found no elevation in risk associated with minimal contact 0 90 95 ci 0 71 1 14 and a small nonsignificant elevation in risk associated with sand contact 1 01 95 ci 0 93 1 09 we found high heterogeneity among risk estimates for general ri and all ri outcomes combined in the activity category sports related contact i2 80 for both health outcome categories because they comprise the same set of data and for cough in the activity category swimming i2 84 however we could not perform a sensitivity analysis because of the small number of illness risk estimates in subgroups corresponding to study design study quality and water type analysis of publication bias suggests a tendency toward publication of positive results for ri fig 7 shows the funnel plots for the overall risk of ri reported in each study for swimming and sports related contact we do not show funnel plots for minimal contact and sand contact because there were fewer than 3 studies providing illness risk estimates for those activity categories the funnel plot for sports related contact does not appear asymmetric and egger s test fails to reject the null hypothesis of symmetrical distributions p 0 399 scatter in the funnel plot for swimming appears asymmetrical with fewer than expected smaller studies showing smaller risks egger s test suggests publication bias p 0 002 and a trim and fill analysis suggests adding three additional studies can prevent small study publication bias resulting in a pooled risk estimate for swimming of 1 51 95 ci 1 24 1 83 3 4 effect of water quality we evaluated the effect of water quality on risk of gi and ri associated with different recreational activities by estimating pooled risk estimates from subsets of illness risk estimates we categorized as related to either good or poor water quality there were relatively few studies contributing to this analysis because only 15 of 92 of the studies meeting our inclusion criteria provided information about water quality as a result we focused our analysis on two health outcome categories all gi outcomes combined and all ri outcomes combined which represent the health outcome data sets with the greatest amount of data fig 8 shows the pooled risk estimates for each activity category stratified by good and poor water quality we found a significant elevation in risk of gi associated with the activity category swimming for the subgroup poor water quality 2 00 95 ci 1 59 2 51 and a smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk of gi associated with swimming for the subgroup good water quality 1 49 95 ci 0 91 2 46 we also found a significant elevation in risk of gi associated with the activity category sports related contact 3 72 95 ci 1 31 10 60 and a smaller but significant elevation in risk of gi associated with sports related contact in the subgroup good water quality 1 29 95 ci 1 04 1 59 although we deemed the pooled risk estimate of gi associated with sports related contact in the subgroup good water quality as inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies we found a nonsignificant elevation in risk of ri associated with the activity category swimming for the subgroup poor water quality 2 03 95 ci 0 97 4 45 and a smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk associated with the activity category swimming for the subgroup good water quality 1 41 95 ci 0 92 2 16 we found a significant elevation in risk of ri associated with the activity category sports related contact for the subgroup poor water quality 1 65 95 ci 1 10 2 47 and a smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk of ri associated with the activity category sports related contact for the subgroup good water quality 1 24 95 ci 0 82 1 89 although we deemed the smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk of ri associated with the activity category sports related contact for the subgroup good water quality as inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies 3 5 level of water contact we analyzed the relationship between illness risk and level of water contact by calculating the pooled risk of gi and ri for different degrees of water contact regardless of the type of recreational activity underlying the water contact because a limited number of studies reported illness risk estimates related to water contact level we focused on pooled risk estimates for gi by combining all gi health outcomes and pooled risk estimates for ri by combining all ri health outcomes fig 9 shows water contact related pooled risk estimates using no contact as the reference group for all gi outcomes combined top and all ri outcomes combined bottom the figure presents pooled risk estimates for categories of water contact that studies explicitly described swallowing water head immersion body immersion face splashing sand contact and for categories of water contact that studies did not explicitly define but we could infer from information provided in each study unspecified direct contact and unspecified indirect contact see 2 materials and methods we found elevation in risk of gi for all water contact categories with the magnitude of gi risk generally following the extent of water contact the top half of fig 9 shows a significant elevation in risk of gi associated with the water contact categories body immersion 1 89 95 ci 1 27 2 83 head immersion 1 98 95 ci 1 58 2 46 and swallowing water 1 91 95 ci 1 27 2 85 and a nonsignificant elevation in risk for the water contact categories sand contact 1 20 95 ci 0 80 1 78 and face splashing 1 15 95 ci 0 99 1 33 we also found a significant elevation in risk of gi associated with the water contact category unspecified direct contact 2 28 95 ci 1 74 2 99 and a smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk of gi associated with the water contact category unspecified indirect contact 1 27 95 ci 0 74 2 99 to provide a general assessment of the association between level of water contact and gi risk we combined all data we considered direct water contact into the general water contact category all direct contact and all data we considered indirect water contact into the general water contact category all indirect contact and calculated separate pooled risk estimates for all gi outcomes combined and all ri outcomes combined for each general water contact category we found a significant elevation in risk of gi associated with the water contact category all direct contact 2 23 95 ci 1 88 2 65 and a smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk of gi associated with the water contact category all indirect contact 1 27 95 ci 0 74 2 16 the bottom half of fig 9 shows the pooled risk estimates of ri with different levels of water contact generally followed the same pattern as gi except for the water contact category swallowing water we observed a significant elevation in risk of ri associated with the water contact category head immersion 2 05 95 ci 1 48 2 83 and a smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk of ri associated with the water contact category body immersion 1 66 95 ci 0 85 3 24 we also found a small nonsignificant elevation in risk of ri associated with the water contact category sand contact 1 01 95 ci 0 93 1 09 although we deemed this result inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies we found no elevation in the pooled risk estimates of ri for the water contact categories face splashing 0 89 95 ci 0 69 1 15 and swallowing water 0 99 95 ci 0 84 1 16 although we deemed the result for face splashing as inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies we found a significant elevation in risk of ri associated with the water contact category unspecified direct contact 1 50 95 ci 1 13 1 86 and no elevation in risk of ri associated with the water contact category unspecified indirect contact 0 90 95 ci 0 72 1 12 although we deemed the result for the water contact category unspecified indirect contact as inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies we found a significant elevation in risk of ri associated with the general water contact category all direct contact 1 70 95 ci 1 39 2 07 and a smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk of ri associated with the general water contact category all indirect contact 0 90 95 ci 0 72 1 12 although we deemed the result for the water contact category all indirect contact as inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies 3 6 additional analyses 3 6 1 children versus adults we evaluated differences in risk of illness for children and adults by calculating pooled risk estimates for children and adults separately thirty six studies meeting our inclusion criteria reported risk estimates for specific participant ages age ranges or age categories fig 10 shows the pooled risk estimates using no contact as the reference for two health outcome categories all gi outcomes combined and all ri outcomes combined and stratified into the two subgroups children and adults because a limited number of studies reported illness risk estimates related to age we focused on pooled risk estimates for gi by combining all gi health outcomes and pooled risk estimates for ri by combining all ri health outcomes for the activity category swimming which is the activity category with the greatest amount of data we found a significant elevation in risk of gi for the age subgroup children 2 53 95 ci 1 41 4 55 and a smaller significant elevation in risk for the age subgroup adults 1 81 95 ci 1 35 2 43 although both pooled risk estimates are significantly greater than 1 they are not significantly different from each other we found no increase in risk of ri for the age subgroup children 0 97 95 ci 0 69 1 37 and a nonsignificant elevation in risk of ri for the age subgroup adults 1 58 95 ci 0 69 3 60 3 6 2 other health outcomes about one half 45 92 of the studies meeting our inclusion criteria reported at least one risk estimate for health outcomes other than gi or ri we categorized these health outcomes of secondary interest as morbidities related to skin ent eyes and cold flu see table 3 and performed meta analysis on all available data we performed meta analysis on the activity category swimming and water contact categories body immersion head immersion and swallowing water because they were the only categories with data related to health outcomes of secondary interest in most cases we found a moderate elevation in risk for health outcome categories skin ent eye and cold flu fig 11 shows the pooled risk estimates for these 4 health outcome categories we observed a significant elevation in risk for the health outcome category skin associated with the activity category swimming 2 37 95 ci 1 77 3 17 and water contact categories body immersion 1 68 95 ci 1 03 2 75 head immersion 2 79 95 ci 1 48 5 27 and swallowing water 1 51 95 ci 1 13 2 00 we found a significant elevation in risk for the health outcome category ent associated with the activity category swimming 1 83 95 ci 1 31 2 56 and water contact category head immersion 1 80 95 ci 1 33 2 42 and a nonsignificant elevation in risk associated with the water contact category body immersion 1 30 95 ci 0 96 1 77 we found no elevation in risk for the health outcome category ent associated with the water contact category swallowing water 0 97 95 ci 0 78 1 20 although we deemed this result inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies we found a significant elevation in risk for the health outcome category eye associated with the activity category swimming 1 65 95 ci 1 17 2 34 and water contact categories head immersion 2 79 95 ci 1 48 5 27 and body immersion 2 24 95 ci 1 32 3 81 we found a significant elevation in risk for the health outcome category eye associated with the water contact category swallowing water 1 77 95 ci 1 14 2 24 but deemed this result inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies finally we found a significant elevation in risk for the health outcome cold flu associated with the activity category swimming 1 60 95 ci 1 03 2 47 and nonsignificant elevations in risk for the water contact categories head immersion 1 59 95 ci 0 74 3 38 and swallowing water 1 08 95 ci 0 85 1 36 we found no elevation in risk for the health outcome cold flu associated with the water contact category body immersion 0 86 95 ci 0 61 1 22 although we deemed this result inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies 4 discussion this is the first systematic review and meta analysis comparing the risk of illness associated with different categories of recreational activities and different levels of contact with ambient surface waters our meta analysis confirms a strong association between swimming and both gi and ri swimming approximately doubles the risk of gi and increases the risk of ri by approximately 75 compared to no contact controls this result is consistent with previous meta analyses exclusively for swimming showing a strong relationship between swimming and gi leonard et al 2018 wade et al 2003 and between swimming and ri mannocci et al 2016 our meta analysis is also consistent with previous meta analyses exclusively for swimming showing an association between swimming and skin related health outcomes yau et al 2009 this consistency is likely due to the relatively large body of scientific literature on the risk of illness associated with swimming in contrast to previous meta analyses exclusively for swimming our meta analysis additionally suggests differences in risk of illness associated with recreational activities that correspond to the likelihood of water ingestion during recreation we categorized recreational activities such as canoeing kayaking rowing boating fishing standup paddle boarding or rafting when those activities occur in relatively tranquil waters as minimal contact and activities such as surfing diving snorkeling windsurfing or canoeing kayaking or rafting in relatively rough waters as sports related contact we found an elevation in the risk of gi associated with minimal contact activities compared to a no contact reference that was less than the risk of gi associated with swimming these results are consistent with studies suggesting that people who canoe kayak fish motorboat or row are less likely to ingest ambient water than swimmers dorevitch et al 2011 we found an elevation in risk of gi associated with sports related contact that was greater than the risk of gi associated with swimming although publication bias may be contributing to our higher risk estimate these results suggest that activity intensity may be an important determinant of exposure to water borne pathogens and risk of illness ingestion of water and subsequent risk of gi are presumed to be lower during minimal contact recreation still it is expected that there is some degree of risk of acquiring illness through these activities inadvertent immersion can result in whole body contact and splashing can lead to a variety of water contact scenarios illnesses affecting the skin and perhaps the mucous membranes of the eyes and ears may be of relatively greater importance for minimal contact recreation usepa 2003 although the results of our meta analysis of the secondary health outcomes skin ent eye and cold flu suggests an elevation in risk with swimming and high levels of water contact we could not calculate risk estimates for minimal contact or low levels of water contact for these health outcomes because none of the studies meeting our inclusion criteria contained relevant data the precise risk of illness with activities we categorize as minimal contact is likely to be dependent on the potential for water contact during the specific activity we found no conclusive evidence of a risk of ri associated with minimal contact activities compared to no contact controls although the pooled risk estimates of ri for minimal contact were derived from only two studies our results suggest the risk of ri is low during minimal contact activities and is lower than the risk associated with swimming on the one hand the results for ri are counterintuitive because ri presumably involves inhalation exposure of sprays or aerosols that could also occur during minimal contact activities on the other hand we define minimal contact activities as occurring on relatively tranquil waters where spray or aerosol generation may be less likely compared to waters where participants engaged in swimming or sports related contact activities and where rough water or breaking waves may result in more spray or aerosols we separately estimated the risk of illnesses associated with recreational activities that are generally not characterized as swimming but nonetheless have a high degree of water contact we categorized activities such as surfing windsurfing whitewater canoeing whitewater kayaking whitewater rafting diving and snorkeling as sports related contact we evaluated the risk of illness associated with this category of recreational activities separately because they are not commonly recognized as swimming but have the potential for similar or even greater exposure than the activities we categorized as swimming our results suggest the risk of gi associated with activities we categorize as sports related contact is the same or greater than the risk of illness associated with swimming several outbreaks of gi and other illnesses have been associated with swimming during sports events such as triathlons which may occur in unmonitored or unregulated waterbodies such as rivers or canals with the potential for poor water quality davis and cdc 1998 hall et al 2017 harder lauridsen et al 2013 parkkali et al 2017 our meta analysis of gi risk stratified by water quality is consistent with greater gi risk in poor water quality conditions our estimates of gi risk associated with different levels of water contact are consistent with the pattern of gi risk we found associated with different categories of recreational activities among explicitly defined levels of water contact we found greater gi risk associated with levels of contact with a high probability of water ingestion body immersion head immersion and swallowing water compared to contact with lower probability of water ingestion sand contact and face splashing we also found greater risk of gi associated with direct contact all direct contact compared to indirect contact all indirect contact these results are consistent with the occurrence of gi as associated with the amount of self reported water exposure dorevitch et al 2012b furthermore the level of gi risk associated with body immersion head immersion and swallowing water are quantitatively similar suggesting that body immersion alone may be enough to put recreators at significant risk of gi this conclusion is consistent with a sensitivity analysis in leonard et al 2018 that reported the pooled risk of illness associated with any definition of swimming and the pooled risk of illness associated with swimming defined as including head immersion are not significantly different from each other the pooled risk estimates for ri generally followed the same pattern as gi we found the highest risk of ri associated with swimming and sports related contact whereas we found little or no elevation in risk for minimal contact however we considered the pooled risk estimates for ri associated with minimal contact as inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies although our meta analysis includes 92 individual studies it is nonetheless limited by the relatively small number of available studies with estimates of illness risk associated with activities we categorized as minimal contact and sports related contact most studies meeting our inclusion criteria focused on swimming because regulatory entities are primarily concerned with protecting beachgoers from human fecal pollution in designated recreational waters where swimming is the most likely activity assessments of illness risk associated with swimming will likely continue to receive most research funding because it represents the largest at risk population however increasing recognition of illness risk associated with non swimming recreational activities and interest in developing water quality guidelines specifically designed to protect recreators engaged in those activities may prompt additional studies of non swimming activities our study was also limited by a lack of available data to adequately account for effect modifiers such as water quality duration and frequency of water contact age type of surface water i e marine or fresh source of contamination e g point versus non point naturally occurring organisms that can cause human illness and heterogeneity in the way those effect modifiers are defined across studies most studies meeting our inclusion criteria either did not specify those parameters did not stratify participants on the basis of those parameters or did so in a manner that was difficult to categorize for meta analysis for example defining children across a broad age range could potentially obscure elevated risk in young children greater attention to water quality and recreator age are relatively simple parameters that could provide important information on the risks associated with water based recreation 5 conclusions recreational activities associated with less ambient water contact e g fishing boating or kayaking in tranquil waters may result in a lower risk of illness compared to recreational activities associated with greater ambient water contact e g swimming surfing or whitewater kayaking this study suggests that the level of exposure with different types of recreational activities are important characteristics when assessing the risk of illness associated with recreation in ambient surface waters declaration of competing interest the

17964,recreational water quality guidelines protect the public from health risks associated with water recreation by helping to prevent unacceptable concentrations of pathogenic organisms in ambient water however illness risk is associated with both the concentration of pathogens in the water and the degree of contact with those pathogens different recreational activities can result in different levels of contact with ambient water containing water borne pathogens we conducted a systematic literature review and meta analysis to evaluate risks of illness associated with different recreational activities and different levels of contact to ambient surface waters we screened 8 618 potentially relevant studies for quantitative measures of risk using inclusion exclusion criteria established in

activities are important characteristics of the exposure pathway when assessing illness risk associated with recreation in ambient surface waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords primary secondary contact illness guidelines standards 1 introduction fecal contamination of ambient surface waters is a public health concern usepa 2012 who 2003 epidemiological studies have reported an increased risk of illness associated with exposure to fecally contaminated recreational water arnold et al 2013 2016 colford et al 2007 fleisher et al 2010 lamparelli et al 2015 wade et al 2003 2006 2008 2010 yau et al 2014 swimming paddling boating and fishing account for more than 90 million cases of gastrointestinal respiratory ear eye and skin related illnesses per year in the united states with an estimated annual cost of 2 9 billion deflorio barker et al 2018 to protect the public from illnesses associated with recreational water exposures national water quality guidelines have been developed by assessing relationships between the concentration of indicators of fecal contamination serving as an indirect measurement of fecal pathogens and rates of illness a level of indicator corresponding to an illness rate is then chosen australian government national health and medical research council 2008 brazil national standards 2005 health canada 2012 new zealand ministry for the environment 2002 republic of south africa department of environmental affairs 2012 usepa 2012 who 2003 recreational water quality guidelines provide the allowable concentration of specific pathogen indicators in surface waters used for different recreational activities by the public however the degree of illness risk is related to both the concentration of pathogens in the water and the degree of contact with those pathogens see usepa 2014 for a review of dose response relationships for pathogens thus individuals engaging in activities with a greater degree of contact to ambient recreational water potentially have a higher risk of illness compared to individuals engaging in activities with a lower degree of contact wade et al 2003 2006 2008 2010 most water quality guidelines were established to protect the public during recreational activities described as swimming or bathing with a high degree of water contact some water quality guidelines have also been established in the united states table 1 and internationally brazil national standards 2005 health canada 2012 to protect activities presumed to be associated with a lower degree of water contact however there is a lack of consistency in the way recreational activities and presumed levels of water contact are defined or grouped table 2 for example some guidelines refer to recreational activities with a high degree of water contact as primary contact whole body contact total body contact immersion contact or simply contact recreation other guidelines refer to recreational activities with a lower degree of water contact as secondary contact limited water contact limited body contact partial body contact incidental contact or limited contact recreation some guidelines consider a third category of recreational activities with the lowest potential contact with water they define as no contact not contact or non contact recreation different recreational activity categories may be associated with different water quality values some water quality guidelines assign less stringent water quality values for activity categories with lower potential for water contact on the basis of the presumption that less contact with pathogens in water compensates for a higher concentration of those pathogens in water resulting in the same overall risk of illness recreational activities with less water contact may still carry risk due to inadvertent contact with water poor hygiene following water contact and hand to mouth or hand to eye contact dorevitch et al 2015 however there is limited evidence about the magnitude of health risks associated with recreational activities commonly identified as resulting in less water contact compared to recreational activities commonly identified as resulting in greater water contact dorevitch et al 2012b fewtrell et al 1992 lee et al 1997 previous systematic reviews and meta analyses focused on the risk of illness associated with swimming leonard et al 2018 mannocci et al 2016 wade et al 2003 yau et al 2009 however these studies did not address differences in the risk of illness between different types of recreational activities the purpose of this systematic review and meta analysis is to evaluate the current scientific evidence for differences in risk of illness between recreational activities typically associated with different levels of contact with water the objectives of this study are to 1 assess and summarize the scientific literature on the risk of illness associated with different types of recreational activities and different levels of water contact during recreation 2 quantitatively estimate the pooled risk of illness associated with different categories of recreational activities and levels of water contact and 3 evaluate risk of illness across activity and water contact categories to better understand illness risk associated with different types of recreation in ambient surface waters 2 material and methods 2 1 protocol the protocol for this systematic review and meta analysis was developed with input from a panel of external peer reviewers the protocol is available upon request from the corresponding author and conforms to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma liberati et al 2009 the protocol specified the literature search strategy for identification of relevant studies and management of retrieved studies reference databases searched search terms procedures for hand searches procedures for assessing gray literature information requests inclusion criteria methodology for risk of bias assessment and general methods of synthesis analysis and interpretation of results the hazard of concern in our study was exposure to ambient surface waters during recreation although sand activities typically do not involve direct contact with water we included sand contact as a potential exposure route because sand contact often occurs in conjunction with water recreation especially among children arnold et al 2016 deflorio barker et al 2018 heaney et al 2012 heaney et al 2009 solo gabriele et al 2016 2 2 literature search we searched pubmed web of science and toxline for peer reviewed articles in any language we limited articles to those published during or after 1950 to match wade et al 2003 studies of interest were those related to exposure to ambient surface water during recreational activities and any health outcomes of interest see supplementary material table s1 for all search terms and the boolean operations we applied to them after the first phase of study selection identifying potentially relevant studies described below we reviewed the content and reference lists of potentially relevant studies for additional relevant literature we also manually searched for articles by examining the reference lists of review articles addressing health effects associated with recreational activities however we did not use results presented in any review articles unless they were derived from data that were not previously published we stored all citations with available abstracts in an electronic database 2 3 study selection our study selection procedure had two phases during the first phase we identified potentially relevant studies returned from our literature searches for studies related to the occurrence of any illness following exposure to ambient surface waters during any type of recreational activity we selected potentially relevant studies based on their titles and abstracts and then confirmed those selections by obtaining and reviewing their full text we included gray literature only if publicly available and if they contained enough supporting methodological information that could allow a peer review as if they were manuscripts being considered for publication by a scientific journal during the second phase of study selection we selected those studies identified in the first phase of study selection that met all the following criteria 2 3 1 study participants study participants were human subjects engaging in activities involving exposure to ambient surface waters 2 3 2 health outcomes at least one health outcome was evaluated health outcomes included but were not limited to vomiting diarrhea stomachache nausea fever loose stool sore throat cough runny nose rash itchy skin eye ailments earache i e ear pain ear infection or runny ears symptoms of infection and non symptomatic health outcomes such as antibody responses to infection with waterborne pathogens 2 3 3 water exposures related to ambient surface water exposure we included studies involving exposure to marine i e ocean or fresh waters i e lakes rivers ponds and excluded studies involving exposure to chlorinated waters e g swimming pools hot tubs and splash parks 2 3 4 study designs study designs were observational epidemiologic studies e g cohort case control cross sectional ecological survey and time series designs or randomized trials 2 3 5 data availability studies reported crude or adjusted effect estimates derived from data not previously published or included enough unpublished data to allow calculation of crude relative risk if a study reported both crude and adjusted effect estimates we used only the adjusted estimates 2 4 data extraction we extracted study design methodology and results from studies meeting our inclusion criteria the data we extracted included water type marine or fresh water quality analytical methods quantitative values and qualitative descriptions time over which water quality measurements represented exposure i e same day at the time of swimming or over the entire study period study population study size study design geographic location health outcome s measured covariate s measured water exposure activity description s reported measures of risk and data we could use to calculate crude relative risk data was extracted by two team members one to identify and enter the data into a database and the other to verify accuracy a third team member supervised data extraction and resolved disagreements 2 5 study quality we evaluated study quality using a checklist of 13 questions that assess risk of bias in 7 domains supplementary material table s2 we formulated the list of questions from the national toxicology program office of health assessment and translation risk of bias tool ohat 2015 agency for healthcare research and quality viswanathan et al 2012 cochrane handbook higgins et al 2011 and the clarity group at mcmaster university 2013 two team members independently rated each study on each of the 13 questions using a four point scale definitely low risk probably low risk probably high risk and definitely high risk we compiled and compared all ratings from the two team members and any disagreements between the two team members were resolved by a third senior team member we developed a classification system to determine whether each study has either a low risk of bias or high risk of bias by focusing on 6 of the 13 risk of bias questions that reflect exposure or outcome misclassification biased methods and lack of adequate adjustment for potential confounders they are 1 is the comparison i e control or reference group appropriate 2 does the study design or analysis account for important confounding and modifying variables 3 do researchers adjust or control for other exposures that are anticipated to bias results 4 are we confident in the exposure characterization 5 are we confident in the outcome assessment 6 are there any other potential threats to internal validity e g inappropriate statistical methods we excluded from the meta analysis any study rated as definitely high risk of bias for any of the above 6 questions we included studies in the meta analysis but classified them as having a high risk of bias if they fulfilled any of the following criteria a a rating of probably high risk of bias for all questions 1 2 3 4 and 5 b a rating of probably high risk of bias for any 2 of questions 1 2 3 with a rating of probably high risk of bias for question 6 c a rating of probably high risk of bias for questions 3 5 and 6 d a rating of probably high risk of bias for question 3 with a rating of probably high risk of bias for at least one of questions 1 2 3 and 6 e a rating of probably high risk of bias for question 4 with a rating of probably high risk of bias for any 2 of questions 1 2 3 5 or 6 we classified studies as having a low risk of bias if they did not fulfill any of the above high risk of bias criteria 2 6 meta analysis descriptions of recreational activities study participants health outcomes water quality age groups and types of water contact substantially varied among the studies meeting our inclusion criteria to perform meta analyses we categorized each extracted effect estimate based on recreational activity degree of water contact health outcome water quality study subject age and water type table 3 shows the study specific descriptions and how we categorized them 2 6 1 recreational activities we designed a system for categorizing recreational activities by first evaluating how currently available recreational water quality guidelines defined them we compiled terms and phrases used to define recreational activities by international health organizations national governments and by individual states and territories in the united states most guidelines that distinguish between different categories of recreational activities define two categories on the basis of the probability of contact with ambient water thus we specified in our protocol a strategy to categorize recreational activities into two categories and perform a meta analysis to compare the risk of illness associated with those two categories when considering the descriptions of recreational activities extracted from the studies meeting our inclusion criteria however we found a wide range of recreational activities that we believe were not adequately represented by only two categories instead we grouped recreational activities into 5 specific categories table 3 we categorized activities as swimming if they involved the immersion of any part of the body in water that did not involve the use of specialized sport equipment we categorized activities as sports related contact if they involved immersion or a high probability of immersion or splashing of water on any part of the body while using specialized sport equipment e g surfing water skiing or canoeing kayaking or rafting in rough water we categorized activities as minimal contact if they involved floating on or being near ambient water except for sand contact with a low probability of immersion or splashing of water on any part of the body e g fishing or canoeing kayaking or rafting in tranquil waters we categorized activities as sand contact if the activity only involved contact with sand although we considered combining sand contact and minimal contact activities together we decided to keep them as separate categories because the activities in each of those categories generally involve different types of beachgoers children versus adults and different media sand versus water finally we categorized activities as mixed contact if a study combined participants engaging in activities from more than one of the above activity categories because the primary goal of this systematic review and meta analysis is to evaluate the risk of illness associated with different recreational activity categories representing different levels of water contact we did not analyze effect estimates in the category mixed contact 2 6 2 levels of water contact a subset of studies meeting our inclusion criteria provided estimates of illness risk associated with one or more levels of water contact independent of the recreational activity underlying the contact to analyze water contact related estimates of risk we independently designated a water contact category to every effect estimate including effect estimates associated with a specific recreational activity table 3 we categorized water contact as body immersion head immersion face splashing or swallowing water if a study specifically described those categories of water contact in addition we categorized water contact as unspecified direct contact if a study did not specify a category of water contact but did specify a recreational activity we categorized as either swimming or sports related contact or described water contact consisting of more than one of the specific water contact categories body immersion head immersion face splashing or swallowing water we categorized water contact as unspecified indirect contact if a study did not specify a water contact category but did specify a recreational activity we categorized as minimal contact for analytical purposes we combined all data from specific water contact categories body immersion head immersion face splashing or swallowing water together with data from the category unspecified direct contact into the general water contact category all direct contact we also defined the general water contact category all indirect contact to compare with the general water contact category all direct contact even though the category all indirect contact represents the same set of data as the category unspecified indirect contact because no studies defined a specific water contact level we considered indirect water contact finally we categorized exposure as sand contact if a study reported the effect estimate as related to contact with sand 2 6 3 health outcomes we selected gastrointestinal illness gi and respiratory illness ri as the health outcomes of primary interest before performing our literature search the studies meeting our inclusion criteria contained a total of 143 health outcome descriptors we categorized the gi and ri health outcome descriptors as either general gi highly credible gastrointestinal illness hcgi diarrhea general ri significant respiratory disease srd or cough health outcomes of secondary interest were skin symptoms skin ear symptoms ear combined ear nose and throat symptoms ent eye symptoms eye cold or flu symptoms cold flu other symptoms other and unspecified symptoms any we used the category hcgi because it is a specific category of gi used by several studies to represent a combination of unmistakably recognized individual symptoms of gastrointestinal illness cabelli 1983 hcgi includes the presence of a specific set of symptoms such as vomiting diarrhea with a fever or disabling condition or stomachache or nausea accompanied by a fever the category diarrhea refers to gi specifically described as diarrhea or a set of symptoms where diarrhea is a distinguishing characteristic the category general gi refers to any one or collection of gi symptoms studies did not specifically categorize as hcgi or diarrhea we used the category srd because it is a category of ri used by several studies to clearly identify the occurrences of consequential ri events the category srd includes a specific set of clearly identifiable ri symptoms although there were small variations in the precise definition of srd among studies the category cough refers to a health outcome that studies simply described as a cough the category general ri includes any one or collection of ri symptoms studies did not specifically categorize as srd or cough 2 6 4 water quality because previous studies have shown an association between water quality and rate of illness water quality could be an effect modifier when evaluating risk of illness associated with different recreational activities to evaluate the effects of water quality we extracted water quality data and information from studies meeting our inclusion criteria we categorized water quality as good intermediate or poor based on quantitative measures of fecal indicator bacteria reported in the studies if a study reported multiple risk estimates each linked to a different density of fecal indicator bacteria we categorized risk estimates linked to the lowest density of indicator bacteria as good water quality the highest density of indicator as poor water quality and densities between good and poor as intermediate water quality many studies did not report quantitative measures of water quality but did provide narrative descriptions we used to categorize water quality as good or poor for example we categorized water quality as good if a study described water quality as low pathogen concentration least polluted or lower pollution and we categorized water quality as poor if a study described water quality as high pathogen concentration most polluted or higher pollution see table 3 we also categorized water quality as good or poor based on physical or climatological conditions studies associated with good or poor water quality for example we categorized water quality as good if the study claimed good water quality due to the presence of a sand berm preventing contaminated water from reaching the study area and we categorized water quality as poor if the study claimed poor water quality due to the absence of a sand berm preventing contaminated water from reaching the study area we categorized water quality as any if the study did not provide water quality information or did not relate effect estimates to water quality 2 6 5 age because children may be at a higher risk of illness when recreating in contaminated waters compared to adults arnold et al 2016 heaney et al 2009 2012 wade et al 2013 we evaluated age as an effect modifier on the risk of illness associated with different recreational activities we generally attempted to categorize subjects below 18 20 years of age as children and subjects above 18 20 years of age as adults when studies provided numerical age information we accepted study specific categorizations of children or adults if the study did not provide numerical age information but nonetheless described subjects as children or adults we categorized the age of the study subjects as any if the study did not report any age information or reported age information but did not relate effect estimates with specific age categories we assumed all subjects from studies of athletes from competitive sporting events e g triathlons were adults 2 7 statistical analysis we quantitatively evaluated the risk of illness associated with different categories of recreational activities and water contact by combining the results of multiple studies using meta analysis egger et al 2008 littell et al 2008 we considered odds ratios to be reasonable estimates of relative risk because the probability of infection due to water based recreational activities is generally low we calculated a crude relative risk and 95 confidence interval ci when a study did not report effect estimates but reported sufficient data to calculate one when analyses contained 5 or more studies we used robust variance estimation meta regression tanner smith and tipton 2014 tipton 2015 to allow the utilization of all effect estimates in a single study that fulfill the criteria of the category being evaluated we assumed a within study correlation of 0 8 tanner smith and tipton 2014 because our sensitivity analysis using within study correlations of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 resulted in point estimates and confidence interval limits that varied by less than 0 001 when analyses contained fewer than 5 studies we used the dersimonian and laird random effects approach dersimonian and laird 1986 to first estimate study specific pooled effects and then the overall pooled effect we used excel and stata for data management and the metan metareg and robumeta packages in stata version 14 0 statacorp 2015 for all meta analyses we considered pooled risk estimates significant if their 95 confidence intervals did not overlap 1 and we considered pooled risk estimates significantly different from each other if their 95 confidence intervals did not overlap each other we evaluated heterogeneity by using forest plots and the cochran q test for heterogeneity in conjunction with the i2 index to quantify the degree of variation when heterogeneity was high i2 index 80 we conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the potential sources of heterogeneity including study quality study design activity category water contact category and water type we evaluated impacts of water quality on pooled risk estimates by performing meta regression analyses that include water quality as a covariate and by calculating water quality specific pooled estimates we analyzed publication bias by creating funnel plots of pooled risk estimates from each individual study versus the log standard error of those estimates and inspecting for asymmetry because robust variance estimation meta regression does not report pooled effect estimates for each individual study we used standard meta regression to calculate the pooled risk for each study in the funnel plot we assessed asymmetry in the funnel plot using eggers test egger et al 2008 we considered the results to indicate publication bias if p 0 10 for the bias coefficient in egger s test we conducted sensitivity trim and fill analyses duval and tweedie 2000a b to estimate the number of missing studies in a meta analysis affected by publication bias and the effect of those studies on the effect estimate before performing our analysis we declared any meta analysis result derived from fewer than three studies as inconclusive 3 results 3 1 literature search summary fig 1 illustrates the study selection process our systematic literature search returned 8 618 articles during the first phase of study selection we identified 968 studies as potentially relevant based on their titles and abstracts we identified 629 of those studies as potentially relevant after evaluating their full text during the second phase of study selection we identified 112 of 629 studies as meeting our inclusion criteria of those 112 studies we excluded three studies ferrer et al 2012 kundu et al 2013 rijal et al 2011 because they were quantitative microbial risk assessments and did not provide evidence of quantitative associations between recreational activities and health outcomes we excluded an additional 15 studies amin et al 2017 appleton and bailey 1990 cabelli et al 1982 deflorio barker et al 2018 eze et al 2014 fewtrell and delahunty 1985 fleming et al 2004 kueh et al 1995 lepesteur et al 2006 papastergiou et al 2011 philipp et al 1989 seyfried et al 1985b stevenson 1953 turbow et al 2008 veleizan et al 2016 because they did not report quantitative results or sufficient data to calculate crude relative risk we also excluded one study von schirnding et al 1992 because it contained pilot data published in a follow up paper von schirnding et al 1993 we considered the results of two publications cabelli 1983 cabelli et al 1983 as one study because they each reported a subset of results from a single study the remaining 92 studies are the subject of this systematic review and meta analysis 3 2 study characteristics fig 2 summarizes the key characteristics of the 92 studies meeting our inclusion criteria a complete list of the studies and their characteristics is provided in table 4 most 81 92 studies evaluated at least one of several symptoms related to gi that met our category definition of general gi because 11 studies independently evaluated the rates of illness associated with a more narrowly defined set of gi symptoms termed highly credible gastrointestinal illness hcgi or hcgi 2 and 18 studies independently evaluated risk of diarrhea we analyzed those health outcomes as both separate categories hcgi and diarrhea and together combined with general gi into the single category all gi outcomes combined a minority 18 92 of studies evaluated at least one of several symptoms related to ri that met our category definition of general ri because 9 studies independently evaluated the rates of illness associated with the more narrowly defined set of ri symptoms srd and 4 studies independently evaluated risk of cough we analyzed those health outcomes as both separate categories srd and cough and together combined with general ri into the single category all ri outcomes combined the majority 66 92 of studies meeting our inclusion criteria reported at least one risk estimate in the recreational activity category swimming most 55 66 of those studies reported risk estimates only for swimming substantially fewer studies reported risk estimates for sports related contact 13 92 minimal contact 10 92 and sand contact 6 92 the specific water contact category that studies meeting our inclusion criteria most often explicitly defined was head immersion 31 92 fewer studies reported risk estimates for body immersion 15 92 swallowing water 13 92 and face splashing 1 92 many 44 92 studies meeting our inclusion criteria reported at least one risk estimate in the water contact category unspecified direct contact and fewer 10 92 studies reported at least one risk estimate in the water contact category unspecified indirect contact about one quarter 21 92 of studies meeting our inclusion criteria provided illness risk estimates for more than one water contact category of the 92 studies included in our meta analysis we assessed study quality as low risk of bias for 85 studies and high risk of bias for 7 studies risk of bias assessments for each study are provided in supplementary material table s3 3 3 recreational activities 3 3 1 gastrointestinal illness gi fig 3 shows the pooled risk of gi for each activity category using no contact as the reference group we observe a consistent elevation in risks of gi for all activity categories our literature search retrieved the greatest amount of data for gi health outcomes we categorized as general gi we found a significant elevation in risk of general gi associated with sports related contact 2 70 95 ci 1 08 6 78 and swimming 2 20 95 ci 1 82 2 65 and a nonsignificant elevation in risk of general gi associated with sand contact 1 41 95 ci 0 94 2 11 and minimal contact 1 19 95 ci 0 62 2 31 although our literature search retrieved substantially fewer studies evaluating health outcomes we categorized as hcgi or diarrhea our meta analysis of the available data suggests a pattern of elevation in risk for these health outcome categories consistent with the pattern we found for general gi we found a significant elevation in risk of hcgi associated with swimming 1 58 95 ci 1 08 2 31 and a nonsignificant elevation in risk associated with minimal contact 1 38 95 ci 0 87 2 21 we also found a significant elevation in risk of diarrhea associated with sports related contact 6 70 95 ci 1 09 41 25 swimming 2 03 95 ci 1 40 2 95 and sand contact 1 39 95 ci 1 03 1 86 no studies provided risk estimates for hcgi associated with the activity categories sports related contact or sand contact or for diarrhea associated with the activity category minimal contact as specified in our protocol we deemed the pooled risk estimates for hcgi associated with the category minimal contact and the pooled risk estimates for diarrhea associated with the activity categories sports related contact and sand contact as inconclusive because they were derived from fewer than 3 studies because of the relatively few estimates of illness risk for hcgi and diarrhea we combined data from all 3 gi related health outcome categories for each activity category separately and calculated the pooled risk for the health outcome category all gi outcomes combined as expected the pattern of pooled risk estimates for the category all gi outcomes combined generally follows the pattern of pooled risk estimates for the health outcome category general gi that contributed most of the data we found a significant elevation in risk for all gi outcomes combined associated with sports related contact 2 69 95 ci 1 04 6 92 and swimming 2 19 95 ci 1 82 2 63 and a nonsignificant elevation in risk associated with sand contact 1 42 95 ci 0 97 2 07 and minimal contact 1 27 95 ci 0 74 2 16 we observed high heterogeneity in pooled risk estimates for general gi and all gi outcomes combined associated with the activity category swimming i2 74 and 76 respectively to evaluate potential sources of heterogeneity we performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of study design study quality and water type we evaluated the effect of water quality separately because many studies did not report water quality fig 4 shows the pooled risk estimate for all gi outcomes combined for the activity category swimming using all data top row followed by pooled risk estimates of subgroups selected by study design study quality and water type comparison of pooled risk estimates by study design and water type suggests these variables likely contribute to the heterogeneity enumerated by the i2 values evaluation of heterogeneity due to study quality is inconclusive because we assessed all the studies contributing data except for one that contributed to the analysis of all gi outcomes combined in the activity category swimming as low risk of bias we evaluated publication bias by calculating pooled risk estimates for all gi outcomes combined in each activity category and the standard error of those estimates for each individual study we used meta regression to derive a study specific effect estimate and standard error if a study provided multiple effect estimates for an activity category fig 5 shows the risk of gi obtained from each study plotted against the standard error of those estimates although scatter in the funnel plot for the category swimming appears asymmetrical egger s test fails to reject the null hypothesis of a symmetrical distribution p 0 84 funnel plots for the categories minimal contact and sand contact do not appear asymmetric and egger s test fails to reject the null hypothesis of symmetrical distributions p 0 25 and 0 59 respectively scatter in the funnel plot for sports related contact appears asymmetrical with fewer than expected smaller studies showing smaller risks egger s test rejects the null hypothesis of symmetrical distributions p 0 03 suggesting publication bias trim and fill analysis suggests adding three studies may prevent small study publication bias resulting in a pooled risk estimate for sports related contact of 1 52 95 ci 0 84 2 83 3 3 2 respiratory illness ri fig 6 shows the pooled risk estimates of ri for different categories of recreational activities using no contact as the reference we found fewer studies reporting risk estimates for ri 16 studies compared to gi 43 studies we found a significant elevation in risk of general ri associated with swimming 1 99 95 ci 1 53 2 58 and sports related contact 1 49 95 ci 1 00 2 24 we found a nonsignificant increase in risk of general ri associated with minimal contact 1 33 95 ci 0 59 3 03 although we deemed this result inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies we found a nonsignificant elevation in risk of srd 1 40 95 ci 0 82 2 39 and cough 1 15 95 ci 0 78 1 71 for the activity category swimming we found no elevation in risk of srd for the activity category minimal contact 0 87 95 ci 0 69 1 09 and a small nonsignificant elevation in risk of srd for the activity category sand contact 1 01 95 ci 0 93 1 09 however we deemed these results inconclusive because they were derived from fewer than 3 studies like the outcome category general ri we observed a significant elevation in risk of all ri outcomes combined associated with swimming 1 78 95 ci 1 38 2 29 and sports related contact 1 49 95 ci 1 00 2 24 we found no elevation in risk associated with minimal contact 0 90 95 ci 0 71 1 14 and a small nonsignificant elevation in risk associated with sand contact 1 01 95 ci 0 93 1 09 we found high heterogeneity among risk estimates for general ri and all ri outcomes combined in the activity category sports related contact i2 80 for both health outcome categories because they comprise the same set of data and for cough in the activity category swimming i2 84 however we could not perform a sensitivity analysis because of the small number of illness risk estimates in subgroups corresponding to study design study quality and water type analysis of publication bias suggests a tendency toward publication of positive results for ri fig 7 shows the funnel plots for the overall risk of ri reported in each study for swimming and sports related contact we do not show funnel plots for minimal contact and sand contact because there were fewer than 3 studies providing illness risk estimates for those activity categories the funnel plot for sports related contact does not appear asymmetric and egger s test fails to reject the null hypothesis of symmetrical distributions p 0 399 scatter in the funnel plot for swimming appears asymmetrical with fewer than expected smaller studies showing smaller risks egger s test suggests publication bias p 0 002 and a trim and fill analysis suggests adding three additional studies can prevent small study publication bias resulting in a pooled risk estimate for swimming of 1 51 95 ci 1 24 1 83 3 4 effect of water quality we evaluated the effect of water quality on risk of gi and ri associated with different recreational activities by estimating pooled risk estimates from subsets of illness risk estimates we categorized as related to either good or poor water quality there were relatively few studies contributing to this analysis because only 15 of 92 of the studies meeting our inclusion criteria provided information about water quality as a result we focused our analysis on two health outcome categories all gi outcomes combined and all ri outcomes combined which represent the health outcome data sets with the greatest amount of data fig 8 shows the pooled risk estimates for each activity category stratified by good and poor water quality we found a significant elevation in risk of gi associated with the activity category swimming for the subgroup poor water quality 2 00 95 ci 1 59 2 51 and a smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk of gi associated with swimming for the subgroup good water quality 1 49 95 ci 0 91 2 46 we also found a significant elevation in risk of gi associated with the activity category sports related contact 3 72 95 ci 1 31 10 60 and a smaller but significant elevation in risk of gi associated with sports related contact in the subgroup good water quality

the subgroup good water quality as inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies 3 5 level of water contact we analyzed the relationship between illness risk and level of water contact by calculating the pooled risk of gi and ri for different degrees of water contact regardless of the type of recreational activity underlying the water contact because a limited number of studies reported illness risk estimates related to water contact level we focused on pooled risk estimates for gi by combining all gi health outcomes and pooled risk estimates for ri by combining all ri health outcomes fig 9 shows water contact related pooled risk estimates using no contact as the reference group for all gi outcomes combined top and all ri outcomes combined bottom the figure presents pooled risk estimates for categories of water contact that studies explicitly described swallowing water head immersion body immersion face splashing sand contact and for categories of water contact that studies did not explicitly define but we could infer from information provided in each study unspecified direct contact and unspecified indirect contact see 2 materials and methods we found elevation in risk of gi for all water contact categories with the magnitude of gi risk generally following the extent of water contact the top half of fig 9 shows a significant elevation in risk of gi

category unspecified direct contact 2 28 95 ci 1 74 2 99 and a smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk of gi associated with the water contact category unspecified indirect contact 1 27 95 ci 0 74 2 99 to provide a general assessment of the association between level of water contact and gi risk we combined all data we considered direct water contact into the general water contact category all direct contact and all data we considered indirect water contact into the general water contact category all indirect contact and calculated separate pooled risk estimates for all gi outcomes combined and all ri outcomes combined for each general water contact category we found a significant elevation in risk of gi associated with the water contact category all direct contact 2 23 95 ci 1 88 2 65 and a smaller nonsignificant elevation in risk of gi associated with the water contact category all indirect contact 1 27 95 ci 0 74 2 16 the bottom half of fig 9 shows the pooled risk estimates of ri with different levels of water contact generally followed the same pattern as gi except for the water contact category swallowing water we observed a significant elevation in risk of ri associated

children versus adults we evaluated differences in risk of illness for children and adults by calculating pooled risk estimates for children and adults separately thirty six studies meeting our inclusion criteria reported risk estimates for specific participant ages age ranges or age categories fig 10 shows the pooled risk estimates using no contact as the reference for two health outcome categories all gi outcomes combined and all ri outcomes combined and stratified into the two subgroups children and adults because a limited number of studies reported illness risk estimates related to age we focused on pooled risk estimates for gi by combining all gi health outcomes and pooled risk estimates for ri by combining all ri health outcomes for the activity category swimming which is the activity category with the greatest amount of data we found a significant elevation in risk of gi for the age subgroup children 2 53 95 ci 1 41 4 55 and a smaller significant elevation in risk for the age subgroup adults 1 81 95 ci 1 35 2 43 although both pooled risk estimates are significantly greater than 1 they are not significantly different from each other we found no increase in risk of ri for the age subgroup children 0 97 95 ci 0 69 1 37 and a nonsignificant elevation in risk of ri for the age subgroup adults 1 58 95 ci 0 69 3 60 3 6 2 other health outcomes about one half 45 92 of the studies meeting our inclusion criteria reported at least one risk estimate for health outcomes other than gi or ri we categorized these health outcomes of secondary interest as morbidities related to skin ent eyes and cold flu see table 3 and performed meta analysis on all available data we performed meta analysis on the activity category swimming and water contact categories body immersion head immersion and swallowing water because they were the only categories with data related to health outcomes of secondary interest in most cases we found a moderate elevation in risk for health outcome categories skin ent eye and cold flu fig 11 shows the pooled risk estimates for these 4 health outcome categories we observed a significant elevation in risk for the health outcome category skin associated with the activity category swimming 2 37 95 ci 1 77 3 17 and water contact categories body immersion 1 68 95 ci 1 03 2 75 head immersion 2 79 95 ci 1 48 5 27 and swallowing water 1 51

category swimming 1 60 95 ci 1 03 2 47 and nonsignificant elevations in risk for the water contact categories head immersion 1 59 95 ci 0 74 3 38 and swallowing water 1 08 95 ci 0 85 1 36 we found no elevation in risk for the health outcome cold flu associated with the water contact category body immersion 0 86 95 ci 0 61 1 22 although we deemed this result inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies 4 discussion this is the first systematic review and meta analysis comparing the risk of illness associated with different categories of recreational activities and different levels of contact with ambient surface waters our meta analysis confirms a strong association between swimming and both gi and ri swimming approximately doubles the risk of gi and increases the risk of ri by approximately 75 compared to no contact controls this result is consistent with previous meta analyses exclusively for swimming showing a strong relationship between swimming and gi leonard et al 2018 wade et al 2003 and between swimming and ri mannocci et al 2016 our meta analysis is also consistent with previous meta analyses exclusively for swimming showing an association between swimming and skin related health outcomes yau et al 2009 this consistency is likely due to the relatively large body of scientific literature on the risk of illness associated with swimming in contrast to previous meta analyses exclusively for swimming our meta analysis additionally suggests differences in risk of illness associated with recreational activities that correspond to the likelihood of water ingestion during recreation we categorized recreational activities such as canoeing kayaking rowing boating fishing standup paddle boarding or rafting when those activities occur in relatively tranquil waters as minimal contact and activities such as surfing diving snorkeling windsurfing or canoeing kayaking or rafting in relatively rough waters as sports related contact we found an elevation in the risk of gi associated with minimal contact activities compared to a no contact reference that was less than the risk of gi associated with swimming these results are consistent with studies suggesting that people who canoe kayak fish motorboat or row are less likely to ingest ambient water than swimmers dorevitch et al 2011 we found an elevation in risk of gi associated with sports related contact that was greater than the risk of gi associated with swimming although publication bias may be contributing to our higher risk estimate these results suggest that activity intensity may be an important determinant of exposure to water borne pathogens and risk of illness ingestion of water and subsequent risk of gi are presumed to be lower during minimal contact recreation still it is expected that there is some degree of risk of acquiring illness through these activities inadvertent immersion can result in whole body contact and splashing can lead to a variety of water contact scenarios illnesses affecting the skin and perhaps the mucous membranes of the eyes and ears may be of relatively greater importance for minimal contact recreation usepa 2003 although the results of our meta analysis of the secondary health outcomes skin ent eye and cold flu suggests an elevation in risk with swimming and high levels of water contact we could not calculate risk estimates for minimal contact or low levels of water contact for these health outcomes because none of the studies meeting our inclusion criteria contained relevant data the precise risk of illness with activities we categorize as minimal contact is likely to be dependent on the potential for water contact during the specific activity we found no conclusive evidence of a risk of ri associated with minimal contact activities compared to no contact controls although the pooled risk estimates of ri for minimal contact were derived from only two studies our results suggest the risk of ri is low during minimal contact activities and is lower than the risk associated with swimming on the one hand the results for ri are counterintuitive because ri presumably involves inhalation exposure of sprays or aerosols that could also occur during minimal contact activities on the other hand we define minimal contact activities as occurring on relatively tranquil waters where spray or aerosol generation may be less likely compared to waters where participants engaged in swimming or sports related contact activities and where rough water or breaking waves may result in more spray or aerosols we separately estimated the risk of illnesses associated with recreational activities that are generally not characterized as swimming but nonetheless have a high degree of water contact we categorized activities such as surfing windsurfing whitewater canoeing whitewater kayaking whitewater rafting diving and snorkeling as sports related contact we evaluated the risk of illness associated with this category of recreational activities separately because they are not commonly recognized as swimming but have the potential for similar or even greater exposure than the activities we categorized as swimming our results suggest the risk of gi associated with activities we categorize as sports related contact is the same or greater than the risk of illness associated with swimming several outbreaks of gi and other illnesses have been associated with swimming during sports events such as triathlons which may occur in unmonitored or unregulated waterbodies such as rivers or canals with the potential for poor water quality davis and cdc 1998 hall et al 2017 harder lauridsen et al 2013 parkkali et al 2017 our meta analysis of gi risk stratified by water quality is consistent with greater gi risk in poor water quality conditions our estimates of gi risk associated with different levels of water contact are consistent with the pattern of gi risk we found associated with different categories of recreational activities among explicitly defined levels of water contact we found greater gi risk associated with levels of contact with a high probability of water ingestion body immersion head immersion and swallowing water compared to contact with lower probability of water ingestion sand contact and face splashing we also found greater risk of gi associated with direct contact all direct contact compared to indirect contact all indirect contact these results are consistent with the occurrence of gi as associated with the amount of self reported water exposure dorevitch et al 2012b furthermore the level of gi risk associated with body immersion head immersion and swallowing water are quantitatively similar suggesting that body immersion alone may be enough to put recreators at significant risk of gi this conclusion is consistent with a sensitivity analysis in leonard et al 2018 that reported the pooled risk of illness associated with any definition of swimming and the pooled risk of illness associated with swimming defined as including head immersion are not significantly different from each other the pooled risk estimates for ri generally followed the same pattern as gi we found the highest risk of ri associated with swimming and sports related contact whereas we found little or no elevation in risk for minimal contact however we considered the pooled risk estimates for ri associated with minimal contact as inconclusive because it was derived from fewer than 3 studies although our meta analysis includes 92 individual studies it is nonetheless limited by the relatively small number of available studies with estimates of illness risk associated with activities we categorized as minimal contact and sports related contact most studies meeting our inclusion criteria focused on swimming because regulatory entities are primarily concerned with protecting beachgoers from human fecal pollution in designated recreational waters where swimming is the most likely activity assessments of illness risk associated with swimming will likely continue to receive most research funding because it represents the largest at risk population however increasing recognition of illness risk associated with non swimming recreational activities and interest in developing water quality guidelines specifically designed to protect recreators engaged in those activities may prompt additional studies of non swimming activities our study was also limited by a lack of available data to adequately account for effect modifiers such as water quality duration and frequency of water contact age type of surface water i e marine or fresh source of contamination e g point versus non point naturally occurring organisms that can cause human illness and heterogeneity in the way those effect modifiers are defined across studies most studies meeting our inclusion criteria either did not specify those parameters did not stratify participants on the basis of those parameters or did so in a manner that was difficult to categorize for meta analysis for example defining children across a broad age range could potentially obscure elevated risk in young children greater attention to water quality and recreator age are relatively simple parameters that could provide important information on the risks associated with water based recreation 5 conclusions recreational activities associated with less ambient water contact e g fishing boating or kayaking in tranquil waters may result in a lower risk of illness compared to recreational activities associated with greater ambient water contact e g swimming surfing or whitewater kayaking this study suggests that the level of exposure with different types of recreational activities are important characteristics when assessing the risk of illness associated with recreation in ambient surface waters declaration of competing interest the
