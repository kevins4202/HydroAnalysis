16225,although urban wetlands are key transition sub ecosystems connecting urban microplastic pollution sources to freshwater environments few studies have reported microplastic migration characteristics in urban wetlands recent studies have only focused on the occurrence of microplastics in wetlands thus this study investigated the occurrence of microplastics in sources and sinks surface water sediment effluent and agricultural waste and analyzed the migration characteristics of microplastics in a typical urban wetland namely the huixian wetland guilin the abundance of microplastics was in the ranges of 16 5 89 0 items l 16 8 103 52 8 103 items kg and 172 0 605 0 items l in the surface water sediment and effluent respectively most of the microplastic settlement at 1 2 km downstream of the source of pollution in this wetland presented with a total decrease of 53 7 61 4 for microplastics in the surface water whereas microplastics of smaller sizes 100 500 µm were retained more in surface water than the smallest 50 100 µm and large 500 5000 µm microplastics clustering analysis and principal component analysis showed that effluent was the major source of microplastics in the urban section of this wetland and agricultural wastes also played a role in the suburbs this first quantification of small sized 50 500 µm microplastic removal throughout an urban wetland provides key reference information for controlling the environmental risk of microplastics in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban wetland source sink analysis subduction migration behavior size effect 1 introduction microplastics 1 5000 μm are excellent carriers of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants with ubiquitous occurrence and potential ecological risks making them a global environmental issue brennecke et al 2016 galloway et al 2017 the migration and transformation of microplastics in various environmental media have attracted extensive attention and their environmental behavior in aqueous environmental systems is a current research hotspot alimi et al 2018 coppock et al 2021 the pollution sources occurrence and environmental fate of microplastics in lakes oceans and rivers have been extensively investigated wang et al 2019 amrutha et al 2020 brennecke et al 2016 lakes are also contaminated with microplastics under the influence of intensive human activities and are considered to be a major sink for microplastics in freshwater systems yuan et al 2019 xiong et al 2018 wang et al 2019 microplastics are widely distributed in the ocean and accumulate in the ocean circulation belt which is widely considered to be the ultimate sink for microplastics cózar et al 2014 the marine environment from the coastline and high seas to deep seas is the focus region of microplastic research in which the environmental behavior of microplastics has been extensively investigated coppock et al 2021 cozzolino et al 2020 rivers are the primary channel for microplastic transport from terrestrial pollution sources to the marine environment which entrains millions of tons of plastic debris into the ocean each year eo et al 2019 lebreton et al 2017 mai et al 2020 however a large number of microplastics derived from effluent discharge blair et al 2019 and agricultural activities huang et al 2020 move through freshwater ecosystems such as urban wetlands and natural rivers to complete land sea transport amrutha et al 2020 liu et al 2019 lasee et al 2017 as transition zones for substance exchange between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems wetlands may be essential in the environmental migration processes of microplastics liu et al 2019 however few studies have mentioned the role of wetlands and research has mostly focused on coastal wetlands such as estuaries and intertidal zones gray et al 2018 lourenco et al 2017 as expected these coastal wetlands have been investigated for the accumulation of microplastics under favorable settling conditions caused by intensive aquatic plants and low flow velocity currents however little is known about the environmental behavior of microplastics in urban wetlands ryan et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 urban wetlands are key passages for urban microplastics entering bulk aquatic environments from wastewater treatment facilities blair et al 2019 these facilities as main recipients of microplastics from towns remain a significant source of microplastics in the aquatic environment because of large amounts of effluent with high concentrations ranging from 4 2 104 to 4 6 109 plastic particles day mintenig et al 2017 kay et al 2018 thus urban wetlands are pivotal nodes for microplastic transport in the global ecosystem in addition except for mega cities such as shanghai and new york there are also frequent agricultural activities in most urban wetlands which also cause microplastic pollution owing to agricultural wastes huang et al 2020 kim et al 2021 urban wetlands often characterized by abundant plants slow water flow and humus rich sediments are an ideal region for intercepting trapping and storing microplastics and they also act as the primary potential barrier that hinders the long range transport of microplastics from urban regions to aquatic environments qian et al 2021 ryan et al 2020 martin et al 2019 nevertheless although urban wetlands have great potential to abate terrestrial microplastics liu et al 2019 sarkar et al 2021 to our knowledge quantitative information in this field remains scarce therefore in this study the huixian wetland in guilin china was chosen as a typical urban wetland to investigate the source sink characteristics of microplastics in this type of aquatic environment the objectives were 1 to understand the occurrence characteristics of microplastics such as abundance size and polymer type in surface water and sediment along rivers in urban wetlands 2 to identify the main sources of microplastic pollution in this urban wetland 3 to preliminarily explore the abatement effect and migration hindrance mechanism of microplastics in urban wetlands river type and lake type 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the huixian wetland a typical urban wetland in guilin guangxi china is the largest karst wetland in china and has an important regulatory function in the ecological environment of the li river basin the region is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an average annual temperature ranging from 16 5 to 20 5 c and average annual precipitation of 1917 0 mm in this region approximately 77 7 of the annual rainfall occurs in the spring and summer resulting in an obvious alternation between the rainy season march august and the dry season september february the main water system in the wetland comprises the ancient guiliu canal xiangsi river and mudong lake fig 1 in this study samples were collected from the huixian wetland in october 2019 dry season and 22 sampling sites table s1 were established along the wetland rivers fig 1 with both surface water w and sediment s collected at the same site in addition we collected effluent samples from 11 wastewater treatment facilities near the wetland table s2 which were labeled p e for samples from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and s e for samples from wastewater treatment stations wwtss simplified wwtps nine samples of agricultural plastics were collected from riverbanks and farmland along rivers in the agricultural areas based on the population density and anthropogenic activity in the huixian wetlands the sampling sites were further divided into four subsections a1 urban area a2 agricultural area a3 agritourism area and a4 urban area a1 a2 and a4 belong to the river type wetland and a3 is a lake type wetland that has more intensive plants than those of the former three detailed sampling site information is provided in supplementary information si 2 2 sample collection and pretreatment surface water samples volume of 15 l flow rate of 7 5 l min were collected from 0 to 15 cm below the water surface using a portable pump cnl 02 chnonli china in triplicate the collected water samples were filtered with a stainless steel screen 50 μm to preconcentrate the microplastics on the screen the material retained on the sieve was backwashed with ultrapure water into a brown glass bottle 500 ml followed by the addition of the formaldehyde solution 8 ml and then the bottle was sealed with aluminum foil triplicate effluent samples volume of 5 l flow rate of 7 5 l min were collected at the effluent outlet of the wastewater treatment facility using the same portable pump with the same pretreatment methods used for surface water sediment samples were collected at a depth of 0 5 cm in triplicate using a column sampler samples were wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in sealed plastic bags which were then transferred from the field to the laboratory in the laboratory the sediments were air dried at ambient temperature 19 28 c the air dried samples were transferred to a new aluminum foil bag for preservation before microplastic separation 2 3 separation and extraction of microplastics first large debris was removed from the preconcentrated water samples surface water and effluent by filtration with a stainless steel screen 5000 μm then the microplastics in the filtrate were retained on a stainless steel screen 50 μm the formaldehyde solution was washed away with ultrapure water followed by backwashing with 100 ml ultrapure water and the microplastic from the sieve into a 200 ml beaker next the samples were oxidatively digested with 100 ml of 30 h2o2 solution at room temperature 19 28 c in the dark for 24 h to completely eliminate the organic components attached to the microplastic surface finally the digested solution was enriched on a polycarbonate filter membrane 25 mm diameter 10 μm pore size whatman uk with a vacuum extraction pump and dried in an oven at 35 c for 24 h the procedure for the isolation and extraction of microplastics from sediments was consistent with the method described by xia et al 2021 the detailed procedure is described in the supplementary information si 2 4 identification of microplastics the analytical methods used in this study are consistent with those reported by xia et al 2021 microplastics on the filter membrane were stained with 0 001 g l nile red methanol solution 95 aladdin china and quantified using laser confocal microscopy revolution xd andorra uk fig s1 the particles were classified into six categories based on the sizes of their maximum lengths 50 100 100 200 200 500 500 1000 1000 2000 and 2000 5000 μm all available microplastics were selected with tweezers and labeled under a stereomicroscope xtl 165 lt phmias china and the polymer types pe polyethylene pp polypropylene ps polystyrene pvc polyvinyl chloride and pa polyamide table s3 of the labeled microplastics fig s2 were identified by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy nicolet is10 pe usa the microplastics were washed with ethanol to remove the interference of nile red methanol dye before ftir analysis subsequently the microscopic morphology and surface elemental composition of the microplastics were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope combined with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer jsm 7900f jeol japan additional details are provided in the supplementary information si 2 5 validation tests to validate the reliability of the fluorescence based protocol we measured the recovery of standard microplastics spiked recoveries and negative control of organism debris from surface water five types of polymers pe pp pvc ps and pa were selected as the standard microplastics for the recovery tests fig s3 pp film 402 2 538 3 μm and pa fibers 198 8 424 9 μm were made by ourselves and the other three pe particle of 268 7 481 2 μm pvc particles of 149 3 219 7 μm ps fragments of 295 8 625 0 μm were purchased from sigma usa table s4 after adding 100 standard microplastics with 20 of each polymer into 1 l of ultrapure water the microplastics in the mixed liquor were treated dyed and quantified using the same procedure as that previously mentioned for the preconcentrated water sample the recovery rate of standard microplastics in ultrapure water was 96 00 16 00 n 3 two water samples w10 5 l surface water p e1 1 l effluent and two sediment samples w10 and w11 1 0 kg wet weight approximately 20 g after oven drying were collected again and at each site sampling was repeated six times to form two groups with triplicate samples in each group in one group 100 standard microplastics with 20 of each polymer were added to each sample while no microplastics were added to the other group as the control the treatment and quantification procedure for each sample was consistent with that of the pre concentrated water sample and sediment described in section 2 3 the spiked recovery rates of microplastics were 88 0 21 2 n 3 90 7 39 5 n 3 and 72 0 8 0 74 67 25 8 n 3 for surface water w10 effluent p e1 and sediment samples w10 w11 respectively after being collected from the surface water near the effluent p e1 and oven dried 0 49 g organism debris was digested twice with 200 ml 30 h2o2 solution stained with 0 001 g l nile red methanol solution 95 aladdin china and finally observed under a fluorescence microscope most of the dyed debris was not identified which showed negligible interference in microplastic quantification fig s4 details of the validation tests are described in the supplementary information si 2 6 quality control quality control procedures during the experiments were performed following the protocol described by xia et al 2021 the abundance of microplastics in the blank controls of surface water sediment and effluent was 8 0 6 0 items l 2 0 2 0 items kg and 4 0 1 0 items l respectively which were subtracted during the subsequent calculation of microplastic abundance 2 7 statistical analysis and mapping microsoft office excel 2010 microsoft usa spss 19 0 ibm usa image j v1 8 0 nih usa and r r studio usa were used for statistical analysis arcgis 10 esri usa was used to map the geographic locations and sampling sites in the huixian wetland 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and distribution of microplastic in the huixian wetland 3 1 1 abundance microplastics were detected in all surface waters and sediments of the huixian wetland figs 2 a 2b the abundance of microplastics in surface waters ranged from 16 5 4 4 to 89 0 14 2 items l with a mean value of 41 8 4 8 items l the minimum and maximum values were observed at w15 and w22 respectively in the sediments the abundance of microplastic ranged from 16 8 14 0 103 to 52 8 5 1 103 items kg with an average value of 30 4 5 2 103 items kg whereas the minimum value occurred at s12 and the maximum value at s2 we observed a relatively higher abundance of microplastics by 1 2 orders of magnitude in both surface waters and sediments than reported results table s4 which may be explained by the differences in identification methods and threshold values 50 μm xia et al 2021 along the rivers the microplastic abundance in surface water decreased rapidly within 1 2 km downstream w2 w5 of the wwtp and then remained stable for a longer distance w7 w13 this indicates that easily settleable particles from the effluents settle rapidly within this short distance and other microplastics migrate farther downstream with water flow the abundance of microplastics in the sediments has a similar spatial variation trend to that of surface water with peaks following effluent input and then a gradual decline along the direction of river flow generally the further the distance from the town center the lower the abundance of microplastics in the surface water and some specific rural pollution sources or hydrodynamic conditions could change the trends at several sites which were attributed to tributary inflows and pollution from agricultural wastes seo et al 2020 kim et al 2021 urban subsections a1 and a4 are hotspots for microplastic pollution followed by suburban ones a3 and a2 which always occur in urban or local suburban areas because of the high intensity of human activity which causes a large value of microplastic abundance in wetlands in the eastern a3 region which has denser villages and wharves microplastic abundance in surface water was significantly higher than that in the western a3 region in rural areas far from towns a2 plastic waste from agricultural activities and rural communities at some sites such as w6 and w11 influenced the spatial distribution of microplastics in the wetland huang et al 2020 resulting in high levels of microplastic abundance in surface waters and sediments the relatively high abundance of microplastics in sediments that remain in a3 may be associated with the enclosed character of lake type wetlands ryan et al 2020 because of a semi enclosed dam located downstream of s15 which impedes the riverine transport of microplastics and enriches microplastics in lake sediments especially in the dry season ryan et al 2020 3 1 2 particle size distribution of microplastics in our study both surface waters and sediments were dominated by small sized microplastics 50 500 μm figs 3 a 3b and the proportion of most microplastics in surface water in suburban areas was slightly lower than that in urban areas fig s5 higher percentages of small sized microplastics were observed in the present study which were 90 6 and 84 0 for the surface water and sediment respectively fig s6 than the results reported in the literature table s5 in addition the proportions of smaller sized microplastics 100 500 μm in surface waters were higher than those in sediments whereas the smallest 50 100 µm and large microplastics 500 5000 µm were more likely to accumulate in sediments with a decrease in the microplastic size there was an exponential increase in the abundance of 100 5000 μm microplastics in both surface waters and sediments fig s7 which is different from the linear growth pattern reported by teng et al 2020 in general larger sized microplastics tend to settle during the conveying of surface water which reduces their abundance in surface waters for example for ps and pvc 10 mm particles take only 0 016 0 23 min to sink to 40 m whereas 100 μm and 1 μm particles need 0 1 1 6 days and 2 8 43 years respectively merel et al 2017 however there is a complete reversal of microplastic abundance in surface water and sediment when the microplastic size was less than 100 μm 50 100 μm in which sediments had a higher proportion of microplastics in this size range than surface waters which may be related to heterogeneous aggregation upward fluctuation and hyporheic exchange of microplastics in this size range in surface waters galloway et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 extracellular polymers can promote heterogeneous aggregation between microorganisms and small sized microplastics mao et al 2018 gigault et al 2018 thereby enhancing their downward settlement away from the shallow water layer of surface waters 0 15 cm in addition two reports have shown that microplastics less than 100 μm in size can easily be captured by hydrophobic substances such as grease and microbubbles in the water column to make them move upward so et al 2018 kalčíková et al 2017 substantial amounts of small sized microplastics 50 500 μm were found in the sediments which may have been caused by the retention effect of the hyporheic exchange which can force water to carry small sized microplastics into or out of the sediment pore interface drummond et al 2020 the wetland sediments collected in this study were composed of fine silt with anaerobic black organic debris and were likely to trap or capture more small sized particles of less than 100 μm into the sediments by hyporheic exchange 3 1 3 morphological characteristics microplastics of 200 5000 μm on the filter membrane were selected for subsequent morphological analysis using a stereomicroscope fig 4 a because of methodological limitations observing microplastics smaller than 200 μm under a somatic microscope as well as polymer identification of these microplastic particles are still a formidable challenge burns et al 2018 thus the selected microplastics in this study were commonly in the range of 200 5000 μm which is somewhat different from those with a size range of 500 5000 μm based on visual classification methods to quantify microplastics reported in several previous studies amrutha et al 2020 ding et al 2019 most of the selected microplastics were of three shapes fiber film and fragment among which fiber was dominant fig 6a the decomposition of agricultural waste and discharge of washing wastewater probably contributed to the high proportion of fiber kim et al 2021 li et al 2018b scanning electron microscopy images figs 4b 4d show that there were breakages cracks and even tears on the surface of the microplastics implying that the microplastics have aged to some extent under various environmental conditions on the microplastic surface there were inorganic nonmetallic elements such as c o b and si as well as several metallic elements such as al fe ca zr and pt figs 4b 4d and this composition is similar to that of the liangfeng river from xia et al 2021 3 1 4 polymer types the polymer types of microplastics in the huixian wetland were all dominated by pe and pp figs 5 a 5b and there were significant geographical differences under the effect of human activities in the surface waters pe and pp had the highest proportions of 37 6 and 24 7 respectively followed by pvc 15 3 pa 11 8 and ps 10 6 and 32 2 23 0 18 4 14 9 and 11 5 for pe pp pvc pa and ps in the sediments respectively the higher proportions of pe and pp were associated with their wide range of daily use additionally the higher proportions of pe and pp in surface waters than those in sediments indicate that pe and pp are more likely to migrate in surface water because their densities are lower in contrast the proportions of pa ps and pvc were significantly lower in surface water samples which may be related to their higher relative densities and therefore faster settling in the water sediment system the suburban areas a2 and a3 had significantly higher proportions of pe and pp than the urban areas a1 and a4 which may be attributed to the input of agricultural plastic wastes containing high amounts of pe and pp such as mulch films woven bags and fishing nets wang et al 2019 3 2 pollution sources of microplastics in urban wetlands 3 2 1 microplastic characteristics the abundance of microplastics in effluents ranged from 172 0 10 5 to 605 0 48 6 items l with the minimum value observed at s e8 and the maximum value at p e1 fig 2c microplastic abundance in wwtp effluents 501 0 605 0 items l was higher than that in wwts effluents 172 0 387 0 items l which was attributed to the more intensive discharge of small sized microplastics 50 500 μm from wwtps considering the more diverse input of microplastics into municipal wastewater in urban areas it is reasonable that more small sized microplastics occur in the wwtp effluent even though wwtps have better treatment techniques than wwtss wei et al 2020 in addition the microplastic abundance in the effluents reported in this study was of an order of magnitude higher than that reported in most studies table s4 which may be attributed to the differences in identification methodologies as mentioned previously in section 3 1 1 in this study the majority of microplastics in the effluent were observed to be in the range of 50 500 μm accounting for 90 8 fig 3c which was similar to the results reported by jiang et al 2020 interestingly the abundance of microplastics with particle sizes less than 100 μm in the effluent was significantly lower a possible explanation is that small sized microplastics of 50 100 μm are more easily captured by activated sludge and thus trapped in the sludge franco et al 2021 kalčíková et al 2017 this is consistent with the results of jiang et al 2020 who observed that 63 7 74 1 of microplastics detected in sludge were in the range of 20 100 μm compared to those in surface waters the types of microplastics in effluents were still dominated by pe 28 7 and pp 24 1 but the percentages of pa and ps increased significantly to 18 4 and 12 6 respectively which may be attributed to the large amount of washing wastewater containing clothing fibers and industrial plastics in domestic wastewater li et al 2018b among these nine agricultural plastic samples mulch films were identified as pe two samples and pp one sample and fishing nets woven bags farm floats plastic bottles fishing lines and clothing fibers as pe pp ps pvc pa and pa respectively the polymer types of agricultural plastic wastes matched those in the surface waters and sediments of the huixian wetland implying that agricultural plastic wastes could also be another important source of microplastics in wetland systems kim et al 2021 martin et al 2019 the widely discarded pp pe wastes are potential contributors to the high proportions of pe and pp in the suburban surface water in this study 3 2 2 pollution source analysis in this study we used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to identify potential sources of microplastics in wetlands and the results are shown in figs 6 c 6g figs 6c and 6d depict the effects of sample sites on the abundance of microplastics with different particle sizes and polymer types respectively in both principal component analysis models two components were sufficient to explain the majority of the datum variation 72 5 for the former and 65 4 for the latter according to the eigenvectors of the samples pc 1 was mainly associated with effluent discharge whereas pc 2 was speculated to be affected by a combination of agricultural plastic wastes and hydrodynamic conditions in general wetlands in urban areas are mostly affected by microplastic pollution from effluent discharge whereas suburb samples are subject to effluent discharge combined with agricultural source input cluster analysis showed that pe and pp in the surface water sediments and effluent formed a cluster in terms of similarity whereas pa and ps formed a distinct cluster combined with pvc figs 6e 6g a similar cluster structure of the polymers was formed in the surface water sediments and effluent implying that effluent discharge was the leading source of microplastic pollution in this wetland system wang et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 in addition pearson correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between microplastic abundance in surface water and sediment as well as between each of them and the effluents fig s8 therefore discharged effluent as a point source is the main microplastic source input in the huixian wetlands and agricultural waste as a non point source input is a sub factor affecting the distribution of microplastics in urban wetlands in densely populated urban areas wwtp effluent comprises the major input of microplastics to urban wetlands whereas effluents combined with agricultural sources affect microplastic pollution in urban wetlands located in sparsely populated areas areas slightly farther downstream from wwtps a1 and a4 are hotspots for microplastic pollution in the urban wetland followed by areas adjacent to wwtss a3 and the distant suburban area a2 in sequence which is closely associated with the distribution of the population fig 7 garcés ordóñez et al 2019 also found that a higher abundance of microplastics was detected in mangrove wetlands closer to population centers wastewater treatment facilities are crucial in the transfer of urban microplastics from human activities to the bulk aquatic environment jiang et al 2020 for the urban wetland subsection far from these wwtps a2 and a3 agricultural wastes derived from agricultural activities become a non ignorable microplastic source long term agricultural production has resulted in the accumulation of plastic waste debris in surface soil and the formation of terrestrial sourced microplastics that can enter surface water via surface runoff huang et al 2020 lasee et al 2017 plastic products frequently used during aquaculture production also affect the abundance size distribution and polymer types of microplastics in urban wetlands li et al 2018a in addition macroplastics retained by plant inter root networks and sediments may disintegrate under sustained environmental stress rose et al 2019 which is a potential source of microplastic contamination in wetland systems 3 3 microplastic migration characteristics and retardation mechanisms in urban wetlands 3 3 1 migration characteristics the abundance of microplastics in the surface water and sediment in this study gradually decreased along the river flow direction with overall reduction rates of 53 7 61 4 through each subsection and part of the microplastics in the surface water basically completed the vertical migration within 1 2 km downstream of the point sources in the two river type sub wetlands a1 a2 and a4 microplastic abundance in the surface water declined by 61 2 and 53 7 respectively whereas that of the typical lake type subwetland was 61 4 a3 the worse abatement in the a4 sub wetland than that in the a1 a2 sub wetland was attributed to the shorter settling time caused by the shorter river length in a4 hence a longer river transport distance is considered to benefit the abatement of microplastics from surface water in urban wetlands even though a3 and a4 have similar river transport distances microplastic removal from surface water in a3 was significantly higher than that in a4 which implies that lake type wetlands can remove more microplastics from surface water to sediments than river type wetlands owing to the enhanced interception effect of lake type wetlands on microplastics qian et al 2021 studies have also found that coastal wetland systems such as salt marshes yao et al 2019 mangroves duan et al 2021 and tidal freshwater wetlands ryan et al 2020 are ideal sites for the interception and storage of microplastics or large plastic debris moreover in our study both large sized 500 5000 µm and small sized 50 500 µm microplastics had a significant abatement effect with removal ratios of 0 71 1 large sized and 52 0 65 2 small sized in surface water in this urban wetland fig 3a a recent report also showed that a natural wastewater treatment wetland system can remove approximately 50 of microplastics in the size range of 63 850 µm from raw wastewater sarkar et al 2021 to our knowledge our investigation is the first report of the abatement of small sized microplastics 50 500 µm in this wetland system which implies that urban wetland systems can be used as important ecological barriers to remove microplastics from relatively clean surface water more than raw wastewater migration processes and abatement are mediated mainly by a combination of settlement floatation and hyporheic exchange processes which are affected by their physicochemical properties such as density size surface electric charge and biofouling which can change the microparticle surface characteristics naji et al 2019 qian et al 2021 drummond et al 2020 wu et al 2020 merel et al 2017 whether microplastic particles float oscillate or settle is mainly determined by the difference in density between freshwater and microplastic particles merel et al 2017 low density microplastics pe and pp are more likely to float on the water surface or be suspended in the water column whereas high density microplastics ps pvc and pa are liable to settle into the sediment alimi et al 2018 moreover larger sized microplastics are more likely to settle into the sediment alimi et al 2018 whereas small sized microplastics easily cross plant pores for long distance river transport liu et al 2019 biofouling can also affect the microplastic migration process by changing the microplastic densities and sizes as has been observed in various aquatic environments fabienne et al 2016 merel et al 2017 wu et al 2020 furthermore the occurrence of shallow slopes at the river bottom can accelerate the accumulation of microplastics settling owing to collision and shallow sedimentation teng et al 2020 which is confirmed by the significant increase in microplastic abundance from s15 to s18 fig 2b high density hydrophytes significantly increased the proportions of large sized 500 5000 μm microplastics in the sediments s5 s7 and s15 s18 by plant interception in addition the migration process of different sized microplastics in the surface water in our study is not consistent with the pattern in the marine surface water cózar et al 2014 merel et al 2017 which is related to high intensity photogenic aging and stronger biofouling on the microplastic surfaces owing to the longer residence time in the ocean zhang et al 2019 enrichetti et al 2021 3 3 2 retardation mechanism the main mechanisms impeding microplastic transport in the surface water of urban wetlands include plankton capture aquatic plant retention and sediment adsorption qian et al 2021 martin et al 2019 li et al 2020 urban wetlands have richer nutrients and more active microbial communities than wetlands in remote areas because of the intensive human activity in urban areas which results in the discharge of large amounts of organics zhang et al 2015 large numbers of plankton can capture microplastics in the water column through adhesion heterogeneous aggregation and feeding behavior hindering the migration of microplastics along with the river flow merel et al 2017 moreover the abundant microorganisms in urban wetlands reinforce the biological effects in the environment causing stronger biofouling which has an adverse effect on the horizontal migration of microplastics enrichetti et al 2021 extracellular polymeric substances may also establish dense hydrogen bonds and electrostatic networks thereby inhibiting microplastic transport by promoting particle coagulation wu et al 2020 merel et al 2017 plant interception is considered a unique retardant factor in wetland ecosystems which limits both the horizontal and vertical migration of microplastics qian et al 2021 it has been proven that plants and their inter root networks have a high capacity to capture large sized microplastics in deep water columns to promote the accumulation of microplastics in sediments cozzolino et al 2020 unlike other open waters urban wetlands contain more diverse and denser aquatic plants that weaken the hydraulic disturbance of surface water such as hydraulic turbulence which results in a shortened horizontal migration distance of microplastics by facilitating their settlement in the water column mudd et al 2010 ryan et al 2020 xia et al 2021 this also makes urban wetlands more capable of capturing both large 500 5000 µm and small 50 500 µm microplastics which was proven by the significantly increased microplastic abundance in the sediments in areas with intensive aquatic plants in our study furthermore an interesting study reported that greater amounts of silt enhanced the ability of sediments to capture microplastics in a wetland li et al 2020 which probably occurs in urban wetlands with rich silt sediments as well as many humic substances and high microbial mass the same pattern has been observed in wetlands with rich silts where microplastics tend to accumulate in sediments during vertical migration seo et al 2020 in addition compared with urban wetlands wetlands away from cities usually have more open water relatively strong hydrodynamic conditions and relatively low plant densities ryan et al 2020 making microplastics more likely to pass through the wetland without being trapped especially for smaller sized microplastics moreover the mechanisms of microplastic retention in urban wetlands are significantly different from those in salt marshes and mangrove wetlands along the coastal zone which is closely related to topographic features current movements and tidal action yao et al 2019 duan et al 2021 martin et al 2019 although urban wetlands can gradually trap microplastics into their sediments the accumulated microplastics in the sediments also have potential environmental risks long term accumulation and plant interception represent the enormous potential of wetlands as microplastic sinks however even though urban wetlands are often located in flat areas with very slow flow rates and shallow water layers they are transferred into an important pollution source during storm events which often occur during the rainy season xia et al 2020 in the context of global climate change extreme rainstorm events occur more frequently than usual such as the once in a millennium rainfall event in china in july 2021 under these extreme weather events wetland sediments transiently switch from microplastic sinks to pollution sources driven by violent hydrodynamic disturbances qian et al 2021 resulting in large releases of microplastics from sediments to surface waters and rapid horizontal transport which pose risks to downstream aquatic ecosystems and drinking water sources 4 conclusions this study reports for the first time the source sink characteristics of microplastics and their migration behavior in a typical urban wetland 1 the abundance of microplastics dominated by those sized 50 500 µm were in the ranges of 16 0 89 0 items l 16 8 103 52 8 103 items kg and 172 0 605 0 items l in the surface waters sediments and effluents respectively smallest sized 50 100 µm and large sized 500 5000 µm microplastics were retained in wetland sediments whereas smaller sized 100 500 µm microplastics were present in surface waters the main shapes of the microplastics were fiber and the main polymer types were pe and pp 2 the huixian wetland not only has a good retention effect on large sized microplastics but also has a significant abatement effect on small sized microplastics in surface waters with a total of 53 7 61 4 of microplastics in surface waters settlement of microplastics in the easily settled portion of effluents was achieved within 1 2 km downstream of the pollution source and lake type wetlands were more effective than river type wetlands in abating terrestrial plastics 3 effluent discharge is the main source of microplastics in urban wetlands and agricultural waste is a secondary source urban wetlands retard the migration of microplastics in surface waters through a combination of enhanced gravitational settling microbial adhesion plant retention and sediment adsorption to better understand the functions and roles of urban wetlands in transferring and retarding microplastics more research on the seasonal variation in the occurrence and fate of microplastics in urban wetlands is required credit authorship contribution statement

16225,although urban wetlands are key transition sub ecosystems connecting urban microplastic pollution sources to freshwater environments few studies have reported microplastic migration characteristics in urban wetlands recent studies have only focused on the occurrence of microplastics in wetlands thus this study investigated the occurrence of microplastics in sources and sinks surface water sediment effluent and agricultural waste and analyzed the migration characteristics of microplastics in a typical urban wetland namely the huixian wetland guilin the abundance of microplastics was in the ranges of 16 5 89 0 items l 16 8 103 52 8 103 items kg and 172 0 605 0 items l in the surface water sediment and effluent respectively most of the microplastic settlement at 1 2 km downstream of the source of pollution in this wetland presented with a total decrease of 53 7 61 4 for microplastics in the surface water whereas microplastics of smaller sizes 100 500 µm were retained more in surface water than the smallest 50 100 µm and large 500 5000 µm microplastics clustering analysis and principal component analysis showed that effluent was the major source of microplastics in the urban section of this wetland and agricultural wastes also played a role in the suburbs this first quantification of small sized 50 500 µm microplastic removal throughout an urban wetland provides key reference information for controlling the environmental risk of microplastics in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban wetland source sink analysis subduction migration behavior size effect 1 introduction microplastics 1 5000 μm are excellent carriers of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants with ubiquitous occurrence and potential ecological risks making them a global environmental issue brennecke et al 2016 galloway et al 2017 the migration and transformation of microplastics in various environmental media have attracted extensive attention and their environmental behavior in aqueous environmental systems is a current research hotspot alimi et al 2018 coppock et al 2021 the pollution sources occurrence and environmental fate of microplastics in lakes oceans and rivers have been extensively investigated wang et al 2019 amrutha et al 2020 brennecke et al 2016 lakes are also contaminated with microplastics under the influence of intensive human activities and are considered to be a major sink for microplastics in freshwater systems yuan et al 2019 xiong et al 2018 wang et al 2019 microplastics are widely distributed in the ocean and accumulate in the ocean circulation belt which is widely considered to be the ultimate sink for microplastics cózar et al 2014 the marine environment from the coastline and high seas to deep seas is the focus region of microplastic research in which the environmental behavior of microplastics has been extensively investigated coppock et al 2021 cozzolino et al 2020 rivers are the primary channel for microplastic transport from terrestrial pollution sources to the marine environment which entrains millions of tons of plastic debris into the ocean each year eo et al 2019 lebreton et al 2017 mai et al 2020 however a large number of microplastics derived from effluent discharge blair et al 2019 and agricultural activities huang et al 2020 move through freshwater ecosystems such as urban wetlands and natural rivers to complete land sea transport amrutha et al 2020 liu et al 2019 lasee et al 2017 as transition zones for substance exchange between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems wetlands may be essential in the environmental migration processes of microplastics liu et al 2019 however few studies have mentioned the role of wetlands and research has mostly focused on coastal wetlands such as estuaries and intertidal zones gray et al 2018 lourenco et al 2017 as expected these coastal wetlands have been investigated for the accumulation of microplastics under favorable settling conditions caused by intensive aquatic plants and low flow velocity currents however little is known about the environmental behavior of microplastics in urban wetlands ryan et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 urban wetlands are key passages for urban microplastics entering bulk aquatic environments from wastewater treatment facilities blair et al 2019 these facilities as main recipients of microplastics from towns remain a significant source of microplastics in the aquatic environment because of large amounts of effluent with high concentrations ranging from 4 2 104 to 4 6 109 plastic particles day mintenig et al 2017 kay et al 2018 thus urban wetlands are pivotal nodes for microplastic transport in the global ecosystem in addition except for mega cities such as shanghai and new york there are also frequent agricultural activities in most urban wetlands which also cause microplastic pollution owing to agricultural wastes huang et al 2020 kim et al 2021 urban wetlands often characterized by abundant plants slow water flow and humus rich sediments are an ideal region for intercepting trapping and storing microplastics and they also act as the primary potential barrier that hinders the long range transport of microplastics from urban regions to aquatic environments qian et al 2021 ryan et al 2020 martin et al 2019 nevertheless although urban wetlands have great potential to abate terrestrial microplastics liu et al 2019 sarkar et al 2021 to our knowledge quantitative information in this field remains scarce therefore in this study the huixian wetland in guilin china was chosen as a typical urban wetland to investigate the source sink characteristics of microplastics in this type of aquatic environment the objectives were 1 to understand the occurrence characteristics of microplastics such as abundance size and polymer type in surface water and sediment along rivers in urban wetlands 2 to identify the main sources of microplastic pollution in this urban wetland 3 to preliminarily explore the abatement effect and migration hindrance mechanism of microplastics in urban wetlands river type and lake type 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the huixian wetland a typical urban wetland in guilin guangxi china is the largest karst wetland in china and has an important regulatory function in the ecological environment of the li river basin the region is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate with an average annual temperature ranging from 16 5 to 20 5 c and average annual precipitation of 1917 0 mm in this region approximately 77 7 of the annual rainfall occurs in the spring and summer resulting in an obvious alternation between the rainy season march august and the dry season september february the main water system in the wetland comprises the ancient guiliu canal xiangsi river and mudong lake fig 1 in this study samples were collected from the huixian wetland in october 2019 dry season and 22 sampling sites table s1 were established along the wetland rivers fig 1 with both surface water w and sediment s collected at the same site in addition we collected effluent samples from 11 wastewater treatment facilities near the wetland table s2 which were labeled p e for samples from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and s e for samples from wastewater treatment stations wwtss simplified wwtps nine samples of agricultural plastics were collected from riverbanks and farmland along rivers in the agricultural areas based on the population density and anthropogenic activity in the huixian wetlands the sampling sites were further divided into four subsections a1 urban area a2 agricultural area a3 agritourism area and a4 urban area a1 a2 and a4 belong to the river type wetland and a3 is a lake type wetland that has more intensive plants than those of the former three detailed sampling site information is provided in supplementary information si 2 2 sample collection and pretreatment surface water samples volume of 15 l flow rate of 7 5 l min were collected from 0 to 15 cm below the water surface using a portable pump cnl 02 chnonli china in triplicate the collected water samples were filtered with a stainless steel screen 50 μm to preconcentrate the microplastics on the screen the material retained on the sieve was backwashed with ultrapure water into a brown glass bottle 500 ml followed by the addition of the formaldehyde solution 8 ml and then the bottle was sealed with aluminum foil triplicate effluent samples volume of 5 l flow rate of 7 5 l min were collected at the effluent outlet of the wastewater treatment facility using the same portable pump with the same pretreatment methods used for surface water sediment samples were collected at a depth of 0 5 cm in triplicate using a column sampler samples were wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in sealed plastic bags which were then transferred from the field to the laboratory in the laboratory the sediments were air dried at ambient temperature 19 28 c the air dried samples were transferred to a new aluminum foil bag for preservation before microplastic separation 2 3 separation and extraction of microplastics first large debris was removed from the preconcentrated water samples surface water and effluent by filtration with a stainless steel screen 5000 μm then the microplastics in the filtrate were retained on a stainless steel screen 50 μm the formaldehyde solution was washed away with ultrapure water followed by backwashing with 100 ml ultrapure water and the microplastic from the sieve into a 200 ml beaker next the samples were oxidatively digested with 100 ml of 30 h2o2 solution at room temperature 19 28 c in the dark for 24 h to completely eliminate the organic components attached to the microplastic surface finally the digested solution was enriched on a polycarbonate filter membrane 25 mm diameter 10 μm pore size whatman uk with a vacuum extraction pump and dried in an oven at 35 c for 24 h the procedure for the isolation and extraction of microplastics from sediments was consistent with the method described by xia et al 2021 the detailed procedure is described in the supplementary information si 2 4 identification of microplastics the analytical methods used in this study are consistent with those reported by xia et al 2021 microplastics on the filter membrane were stained with 0 001 g l nile red methanol solution 95 aladdin china and quantified using laser confocal microscopy revolution xd andorra uk fig s1 the particles were classified into six categories based on the sizes of their maximum lengths 50 100 100 200 200 500 500 1000 1000 2000 and 2000 5000 μm all available microplastics were selected with tweezers and labeled under a stereomicroscope xtl 165 lt phmias china and the polymer types pe polyethylene pp polypropylene ps polystyrene pvc polyvinyl chloride and pa polyamide table s3 of the labeled microplastics fig s2 were identified by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy nicolet is10 pe usa the microplastics were washed with ethanol to remove the interference of nile red methanol dye before ftir analysis subsequently the microscopic morphology and surface elemental composition of the microplastics were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope combined with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer jsm 7900f jeol japan additional details are provided in the supplementary information si 2 5 validation tests to validate the reliability of the fluorescence based protocol we measured the recovery of standard microplastics spiked recoveries and negative control of organism debris from surface water five types of polymers pe pp pvc ps and pa were selected as the standard microplastics for the recovery tests fig s3 pp film 402 2 538 3 μm and pa fibers 198 8 424 9 μm were made by ourselves and the other three pe particle of 268 7 481 2 μm pvc particles of 149 3 219 7 μm ps fragments of 295 8 625 0 μm were purchased from sigma usa table s4 after adding 100 standard microplastics with 20 of each polymer into 1 l of ultrapure water the microplastics in the mixed liquor were treated dyed and quantified using the same procedure as that previously mentioned for the preconcentrated water sample the recovery rate of standard microplastics in ultrapure water was 96 00 16 00 n 3 two water samples w10 5 l surface water p e1 1 l effluent and two sediment samples w10 and w11 1 0 kg wet weight approximately 20 g after oven drying were collected again and at each site sampling was repeated six times to form two groups with triplicate samples in each group in one group 100 standard microplastics with 20 of each polymer were added to each sample while no microplastics were added to the other group as the control the treatment and quantification procedure for each sample was consistent with that of the pre concentrated water sample and sediment described in section 2 3 the spiked recovery rates of microplastics were 88 0 21 2 n 3 90 7 39 5 n 3 and 72 0 8 0 74 67 25 8 n 3 for surface water w10 effluent p e1 and sediment samples w10 w11 respectively after being collected from the surface water near the effluent p e1 and oven dried 0 49 g organism debris was digested twice with 200 ml 30 h2o2 solution stained with 0 001 g l nile red methanol solution 95 aladdin china and finally observed under a fluorescence microscope most of the dyed debris was not identified which showed negligible interference in microplastic quantification fig s4 details of the validation tests are described in the supplementary information si 2 6 quality control quality control procedures during the experiments were performed following the protocol described by xia et al 2021 the abundance of microplastics in the blank controls of surface water sediment and effluent was 8 0 6 0 items l 2 0 2 0 items kg and 4 0 1 0 items l respectively which were subtracted during the subsequent calculation of microplastic abundance 2 7 statistical analysis and mapping microsoft office excel 2010 microsoft usa spss 19 0 ibm usa image j v1 8 0 nih usa and r r studio usa were used for statistical analysis arcgis 10 esri usa was used to map the geographic locations and sampling sites in the huixian wetland 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and distribution of microplastic in the huixian wetland 3 1 1 abundance microplastics were detected in all surface waters and sediments of the huixian wetland figs 2 a 2b the abundance of microplastics in surface waters ranged from 16 5 4 4 to 89 0 14 2 items l with a mean value of 41 8 4 8 items l the minimum and maximum values were observed at w15 and w22 respectively in the sediments the abundance of microplastic ranged from 16 8 14 0 103 to 52 8 5 1 103 items kg with an average value of 30 4 5 2 103 items kg whereas the minimum value occurred at s12 and the maximum value at s2 we observed a relatively higher abundance of microplastics by 1 2 orders of magnitude in both surface waters and sediments than reported results table s4 which may be explained by the differences in identification methods and threshold values 50 μm xia et al 2021 along the rivers the microplastic abundance in surface water decreased rapidly within 1 2 km downstream w2 w5 of the wwtp and then remained stable for a longer distance w7 w13 this indicates that easily settleable particles from the effluents settle rapidly within this short distance and other microplastics migrate farther downstream with water flow the abundance of microplastics in the sediments has a similar spatial variation trend to that of surface water with peaks following effluent input and then a gradual decline along the direction of river flow generally the further the distance from the town center the lower the abundance of microplastics in the surface water and some specific rural pollution sources or hydrodynamic conditions could change the trends at several sites which were attributed to tributary inflows and pollution from agricultural wastes seo et al 2020 kim et al 2021 urban subsections a1 and a4 are hotspots for microplastic pollution followed by suburban ones a3 and a2 which always occur in urban or local suburban areas because of the high intensity of human activity which causes a large value of microplastic abundance in wetlands in the eastern a3 region which has denser villages and wharves microplastic abundance in surface water was significantly higher than that in the western a3 region in rural areas far from towns a2 plastic waste from agricultural activities and rural communities at some sites such as w6 and w11 influenced the spatial distribution of microplastics in the wetland huang et al 2020 resulting in high levels of microplastic abundance in surface waters and sediments the relatively high abundance of microplastics in sediments that remain in a3 may be associated with the enclosed character of lake type wetlands ryan et al 2020 because of a semi enclosed dam located downstream of s15 which impedes the riverine transport of microplastics and enriches microplastics in lake sediments especially in the dry season ryan et al 2020 3 1 2 particle size distribution of microplastics in our study both surface waters and sediments were dominated by small sized microplastics 50 500 μm figs 3 a 3b and the proportion of most microplastics in surface water in suburban areas was slightly lower than that in urban areas fig s5 higher percentages of small sized microplastics were observed in the present study which were 90 6 and 84 0 for the surface water and sediment respectively fig s6 than the results reported in the literature table s5 in addition the proportions of smaller sized microplastics 100 500 μm in surface waters were higher than those in sediments whereas the smallest 50 100 µm and large microplastics 500 5000 µm were more likely to accumulate in sediments with a decrease in the microplastic size there was an exponential increase in the abundance of 100 5000 μm microplastics in both surface waters and sediments fig s7 which is different from the linear growth pattern reported by teng et al 2020 in general larger sized microplastics tend to settle during the conveying of surface water which reduces their abundance in surface waters for example for ps and pvc 10 mm particles take only 0 016 0 23 min to sink to 40 m whereas 100 μm and 1 μm particles need 0 1 1 6 days and 2 8 43 years respectively merel et al 2017 however there is a complete reversal of microplastic abundance in surface water and sediment when the microplastic size was less than 100 μm 50 100 μm in which sediments had a higher proportion of microplastics in this size range than surface waters which may be related to heterogeneous aggregation upward fluctuation and hyporheic exchange of microplastics in this size range in surface waters galloway et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 extracellular polymers can promote heterogeneous aggregation between microorganisms and small sized microplastics mao et al 2018 gigault et al 2018 thereby enhancing their downward settlement away from the shallow water layer of surface waters 0 15 cm in addition two reports have shown that microplastics less than 100 μm in size can easily be captured by hydrophobic substances such as grease and microbubbles in the water column to make them move upward so et al 2018 kalčíková et al 2017 substantial amounts of small sized microplastics 50 500 μm were found in the sediments which may have been caused by the retention effect of the hyporheic exchange which can force water to carry small sized microplastics into or out of the sediment pore interface drummond et al 2020 the wetland sediments collected in this study were composed of fine silt with anaerobic black organic debris and were likely to trap or capture more small sized particles of less than 100 μm into the sediments by hyporheic exchange 3 1 3 morphological characteristics microplastics of 200 5000 μm on the filter membrane were selected for subsequent morphological analysis using a stereomicroscope fig 4 a because of methodological limitations observing microplastics smaller than 200 μm under a somatic microscope as well as polymer identification of these microplastic particles are still a formidable challenge burns et al 2018 thus the selected microplastics in this study were commonly in the range of 200 5000 μm which is somewhat different from those with a size range of 500 5000 μm based on visual classification methods to quantify microplastics reported in several previous studies amrutha et al 2020 ding et al 2019 most of the selected microplastics were of three shapes fiber film and fragment among which fiber was dominant fig 6a the decomposition of agricultural waste and discharge of washing wastewater probably contributed to the high proportion of fiber kim et al 2021 li et al 2018b scanning electron microscopy images figs 4b 4d show that there were breakages cracks and even tears on the surface of the microplastics implying that the microplastics have aged to some extent under various environmental conditions on the microplastic surface there were inorganic nonmetallic elements such as c o b and si as well as several metallic elements such as al fe ca zr and pt figs 4b 4d and this composition is similar to that of the liangfeng river from xia et al 2021 3 1 4 polymer types the polymer types of microplastics in the huixian wetland were all dominated by pe and pp figs 5 a 5b and there were significant geographical differences under the effect of human activities in the surface waters pe and pp had the highest proportions of 37 6 and 24 7 respectively followed by pvc 15 3 pa 11 8 and ps 10 6 and 32 2 23 0 18 4 14 9 and 11 5 for pe pp pvc pa and ps in the sediments respectively the higher proportions of pe and pp were associated with their wide range of daily use additionally the higher proportions of pe and pp in surface waters than those in sediments indicate that pe and pp are more likely to migrate in surface water because their densities are lower in contrast the proportions of pa ps and pvc were significantly lower in surface water samples which may be related to their higher relative densities and therefore faster settling in the water sediment system the suburban areas a2 and a3 had significantly higher proportions of pe and pp than the urban areas a1 and a4 which may be attributed to the input of agricultural plastic wastes containing high amounts of pe and pp such as mulch films woven bags and fishing nets wang et al 2019 3 2 pollution sources of microplastics in urban wetlands 3 2 1 microplastic characteristics the abundance of microplastics in effluents ranged from 172 0 10 5 to 605 0 48 6 items l with the minimum value observed at s e8 and the maximum value at p e1 fig 2c microplastic abundance in wwtp effluents 501 0 605 0 items l was higher than that in wwts effluents 172 0 387 0 items l which was attributed to the more intensive discharge of small sized microplastics 50 500 μm from wwtps considering the more diverse input of microplastics into municipal wastewater in urban areas it is reasonable that more small sized microplastics occur in the wwtp effluent even though wwtps have better treatment techniques than wwtss wei et al 2020 in addition the microplastic abundance in the effluents reported in this study was of an order of magnitude higher than that reported in most studies table s4 which may be attributed to the differences in identification methodologies as mentioned previously in section 3 1 1 in this study the majority of microplastics in the effluent were observed to be in the range of 50 500 μm accounting for 90 8 fig 3c which was similar to the results reported by jiang et al 2020 interestingly the abundance of microplastics with particle sizes less than 100 μm in the effluent was significantly lower a possible explanation is that small sized microplastics of 50 100 μm are more easily captured by activated sludge and thus trapped in the sludge franco et al 2021 kalčíková et al 2017 this is consistent with the results of jiang et al 2020 who observed that 63 7 74 1 of microplastics detected in sludge were in the range of 20 100 μm compared to those in surface waters the types of microplastics in effluents were still dominated by pe 28 7 and pp 24 1 but the percentages of pa and ps increased significantly to 18 4 and 12 6 respectively which may be attributed to the large amount of washing wastewater containing clothing fibers and industrial plastics in domestic wastewater li et al 2018b among these nine agricultural plastic samples mulch films were identified as pe two samples and pp one sample and fishing nets woven bags farm floats plastic bottles fishing lines and clothing fibers as pe pp ps pvc pa and pa respectively the polymer types of agricultural plastic wastes matched those in the surface waters and sediments of the huixian wetland implying that agricultural plastic wastes could also be another important source of microplastics in wetland systems kim et al 2021 martin et al 2019 the widely discarded pp pe wastes are potential contributors to the high proportions of pe and pp in the suburban surface water in this study 3 2 2 pollution source analysis in this study we used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to identify potential sources of microplastics in wetlands and the results are shown in figs 6 c 6g figs 6c and 6d depict the effects of sample sites on the abundance of microplastics with different particle sizes and polymer types respectively in both principal component analysis models two components were sufficient to explain the majority of the datum variation 72 5 for the former and 65 4 for the latter according to the eigenvectors of the samples pc 1 was mainly associated with effluent discharge whereas pc 2 was speculated to be affected by a combination of agricultural plastic wastes and hydrodynamic conditions in general wetlands in urban areas are mostly affected by microplastic pollution from effluent discharge whereas suburb samples are subject to effluent discharge combined with agricultural source input cluster analysis showed that pe and pp in the surface water sediments and effluent formed a cluster in terms of similarity whereas pa and ps formed a distinct cluster combined with pvc figs 6e 6g a similar cluster structure of the polymers was formed in the surface water sediments and effluent implying that effluent discharge was the leading source of microplastic pollution in this wetland system wang et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 in addition pearson correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between microplastic abundance in surface water and sediment as well as between each of them and the effluents fig s8 therefore discharged effluent as a point source is the main microplastic source input in the huixian wetlands and agricultural waste as a non point source input is a sub factor affecting the distribution of microplastics in urban wetlands in densely populated urban areas wwtp effluent comprises the major input of microplastics to urban wetlands whereas effluents combined with agricultural sources affect microplastic pollution in urban wetlands located in sparsely populated areas areas slightly farther downstream from wwtps a1 and a4 are hotspots for microplastic pollution in the urban wetland followed by areas adjacent to wwtss a3 and the distant suburban area a2 in sequence which is closely associated with the distribution of the population fig 7 garcés ordóñez et al 2019 also found that a higher abundance of microplastics was detected in mangrove wetlands closer to population centers wastewater treatment facilities are crucial in the transfer of urban microplastics from human activities to the bulk aquatic environment jiang et al 2020 for the urban wetland subsection far from these wwtps a2 and a3 agricultural wastes derived from agricultural activities become a non ignorable microplastic source long term agricultural production has resulted in the accumulation of plastic waste debris in surface soil and the formation of terrestrial sourced microplastics that can enter surface water via surface runoff huang et al 2020 lasee et al 2017 plastic products frequently used during aquaculture production also affect the abundance size distribution and polymer types of microplastics in urban wetlands li et al 2018a in addition macroplastics retained by plant inter root networks and sediments may disintegrate under sustained environmental stress rose et al 2019 which is a potential source of microplastic contamination in wetland systems 3 3 microplastic migration characteristics and retardation mechanisms in urban wetlands 3 3 1 migration characteristics the abundance of microplastics in the surface water and sediment in this study gradually decreased along the river flow direction with overall reduction rates of 53 7 61 4 through each subsection and part of the microplastics in the surface water basically completed the vertical migration within 1 2 km downstream of the point sources in the two river type sub wetlands a1 a2 and a4 microplastic abundance in the surface water declined by 61 2 and 53 7 respectively whereas that of the typical lake type subwetland was 61 4 a3 the worse abatement in the a4 sub wetland than that in the a1 a2 sub wetland was attributed to the shorter settling time caused by the shorter river length in a4 hence a longer river transport distance is considered to benefit the abatement of microplastics from surface water in urban wetlands even though a3 and a4 have similar river transport distances microplastic removal from surface water in a3 was significantly higher than that in a4 which implies that lake type wetlands can remove more microplastics from surface water to sediments than river type wetlands owing to the enhanced interception effect of lake type wetlands on microplastics qian et al 2021 studies have also found that coastal wetland systems such as salt marshes yao et al 2019 mangroves duan et al 2021 and tidal freshwater wetlands ryan et al 2020 are ideal sites for the interception and storage of microplastics or large plastic debris moreover in our study both large sized 500 5000 µm and small sized 50 500 µm microplastics had a significant abatement effect with removal ratios of 0 71 1 large sized and 52 0 65 2 small sized in surface water in this urban wetland fig 3a a recent report also showed that a natural wastewater treatment wetland system can remove approximately 50 of microplastics in the size range of 63 850 µm from raw wastewater sarkar et al 2021 to our knowledge our investigation is the first report of the abatement of small sized microplastics 50 500 µm in this wetland system which implies that urban wetland systems can be used as important ecological barriers to remove microplastics from relatively clean surface water more than raw wastewater migration processes and abatement are mediated mainly by a combination of settlement floatation and hyporheic exchange processes which are affected by their physicochemical properties such as density size surface electric charge and biofouling which can change the microparticle surface characteristics naji et al 2019 qian et al 2021 drummond et al 2020 wu et al 2020 merel et al 2017 whether microplastic particles float oscillate or settle is mainly determined by the difference in density between freshwater and microplastic particles merel et al 2017 low density microplastics pe and pp are more likely to float on the water surface or be suspended in the water column whereas high density microplastics ps pvc and pa are liable to settle into the sediment alimi et al 2018 moreover larger sized microplastics are more likely to settle into the sediment alimi et al 2018 whereas small sized microplastics easily cross plant pores for long distance river transport liu et al 2019 biofouling can also affect the microplastic migration process by changing the microplastic densities and sizes as has been observed in various aquatic environments fabienne et al 2016 merel et al 2017 wu et al 2020 furthermore the occurrence of shallow slopes at the river bottom can accelerate the accumulation of microplastics settling owing to collision and shallow sedimentation teng et al 2020 which is confirmed by the significant increase in microplastic abundance from s15 to s18 fig 2b high density hydrophytes significantly increased the proportions of large sized 500 5000 μm microplastics in the sediments s5 s7 and s15 s18 by plant interception in addition the migration process of different sized microplastics in the surface water in our study is not consistent with the pattern in the marine surface water cózar et al 2014 merel et al 2017 which is related to high intensity photogenic aging and stronger biofouling on the microplastic surfaces owing to the longer residence time in the ocean zhang et al 2019 enrichetti et al 2021 3 3 2 retardation mechanism the main mechanisms impeding microplastic transport in the surface water of urban wetlands include plankton capture aquatic plant retention and sediment adsorption qian et al 2021 martin et al 2019 li et al 2020 urban wetlands have richer nutrients and more active microbial communities than wetlands in remote areas because of the intensive human activity in urban areas which results in the discharge of large amounts of organics zhang et al 2015 large numbers of plankton can capture microplastics in the water column through adhesion heterogeneous aggregation and feeding behavior hindering the migration of microplastics along with the river flow merel et al 2017 moreover the abundant microorganisms in urban wetlands reinforce the biological effects in the environment causing stronger biofouling which has an adverse effect on the horizontal migration of microplastics enrichetti et al 2021 extracellular polymeric substances may also establish dense hydrogen bonds and electrostatic networks thereby inhibiting microplastic transport by promoting particle coagulation wu et al 2020 merel et al 2017 plant interception is considered a unique retardant factor in wetland ecosystems which limits both the horizontal and vertical migration of microplastics qian et al 2021 it has been proven that plants and their inter root networks have a high capacity to capture large sized microplastics in deep water columns to promote the accumulation of microplastics in sediments cozzolino et al 2020 unlike other open waters urban wetlands contain more diverse and denser aquatic plants that weaken the hydraulic disturbance of surface water such as hydraulic turbulence which results in a shortened horizontal migration distance of microplastics by facilitating their settlement in the water column mudd et al 2010 ryan et al 2020 xia et al 2021 this also makes urban wetlands more capable of capturing both large 500 5000 µm and small 50 500 µm microplastics which was proven by the significantly increased microplastic abundance in the sediments in areas with intensive aquatic plants in our study furthermore an interesting study reported that greater amounts of silt enhanced the ability of sediments to capture microplastics in a wetland li et al 2020 which probably occurs in urban wetlands with rich silt sediments as well as many humic substances and high microbial mass the same pattern has been observed in wetlands with rich silts where microplastics tend to accumulate in sediments during vertical migration seo et al 2020 in addition compared with urban wetlands wetlands away from cities usually have more open water relatively strong hydrodynamic conditions and relatively low plant densities ryan et al 2020 making microplastics more likely to pass through the wetland without being trapped especially for smaller sized microplastics moreover the mechanisms of microplastic retention in urban wetlands are significantly different from those in salt marshes and mangrove wetlands along the coastal zone which is closely related to topographic features current movements and tidal action yao et al 2019 duan et al 2021 martin et al 2019 although urban wetlands can gradually trap microplastics into their sediments the accumulated microplastics in the sediments also have potential environmental risks long term accumulation and plant interception represent the enormous potential of wetlands as microplastic sinks however even though urban wetlands are often located in flat areas with very slow flow rates and shallow water layers they are transferred into an important pollution source during storm events which often occur during the rainy season xia et al 2020 in the context of global climate change extreme rainstorm events occur more frequently than usual such as the once in a millennium rainfall event in china in july 2021 under these extreme weather events wetland sediments transiently switch from microplastic sinks to pollution sources driven by violent hydrodynamic disturbances qian et al 2021 resulting in large releases of microplastics from sediments to surface waters and rapid horizontal transport which pose risks to downstream aquatic ecosystems and drinking water sources 4 conclusions this study reports for the first time the source sink characteristics of microplastics and their migration behavior in a typical urban wetland 1 the abundance of microplastics dominated by those sized 50 500 µm were in the ranges of 16 0 89 0 items l 16 8 103 52 8 103 items kg and 172 0 605 0 items l in the surface waters sediments and effluents respectively smallest sized 50 100 µm and large sized 500 5000 µm microplastics were retained in wetland sediments whereas smaller sized 100 500 µm microplastics were present in surface waters the main shapes of the microplastics were fiber and the main polymer types were pe and pp 2 the huixian wetland not only has a good retention effect on large sized microplastics but also has a significant abatement effect on small sized microplastics in surface waters with a total of 53 7 61 4 of microplastics in surface waters settlement of microplastics in the easily settled portion of effluents was achieved within 1 2 km downstream of the pollution source and lake type wetlands were more effective than river type wetlands in abating terrestrial plastics 3 effluent discharge is the main source of microplastics in urban wetlands and agricultural waste is a secondary source urban wetlands retard the migration of microplastics in surface waters through a combination of enhanced gravitational settling microbial adhesion plant retention and sediment adsorption to better understand the functions and roles of urban wetlands in transferring and retarding microplastics more research on the seasonal variation in the occurrence and fate of microplastics in urban wetlands is required credit authorship contribution statement

16226,in sludge disposal arsenic as poses serious secondary pollution due to its high toxicity and low stability this work systematically studied the effects of fenton cao composite conditioning on as chemistry throughout sludge dewatering thermal drying and steam gasification processes the experimental results showed that for raw sludge 40 9 of as was released with filtrate discharging and 26 8 57 3 emitted with flue gas emission when sludge was conditioned by fenton cao all of the as in the filtrate was fixed in the sludge cake and the releasing rate of gaseous as was reduced by up to 86 0 furthermore the comprehensive results of the model compounds experiment sequential extraction and thermodynamic calculations revealed the effects of fe ca conditioners on as species evolution in the fenton pre oxidation as v was reduced to as iii due to the decreasing eh caused by the excessive fe ii after adding cao as iii dma dimethyl arsenic was adsorbed onto the surface of amorphous fe oh 3 that was introduced by fenton s reagent 50 and 43 of which were then oxidized or demethylated to form as v mma monomethyl arsenic respectively in the following drying process at 120 180 c the feooh and cao derived by residual fe ca conditioners could promote the oxidation of 30 of the rest as iii by the catalytic effect or directly reacting with it in the final steam gasification process the very little as iii left in the dry sludge was released with the gas phase and the proportion of as v in gasification ash almost reached 100 in short fenton cao composite conditioning could achieve the near zero emission of as and reduce the toxicity of the products throughout the whole sludge treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge fenton cao arsenic dewatering thermal drying steam gasification 1 introduction municipal sewage sludge is an important by product of the wastewater treatment process along with the rapid development of the chinese social economy and the gradual enhancement of public environmental awareness the wastewater treatment capacity increased rapidly leading to a substantial increase in sludge production the sludge contains high moisture content rich organic matter and various harmful substances such as pathogenic microorganisms refractory organics heavy metals and trace elements to achieve sludge disposal and resource utilization simultaneously it is often subjected to pretreatments such as conditioning dewatering and drying for moisture removal followed by thermal means like gasification which are usually employed to realize the conversion of sludge to energy it is noteworthy that pathogenic microorganisms and refractory organics can be completely decomposed at a sufficiently high temperature whereas heavy metals and trace elements cannot be eliminated especially some unstable trace elements are prone to change forms and release into the environment along with the sludge treatment processes posing a threat to the environment and human health gayathri et al 2021 arsenic is a typical representative among all the trace elements in sludge due to its highest mobility factor dai et al 2019 and remarkable emission risk in energy utilization only weaker than hg chanaka udayanga et al 2018 arsenic existed in various species in sludge duker et al 2005 it is commonly recognized that inorganic arsenic like as iii and as v is the predominant species in sludge and the former is more toxic siddiqui and chaudhry 2017 some of the inorganic arsenic may also undergo methylation and become relatively less toxicity organic species such as monomethyl arsenic mma and dimethyl arsenic dma andrianisa et al 2008 for more information about the toxicity level of different arsenic species please see table s1 in the supplementary material apart from poisonousness the arsenic accumulation transformation in pretreatments and the release behavior in subsequent thermal treatments also varied widely with its species therefore the arsenic chemistry including its distribution and species needs to be fully explored during the whole process of sludge conditioning dewatering thermal drying and steam gasification in the conditioning and dewatering process the applied conditioners are the most important influencing factor however most current studies used model arsenic solutions rather than actual wastewater or sewage sludge to carry out their experiments for example iron based compounds are commonly used conditioners and may contribute to arsenic immobilization mukherjee et al 2016 reported that alpha fe2o3 showed a high arsenic adsorption capacity of 38 48 mg g at the best operating condition in the standard as v solution roy et al 2021 proved that fe 0 electrocoagulation combined with biological oxidation could effectively remove as iii in simulated groundwater to who guidelines by generating reactive fe iii precipitates tang et al 2017 used fe fe2o3 nanobunches to deal with the arsenic in wastewater the as iii removal efficiency reached 92 and still remained to be 78 after 9 times of cycling beside the calcium compound is another kind of frequently used conditioner which also works on arsenic fixation according to the study of bothe and brown 1999 lime addition could decrease arsenic activity in model arsenic solutions by producing calcium arsenates such as ca5 aso4 3oh with low solubility dai et al 2019 demonstrated that the mobility factor of arsenic in sludge conditioned by modified phosphogypsum containing plenty of caso4 and acetic acid decreased from 0 15 to 0 01 the mobility factor of cd cr cu pb zn and ni also decreased to below 0 05 zhang et al 2019 found that 99 64 of arsenic in aqueous solution could be removed by using caco3 coupled with feso4 the literature above showed that a large number of iron calcium compounds of different forms have great effects on arsenic immobilization additionally the fenton cao composite conditioning which was proposed first in our previous studies can realize satisfactory sludge dewatering performance liu et al 2014 2012 2013 and has been certified by many other researchers dai et al 2017 liang et al 2015 mo et al 2015 this composite conditioning process can bring many iron calcium compounds into the sludge but the possible formation of these compounds and their combined effects on arsenic immobilization in the actual sludge were not clear in the subsequent thermal drying and steam gasification process the residual iron calcium conditioners probably continue to play a role in arsenic transformation but few relative studies were reported under the drying temperature of 105 and 300 c weng et al 2014 claimed that arsenic tended to bind with those minerals in sludge with the loss of bound water and its species was converted from acid soluble reducible fraction into a more stable form residual fraction when the temperature further raised to gasification level around 900 c and above no direct study is found but there is still some evidence to support the potential influence of residual iron calcium compounds on arsenic immobilization the results of zhao et al 2018 fu et al 2019 and xie et al 2021 were in favor of the conclusion that calcium compounds in sludge could enhance arsenic retention via condensation and or adsorption during the sludge co incineration han et al 2017 also found that in the sludge pyrolysis which was similar to the devolatilization stage of the gasification process arsenic releasing rate in sludge conditioned by cao did not show a growing trend even when temperature increased from 450 to 850 c and was always lower than that in raw sludge in addition liu et al 2019 reported that fe2o3 had a positive impact on reactions between cao and arsenic to inhibit its volatilization during the sludge co incineration song et al 2021 and zhao et al 2017 showed that iron compounds could facilitate the oxidation of arsenic by forming various arsenates during sludge incineration in general the existing studies focused on arsenic transformation in thermal treatments like incineration or pyrolysis the reaction path of arsenic and the roles of residual iron calcium conditioners during sludge thermal drying and steam gasification were still poorly understood because of the complex conversion behaviors of the fenton cao system the form changes of iron calcium compounds may be different from those described in the literature and the fate of arsenic was also unknown in our previous studies an innovative method has been proposed for sludge dewatering drying gasification and adsorbent preparation for sulfur and nitrogen odor simultaneously by using fenton cao composite conditioning liu et al 2014 2013 2016 yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 thus this research aims to explore the arsenic chemistry in the whole process of sludge treatment using fenton cao composite conditioning in particular the total arsenic distribution and its species in the products of each process were quantified the combined effects of iron calcium conditioners on arsenic evolution were also clarified by using model compounds experiments principal component regression thermodynamic calculation and sequential extraction 2 material and methods 2 1 sludge samples the raw sludge rs sample was secondary sludge obtained from a wastewater treatment plant in wuhan china and stored at 4 c for further experiments the moisture content of the sludge was 97 9 and the organic matter dry basis was 52 5 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 sludge conditioning and dewatering process the effects of fenton cao conditioning on arsenic migration and transformation were investigated using different dosages of fe2 feso4 and cao table s2 in supplementary materials unit mg g ds a typical conditioning process contains fenton pre oxidation mixing with fe2 for 30 s and h2o2 for 5 min and cao conditioning blending with cao for 5 min successively the conditioned sludge was called s fex s fex caoy respectively x y are the dosage of the corresponding reagents for the further dewatering process sludge dewatering was carried out in our self designed multi unit filtration system shown in fig s1 which was convenient to handle multiple samples at the same time conditioned sludge was poured into a brinell funnel with a filter and then exposed to a negative pressure of 0 08 mpa created by a vacuum pump until the sludge cake cracked or no filtrate flowed down sludge cake and filtrate were collected separately for further examinations 2 2 2 sludge drying process table s2 demonstrated the best conditioning formulas for the further drying process and the corresponding conditioned sludge was named rs s fenton s cao and s fenton cao each sludge sample was dried to a constant weight at 60 70 80 120 150 180 c and then collected for subsequent testing 2 2 3 sludge gasification experiments sludge gasification experiments were carried out in a fixed bed gasifier heated by an electrothermal furnace at 600 800 1000 c since gasification was generally regarded as an extension to the pyrolysis process chanaka udayanga et al 2018 syed hassan et al 2017 decoupling experiments were designed to obtain char and ash samples separately to reveal the arsenic behaviors in the devolatilization stage and char gasification stage respectively to get char samples 1 l min ar was used 5 g sludge samples were tiled as a thin layer in a quartz boat and then put into the center of a heated gasifier for each batch the reaction time was set as 20 min after the reaction the quartz boat was towed back to the water cooling zone for sample collection to obtain gasification ash additional steam would be pumped into the furnace at the flow rate of 0 2 g min and the reaction time was extended to 60 min the gasification bench and the discussion about the char samples were demonstrated in fig s2 and text s1 separately all the experiments mentioned above were repeated three times to guarantee the validity of the results 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 determination of arsenic in sludge the arsenic content was measured by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy afs arsenic species as iii as v mma and dma was tested using afs coupled with high performance liquid chromatography more detailed information could be seen in text s2 moreover a sequential extraction method was applied to uncover the binding forms of arsenic in solid products hu et al 2015 pantuzzo and ciminelli 2010 extraction steps for ca bound fe al bound and silicon bound arsenic were listed in table s3 2 4 arsenic model compounds experiments model compounds experiments were designed to better understand the mechanism of fenton cao conditioning on arsenic transformation in the dewatering process seen in table s4 conditioners were directly added into standard solutions of different arsenic species as iii as v mma and dma instead of sludge and then the original dewatering procedure was followed the precipitate was freeze dried and then sent to analyze its arsenic species together with the filtrate 2 4 1 composition analysis of sludge and residual conditioners the blank conditioning groups in table s4 were used to monitor the residual conditioners in the sludge cake the precipitate of blank conditioning groups of fenton and fenton cao conditioning were collected some of them were freeze dried and the rest was dried at 60 70 80 120 150 180 c respectively the dried solids were ground into powder for subsequent testing the residual iron calcium substances in the precipitates of blank groups were detected by x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro panalytical b c the content of different valence states of iron was tested using the phenanthroline spectrophotometry method gendel and lahav 2008 the composition of each sludge sample was tested by x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf america edax eagle iii 2 4 2 principal component regression analysis the principal component regression method was employed by spss 26 0 software to further reflect the correlation between arsenic transformation and the key influencing factors in the dewatering and drying process in detail the key influencing factors were defined as original variables considering these original variables were not independent of each other the principal component analysis method was used to eliminate their collinearity and got the principal component variables these variables were regarded as independent variables for multiple linear regression analysis finally according to the scoring coefficient matrix the original influencing factors were substituted back into the regression equation and a new regression model of the key influencing factors of arsenic transformation was obtained this method could avoid the influence of variable correlation so the coefficients of key influencing factors in the new regression model could reflect their net contribution to arsenic transformation 2 4 3 thermodynamic equilibrium calculation factsage 6 0 was used to calculate the thermodynamic equilibrium concerning the eh ph diagram for the system fe as h2o hsc chemistry 6 0 was used to calculate the possible reaction pathways of arsenic transformation during the sludge gasification process 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic transformation in the dewatering process 3 1 1 arsenic distribution in dewatered products with fenton cao conditioning arsenic contents in the sludge cake and filtrate were displayed in fig 1 fig 1 a showed that nearly 40 9 of arsenic in raw sludge existed in the filtrate this part of arsenic was almost completely stabilized in the sludge cake with the addition of fe2 s fe50 but arsenic began to slightly dissolve into the filtrate when fe2 dosage was greater than 50 mg g ds demonstrating the weakened arsenic stabilization ability of fenton pre oxidation after adding different doses of cao arsenic always accumulated in the sludge cake fig 1 b showing the great immobilization effect of fenton cao conditioning to further study the dosages changes of conditioners for arsenic fixation the following section focused on the relationship between arsenic content and changes of key factors affecting arsenic transformation caused by fenton cao conditioning 3 1 2 correlation between total arsenic distribution and key influencing factors since the arsenic transformation behaviors largely depended on sludge physicochemical properties such as oxidation reduction environment eh ph ascar et al 2008 carbonell barrachina et al 2000 and iron species like fe ii fe iii lakshmanan et al 2010 andrianisa et al 2008 they were selected as the key factors affecting arsenic transformation considering that these factors were not independent of each other it was difficult to judge their influence degree directly therefore the principal component regression method was used to establish multiple regression equations for the arsenic content in sludge cake and filtrate e g total as cake 0 18 ph 0 71 eh 0 65 fe ii cake 0 23 fe iii cake r2 0 99 the coefficients of these four factors were listed in table 1 to reflect their net contributions to the total arsenic distribution e g for arsenic accumulation in sludge cake the contribution of each key influencing factors were eh fe ii cake fe iii cake ph during the fenton pre oxidation the changes of eh and fe ii whose coefficients were 0 68 and 0 54 for total as filtrate r2 0 97 respectively were the most significant factors affecting arsenic accumulation table 1 the eh changes of the conditioned sludge were listed in table 2 as arsenic in filtrate decreased from 40 9 s fe0 to 0 9 s fe50 eh increased from 140 mv to its maximum value of 510 mv simultaneously showing a good negative correlation ascar et al 2008 also reported the weakened mobility of arsenic in the soil under high eh conditions the arsenic re leaching was mainly attributed to fe ii changes the excessive fe2 led to the migration of fe ii species into filtrate rather than solid when fe2 dosage exceeded 50 mg g ds fig 2 a parts of the adsorbed arsenic also dissolved with these iron containing species carbonell barrachina et al 2000 yamaguchi et al 2011 thus leading to the increase of arsenic content in the filtrate after the addition of cao the most important factors affecting arsenic accumulation turned out to be fe iii changes with the coefficient of 0 59 for total as cake r2 0 96 table 1 fe iii accounted for the major part of iron in fenton cao conditioned sludge 68 fig 2 b and was believed to be the host phase of arsenic in the form of amorphous fe oh 3 carbonell barrachina et al 2000 yamaguchi et al 2011 although the proportion of fe iii kept decreasing from s fe50 ca0 to s fe50 ca60 the arsenic dissolved into the filtrate was negligible implying that fe iii hydroxides produced in fenton cao process might have better adsorption capacity 3 1 3 arsenic species in sludge cakes with fenton cao conditioning apart from the arsenic distribution in dewatered products the control of toxic arsenic species also needed to be considered since most of the arsenic tended to accumulate in the solid the sludge cakes were selected to analyze their species distribution as shown in fig 3 the as iii in sludge cake was oxidized into as v from s fe0 to s fe50 fig 3 a however as v continuously changed back to as iii after the turning point of s fe50 indicating that excessive fe ii was unfavorable for the arsenic transformation to less toxic forms as for organic arsenic the mma content reached its maximum at the same turning point of s fe50 and then continued to decline while the opposite law was generally found for dma hence dma might undergo a demethylation reaction to generate mma before the turning point but then this reaction was inhibited in comparison after adding cao as v was no longer reduced to as iii and its content kept growing from 2 65 to 3 45 mg g ds fig 3 b this result showed that fenton cao conditioning could make the as iii oxidation much easier thereby reducing the toxicity of products the content of mma and dma kept on declining from s fe50 ca0 to s fe50 ca60 implying that dma and mma experienced a stronger demethylation reaction and finally decomposed to understand the mechanism behind the complex transformation behaviors of as iii as v and dma mma the correlation analysis between arsenic species and key influencing factors was also needed 3 1 4 correlation between arsenic species and key influencing factors table 1 summarized the coefficients of the ph eh and fe ii fe iii content of the conditioned sludge to demonstrate their net contributions on arsenic species changes using the principal component regression method as for fenton pre oxidation eh and fe ii changes were believed to be able to explain the different arsenic transformation behaviors before and after the turning point of s fe50 table 1 the experimental results of eh in table 2 showed an increasing trend from s fe0 to s fe50 which might be owing to oh with strong oxidizing ability generated by fenton reaction this oxidation environment was responsible for the conversion of as iii to as v and the demethylation of dma to produce mma fig 3 a the reduction reaction of as v to as iii and the inhibition of the demethylation reaction of dma to mma were mainly attributed to fe ii changes from s fe50 to s fe100 fe ii had already appeared in the filtrate in s fe50 indicating a completed fenton reaction fig 2 a further addition of fe2 only increased fe ii in the filtrate and thus decreasing the eh values therefore the conversion of dma to mma slowed down and as v was reduced to as iii the conversion tendency of as v to as iii also agreed with the calculation results in fig s3 under the same eh and ph conditions from s fe50 to s fe100 when it comes to fenton cao conditioning eh ph and fe iii all had noticeable effects on arsenic transformation and their influence degree was generally eh ph fe iii table 1 however the arsenic conversion process seemed not to match up with the changes of these three key factors in particular the growing trend of as v and the decomposition of dma mma in fenton cao conditioning indicated a more oxidizing environment fig 3 b on the contrary the results in table 2 displayed significantly decreased eh values and increased ph fe iii content also went down fig 2 b from s fe50 ca0 to s fe50 ca60 all of these changes pointed to an inhibited fenton reaction and a weakening oxidizing environment a possible reason for this contradiction was that the fenton cao conditioning could reduce the threshold of arsenic oxidation thus making it easier to occur and further investigation was needed to verify this deduction 3 1 5 arsenic oxidation mechanism during fenton cao conditioning to avoid the interference of complex components in the sludge the model compounds experiment was designed to better explore the mechanism of fenton cao conditioning to reduce the arsenic oxidation threshold the results in fig 4 showed that all the as iii was oxidized to as v whether in fenton or fenton cao conditioning it was noticed that the percentage of as v 77 8 left in precipitate in fenton pre oxidation was more than that of as v oxidized from as iii only 55 3 fig 4 a this phenomenon suggested that as iii in the sludge possibly tended to be adsorbed by amorphous fe oh 3 first and then oxidized to as v on the surface of these hydroxides other researchers also reported that the adsorption degree of as v was always higher than that of as iii under similar conditions using fecl3 lakshmanan et al 2010 qiao et al 2012 which further supported our experimental conclusion however the proportion of as v oxidized by as iii in the precipitate reached 100 after cao addition which was much more than that of fenton pre oxidation fig 4 a this increase of as v oxidized by as iii verified that fenton cao conditioning enhanced the adsorption capacity of the raw as iii in fe iii hydroxides even though fe iii content was decreasing considering the eh value was decreasing at the same time in fenton cao conditioning the adsorbed as iii on fe iii hydroxides must be easier to be oxidized into as v than dissociative as iii see in fig s4 during fenton reaction eqs 1 7 oh and ho2 with strong oxidizing property were continuously generated under the catalytic effects of fe ii fe iii system because the chemical reaction rate were much faster than the diffusion rate of oh and ho2 the concentration of these oxidizing radicals would be relatively higher in the region near the fe ii fe iii system as a result as iii dma were more easier to contact and react with the oxidizing radicals than that in filtrate after they were adsorbed onto the surface of fe iii in fenton cao composite conditioning the addition of cao promote the adsorption capacity of fe iii on as iii dma so that the oxidation demethylation reaction were further enhanced that was the explanation for the contradiction between the growing trend of as v and the changes of eh ph and fe iii in fenton cao conditioning the above mechanism could also explain the decomposition of dma and mma in fig 3 during the fenton cao conditioning the adsorption of dma and mma on fe iii hydroxides was strengthened fig 4 a hence the demethylation reaction became more drastic and dma mma could even directly remove all the methyl groups to produce other forms of arsenic the sum of all the arsenic species in the filtrate fig 4 b and precipitates fig 4 a derived from the raw mma and raw dma was less than 100 in fenton cao conditioning which confirmed the decomposition of dma and mma 3 2 arsenic transformation in the drying process 3 2 1 arsenic species in dry sludge as an effective method to remove residual water after the dewatering process thermal drying was widely used to meet the standards of the subsequent sludge treatment process but the arsenic transformation behavior was poorly understood in this process fig 5 illustrated the effects of drying temperature and residual conditioners on arsenic species changes the arsenic transformation behavior was exactly the opposite in different ranges of drying temperature 60 80 c compared with 120 180 c during 60 80 c as v was constantly reduced to as iii whether in rs s fenton s cao or s fenton cao even under the increasing temperature this result was due to the sulfur nitrogen containing odors with strong reducing ability produced by the decomposition of organic compounds e g protein in the drying process for detailed explanation please see text s3 and table s5 on the contrary over 30 of as iii in all the conditioned sludge was converted into as v as the temperature further increased from 120 to 180 c indicating the strengthened oxidation effect in the high temperature drying compared with rs whose as iii content remained unchanged under 120 180 c this phenomenon verified the necessity of the residual conditioners on the strengthened oxidation effect a similar strengthened reduction effect could also be observed in 60 80 c during which the conversion rate of as v to as iii in conditioned sludge was 1 21 3 higher than rs the organic arsenic did not show an obvious transformation trend during the drying process 3 2 2 correlation between arsenic species and key influencing factors to further evaluate the synergistic effect of residual conditioners in different temperature ranges the contributions of drying temperature and fe iii changes which was regarded as the host phase of arsenic were calculated and their coefficients were listed in table 3 in the range of 60 80 c the coefficients of temperature only became significant in s fenton and s fenton cao from 120 to 180 c the difference between the temperature coefficients and the fe iii coefficients also tended to be greater in the presence of residual iron introduced from the conditioning process for example the temperature coefficients of as iii changes were approximately 5 times bigger than the fe iii coefficients in s fenton while for rs it was only 2 times hence the residual iron compounds acted as a catalyst to promote the as iii oxidation with o2 in the air the results of fe ii fe iii distribution in dry sludge in fig 6 could further support this deduction the fe iii content in rs and s cao presented a sudden increase with the drying temperature range increasing from 60 80 c to 120 180 c while that in s fenton and s fenton cao almost kept unchanged compared with fig 5 it was obvious that the variation tendency of as iii as v was completely inconsistent with the fe iii fe ii change this result proved that it was the presence rather than the content of residual iron containing species that mattered for arsenic transformation as for s cao without iron conditioners the oxidation of as iii was also observed which was owing to the strengthened oxidation reaction with the existence of cao for more explanation please see text s4 table s6 additionally the different moisture content of rs and the conditioned sludge was proved to have little contribution on arsenic species transformation for more discussion please see text s5 and table s7 3 2 3 the forms of residual iron calcium conditioners to explore which component of the residual conditioners played the catalytic role for arsenic transformation during the drying process xrd testing was carried out using blank conditioning groups of fenton and fenton cao conditioning respectively the samples were listed in table s4 and the results were shown in fig 7 the obvious peak of fenton pre oxidation residuals did not appear until the drying temperature reached 180 c and the active ingredient with the catalysis effect in residual iron conditioners was proved to be feooh fig 7 a because the fe iii hydrolysis products generated in fenton reaction were mainly amorphous iron hydroxide cai et al 2020 almost nothing could be detected from fenton wet to fenton 150 c by xrd the active hydroxyl groups on feooh might contribute to the oxidation of adsorbed as iii at 120 180 c beside only caso4 nh2o could be found in s fenton cao fig 7 b indicating that cao hindered the crystallization process of feooh thus making it hard to be detected thereby the mechanism of fenton cao conditioning on arsenic transformation during sludge dewatering and drying process was demonstrated in fig 8 during the fenton cao conditioning fe iii produced by fenton reaction could be hydrolyzed to form amorphous fe oh 3 with strong adsorption capacity the addition of cao neutralized ph which further promoted the generation of amorphous fe oh 3 and its ability to adsorb arsenic compounds more as iii was thereby adsorbed into the amorphous fe oh 3 and its oxidation reaction was proved more easier to carry out even under negative eh values as a result arsenic in the sludge cake of s fenton cao was mainly as v dma and mma also experienced the same process and took place more violent demethylation reaction on the surface of amorphous fe oh 3 in the subsequent drying process the amorphous fe oh 3 was gradually dehydrated and crystallized into feooh the active hydroxyl group on feooh continued to affect the residual adsorbed as iii and dma making them more sensitive to the be oxidized by air under 120 180 c the alkaline environment provided by cao also had the same ability to reduce the activation energy of arsenic oxidation 3 3 arsenic transformation in the steam gasification process 3 3 1 arsenic stabilization effect of fenton cao conditioning compared to the dewatering and drying process sludge gasification was the most important process that caused the concentrated release of arsenic however few studies about the arsenic release in the gasification process are reported the effects of reaction conditions residual conditioners and the binding forms of arsenic in the pretreatment process on arsenic transformation during steam gasification were also poorly understood chanaka udayanga et al 2018 syed hassan et al 2017 to investigate the arsenic release behavior during sludge steam gasification the gasification process was divided into the devolatilization stage and the char gasification stage the increment of arsenic retention rates in the corresponding char and ash samples of conditioned sludge were determined in table 4 the arsenic stabilization effect of s fenton was better than that of rs in the devolatilization stage but this effect declined gradually in the char gasification stage this result indicated that arsenic bound with residual iron species was less stable in the presence of steam in contrast the arsenic in s cao always had a higher retention rate throughout the gasification process therefore arsenic bound with residual iron conditioners might have lower stability than that with residual calcium in the char gasification stage as a result the temperature for the highest arsenic control co effect in s fenton cao dropped from 800 to 600 c with the steam addition 3 3 2 binding forms of arsenic in gasification products to confirm the arsenic combining tendency with the residual iron calcium conditioners during the gasification process it is necessary to figure out the arsenic binding forms in gasification products the partition experiment was carried out on ash samples of s fenton with a lower arsenic immobilization effect the results were compared with char samples of s cao with a superior arsenic immobilization effect fig s5 for the ash samples of s fenton fe al bound arsenic was transferred into ca bound arsenic from 600 to 800 c verifying ca bound arsenic had greater stability than fe bound arsenic for the char samples of s cao however more arsenic was found to bind with fe al from 600 to 1000 c several studies have reported a similar phenomenon that the released arsenic could be re adsorbed by fe al oxides during the extraction process of calcite bound arsenic costagliola et al 2013 hu et al 2015 as a result the fraction of fe al bound arsenic was greatly overestimated and it was calcite bound arsenic that accounted for the major part in the char samples of s cao the results in table s8 also showed that the fe al content in dry s cao was the lowest among all the sludge samples so that it is calcium species rather than fe al was the host phase of arsenic in s cao to further confirm the stability of the binding strength between arsenic and residual iron calcium fig 9 represented the arsenic binding forms of all samples under the highest gasification temperature of 1000 c the predominant fe al bound arsenic in dry sludge of s fenton and s fenton cao all gradually escaped as the gasification process continued the ca bound phase and residual phase became the main arsenic species in s cao and rs respectively indicating that the stability of different arsenic forms was ca bound residual fe al bound 3 3 3 arsenic species in solid residuals to further investigate the mechanism of the arsenic transformation in the gasification process arsenic species in different gasification products were described in fig 10 in the devolatilization stage the proportion of as iii in s fenton and s fenton cao was more than that in rs and s cao implying a more reductive environment this result was attributed to the better promotion effect of residual iron on the generation of reductive gas like h2 than that of residual calcium conditioners which had been proved in our previous studies liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however as iii nearly disappeared in all ash samples in the char gasification stage there were two possible reasons for this phenomenon i as iii was oxidized to as v by steam or residual iron conditioners in the sludge ii the thermal stability of as iii with residual iron or calcium conditioners was much weaker than that of as v making the former easier to release in the char gasification stage further investigation should be carried out to confirm the reason for the great decline of as iii in the char gasification stage 3 3 4 arsenic transformation mechanism in char gasification stage considering the commonly recognized relationship between iron and arsenic the iron distribution in solid residuals of s fenton and s fenton cao was analyzed as shown in fig 11 it could be seen that only a small amount of fe ii could be oxidized into fe iii during the char gasification stage whose variation trend was inconsistent with the abrupt decrease of as iii obviously fe ii was impossible to be the oxidizing agent for as iii therefore the decrease of as iii in the gasification stage was unrelated to fe ii fe iii distribution changes apart from residual iron species steam might also present oxidization ability under high temperatures and caused the decrease of as iii in ash samples the possible reactions of as iii oxidized by steam with typical iron and calcium compounds under gasification temperature were assessed using hsc chemistry 6 0 table s9 the calculation results showed that as iii is difficult to be oxidized by steam except for the existence of cao or caco3 according to table s8 calcium compounds only accounted for a very small proportion in rs s fenton and s fenton cao in addition the residual calcium compounds were proven to be caso4 in the dry sludge seen in fig 7 thereby it could be determined that the decrease of as iii in the gasification stage was not caused by the redox reaction but by the lower thermal stability of as iii with residual iron calcium compounds compared to as v 4 conclusions this work clarified the effects of fenton cao composite conditioning on as chemistry throughout sludge dewatering thermal drying and steam gasification processes the results showed that in the dewatering process only 59 1 of as in raw sludge was fixed in sludge cake all of which existed in the form of as iii in fenton pre oxidation as in the filtrate was partly adsorbed onto amorphous fe oh 3 derived by fenton s reagent and as v was reduced to as iii because the excessive fe ii lowered the eh of sludge when adding cao subsequently arsenic fixation rate reached 100 due to the strengthened adsorption capacity of amorphous fe oh 3 and the adsorbed as iii dma was directly oxidized or demethylated so that their proportion in dewatered sludge decreased by 50 and 43 in the drying process the as iii in dewatered raw sludge could not be oxidized at any temperature instead 30 of the rest as iii in fenton cao conditioned sludge was further converted to as v at 120 180 c because the feooh and cao derived from the residual fe ca conditioners could act as a catalyst or directly react with as iii to promote its oxidation in the steam gasification process 26 8 57 3 of the residual as in the dried raw sludge was released with flue gas emission this proportion was reduced by up to 86 0 in fenton cao conditioned sludge by forming stable fe ca as thermal stability fe as ca as as v proportion almost reached 100 in gasification ash and only the very little residual as iii escaped into the gas phase declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16226,in sludge disposal arsenic as poses serious secondary pollution due to its high toxicity and low stability this work systematically studied the effects of fenton cao composite conditioning on as chemistry throughout sludge dewatering thermal drying and steam gasification processes the experimental results showed that for raw sludge 40 9 of as was released with filtrate discharging and 26 8 57 3 emitted with flue gas emission when sludge was conditioned by fenton cao all of the as in the filtrate was fixed in the sludge cake and the releasing rate of gaseous as was reduced by up to 86 0 furthermore the comprehensive results of the model compounds experiment sequential extraction and thermodynamic calculations revealed the effects of fe ca conditioners on as species evolution in the fenton pre oxidation as v was reduced to as iii due to the decreasing eh caused by the excessive fe ii after adding cao as iii dma dimethyl arsenic was adsorbed onto the surface of amorphous fe oh 3 that was introduced by fenton s reagent 50 and 43 of which were then oxidized or demethylated to form as v mma monomethyl arsenic respectively in the following drying process at 120 180 c the feooh and cao derived by residual fe ca conditioners could promote the oxidation of 30 of the rest as iii by the catalytic effect or directly reacting with it in the final steam gasification process the very little as iii left in the dry sludge was released with the gas phase and the proportion of as v in gasification ash almost reached 100 in short fenton cao composite conditioning could achieve the near zero emission of as and reduce the toxicity of the products throughout the whole sludge treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge fenton cao arsenic dewatering thermal drying steam gasification 1 introduction municipal sewage sludge is an important by product of the wastewater treatment process along with the rapid development of the chinese social economy and the gradual enhancement of public environmental awareness the wastewater treatment capacity increased rapidly leading to a substantial increase in sludge production the sludge contains high moisture content rich organic matter and various harmful substances such as pathogenic microorganisms refractory organics heavy metals and trace elements to achieve sludge disposal and resource utilization simultaneously it is often subjected to pretreatments such as conditioning dewatering and drying for moisture removal followed by thermal means like gasification which are usually employed to realize the conversion of sludge to energy it is noteworthy that pathogenic microorganisms and refractory organics can be completely decomposed at a sufficiently high temperature whereas heavy metals and trace elements cannot be eliminated especially some unstable trace elements are prone to change forms and release into the environment along with the sludge treatment processes posing a threat to the environment and human health gayathri et al 2021 arsenic is a typical representative among all the trace elements in sludge due to its highest mobility factor dai et al 2019 and remarkable emission risk in energy utilization only weaker than hg chanaka udayanga et al 2018 arsenic existed in various species in sludge duker et al 2005 it is commonly recognized that inorganic arsenic like as iii and as v is the predominant species in sludge and the former is more toxic siddiqui and chaudhry 2017 some of the inorganic arsenic may also undergo methylation and become relatively less toxicity organic species such as monomethyl arsenic mma and dimethyl arsenic dma andrianisa et al 2008 for more information about the toxicity level of different arsenic species please see table s1 in the supplementary material apart from poisonousness the arsenic accumulation transformation in pretreatments and the release behavior in subsequent thermal treatments also varied widely with its species therefore the arsenic chemistry including its distribution and species needs to be fully explored during the whole process of sludge conditioning dewatering thermal drying and steam gasification in the conditioning and dewatering process the applied conditioners are the most important influencing factor however most current studies used model arsenic solutions rather than actual wastewater or sewage sludge to carry out their experiments for example iron based compounds are commonly used conditioners and may contribute to arsenic immobilization mukherjee et al 2016 reported that alpha fe2o3 showed a high arsenic adsorption capacity of 38 48 mg g at the best operating condition in the standard as v solution roy et al 2021 proved that fe 0 electrocoagulation combined with biological oxidation could effectively remove as iii in simulated groundwater to who guidelines by generating reactive fe iii precipitates tang et al 2017 used fe fe2o3 nanobunches to deal with the arsenic in wastewater the as iii removal efficiency reached 92 and still remained to be 78 after 9 times of cycling beside the calcium compound is another kind of frequently used conditioner which also works on arsenic fixation according to the study of bothe and brown 1999 lime addition could decrease arsenic activity in model arsenic solutions by producing calcium arsenates such as ca5 aso4 3oh with low solubility dai et al 2019 demonstrated that the mobility factor of arsenic in sludge conditioned by modified phosphogypsum containing plenty of caso4 and acetic acid decreased from 0 15 to 0 01 the mobility factor of cd cr cu pb zn and ni also decreased to below 0 05 zhang et al 2019 found that 99 64 of arsenic in aqueous solution could be removed by using caco3 coupled with feso4 the literature above showed that a large number of iron calcium compounds of different forms have great effects on arsenic immobilization additionally the fenton cao composite conditioning which was proposed first in our previous studies can realize satisfactory sludge dewatering performance liu et al 2014 2012 2013 and has been certified by many other researchers dai et al 2017 liang et al 2015 mo et al 2015 this composite conditioning process can bring many iron calcium compounds into the sludge but the possible formation of these compounds and their combined effects on arsenic immobilization in the actual sludge were not clear in the subsequent thermal drying and steam gasification process the residual iron calcium conditioners probably continue to play a role in arsenic transformation but few relative studies were reported under the drying temperature of 105 and 300 c weng et al 2014 claimed that arsenic tended to bind with those minerals in sludge with the loss of bound water and its species was converted from acid soluble reducible fraction into a more stable form residual fraction when the temperature further raised to gasification level around 900 c and above no direct study is found but there is still some evidence to support the potential influence of residual iron calcium compounds on arsenic immobilization the results of zhao et al 2018 fu et al 2019 and xie et al 2021 were in favor of the conclusion that calcium compounds in sludge could enhance arsenic retention via condensation and or adsorption during the sludge co incineration han et al 2017 also found that in the sludge pyrolysis which was similar to the devolatilization stage of the gasification process arsenic releasing rate in sludge conditioned by cao did not show a growing trend even when temperature increased from 450 to 850 c and was always lower than that in raw sludge in addition liu et al 2019 reported that fe2o3 had a positive impact on reactions between cao and arsenic to inhibit its volatilization during the sludge co incineration song et al 2021 and zhao et al 2017 showed that iron compounds could facilitate the oxidation of arsenic by forming various arsenates during sludge incineration in general the existing studies focused on arsenic transformation in thermal treatments like incineration or pyrolysis the reaction path of arsenic and the roles of residual iron calcium conditioners during sludge thermal drying and steam gasification were still poorly understood because of the complex conversion behaviors of the fenton cao system the form changes of iron calcium compounds may be different from those described in the literature and the fate of arsenic was also unknown in our previous studies an innovative method has been proposed for sludge dewatering drying gasification and adsorbent preparation for sulfur and nitrogen odor simultaneously by using fenton cao composite conditioning liu et al 2014 2013 2016 yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 thus this research aims to explore the arsenic chemistry in the whole process of sludge treatment using fenton cao composite conditioning in particular the total arsenic distribution and its species in the products of each process were quantified the combined effects of iron calcium conditioners on arsenic evolution were also clarified by using model compounds experiments principal component regression thermodynamic calculation and sequential extraction 2 material and methods 2 1 sludge samples the raw sludge rs sample was secondary sludge obtained from a wastewater treatment plant in wuhan china and stored at 4 c for further experiments the moisture content of the sludge was 97 9 and the organic matter dry basis was 52 5 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 sludge conditioning and dewatering process the effects of fenton cao conditioning on arsenic migration and transformation were investigated using different dosages of fe2 feso4 and cao table s2 in supplementary materials unit mg g ds a typical conditioning process contains fenton pre oxidation mixing with fe2 for 30 s and h2o2 for 5 min and cao conditioning blending with cao for 5 min successively the conditioned sludge was called s fex s fex caoy respectively x y are the dosage of the corresponding reagents for the further dewatering process sludge dewatering was carried out in our self designed multi unit filtration system shown in fig s1 which was convenient to handle multiple samples at the same time conditioned sludge was poured into a brinell funnel with a filter and then exposed to a negative pressure of 0 08 mpa created by a vacuum pump until the sludge cake cracked or no filtrate flowed down sludge cake and filtrate were collected separately for further examinations 2 2 2 sludge drying process table s2 demonstrated the best conditioning formulas for the further drying process and the corresponding conditioned sludge was named rs s fenton s cao and s fenton cao each sludge sample was dried to a constant weight at 60 70 80 120 150 180 c and then collected for subsequent testing 2 2 3 sludge gasification experiments sludge gasification experiments were carried out in a fixed bed gasifier heated by an electrothermal furnace at 600 800 1000 c since gasification was generally regarded as an extension to the pyrolysis process chanaka udayanga et al 2018 syed hassan et al 2017 decoupling experiments were designed to obtain char and ash samples separately to reveal the arsenic behaviors in the devolatilization stage and char gasification stage respectively to get char samples 1 l min ar was used 5 g sludge samples were tiled as a thin layer in a quartz boat and then put into the center of a heated gasifier for each batch the reaction time was set as 20 min after the reaction the quartz boat was towed back to the water cooling zone for sample collection to obtain gasification ash additional steam would be pumped into the furnace at the flow rate of 0 2 g min and the reaction time was extended to 60 min the gasification bench and the discussion about the char samples were demonstrated in fig s2 and text s1 separately all the experiments mentioned above were repeated three times to guarantee the validity of the results 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 determination of arsenic in sludge the arsenic content was measured by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy afs arsenic species as iii as v mma and dma was tested using afs coupled with high performance liquid chromatography more detailed information could be seen in text s2 moreover a sequential extraction method was applied to uncover the binding forms of arsenic in solid products hu et al 2015 pantuzzo and ciminelli 2010 extraction steps for ca bound fe al bound and silicon bound arsenic were listed in table s3 2 4 arsenic model compounds experiments model compounds experiments were designed to better understand the mechanism of fenton cao conditioning on arsenic transformation in the dewatering process seen in table s4 conditioners were directly added into standard solutions of different arsenic species as iii as v mma and dma instead of sludge and then the original dewatering procedure was followed the precipitate was freeze dried and then sent to analyze its arsenic species together with the filtrate 2 4 1 composition analysis of sludge and residual conditioners the blank conditioning groups in table s4 were used to monitor the residual conditioners in the sludge cake the precipitate of blank conditioning groups of fenton and fenton cao conditioning were collected some of them were freeze dried and the rest was dried at 60 70 80 120 150 180 c respectively the dried solids were ground into powder for subsequent testing the residual iron calcium substances in the precipitates of blank groups were detected by x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro panalytical b c the content of different valence states of iron was tested using the phenanthroline spectrophotometry method gendel and lahav 2008 the composition of each sludge sample was tested by x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf america edax eagle iii 2 4 2 principal component regression analysis the principal component regression method was employed by spss 26 0 software to further reflect the correlation between arsenic transformation and the key influencing factors in the dewatering and drying process in detail the key influencing factors were defined as original variables considering these original variables were not independent of each other the principal component analysis method was used to eliminate their collinearity and got the principal component variables these variables were regarded as independent variables for multiple linear regression analysis finally according to the scoring coefficient matrix the original influencing factors were substituted back into the regression equation and a new regression model of the key influencing factors of arsenic transformation was obtained this method could avoid the influence of variable correlation so the coefficients of key influencing factors in the new regression model could reflect their net contribution to arsenic transformation 2 4 3 thermodynamic equilibrium calculation factsage 6 0 was used to calculate the thermodynamic equilibrium concerning the eh ph diagram for the system fe as h2o hsc chemistry 6 0 was used to calculate the possible reaction pathways of arsenic transformation during the sludge gasification process 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic transformation in the dewatering process 3 1 1 arsenic distribution in dewatered products with fenton cao conditioning arsenic contents in the sludge cake and filtrate were displayed in fig 1 fig 1 a showed that nearly 40 9 of arsenic in raw sludge existed in the filtrate this part of arsenic was almost completely stabilized in the sludge cake with the addition of fe2 s fe50 but arsenic began to slightly dissolve into the filtrate when fe2 dosage was greater than 50 mg g ds demonstrating the weakened arsenic stabilization ability of fenton pre oxidation after adding different doses of cao arsenic always accumulated in the sludge cake fig 1 b showing the great immobilization effect of fenton cao conditioning to further study the dosages changes of conditioners for arsenic fixation the following section focused on the relationship between arsenic content and changes of key factors affecting arsenic transformation caused by fenton cao conditioning 3 1 2 correlation between total arsenic distribution and key influencing factors since the arsenic transformation behaviors largely depended on sludge physicochemical properties such as oxidation reduction environment eh ph ascar et al 2008 carbonell barrachina et al 2000 and iron species like fe ii fe iii lakshmanan et al 2010 andrianisa et al 2008 they were selected as the key factors affecting arsenic transformation considering that these factors were not independent of each other it was difficult to judge their influence degree directly therefore the principal component regression method was used to establish multiple regression equations for the arsenic content in sludge cake and filtrate e g total as cake 0 18 ph 0 71 eh 0 65 fe ii cake 0 23 fe iii cake r2 0 99 the coefficients of these four factors were listed in table 1 to reflect their net contributions to the total arsenic distribution e g for arsenic accumulation in sludge cake the contribution of each key influencing factors were eh fe ii cake fe iii cake ph during the fenton pre oxidation the changes of eh and fe ii whose coefficients were 0 68 and 0 54 for total as filtrate r2 0 97 respectively were the most significant factors affecting arsenic accumulation table 1 the eh changes of the conditioned sludge were listed in table 2 as arsenic in filtrate decreased from 40 9 s fe0 to 0 9 s fe50 eh increased from 140 mv to its maximum value of 510 mv simultaneously showing a good negative correlation ascar et al 2008 also reported the weakened mobility of arsenic in the soil under high eh conditions the arsenic re leaching was mainly attributed to fe ii changes the excessive fe2 led to the migration of fe ii species into filtrate rather than solid when fe2 dosage exceeded 50 mg g ds fig 2 a parts of the adsorbed arsenic also dissolved with these iron containing species carbonell barrachina et al 2000 yamaguchi et al 2011 thus leading to the increase of arsenic content in the filtrate after the addition of cao the most important factors affecting arsenic accumulation turned out to be fe iii changes with the coefficient of 0 59 for total as cake r2 0 96 table 1 fe iii accounted for the major part of iron in fenton cao conditioned sludge 68 fig 2 b and was believed to be the host phase of arsenic in the form of amorphous fe oh 3 carbonell barrachina et al 2000 yamaguchi et al 2011 although the proportion of fe iii kept decreasing from s fe50 ca0 to s fe50 ca60 the arsenic dissolved into the filtrate was negligible implying that fe iii hydroxides produced in fenton cao process might have better adsorption capacity 3 1 3 arsenic species in sludge cakes with fenton cao conditioning apart from the arsenic distribution in dewatered products the control of toxic arsenic species also needed to be considered since most of the arsenic tended to accumulate in the solid the sludge cakes were selected to analyze their species distribution as shown in fig 3 the as iii in sludge cake was oxidized into as v from s fe0 to s fe50 fig 3 a however as v continuously changed back to as iii after the turning point of s fe50 indicating that excessive fe ii was unfavorable for the arsenic transformation to less toxic forms as for organic arsenic the mma content reached its maximum at the same turning point of s fe50 and then continued to decline while the opposite law was generally found for dma hence dma might undergo a demethylation reaction to generate mma before the turning point but then this reaction was inhibited in comparison after adding cao as v was no longer reduced to as iii and its content kept growing from 2 65 to 3 45 mg g ds fig 3 b this result showed that fenton cao conditioning could make the as iii oxidation much easier thereby reducing the toxicity of products the content of mma and dma kept on declining from s fe50 ca0 to s fe50 ca60 implying that dma and mma experienced a stronger demethylation reaction and finally decomposed to understand the mechanism behind the complex transformation behaviors of as iii as v and dma mma the correlation analysis between arsenic species and key influencing factors was also needed 3 1 4 correlation between arsenic species and key influencing factors table 1 summarized the coefficients of the ph eh and fe ii fe iii content of the conditioned sludge to demonstrate their net contributions on arsenic species changes using the principal component regression method as for fenton pre oxidation eh and fe ii changes were believed to be able to explain the different arsenic transformation behaviors before and after the turning point of s fe50 table 1 the experimental results of eh in table 2 showed an increasing trend from s fe0 to s fe50 which might be owing to oh with strong oxidizing ability generated by fenton reaction this oxidation environment was responsible for the conversion of as iii to as v and the demethylation of dma to produce mma fig 3 a the reduction reaction of as v to as iii and the inhibition of the demethylation reaction of dma to mma were mainly attributed to fe ii changes from s fe50 to s fe100 fe ii had already appeared in the filtrate in s fe50 indicating a completed fenton reaction fig 2 a further addition of fe2 only increased fe ii in the filtrate and thus decreasing the eh values therefore the conversion of dma to mma slowed down and as v was reduced to as iii the conversion tendency of as v to as iii also agreed with the calculation results in fig s3 under the same eh and ph conditions from s fe50 to s fe100 when it comes to fenton cao conditioning eh ph and fe iii all had noticeable effects on arsenic transformation and their influence degree was generally eh ph fe iii table 1 however the arsenic conversion process seemed not to match up with the changes of these three key factors in particular the growing trend of as v and the decomposition of dma mma in fenton cao conditioning indicated a more oxidizing environment fig 3 b on the contrary the results in table 2 displayed significantly decreased eh values and increased ph fe iii content also went down fig 2 b from s fe50 ca0 to s fe50 ca60 all of these changes pointed to an inhibited fenton reaction and a weakening oxidizing environment a possible reason for this contradiction was that the fenton cao conditioning could reduce the threshold of arsenic oxidation thus making it easier to occur and further investigation was needed to verify this deduction 3 1 5 arsenic oxidation mechanism during fenton cao conditioning to avoid the interference of complex components in the sludge the model compounds experiment was designed to better explore the mechanism of fenton cao conditioning to reduce the arsenic oxidation threshold the results in fig 4 showed that all the as iii was oxidized to as v whether in fenton or fenton cao conditioning it was noticed that the percentage of as v 77 8 left in precipitate in fenton pre oxidation was more than that of as v oxidized from as iii only 55 3 fig 4 a this phenomenon suggested that as iii in the sludge possibly tended to be adsorbed by amorphous fe oh 3 first and then oxidized to as v on the surface of these hydroxides other researchers also reported that the adsorption degree of as v was always higher than that of as iii under similar conditions using fecl3 lakshmanan et al 2010 qiao et al 2012 which further supported our experimental conclusion however the proportion of as v oxidized by as iii in the precipitate reached 100 after cao addition which was much more than that of fenton pre oxidation fig 4 a this increase of as v oxidized by as iii verified that fenton cao conditioning enhanced the adsorption capacity of the raw as iii in fe iii hydroxides even though fe iii content was decreasing considering the eh value was decreasing at the same time in fenton cao conditioning the adsorbed as iii on fe iii hydroxides must be easier to be oxidized into as v than dissociative as iii see in fig s4 during fenton reaction eqs 1 7 oh and ho2 with strong oxidizing property were continuously generated under the catalytic effects of fe ii fe iii system because the chemical reaction rate were much faster than the diffusion rate of oh and ho2 the concentration of these oxidizing radicals would be relatively higher in the region near the fe ii fe iii system as a result as iii dma were more easier to contact and react with the oxidizing radicals than that in filtrate after they were adsorbed onto the surface of fe iii in fenton cao composite conditioning the addition of cao promote the adsorption capacity of fe iii on as iii dma so that the oxidation demethylation reaction were further enhanced that was the explanation for the contradiction between the growing trend of as v and the changes of eh ph and fe iii in fenton cao conditioning the above mechanism could also explain the decomposition of dma and mma in fig 3 during the fenton cao conditioning the adsorption of dma and mma on fe iii hydroxides was strengthened fig 4 a hence the demethylation reaction became more drastic and dma mma could even directly remove all the methyl groups to produce other forms of arsenic the sum of all the arsenic species in the filtrate fig 4 b and precipitates fig 4 a derived from the raw mma and raw dma was less than 100 in fenton cao conditioning which confirmed the decomposition of dma and mma 3 2 arsenic transformation in the drying process 3 2 1 arsenic species in dry sludge as an effective method to remove residual water after the dewatering process thermal drying was widely used to meet the standards of the subsequent sludge treatment process but the arsenic transformation behavior was poorly understood in this process fig 5 illustrated the effects of drying temperature and residual conditioners on arsenic species changes the arsenic transformation behavior was exactly the opposite in different ranges of drying temperature 60 80 c compared with 120 180 c during 60 80 c as v was constantly reduced to as iii whether in rs s fenton s cao or s fenton cao even under the increasing temperature this result was due to the sulfur nitrogen containing odors with strong reducing ability produced by the decomposition of organic compounds e g protein in the drying process for detailed explanation please see text s3 and table s5 on the contrary over 30 of as iii in all the conditioned sludge was converted into as v as the temperature further increased from 120 to 180 c indicating the strengthened oxidation effect in the high temperature drying compared with rs whose as iii content remained unchanged under 120 180 c this phenomenon verified the necessity of the residual conditioners on the strengthened oxidation effect a similar strengthened reduction effect could also be observed in 60 80 c during which the conversion rate of as v to as iii in conditioned sludge was 1 21 3 higher than rs the organic arsenic did not show an obvious transformation trend during the drying process 3 2 2 correlation between arsenic species and key influencing factors to further evaluate the synergistic effect of residual conditioners in different temperature ranges the contributions of drying temperature and fe iii changes which was regarded as the host phase of arsenic were calculated and their coefficients were listed in table 3 in the range of 60 80 c the coefficients of temperature only became significant in s fenton and s fenton cao from 120 to 180 c the difference between the temperature coefficients and the fe iii coefficients also tended to be greater in the presence of residual iron introduced from the conditioning process for example the temperature coefficients of as iii changes were approximately 5 times bigger than the fe iii coefficients in s fenton while for rs it was only 2 times hence the residual iron compounds acted as a catalyst to promote the as iii oxidation with o2 in the air the results of fe ii fe iii distribution in dry sludge in fig 6 could further support this deduction the fe iii content in rs and s cao presented a sudden increase with the drying temperature range increasing from 60 80 c to 120 180 c while that in s fenton and s fenton cao almost kept unchanged compared with fig 5 it was obvious that the variation tendency of as iii as v was completely inconsistent with the fe iii fe ii change this result proved that it was the presence rather than the content of residual iron containing species that mattered for arsenic transformation as for s cao without iron conditioners the oxidation of as iii was also observed which was owing to the strengthened oxidation reaction with the existence of cao for more explanation please see text s4 table s6 additionally the different moisture content of rs and the conditioned sludge was proved to have little contribution on arsenic species transformation for more discussion please see text s5 and table s7 3 2 3 the forms of residual iron calcium conditioners to explore which component of the residual conditioners played the catalytic role for arsenic transformation during the drying process xrd testing was carried out using blank conditioning groups of fenton and fenton cao conditioning respectively the samples were listed in table s4 and the results were shown in fig 7 the obvious peak of fenton pre oxidation residuals did not appear until the drying temperature reached 180 c and the active ingredient with the catalysis effect in residual iron conditioners was proved to be feooh fig 7 a because the fe iii hydrolysis products generated in fenton reaction were mainly amorphous iron hydroxide cai et al 2020 almost nothing could be detected from fenton wet to fenton 150 c by xrd the active hydroxyl groups on feooh might contribute to the oxidation of adsorbed as iii at 120 180 c beside only caso4 nh2o could be found in s fenton cao fig 7 b indicating that cao hindered the crystallization process of feooh thus making it hard to be detected thereby the mechanism of fenton cao conditioning on arsenic transformation during sludge dewatering and drying process was demonstrated in fig 8 during the fenton cao conditioning fe iii produced by fenton reaction could be hydrolyzed to form amorphous fe oh 3 with strong adsorption capacity the addition of cao neutralized ph which further promoted the generation of amorphous fe oh 3 and its ability to adsorb arsenic compounds more as iii was thereby adsorbed into the amorphous fe oh 3 and its oxidation reaction was proved more easier to carry out even under negative eh values as a result arsenic in the sludge cake of s fenton cao was mainly as v dma and mma also experienced the same process and took place more violent demethylation reaction on the surface of amorphous fe oh 3 in the subsequent drying process the amorphous fe oh 3 was gradually dehydrated and crystallized into feooh the active hydroxyl group on feooh continued to affect the residual adsorbed as iii and dma making them more sensitive to the be oxidized by air under 120 180 c the alkaline environment provided by cao also had the same ability to reduce the activation energy of arsenic oxidation 3 3 arsenic transformation in the steam gasification process 3 3 1 arsenic stabilization effect of fenton cao conditioning compared to the dewatering and drying process sludge gasification was the most important process that caused the concentrated release of arsenic however few studies about the arsenic release in the gasification process are reported the effects of reaction conditions residual conditioners and the binding forms of arsenic in the pretreatment process on arsenic transformation during steam gasification were also poorly understood chanaka udayanga et al 2018 syed hassan et al 2017 to investigate the arsenic release behavior during sludge steam gasification the gasification process was divided into the devolatilization stage and the char gasification stage the increment of arsenic retention rates in the corresponding char and ash samples of conditioned sludge were determined in table 4 the arsenic stabilization effect of s fenton was better than that of rs in the devolatilization stage but this effect declined gradually in the char gasification stage this result indicated that arsenic bound with residual iron species was less stable in the presence of steam in contrast the arsenic in s cao always had a higher retention rate throughout the gasification process therefore arsenic bound with residual iron conditioners might have lower stability than that with residual calcium in the char gasification stage as a result the temperature for the highest arsenic control co effect in s fenton cao dropped from 800 to 600 c with the steam addition 3 3 2 binding forms of arsenic in gasification products to confirm the arsenic combining tendency with the residual iron calcium conditioners during the gasification process it is necessary to figure out the arsenic binding forms in gasification products the partition experiment was carried out on ash samples of s fenton with a lower arsenic immobilization effect the results were compared with char samples of s cao with a superior arsenic immobilization effect fig s5 for the ash samples of s fenton fe al bound arsenic was transferred into ca bound arsenic from 600 to 800 c verifying ca bound arsenic had greater stability than fe bound arsenic for the char samples of s cao however more arsenic was found to bind with fe al from 600 to 1000 c several studies have reported a similar phenomenon that the released arsenic could be re adsorbed by fe al oxides during the extraction process of calcite bound arsenic costagliola et al 2013 hu et al 2015 as a result the fraction of fe al bound arsenic was greatly overestimated and it was calcite bound arsenic that accounted for the major part in the char samples of s cao the results in table s8 also showed that the fe al content in dry s cao was the lowest among all the sludge samples so that it is calcium species rather than fe al was the host phase of arsenic in s cao to further confirm the stability of the binding strength between arsenic and residual iron calcium fig 9 represented the arsenic binding forms of all samples under the highest gasification temperature of 1000 c the predominant fe al bound arsenic in dry sludge of s fenton and s fenton cao all gradually escaped as the gasification process continued the ca bound phase and residual phase became the main arsenic species in s cao and rs respectively indicating that the stability of different arsenic forms was ca bound residual fe al bound 3 3 3 arsenic species in solid residuals to further investigate the mechanism of the arsenic transformation in the gasification process arsenic species in different gasification products were described in fig 10 in the devolatilization stage the proportion of as iii in s fenton and s fenton cao was more than that in rs and s cao implying a more reductive environment this result was attributed to the better promotion effect of residual iron on the generation of reductive gas like h2 than that of residual calcium conditioners which had been proved in our previous studies liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however as iii nearly disappeared in all ash samples in the char gasification stage there were two possible reasons for this phenomenon i as iii was oxidized to as v by steam or residual iron conditioners in the sludge ii the thermal stability of as iii with residual iron or calcium conditioners was much weaker than that of as v making the former easier to release in the char gasification stage further investigation should be carried out to confirm the reason for the great decline of as iii in the char gasification stage 3 3 4 arsenic transformation mechanism in char gasification stage considering the commonly recognized relationship between iron and arsenic the iron distribution in solid residuals of s fenton and s fenton cao was analyzed as shown in fig 11 it could be seen that only a small amount of fe ii could be oxidized into fe iii during the char gasification stage whose variation trend was inconsistent with the abrupt decrease of as iii obviously fe ii was impossible to be the oxidizing agent for as iii therefore the decrease of as iii in the gasification stage was unrelated to fe ii fe iii distribution changes apart from residual iron species steam might also present oxidization ability under high temperatures and caused the decrease of as iii in ash samples the possible reactions of as iii oxidized by steam with typical iron and calcium compounds under gasification temperature were assessed using hsc chemistry 6 0 table s9 the calculation results showed that as iii is difficult to be oxidized by steam except for the existence of cao or caco3 according to table s8 calcium compounds only accounted for a very small proportion in rs s fenton and s fenton cao in addition the residual calcium compounds were proven to be caso4 in the dry sludge seen in fig 7 thereby it could be determined that the decrease of as iii in the gasification stage was not caused by the redox reaction but by the lower thermal stability of as iii with residual iron calcium compounds compared to as v 4 conclusions this work clarified the effects of fenton cao composite conditioning on as chemistry throughout sludge dewatering thermal drying and steam gasification processes the results showed that in the dewatering process only 59 1 of as in raw sludge was fixed in sludge cake all of which existed in the form of as iii in fenton pre oxidation as in the filtrate was partly adsorbed onto amorphous fe oh 3 derived by fenton s reagent and as v was reduced to as iii because the excessive fe ii lowered the eh of sludge when adding cao subsequently arsenic fixation rate reached 100 due to the strengthened adsorption capacity of amorphous fe oh 3 and the adsorbed as iii dma was directly oxidized or demethylated so that their proportion in dewatered sludge decreased by 50 and 43 in the drying process the as iii in dewatered raw sludge could not be oxidized at any temperature instead 30 of the rest as iii in fenton cao conditioned sludge was further converted to as v at 120 180 c because the feooh and cao derived from the residual fe ca conditioners could act as a catalyst or directly react with as iii to promote its oxidation in the steam gasification process 26 8 57 3 of the residual as in the dried raw sludge was released with flue gas emission this proportion was reduced by up to 86 0 in fenton cao conditioned sludge by forming stable fe ca as thermal stability fe as ca as as v proportion almost reached 100 in gasification ash and only the very little residual as iii escaped into the gas phase declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16227,the global increase in the construction of reservoirs has drawn attention given its documented hydrological and biogeochemical impacts on downstream rivers however the impact of reservoirs on downstream pco2 partial pressure of carbon dioxide is still poorly understood to evaluate these impacts the interactions between reservoirs and their corresponding upstream and downstream rivers were analyzed for three reservoirs in the seine basin based on monthly measurement during two hydrological years the seasonal variations of water quality in the reservoirs were mainly driven by the entering water and the biogeochemical processes occurring in the reservoirs our results unravel the crucial role of reservoir in downstream water quality which significantly increased doc dissolved organic carbon and bdoc biodegradable doc concentrations while lowered dsi dissolved silica concentrations during emptying period p 0 01 furthermore the impacts of reservoirs on the annual fluxes of doc bdoc and dsi were quantified and suggested that the three reservoirs respectively increased 20 and 23 of annual fluxes of doc and bdoc while decreased 33 of annual dsi fluxes in their downstream rivers additionally the reservoirs significantly decreased downstream riverine pco2 p 0 01 and enhanced the gas transfer coefficient of co2 in downstream rivers by 1 3 times during the emptying period which highlights the necessity to consider the potential impact of reservoirs on riverine co2 emissions overall our results highlight the importance of combining biogeochemical and hydrological characteristics to understand the impacts of reservoirs on downstream rivers and emphasize the need of similar studies under the current context of increasing reservoir constructions graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words reservoirs seine basin downstream river water quality partial pressure of co2 1 introduction the increase in reservoirs has been well reported since recent decades due to its benefits and capacities in hydroelectric generation irrigation water supply and downstream water flow regulation garnier et al 1999 lehner et al 2011 however concerns and ongoing debates still exist to date given their resulting socioenvironmental costs bertassoli et al 2021 harrison 2019 hermoso et al 2019 muller 2019 for instance reservoirs can significantly alter the flow regime vörösmarty et al 1997 by shifting rivers from free flowing systems to lentic and lotic systems of high discontinuity ward and stanford 1995 such altered hydrological transport together with the resulting changes in biogeochemical processes can further change the downstream water quality maavara et al 2020b many studies have revealed the reservoir derived changes in nutrient retention elimination akbarzadeh et al 2019 garnier et al 1999 maavara et al 2014 2015b 2017 yan et al 2021a nutrient bioavailability chen et al 2020 and stoichiometry maavara et al 2020a wang 2020 yang et al 2018 as well as in the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter in downstream rivers he et al 2020 however most of the previous studies that investigated nutrient retentions in reservoirs were calculated by mass balance e g garnier et al 1999 yan et al 2021a and modeling methods e g mechanistic models for global estimation see akbarzadeh et al 2019 maavara et al 2014 and little attention has been paid to related processes e g hydrological characteristics and biogeochemical processes occurring in the reservoirs in addition to the hydrological and biogeochemical effects ghg greenhouse gas emission from reservoirs is another concern which is partially responsible for the climatic change giles 2006 from a global perspective ghg emissions from reservoirs were estimated as 773 tg co2 carbon dioxide equivalents yr 1 330 tg c yr 1 suggesting reservoirs as critical sources of ghg deemer et al 2016 co2 one of the crucial components of ghg has been extensively studied around the world regarding its flux from reservoirs numerous studies have contributed to the estimation of global annual co2 emissions from reservoirs with the reported different magnitudes ranging from 36 8 to 272 7 tg c yr 1 deemer et al 2016 yan et al 2021b the high uncertainty of co2 emissions from global reservoirs indicates the necessity for future field measurements of co2 emissions in regional reservoirs which are critical to understand the behavior of co2 emissions from multiple reservoir settings and conditions bertassoli et al 2021 however current studies of co2 emissions from reservoirs have mainly focused on co2 exchange at the water air interface in the reservoirs soued and prairie 2020 while little attention has been paid to simultaneous co2 emissions and concentrations in their upstream and downstream rivers although it has been acknowledged that overall rivers are sources of co2 raymond et al 2013 less is known about the potential impact of reservoirs on riverine co2 concentrations and emissions liu et al 2016 a previous modeling approach suggested that the reservoirs in the seine basin lowered the dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity of downstream rivers marescaux et al 2020 two variables closely related to co2 concentration however further research on co2 dynamics is still required to provide direct evidence to identify the underlying mechanisms regarding the impact of these reservoirs on co2 in downstream rivers the marne aube and seine reservoirs in the seine basin france share the same water management strategy for flood control and low flow support garnier et al 2000 1999 but differ from most reservoirs built on the stretches of river as they were diverted from their related rivers and connected with the rivers by artificial canals the annual shift in hydrological characteristics due to the emptying and filling operations allows the co existence of multiple biogeochemical processes in reservoirs specifically the development of phytoplankton in the reservoirs which potentially drives the changes in nutrient concentrations and pco2 partial pressure of co2 by analyzing the monthly observations in these three reservoirs their upstream and downstream rivers we seek to identify and quantify the impact of three reservoirs on pco2 and nutrient concentrations on downstream rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites three reservoirs are located in the upstream of the seine basin france fig 1 a in mixed land use catchments that are dominated by forest 40 54 agricultural land 38 48 and fringed by grassland 5 18 the lithological characteristics of the three reservoirs are clay garnier et al 1999 yan et al 2021a the marne storage capacity of 350 m m3 aube 170 m m3 and seine 208 m m3 reservoirs were built in diversion of the marne aube and seine rivers in 1974 1990 and 1966 respectively according to the upstream hydrological characteristics the three reservoirs are filled from december to june of the following year filling period prevent flooding and emptied from july to november emptying period support low water flows in downstream the variation of volume in the reservoirs is directly related to water management objectives and is fully controlled by specific filling and emptying operations using artificial penstock canals garnier et al 1999 more information on three reservoirs can be found on the seine grand lacs website sgl http seinegrandslacs fr 2 2 sampling strategy and measurements monthly field campaigns were conducted since 2019 for approximately two hydrological cycles of the reservoirs a total of nine sampling sites were selected in the upstream and downstream rivers and inside the three reservoirs fig 1 table s1 for each site surface water samples were taken with a bucket from bridges or pontoons and 5 l high density polyethylene sampling bottles were filled all samples were conditioned e g filtration and kept at 10 c in the field after returning to the laboratory they were stored at 4 c or frozen until the analysis in addition ph t water temperature c and do dissolved oxygen mg l 1 were measured on the field using a multiparameter instrument ysi 6600 v2 co2 sampling and measurements were realized on the field 30 ml of water was kept in four syringes 60 ml with 30 ml of ambient air and were shaken for 10 min a fifth syringe was filled with ambient air to measure the atmospheric pco2 the pco2 in water was determined through a non dispersive infrared gas analyzer licor li 820 usa using the syringe headspace equilibrium method in the field abril et al 2015 marescaux et al 2018a the gas analyzer was calibrated with standard co2 800 ppm and co2 free dinitrogen the pco2 in water was then calculated based on the pco2 measured in the equilibrated headspace of the syringes and in the atmosphere wanninkhof 2014 in the laboratory filtered water samples gf f 0 7 μm grilled at 500 c for 4 h were collected in grilled glass flasks and acidified 0 1 ml h2so4 4 m in 30 ml of water and were then analyzed with a toc analyzer aurora 1030 toc analyzer oi analytical for doc dissolved organic carbon mg l 1 marescaux et al 2018a 2018b doc

according to lorenzen 1967 2 3 calculations 2 3 1 calculations of co2 flux and do saturation the diffusive fluxes of co2 in three reservoirs and rivers were calculated based on the boundary layer

water quality changes in the reservoir the concentrations of water variables in reservoirs were calculated assuming they resulted only from the mixing with the entering water concentrations and without any alteration from biogeochemical processes hereafter named mixing values for this theoretical exercise the daily concentrations of chl a dsi doc and bdoc were derived by a simple linear interpolation based on the monthly measurements their corresponding mixing values in reservoirs were calculated as follows 11 c i c i 1 q i n i 3600 24 c u p i c i 1 v o l i where ci and cup i represent the concentrations of water variable in the reservoir and the upstream rivers in day i respectively ci 1 is the water variable concentrations in the reservoir at the previous day of i qin i is the water discharges m3 s 1 entering reservoir in day i and voli m3 is reservoir volume in day i additionally to quantify the impact of reservoirs on downstream water quality we calculated the annual fluxes of chl a dsi doc and bdoc in downstream rivers under the actual situation with reservoir and the hypothetical situation without reservoir in the actual situation the annual fluxes of the mentioned variables in the downstream were calculated using discharge weighted concentration method moatar and meybeck 2005 yan et al 2021a 12 a f i 1 n c i q i i 1 n q i q m where af is the annual flux of related variable ci is the measured instantaneous concentration value qi is the water discharges associated with ci qm is the average water discharge during the annual water cycle from

reservoirs the revised discharges in the downstream rivers marne and aube were presented in the sm fig s2 in a previous study of the seine reservoirs yan et al 2021 we demonstrate that in the absence of reservoir releases the water quality remains unchanged between upstream and downstream sites ruling out any significant impacts of instream processes or lateral inputs along the river sections between the upstream and downstream sampling stations therefore in the hypothetical situation of no reservoir downstream water quality was assumed to be similar to the upstream one the annual fluxes of chl a dsi doc and bdoc in downstream rivers were calculated by equation 12 2 4 statistical analysis the shapiro wilk method was used to test the normal distribution of the field data before performing statistical analysis the wilcoxon test method was used to identify the impact of the three reservoirs on water quality of downstream rivers during the filling period and emptying period including doc bdoc dsi and pco2 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient was used to identify the relationship between pco2 and sdo and dsi during emptying period in order to avoid the influence of the upstream water entering the reservoirs the criterion of p 0 05 was used to determine statistical significance all of the aforementioned analysis was conducted using r version 3 5 1 r core team 2019 3 result 3 1 water quality in the reservoirs the seasonal variations of volumes and water quality in the three reservoirs showed similar patterns therefore we only presented the marne reservoir as an example fig 2 for seine and aube reservoirs please refer to fig s3 and s4 chl a concentrations in upstream river showed slight variations with values ranging from 2 μg l 1 to 7 μg l 1 in the reservoir high chl a concentrations were found when the reservoir volumes were the lowest during november december fig 2b s3b and s4b and were 4 14 times higher than those in the upstream river chl a concentrations in the reservoir gradually declined from december to march and sustained low concentrations from april to september 2 6 μg l 1 and then increased from october to december comparing the observed chl a concentrations with the corresponding mixing values the former were much higher than the latter during this period the dsi concentrations in the upstream rivers were generally higher than those in the reservoirs fig 2 s3 and s4 dsi concentrations in the reservoirs gradually declined from december to august and increased from september to december when water depth was low in addition the co variation between observations and the mixing values of dsi concentrations was found from october to february however this was followed by continuously declining of dsi concentrations during april july the dynamics of bdoc concentrations in reservoirs which accounted approximately 25 of doc showed synchronous variations with doc concentrations doc and bdoc concentrations in reservoirs decreased from december to march and were close to the mixing values they gradually increased during april november and were higher than the mixing values during april november the seasonal variations of sdo and water temperature in the three reservoirs were generally similar fig 3 overall high sdo 100 was found in summer june july at the end of the filling period when water level and temperature of reservoir were high while low sdo 100 was found in late autumn at the end of emptying period when water level and temperature were low 3 2 seasonal dynamics of pco2 and co2 fluxes pco2 in rivers were higher in summer and lower in winter and were much higher 2000 µatm than that in the reservoirs 1000 µatm fig 4 the pco2 in the reservoirs showed general decline trends during the filling period despite high pco2 supplies by upstream rivers the pco2 continued declining during the early emptying of the reservoirs in september and october but increased during the rest of the emptying period the pco2 in the downstream of marne and aube reservoirs were 1 5 times lower than that in upstream rivers during the emptying period while they were relatively close during the filling period fig 4 in the three reservoirs we found that pco2 negatively correlated to sdo n 32 r 0 61 p 0 01 while positively correlated to dsi during emptying period n 32 r 0 5 p 0 01 in terms of average co2 fluxes all of three reservoirs were sources of co2 to the atmosphere during the study period 04 2019 11 2020 with emission rates of 115 134 mg c m 2 d 1 95 124 mg c m 2 d 1 and 174 305 mg c m 2 d 1 mean sd in the marne aube and seine reservoirs respectively in contrast the mean co2 fluxes in the upstream of marne aube and seine rivers were 2377 536 mg c m 2 d 1 2426 589 mg c m 2 d 1 and 3009 574 mg c m 2 d 1 over the same time period respectively high co2 fluxes were observed in downstream of the marne 1668 652 mg c m 2 d 1 and aube 1961 757 mg c m 2 d 1 rivers in may june while relative lower values 40 50 were found during the emptying period fig 4 3 3 impact of reservoirs on their downstream rivers the comparison of water concentrations between upstream and downstream rivers during the filling and emptying periods revealed that water released from three reservoirs significantly changed downstream pco2 and water quality doc bdoc dsi fig 5 during the filling period almost without any release from the reservoirs no significant difference was found for the water quality and pco2 between the upstream and downstream rivers however the three reservoirs significantly changed downstream water quality and pco2 during emptying period p 0 01 i e increasing doc and bdoc concentrations while decreasing dsi concentrations and pco2 of downstream rivers furthermore the impacts of the reservoirs on the downstream rivers were quantified by comparing the annual fluxes of chl a doc bdoc and dsi in downstream river under the two situations with and without reservoirs see 2 3 2 results showed that the marne and aube reservoirs increased respectively by 22 and 19 the annual doc fluxes and by 34 and 12 the annual bdoc fluxes while the annual dsi fluxes in the downstream rivers was decreased by 35 and 31 table 1 two reservoirs slightly increased the annual chl a flux 7 in their downstream rivers in addition to pco2 and water quality marne and aube reservoirs increased the downstream discharge by 20 m3 s 1 and 10 m3 s 1 during emptying period respectively similarly k600 of the downstream rivers increase by 1 3 times during emptying period july november 4 discussion 4 1 temporal changes of water parameters in the reservoirs the temporal changes of water quality in the three reservoirs were affected by the biogeochemical processes in the reservoirs and the upstream discharge during the filling period december june the differences between observations of water variables chl a dsi doc and bdoc and their corresponding mixing values resulted from biogeochemical processes occurring in the reservoir fig 2 s3 and s4 in the three reservoirs the observed chl a concentrations were much higher than their corresponding mixing values demonstrating the development of phytoplankton during october december in the reservoirs which were favored by the weak limitations of light and nutrient exchanges from sediment when water levels were shallow liu et al 2019 the gradual decline of chl a concentrations during december march would dominantly result from the entering water containing much lower chl a concentrations while other combined processes might not be excluded e g phytoplankton primary production garnier et al 2000 mortality sedimentation as well as grazing by large cladocerans and copepods which has been reported in previous studies akopian et al 2002 1999 the grazing pressure of zooplankton would sustain low chl a concentrations in reservoir during march october in addition to the mixing effect of the entering water the dynamics of doc bdoc and dsi revealed the multiple processes occurring in the reservoirs first the concentrations of doc bdoc and dsi in reservoirs were mainly controlled by the water entering reservoirs during december march due to the close values between the observed concentrations and mixing values fig 2 however the observed concentrations of dsi were much lower than their mixing values during april june with a continuous decline trend suggesting the influences of the phytoplankton development in the reservoirs mainly diatoms in contrast the increasing trends of dsi concentrations in reservoirs during october december suggested the dissolution of diatom frustules as reported in previous study garnier et al 1999 maavara et al 2015a differing from dsi trends the observed concentrations of doc and bdoc were higher than their mixing values during april june such gradual increasing trends indicate a production of doc and bdoc potentially attributed to the lysis of phytoplankton sloppy feeding by zooplankton and mineralization of organic matter overall the temporal changes of chl a dsi doc and bdoc concentrations provided sufficient evidence for identifying the dynamics of phytoplankton in the reservoirs 4 2 hydrological biogeochemical meteorological effects on pco2 dynamics this study revealed that both hydrological and meteorological characteristics impact on pco2 in the three studied rivers as shown by previous studies borges et al 2018 butman and raymond 2011 marescaux et al 2018a the three rivers were supersaturated in co2 during all seasons and thus act as co2 sources to the atmosphere as found around the globe butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 in this study riverine pco2 peaks generally occurred in june july fig 4 and were probably due to the enhanced in situ respiration rate via the high water temperature butman and raymond 2011 liu et al 2017 marescaux et al 2018a ran et al 2017 moreover reservoirs have not yet started to release their water at this time period and the river flows were mostly driven by groundwater with high pco2 concentrations marescaux et al 2020 conversely relatively low pco2 in rivers were found during late autumn and early winter when river water was more sustained by surface runoff than groundwater macpherson 2009 marescaux et al 2020 such dynamic was reinforced by the seasonal changes in gas transfer velocity k600 with higher values in winter supporting more outgassing and in contrast less pco2 evasion during summer fig 6 in addition mismatches of pco2 between upstream and downstream rivers were found especially during the emptying period july november these time periods exactly coincided with the time when water was released from the reservoirs increasing gas transfer exchanges see also below which further highlighted the potential importance of reservoir on the seasonal decrease of downstream pco2 also short term decrease in downstream pco2 was observed during filling period in february and march fig 4 this can happen in rainy winters when the reservoir filling emptying operation is used to buffer any possible flooding in downstream overall our result revealed that during the emptying periods reservoirs have a significant impact on downstream river pco2 which superimposes on the effects of instream hydrological and biogeochemical processes for stagnant aquatic ecosystems the dynamics of co2 concentrations are generally regulated by the balances between photosynthesis respiration and gas exchange rate cole et al 2000 duarte and prairie 2005 gu et al 2011 marcé et al 2010 do saturation has been considered as the surrogate for surface lake net primary productivity marcé et al 2015 and revealed to some extent the balance between photosynthesis and respiration in the three reservoirs do saturation gradually increased from the early beginning of the year to early summer fig 3 corresponding to the general decline trends of pco2 in reservoirs which would support that increasing primary productivity consumed co2 in these studied reservoirs the low and even undersaturated pco2 september october in the reservoirs probably resulted from the assimilation by primary producers e g phytoplankton which sharply increased at this period fig 2b in late autumn high values of pco2 in reservoirs were observed and were consistent with the undersaturated do increasing dsi and decreasing bdoc concentrations fig 2 3 and 4 all these variables typically revealed degradation of organic matter and biogenic dissolution therefore the seasonal patterns of pco2 in the studied rivers and reservoirs were regulated by hydrological biogeochemical and meteorological effects and the seasonal dynamics of downstream pco2 were also affected by the water released from the reservoirs 4 3 co2 fluxes in three reservoirs and up and downstream rivers the calculation of co2 fluxes from surface water indicated that upstream and downstream rivers are relatively important co2 sources to the atmosphere 1668 to 3000 mg co2 c m 2 d 1 while the amount of co2 emissions from the three reservoirs were more moderate and matches the average co2 fluxes in the temperate reservoirs at the global scale from 105 to 316 mg co2 c m 2 d 1 barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 hertwich 2013 it should be emphasized that spatial variations of co2 emissions from reservoirs have been reported in previous studies e g paranaíba et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 however such spatial variations of co2 emissions were not investigated here considering that these shallow reservoirs are only intermittently stratified and are homogeneous for a major part of their surface area garnier et al 2000 for the marne reservoir despite still preliminarily the annual co2 emissions from three reservoirs were for the first time estimated at 4 2 gg c yr 1 from seasonal variations of the emissions at a single station extrapolated to the whole reservoir areas by comparison with the co2 emissions from the seine drainage network 364 gg c yr 1 marescaux et al 2020 the reservoir co2 emissions would account for about 1 of the contribution to the whole co2 emissions from the seine river which would remain low with documented spatial emissions compared with reservoirs their related rivers showed much higher co2 fluxes to the atmosphere fig 4 and were similar to the recent global estimation of co2 fluxes from streams and rivers at the global scale 2886 mg c m 2 d 1 li et al 2021 in addition to the co2 saturation in water one of the other important factors controlling co2 exchange rates is the gas exchange coefficient which was determined by k600 and the schmidt number drake et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 raymond and cole 2001 wanninkhof 2014 in rivers despite of the other influencing factors k600 is proportional to water flow velocity alin et al 2011 raymond and cole 2001 therefore wintertime k600 values were higher than those in summer in the upstream rivers while increasing k600 values in downstream rivers were found due to the increase in water discharges during emptying period fig 6 in the present study the seasonal variation of co2 fluxes in the upstream rivers co varied with k600 and pco2 showing that both variables controlled co2 fluxes interestingly increasing k600 during emptying period was offset by the significantly decreased in pco2 which resulted in an overall damped co2 flux fig 4 in other words pco2 rather than k600 was the dominant driver of co2 fluxes in the downstream rivers which is also the case for the reservoirs therefore the observed low pco2 in downstream rivers during emptying period strengthened the impact of reservoir on downstream co2 concentrations and hence on the co2 emission rates our results further highlight the necessity to include reservoir based effects into consideration when evaluating co2 emissions from rivers especially in the context of a global increase in reservoir construction in the near future zarfl et al 2015 4 4 overall impacts of the reservoirs on the downstream rivers the result of this study revealed a variety of impacts on downstream rivers including water discharges water quality pco2 and gas transfer coefficient fig 5 6 and s2 water quality doc bdoc and dsi in upstream and downstream showed no significant difference during filling period fig 5 suggesting that the impact of other processes e g lateral inputs and internal biogeochemical processes on water quality between upstream and downstream were not obvious however the three reservoirs significantly changed water quality in their downstream rivers during the emptying period p 0 01 fig 5 our results confirm that reservoirs are hot spots for nutrient retention and thus affect nutrient concentrations in their downstream rivers as is widely recognized garnier et al 1998 1999 2000 maavara et al 2020a 2020b 2017 yan et al 2021a this is because reservoirs usually show higher residence times than that in the rivers maavara et al 2020b and provide favorable conditions for multiple biogeochemical processes such as nutrient uptake and release induced by photosynthesis and respiration akbarzadeh et al 2019 frings et al 2014 garnier et al 1999 2000 humborg et al 2008 which are responsible for water quality changes the coupling of biogeochemical processes and water management strategy of reservoirs emptying from july to november when the dsi concentrations were relatively low while doc and bdoc levels were high plays the key role in affecting the water quality of downstream rivers in addition to nutrient concentrations our results revealed that the reservoirs lowered downstream pco2 and such a finding is different from previous studies that have indicated that the water leaving deep and strongly stratified reservoirs from the bottom might contain high concentrations of co2 leading to significant downstream emissions of co2 abril et al 2005 calamita et al 2021 winton et al 2019 interestingly we indeed found that pco2 in the outflow at the bottom of aube reservoir though being higher than that in the surface water was still lower than that in the upstream river waters table s2 this is probably because the three reservoirs in our study were relative shallow 10 15 m at the deepest leading to limited stratification in summer for a rather short period and thus well mixed for most of the time garnier et al 2000 therefore the importance of downstream emission patterns in the three reservoirs differed from the behavior of deep and stratified one overall our results enrich current knowledge on biogeochemical impacts of reservoirs on downstream rivers especially in terms of co2 concentrations besides of other water quality variables in the downstream rivers 5 conclusion in this study we evaluated the impacts of the three reservoirs marne aube and seine in the seine basin on their downstream rivers based on the monthly field measurements during the period from 04 2019 to 11 2020 the temporal changes of the concentrations of chl a dsi doc bdoc and pco2 in reservoirs resulted from combined effects of entering waters and reservoir biogeochemical processes we indeed found that the reservoirs significantly changed downstream water quality during the emptying period i e lowering pco2 in addition to dsi concentrations by 33 and increasing doc by 20 and bdoc by 23 concentrations in addition the reservoirs changed the water discharges and increased gas transfer coefficient by 1 3 times of downstream rivers the current study fills thus an important gap in the understanding of the functioning of the three reservoirs and their impacts on the downstream rivers during the emptying period in terms of the co2 emissions from the surface water these three reservoirs were moderate sources of co2 with the average emission rates ranging from 95 to 174 mg co2 c m 2 d 1 while the rivers were important co2 sources with the average emission rates ranging from 1668 to 3000 co2 c m 2 d 1 co2 fluxes in the upstream rivers were regulated by both the k600 and pco2 while they were dominantly driven by the pco2 from the reservoirs in the downstream rivers overall our results emphasize that integrating hydrological and biogeochemical functioning of reservoirs in the riverine drainage network could provide new insights into the

16227,the global increase in the construction of reservoirs has drawn attention given its documented hydrological and biogeochemical impacts on downstream rivers however the impact of reservoirs on downstream pco2 partial pressure of carbon dioxide is still poorly understood to evaluate these impacts the interactions between reservoirs and their corresponding upstream and downstream rivers were analyzed for three reservoirs in the seine basin based on monthly measurement during two hydrological years the seasonal variations of water quality in the reservoirs were mainly driven by the entering water and the biogeochemical processes occurring in the reservoirs our results unravel the crucial role of reservoir in downstream water quality which significantly increased doc dissolved organic carbon and bdoc biodegradable doc concentrations while lowered dsi dissolved silica concentrations during emptying period p 0 01 furthermore the impacts of reservoirs on the annual fluxes of doc bdoc and dsi were quantified and suggested that the three reservoirs respectively increased 20 and 23 of annual fluxes of doc and bdoc while decreased 33 of annual dsi fluxes in their downstream rivers additionally the reservoirs significantly decreased downstream riverine pco2 p 0 01 and enhanced the gas transfer coefficient of co2 in downstream rivers by 1 3 times during the emptying period which highlights the necessity to consider the potential impact of reservoirs on riverine co2 emissions overall our results highlight the importance of combining biogeochemical and hydrological characteristics to understand the impacts of reservoirs on downstream rivers and emphasize the need of similar studies under the current context of increasing reservoir constructions graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words reservoirs seine basin downstream river water quality partial pressure of co2 1 introduction the increase in reservoirs has been well reported since recent decades due to its benefits and capacities in hydroelectric generation irrigation water supply and downstream water flow regulation garnier et al 1999 lehner et al 2011 however concerns and ongoing debates still exist to date given their resulting socioenvironmental costs bertassoli et al 2021 harrison 2019 hermoso et al 2019 muller 2019 for instance reservoirs can significantly alter the flow regime vörösmarty et al 1997 by shifting rivers from free flowing systems to lentic and lotic systems of high discontinuity ward and stanford 1995 such altered hydrological transport together with the resulting changes in biogeochemical processes can further change the downstream water quality maavara et al 2020b many studies have revealed the reservoir derived changes in nutrient retention elimination akbarzadeh et al 2019 garnier et al 1999 maavara et al 2014 2015b 2017 yan et al 2021a nutrient bioavailability chen et al 2020 and stoichiometry maavara et al 2020a wang 2020 yang et al 2018 as well as in the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter in downstream rivers he et al 2020 however most of the previous studies that investigated nutrient retentions in reservoirs were calculated by mass balance e g garnier et al 1999 yan et al 2021a and modeling methods e g mechanistic models for global estimation see akbarzadeh et al 2019 maavara et al 2014 and little attention has been paid to related processes e g hydrological characteristics and biogeochemical processes occurring in the reservoirs in addition to the hydrological and biogeochemical effects ghg greenhouse gas emission from reservoirs is another concern which is partially responsible for the climatic change giles 2006 from a global perspective ghg emissions from reservoirs were estimated as 773 tg co2 carbon dioxide equivalents yr 1 330 tg c yr 1 suggesting reservoirs as critical sources of ghg deemer et al 2016 co2 one of the crucial components of ghg has been extensively studied around the world regarding its flux from reservoirs numerous studies have contributed to the estimation of global annual co2 emissions from reservoirs with the reported different magnitudes ranging from 36 8 to 272 7 tg c yr 1 deemer et al 2016 yan et al 2021b the high uncertainty of co2 emissions from global reservoirs indicates the necessity for future field measurements of co2 emissions in regional reservoirs which are critical to understand the behavior of co2 emissions from multiple reservoir settings and conditions bertassoli et al 2021 however current studies of co2 emissions from reservoirs have mainly focused on co2 exchange at the water air interface in the reservoirs soued and prairie 2020 while little attention has been paid to simultaneous co2 emissions and concentrations in their upstream and downstream rivers although it has been acknowledged that overall rivers are sources of co2 raymond et al 2013 less is known about the potential impact of reservoirs on riverine co2 concentrations and emissions liu et al 2016 a previous modeling approach suggested that the reservoirs in the seine basin lowered the dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity of downstream rivers marescaux et al 2020 two variables closely related to co2 concentration however further research on co2 dynamics is still required to provide direct evidence to identify the underlying mechanisms regarding the impact of these reservoirs on co2 in downstream rivers the marne aube and seine reservoirs in the seine basin france share the same water management strategy for flood control and low flow support garnier et al 2000 1999 but differ from most reservoirs built on the stretches of river as they were diverted from their related rivers and connected with the rivers by artificial canals the annual shift in hydrological characteristics due to the emptying and filling operations allows the co existence of multiple biogeochemical processes in reservoirs specifically the development of phytoplankton in the reservoirs which potentially drives the changes in nutrient concentrations and pco2 partial pressure of co2 by analyzing the monthly observations in these three reservoirs their upstream and downstream rivers we seek to identify and quantify the impact of three reservoirs on pco2 and nutrient concentrations on downstream rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites three reservoirs are located in the upstream of the seine basin france fig 1 a in mixed land use catchments that are dominated by forest 40 54 agricultural land 38 48 and fringed by grassland 5 18 the lithological characteristics of the three reservoirs are clay garnier et al 1999 yan et al 2021a the marne storage capacity of 350 m m3 aube 170 m m3 and seine 208 m m3 reservoirs were built in diversion of the marne aube and seine rivers in 1974 1990 and 1966 respectively according to the upstream hydrological characteristics the three reservoirs are filled from december to june of the following year filling period prevent flooding and emptied from july to november emptying period support low water flows in downstream the variation of volume in the reservoirs is directly related to water management objectives and is fully controlled by specific filling and emptying operations using artificial penstock canals garnier et al 1999 more information on three reservoirs can be found on the seine grand lacs website sgl http seinegrandslacs fr 2 2 sampling strategy and measurements monthly field campaigns were conducted since 2019 for approximately two hydrological cycles of the reservoirs a total of nine sampling sites were selected in the upstream and downstream rivers and inside the three reservoirs fig 1 table s1 for each site surface water samples were taken with a bucket from bridges or pontoons and 5 l high density polyethylene sampling bottles were filled all samples were conditioned e g filtration and kept at 10 c in the field after returning to the laboratory they were stored at 4 c or frozen until the analysis in addition ph t water temperature c and do dissolved oxygen mg l 1 were measured on the field using a multiparameter instrument ysi 6600 v2 co2 sampling and measurements were realized on the field 30 ml of water was kept in four syringes 60 ml with 30 ml of ambient air and were shaken for 10 min a fifth syringe was filled with ambient air to measure the atmospheric pco2 the pco2 in water was determined through a non dispersive infrared gas analyzer licor li 820 usa using the syringe headspace equilibrium method in the field abril et al 2015 marescaux et al 2018a the gas analyzer was calibrated with standard co2 800 ppm and co2 free dinitrogen the pco2 in water was then calculated based on the pco2 measured in the equilibrated headspace of the syringes and in the atmosphere wanninkhof 2014 in the laboratory filtered water samples gf f 0 7 μm grilled at 500 c for 4 h were collected in grilled glass flasks and acidified 0 1 ml h2so4 4 m in 30 ml of water and were then analyzed with a toc analyzer aurora 1030 toc analyzer oi analytical for doc dissolved organic carbon mg l 1 marescaux et al 2018a 2018b doc

according to lorenzen 1967 2 3 calculations 2 3 1 calculations of co2 flux and do saturation the diffusive fluxes of co2 in three reservoirs and rivers were calculated based on the boundary layer

water quality changes in the reservoir the concentrations of water variables in reservoirs were calculated assuming they resulted only from the mixing with the entering water concentrations and without any alteration from biogeochemical processes hereafter named mixing values for this theoretical exercise the daily concentrations of chl a dsi doc and bdoc were derived by a simple linear interpolation based on the monthly measurements their corresponding mixing values in reservoirs were calculated as follows 11 c i c i 1 q i n i 3600 24 c u p i c i 1 v o l i where ci and cup i represent the concentrations of water variable in the reservoir and the upstream rivers in day i respectively ci 1 is the water variable concentrations in the reservoir at the previous day of i qin i is the water discharges m3 s 1 entering reservoir in day i and voli m3 is reservoir volume in day i additionally to quantify the impact of reservoirs on downstream water quality we calculated the annual fluxes of chl a dsi doc and bdoc in downstream rivers under the actual situation with reservoir and the hypothetical situation without reservoir in the actual situation the annual fluxes of the mentioned variables in the downstream were calculated using discharge weighted concentration method moatar and meybeck 2005 yan et al 2021a 12 a f i 1 n c i q i i 1 n q i q m where af is the annual flux of related variable ci is the measured instantaneous concentration value qi is the water discharges associated with ci qm is the average water discharge during the annual water cycle from

reservoirs the revised discharges in the downstream rivers marne and aube were presented in the sm fig s2 in a previous study of the seine reservoirs yan et al 2021 we demonstrate that in the absence of reservoir releases the water quality remains unchanged between upstream and downstream sites ruling out any significant impacts of instream processes or lateral inputs along the river sections between the upstream and downstream sampling stations therefore in the hypothetical situation of no reservoir downstream water quality was assumed to be similar to the upstream one the annual fluxes of chl a dsi doc and bdoc in downstream rivers were calculated by equation 12 2 4 statistical analysis the shapiro wilk method was used to test the normal distribution of the field data before performing statistical analysis the wilcoxon test method was used to identify the impact of the three reservoirs on water quality of downstream rivers during the filling period and emptying period including doc bdoc dsi and pco2 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient was used to identify the relationship between pco2 and sdo and dsi during emptying period in order to avoid the influence of the upstream water entering the reservoirs the criterion of p 0 05 was used to determine statistical significance all of the aforementioned analysis was conducted using r version 3 5 1 r core team 2019 3 result 3 1 water quality in the reservoirs the seasonal variations of volumes and water quality in the three reservoirs showed similar patterns therefore we only presented the marne reservoir as an example fig 2 for seine and aube reservoirs please refer to fig s3 and s4 chl a concentrations in upstream river showed slight variations with values ranging from 2 μg l 1 to 7 μg l 1 in the reservoir high chl a concentrations were found when the reservoir volumes were the lowest during november december fig 2b s3b and s4b and were 4 14 times higher than those in the upstream river chl a concentrations in the reservoir gradually declined from december to march and sustained low concentrations from april to september 2 6 μg l 1 and then increased from october to december comparing the observed chl a concentrations with the corresponding mixing values the former were much higher than the latter during this period the dsi concentrations in the upstream rivers were generally higher than those in the reservoirs fig 2 s3 and s4 dsi concentrations in the reservoirs gradually declined from december to august and increased from september to december when water depth was low in addition the co variation between observations and the mixing values of dsi concentrations was found from october to february however this was followed by continuously declining of dsi concentrations during april july the dynamics of bdoc concentrations in reservoirs which accounted approximately 25 of doc showed synchronous variations with doc concentrations doc and bdoc concentrations in reservoirs decreased from december to march and were close to the mixing values they gradually increased during april november and were higher than the mixing values during april november the seasonal variations of sdo and water temperature in the three reservoirs were generally similar fig 3 overall high sdo 100 was found in summer june july at the end of the filling period when water level and temperature of reservoir were high while low sdo 100 was found in late autumn at the end of emptying period when water level and temperature were low 3 2 seasonal dynamics of pco2 and co2 fluxes pco2 in rivers were higher in summer and lower in winter and were much higher 2000 µatm than that in the reservoirs 1000 µatm fig 4 the pco2 in the reservoirs showed general decline trends during the filling period despite high pco2 supplies by upstream rivers the pco2 continued declining during the early emptying of the reservoirs in september and october but increased during the rest of the emptying period the pco2 in the downstream of marne and aube reservoirs were 1 5 times lower than that in upstream rivers during the emptying period while they were relatively close during the filling period fig 4 in the three reservoirs we found that pco2 negatively correlated to sdo n 32 r 0 61 p 0 01 while positively correlated to dsi during emptying period n 32 r 0 5 p 0 01 in terms of average co2 fluxes all of three reservoirs were sources of co2 to the atmosphere during the study period 04 2019 11 2020 with emission rates of 115 134 mg c m 2 d 1 95 124 mg c m 2 d 1 and 174 305 mg c m 2 d 1 mean sd in the marne aube and seine reservoirs respectively in contrast the mean co2 fluxes in the upstream of marne aube and seine rivers were 2377 536 mg c m 2 d 1 2426 589 mg c m 2 d 1 and 3009 574 mg c m 2 d 1 over the same time period respectively high co2 fluxes were observed in downstream of the marne 1668 652 mg c m 2 d 1 and aube 1961 757 mg c m 2 d 1 rivers in may june while relative lower values 40 50 were found during the emptying period fig 4 3 3 impact of reservoirs on their downstream rivers the comparison of water concentrations between upstream and downstream rivers during the filling and emptying periods revealed that water released from three reservoirs significantly changed downstream pco2 and water quality doc bdoc dsi fig 5 during the filling period almost without any release from the reservoirs no significant difference was found for the water quality and pco2 between the upstream and downstream rivers however the three reservoirs significantly changed downstream water quality and pco2 during emptying period p 0 01 i e increasing doc and bdoc concentrations while decreasing dsi concentrations and pco2 of downstream rivers furthermore the impacts of the reservoirs on the downstream rivers were quantified by comparing the annual fluxes of chl a doc bdoc and dsi in downstream river under the two situations with and without reservoirs see 2 3 2 results showed that the marne and aube reservoirs increased respectively by 22 and 19 the annual doc fluxes and by 34 and 12 the annual bdoc fluxes while the annual dsi fluxes in the downstream rivers was decreased by 35 and 31 table 1 two reservoirs slightly increased the annual chl a flux 7 in their downstream rivers in addition to pco2 and water quality marne and aube reservoirs increased the downstream discharge by 20 m3 s 1 and 10 m3 s 1 during emptying period respectively similarly k600 of the downstream rivers increase by 1 3 times during emptying period july november 4 discussion 4 1 temporal changes of water parameters in the reservoirs the temporal changes of water quality in the three reservoirs were affected by the biogeochemical processes in the reservoirs and the upstream discharge during the filling period december june the differences between observations of water variables chl a dsi doc and bdoc and their corresponding mixing values resulted from biogeochemical processes occurring in the reservoir fig 2 s3 and s4 in the three reservoirs the observed chl a concentrations were much higher than their corresponding mixing values demonstrating the development of phytoplankton during october december in the reservoirs which were favored by the weak limitations of light and nutrient exchanges from sediment when water levels were shallow liu et al 2019 the gradual decline of chl a concentrations during december march would dominantly result from the entering water containing much lower chl a concentrations while other combined processes might not be excluded e g phytoplankton primary production garnier et al 2000 mortality sedimentation as well as grazing by large cladocerans and copepods which has been reported in previous studies akopian et al 2002 1999 the grazing pressure of zooplankton would sustain low chl a concentrations in reservoir during march october in addition to the mixing effect of the entering water the dynamics of doc bdoc and dsi revealed the multiple processes occurring in the reservoirs first the concentrations of doc bdoc and dsi in reservoirs were mainly controlled by the water entering reservoirs during december march due to the close values between the observed concentrations and mixing values fig 2 however the observed concentrations of dsi were much lower than their mixing values during april june with a continuous decline trend suggesting the influences of the phytoplankton development in the reservoirs mainly diatoms in contrast the increasing trends of dsi concentrations in reservoirs during october december suggested the dissolution of diatom frustules as reported in previous study garnier et al 1999 maavara et al 2015a differing from dsi trends the observed concentrations of doc and bdoc were higher than their mixing values during april june such gradual increasing trends indicate a production of doc and bdoc potentially attributed to the lysis of phytoplankton sloppy feeding by zooplankton and mineralization of organic matter overall the temporal changes of chl a dsi doc and bdoc concentrations provided sufficient evidence for identifying the dynamics of phytoplankton in the reservoirs 4 2 hydrological biogeochemical meteorological effects on pco2 dynamics this study revealed that both hydrological and meteorological characteristics impact on pco2 in the three studied rivers as shown by previous studies borges et al 2018 butman and raymond 2011 marescaux et al 2018a the three rivers were supersaturated in co2 during all seasons and thus act as co2 sources to the atmosphere as found around the globe butman and raymond 2011 raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 in this study riverine pco2 peaks generally occurred in june july fig 4 and were probably due to the enhanced in situ respiration rate via the high water temperature butman and raymond 2011 liu et al 2017 marescaux et al 2018a ran et al 2017 moreover reservoirs have not yet started to release their water at this time period and the river flows were mostly driven by groundwater with high pco2 concentrations marescaux et al 2020 conversely relatively low pco2 in rivers were found during late autumn and early winter when river water was more sustained by surface runoff than groundwater macpherson 2009 marescaux et al 2020 such dynamic was reinforced by the seasonal changes in gas transfer velocity k600 with higher values in winter supporting more outgassing and in contrast less pco2 evasion during summer fig 6 in addition mismatches of pco2 between upstream and downstream rivers were found especially during the emptying period july november these time periods exactly coincided with the time when water was released from the reservoirs increasing gas transfer exchanges see also below which further highlighted the potential importance of reservoir on the seasonal decrease of downstream pco2 also short term decrease in downstream pco2 was observed during filling period in february and march fig 4 this can happen in rainy winters when the reservoir filling emptying operation is used to buffer any possible flooding in downstream overall our result revealed that during the emptying periods reservoirs have a significant impact on downstream river pco2 which superimposes on the effects of instream hydrological and biogeochemical processes for stagnant aquatic ecosystems the dynamics of co2 concentrations are generally regulated by the balances between photosynthesis respiration and gas exchange rate cole et al 2000 duarte and prairie 2005 gu et al 2011 marcé et al 2010 do saturation has been considered as the surrogate for surface lake net primary productivity marcé et al 2015 and revealed to some extent the balance between photosynthesis and respiration in the three reservoirs do saturation gradually increased from the early beginning of the year to early summer fig 3 corresponding to the general decline trends of pco2 in reservoirs which would support that increasing primary productivity consumed co2 in these studied reservoirs the low and even undersaturated pco2 september october in the reservoirs probably resulted from the assimilation by primary producers e g phytoplankton which sharply increased at this period fig 2b in late autumn high values of pco2 in reservoirs were observed and were consistent with the undersaturated do increasing dsi and decreasing bdoc concentrations fig 2 3 and 4 all these variables typically revealed degradation of organic matter and biogenic dissolution therefore the seasonal patterns of pco2 in the studied rivers and reservoirs were regulated by hydrological biogeochemical and meteorological effects and the seasonal dynamics of downstream pco2 were also affected by the water released from the reservoirs 4 3 co2 fluxes in three reservoirs and up and downstream rivers the calculation of co2 fluxes from surface water indicated that upstream and downstream rivers are relatively important co2 sources to the atmosphere 1668 to 3000 mg co2 c m 2 d 1 while the amount of co2 emissions from the three reservoirs were more moderate and matches the average co2 fluxes in the temperate reservoirs at the global scale from 105 to 316 mg co2 c m 2 d 1 barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 hertwich 2013 it should be emphasized that spatial variations of co2 emissions from reservoirs have been reported in previous studies e g paranaíba et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 however such spatial variations of co2 emissions were not investigated here considering that these shallow reservoirs are only intermittently stratified and are homogeneous for a major part of their surface area garnier et al 2000 for the marne reservoir despite still preliminarily the annual co2 emissions from three reservoirs were for the first time estimated at 4 2 gg c yr 1 from seasonal variations of the emissions at a single station extrapolated to the whole reservoir areas by comparison with the co2 emissions from the seine drainage network 364 gg c yr 1 marescaux et al 2020 the reservoir co2 emissions would account for about 1 of the contribution to the whole co2 emissions from the seine river which would remain low with documented spatial emissions compared with reservoirs their related rivers showed much higher co2 fluxes to the atmosphere fig 4 and were similar to the recent global estimation of co2 fluxes from streams and rivers at the global scale 2886 mg c m 2 d 1 li et al 2021 in addition to the co2 saturation in water one of the other important factors controlling co2 exchange rates is the gas exchange coefficient which was determined by k600 and the schmidt number drake et al 2018 raymond et al 2013 raymond and cole 2001 wanninkhof 2014 in rivers despite of the other influencing factors k600 is proportional to water flow velocity alin et al 2011 raymond and cole 2001 therefore wintertime k600 values were higher than those in summer in the upstream rivers while increasing k600 values in downstream rivers were found due to the increase in water discharges during emptying period fig 6 in the present study the seasonal variation of co2 fluxes in the upstream rivers co varied with k600 and pco2 showing that both variables controlled co2 fluxes interestingly increasing k600 during emptying period was offset by the significantly decreased in pco2 which resulted in an overall damped co2 flux fig 4 in other words pco2 rather than k600 was the dominant driver of co2 fluxes in the downstream rivers which is also the case for the reservoirs therefore the observed low pco2 in downstream rivers during emptying period strengthened the impact of reservoir on downstream co2 concentrations and hence on the co2 emission rates our results further highlight the necessity to include reservoir based effects into consideration when evaluating co2 emissions from rivers especially in the context of a global increase in reservoir construction in the near future zarfl et al 2015 4 4 overall impacts of the reservoirs on the downstream rivers the result of this study revealed a variety of impacts on downstream rivers including water discharges water quality pco2 and gas transfer coefficient fig 5 6 and s2 water quality doc bdoc and dsi in upstream and downstream showed no significant difference during filling period fig 5 suggesting that the impact of other processes e g lateral inputs and internal biogeochemical processes on water quality between upstream and downstream were not obvious however the three reservoirs significantly changed water quality in their downstream rivers during the emptying period p 0 01 fig 5 our results confirm that reservoirs are hot spots for nutrient retention and thus affect nutrient concentrations in their downstream rivers as is widely recognized garnier et al 1998 1999 2000 maavara et al 2020a 2020b 2017 yan et al 2021a this is because reservoirs usually show higher residence times than that in the rivers maavara et al 2020b and provide favorable conditions for multiple biogeochemical processes such as nutrient uptake and release induced by photosynthesis and respiration akbarzadeh et al 2019 frings et al 2014 garnier et al 1999 2000 humborg et al 2008 which are responsible for water quality changes the coupling of biogeochemical processes and water management strategy of reservoirs emptying from july to november when the dsi concentrations were relatively low while doc and bdoc levels were high plays the key role in affecting the water quality of downstream rivers in addition to nutrient concentrations our results revealed that the reservoirs lowered downstream pco2 and such a finding is different from previous studies that have indicated that the water leaving deep and strongly stratified reservoirs from the bottom might contain high concentrations of co2 leading to significant downstream emissions of co2 abril et al 2005 calamita et al 2021 winton et al 2019 interestingly we indeed found that pco2 in the outflow at the bottom of aube reservoir though being higher than that in the surface water was still lower than that in the upstream river waters table s2 this is probably because the three reservoirs in our study were relative shallow 10 15 m at the deepest leading to limited stratification in summer for a rather short period and thus well mixed for most of the time garnier et al 2000 therefore the importance of downstream emission patterns in the three reservoirs differed from the behavior of deep and stratified one overall our results enrich current knowledge on biogeochemical impacts of reservoirs on downstream rivers especially in terms of co2 concentrations besides of other water quality variables in the downstream rivers 5 conclusion in this study we evaluated the impacts of the three reservoirs marne aube and seine in the seine basin on their downstream rivers based on the monthly field measurements during the period from 04 2019 to 11 2020 the temporal changes of the concentrations of chl a dsi doc bdoc and pco2 in reservoirs resulted from combined effects of entering waters and reservoir biogeochemical processes we indeed found that the reservoirs significantly changed downstream water quality during the emptying period i e lowering pco2 in addition to dsi concentrations by 33 and increasing doc by 20 and bdoc by 23 concentrations in addition the reservoirs changed the water discharges and increased gas transfer coefficient by 1 3 times of downstream rivers the current study fills thus an important gap in the understanding of the functioning of the three reservoirs and their impacts on the downstream rivers during the emptying period in terms of the co2 emissions from the surface water these three reservoirs were moderate sources of co2 with the average emission rates ranging from 95 to 174 mg co2 c m 2 d 1 while the rivers were important co2 sources with the average emission rates ranging from 1668 to 3000 co2 c m 2 d 1 co2 fluxes in the upstream rivers were regulated by both the k600 and pco2 while they were dominantly driven by the pco2 from the reservoirs in the downstream rivers overall our results emphasize that integrating hydrological and biogeochemical functioning of reservoirs in the riverine drainage network could provide new insights into the

16228,identification and location of contamination sources is crucial for water resource protection especially in karst aquifers which provide 25 of the world s population with water but are highly vulnerable to contamination transport based source tracking is proposed and verified here as a complementary approach to microbial and chemical source tracking in karst aquifers for identifying and locating such sources of contamination and for avoiding ambiguities that might arise from using one method alone the transport distance is inversely modelled from contaminant breakthrough curves btc based on analytical solutions of the 1d two region non equilibrium advection dispersion equation using gnu octave besides the btc the model requires reliable estimates of transport velocity and input time the model is shown to be robust allows scripted based automated 2d sensitivity analyses interplay of two parameters and can be favourable when distributed numerical models are inappropriate due to insufficient data sensitivity analyses illustrate that the model is highly sensitive to the input time the flow velocity and the fraction of the mobile fluid region a conclusive verification approach was performed by applying the method to synthetic data tracer tests and event based field data transport distances were correctly modelled for a set of artificial tracer tests using a discharge velocity relationship that could be established for the respective karst catchment for the first time such an approach was shown to be applicable to estimate the maximum distance to the contamination source for coliform bacteria in karst spring water combined with microbial source tracking however prediction intervals for the transport distance can be large even in well studied karst catchments mainly related to uncertainties in the flow velocity and the input time using a maximum transport distance is proposed to account for less permeable slower pathways in general transport

gurdak and qi 2012 carbonate and karst aquifers are present over about 15 of the world s continents and an estimated 17 of the world s population in 2015 lived within karst catchment areas goldscheider et al 2020 understanding and modelling flow within carbonate aquifers is extremely challenging due to their unique hydrology and exceptional heterogeneity especially when they are karstified ford and williams 2007 the hydrology of such karstified carbonate aquifers can be described as a network of highly permeable fissures and conduits embedded in a less permeable matrix resulting in flows that are governed by two or three different types of porosity e g white and schmidt 1966 vulnerability assessments in karst catchments are therefore particularly challenging doerfliger et al 1999 daly et al 2002 a number of methods have been developed to identify the type of contaminant source in karst aquifers through specific characteristics or fingerprinting in

approaches run into problems if a number of similar source signals are present and individual sources can no longer be distinguished james et al 2016 the resulting ambiguities can sometimes be resolved by combining mst and cst with information on contaminant transport within the particular system allowing an estimate to be made of the transport distance and hence the input location e g zirlewagen et al 2016 however such attempts are rare even in porous media the one dimensional 1d transport distance in karst aquifers is based on a transit time determined from breakthrough curves btcs with known or estimated input times and flow velocities the peak velocity also called dominant velocity is calculated based on the peak transit time time at which a maximum in concentration is reached tpeak and can be easily read out from btcs provided they have high temporal resolutions and accuracies käss 1998 goldscheider et al 2008 however btcs for event based data on bacterial contamination or organic pollutants in karst catchments often do not satisfy these conditions since sampling and analysis usually polymerase chain reaction pcr and high performance liquid chromatography hplc are both expensive and time consuming sampling intervals are often large in relation to transit times e g ryan and meimann 1996 stange and tiehm 2020 uncertainties associated with the determination of tpeak can be to some extent mitigated by using appropriate transport distance modelling transport modelling based on analytical solutions of the advection dispersion equation ade has become the standard approach for evaluating btcs from tracer studies in karst aquifers in fact most tracer studies in groundwater have been performed in karst aquifers worthington 1999 a large number of tracer studies in karst aquifers have revealed rapid flows within the networks of conduits e g worthington and ford 1995 in addition to the 1d ade model field and pinsky 2000 also used a 1d two region non equilibrium 2rne model to model tracer transport in karst aquifers in order to take into account non fickian transport as is often indicated by strongly skewed breakthrough curves with long tailings within the model non fickian behaviour is partly accounted for by lumping it into a mass exchange term see chapter 2 1 the 2rne model has since become popular for analysing artificial

for detecting the sources of pollutants is a state of the art technique in porous media sidauruk et al 1998 ayaz et al 2021 gómez hernández and xu 2021 but it has to date not yet been implemented in the stanmod software package or evaluated for karst specific problems in this study we propose the use of transport based source tracking tst i e 1d inverse modelling to track the source of contaminants assuming that the transport velocities and input time are either known or can be estimated with sufficient accuracy the aims of this study were 1 to make use of 1d analytical solutions from ade and 2rne models to inversely model transport distances on the basis of breakthrough curve data input time and transport velocity 2 to evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of this method using reference tracers to test the potential of the tst method and 3 to apply the model to event based data thereby revealing the specific requirements and uncertainties involved and discuss the general feasibility of this approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling transport modelling in this study is based on analytical solutions of the one dimensional advection dispersion eq 1d ade with constant coefficients in time and space velocity v dispersion d mass m and one of its extensions the two region non equilibrium model 2rne with additional non equilibrium parameters the partitioning coefficient β and the mass transfer coefficient ω as described in toride et al 1999 only non reactive transport was considered i e retardation equilibrium adsorption degradation and production were not implemented yet analytical solutions for a semi infinite domain with a neumann boundary condition at the outlet a dirac δ boundary condition at the inlet and zero initial concentration c x t 0 0 were applied the ade and 2rne as described in toride et al 1999 were implemented in gnu octave version 6 1 0 henceforth referred to as adetst and 2rnetst model analytical solutions and parameter descriptions are given in the supplementary information si section 1 numerical integration within the 2rne model si equ 5 was performed using either the quadgk algorithm or the quadgl algorithm the first of these algorithms is based on an adaptive gauß konrod quadrature shampine et al 2008 with a relative error tolerance in the adaption procedure set to 10 6 and an absolute tolerance set to 10 10 the second algorithm is based on an adaptive lobatto rule gander and gautschi 2000 using a relative tolerance of 10 8 the levenberg marquardt nonlinear regression method from the optim software package was used to solve inverse problems bard 1974 inverse modelling for source tracking included fitting following parameters transport distance x dispersion d mass m partitioning coefficient β and the mass transfer coefficient ω the consistency of the ade and 2rne models implemented in octave was tested against the cxtfit code for estimating transport parameters from laboratory or field tracer experiments toride et al 1999 implemented in the stanmod software package version 6 1 0 van genuchten et al 2012 stanmod models are hereinafter referred to as standmod model or adestmod and 2rnestmod model forward and inverse models were compared for a broad range of input parameters and verfied the general functioning of the code see si section 3 model benchmark using the peak velocity vpeak as the model s input velocity has a number of advantages it can be readily determined from tracer test btcs where the transport distance is known and its precision depends only on the temporal resolution and quality of the data see chapter 4 1 2 for further discussion therefore using vpeak as the model s input velocity would be advantageous yet analytical solutions of the ade and 2rne are based on the mean velocity vmean and cannot be solved using the peak velocity without further ado one way to still use vpeak as the model s input velocity is to adapt vmean iteratively until vpeak of the model vpeak mod converges to the input vpeak vpeak in for convenience vpeak in is used as the initial value for vmean the convergence criterion of the model was set so that the difference of vpeak mod and vpeak in normalized to vpeak mod is lower than 0 5 this procedure of adapting and comparing was implemented in octave using a loop so that vpeak can be used as an alternative input parameter for further details see si section 5 both 1d and 2d sensitivity analyses were performed for the 1d analyses a single optimized fit parameter was varied between 60 and 140 of its actual value while the others remained fixed and the root mean square error rmse was calculated for the 2d analyses two parameters were varied systematically between 80 and 120 of the fitted result except for β which was only varied up to its maximum value of 1 2 2 study area contaminations of spring water were investigated within a karst catchment located in south west germany about 70 km south of stuttgart fig 1 the investigated gallusquelle spring is fed predominantly by autogenic recharge it has a mean discharge rate of 0 45 m3 s 1 the first second and third quartiles are 0 24 0 35 and 0 57 m3 s 1 the catchment covers about 45 km2 and consists mainly of rural land 55 forest 27 grassland 15 crops with only 3 urban land zirlewagen et al 2016 the aquifer consists of upper jurassic limestones with groundwater flowing through a network of conduits fractures and small scale solution channels sauter 1992 the spring water is generally of high quality but is frequently affected by bacterial contamination often associated with organic micropollutants such as cyclamate metazachlor or caffeine heinz et al 2006 and 2009 hillebrand et al 2012a and 2014 schiperski et al 2015b zirlewagen et al 2016 different sources of contamination have previously been identified within the catchment associated with different types of input 1 a stormwater tank discharging sporadically into a dry valley distance to the spring is about 9 1 km heinz et al 2009 zirlewagen et al 2016 2 a combined sewer system hillebrand et al 2012a 3 herbicides applied in agricultural areas throughout the catchment schiperski et al 2015b hillebrand et al 2014 zirlewagen et al 2016 and 4 possible contamination from roadway runoff schiperski et al 2015a a number of tracer studies based on injections at different sinkholes within the catchment area have shown a linear relationship between spring discharge and flow velocity for discharge rates of between 0 1 and 0 8 m3 s 1 which indicates phreatic conditions merkel 1991 sauter 1992 tranter et al 2017 we have reviewed all tracer tests documented for the catchment area and observed at the gallusquelle spring si table s2 and only data from tests that used the well established tracer compounds uranine and sulforhodamine g have been used in our investigations the differences in mobility between the two compounds within the catchment appear to be negligible with their travel times only varying by about 2 geyer et al 2007 only tracer tests with a direct input into highly permeable surface karst features were selected all of the tracer tests were conducted during dry weather and periods of flow recession when flow conditions were very close to a steady state over the duration of each tracer test most tracer studies have been analysed using a 2rne model as the equilibrium ade model has been shown to be less appropriate e g birk et al 2005 schiperski et al 2019 a linear relationship between discharge rate and peak velocity velocity associated with the peak transit time i e time at which the peak concentration occurs is observed that not correlated to the input distance fig 2 this has also been inferred at other karst aquifers using modelling approaches jeannin 2001 the linear regression for the discharge q and the peak velocity vpeak shows a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 996 for the study area based on data from 10 tracer tests with data points being located within a 2σ confidence interval fig 2 blue dashed line the principal considerations and assumptions involved when using this determined q vpeak relationship for source tracking in this study are discussed in a later section see section 4 3 3 results 3 1 proof of concept 3 1 1 modelling tracer tests using tst models after successfully benchmarking the tst models with synthetic data si section 3 model benchmark the 2rnetst was then used with field data the 2rnetst model was evaluated for two of the tracer tests at the gallusquelle that were considered to be particularly suitable due to their high resolution data different skewness different travel distances 3000 m and 9100 m representing 25 and 75 of the extent of the catchment respectively and similar p values schiperski et al 2016 tranter et al 2017 for a general validation of the 2rnetst model with field tracer data the mean velocity was calculated from tracer btcs using the 2rnestmod model and subsequently applied as a fixed input parameter for the 2rnetst model to obtain the transport distance x the dispersion d the mass m the portioning coefficient β and the mass transfer coefficient ω for tracer test 1 uranine was released into the aquifer at a distance of 3000 m from the spring when the spring s discharge rate was 0 225 m3 s 1 schiperski et al 2016 a mean velocity of 36 90 m h 1 and a dispersion of 150 m2 h 1 were obtained from the 2rnestmod model p 738 r2 0 999 rmse 0 28 µg l 1 for full details see schiperski et al 2016 using this mean velocity a distance of 2992 m was obtained from the 2rnetst model yielding an r2 of 0 999 and an rmse of 0 28 µg l 1 the distance of 2992 m is equivalent to a tmean of 81 08 h and a relative difference of 0 3 from stanmod s input distance of 3000 m fig 3 table 1 the remaining fit parameters are similar to those in schiperski et al 2016 with the exception of ω table 1 which was observed to have low impact on the overall fit at beta values close to 1 this means that the 2rnetst model performs well with field data compared to the 2rnestmod model since the resulting r2 and rmse of the 2rnetst model are very close to those from the 2rnestmod model table 1 tracer test 2 was performed over a distance of 9100 m from the injection point to the spring when the spring s discharge rate was 0 8 m3 s 1 using sulforhodamine g tranter et al 2017 the btc originally fitted using the 2rnestmod model revealed a mean velocity of 115 3 m h 1 and a dispersion of 1626 m2 h 1 p 645 r2 0 993 rmse 0 14 µg l 1 tranter et al 2017 the tailing in this btc is more pronounced compared to tracer test 1 the 2rnetst model yields a distance of 9090 m which is almost identical to stanmod s input distance 9100 m 0 1 difference r2 0 993 rmse 0 14 µg l 1 again this means that the inverse 2rnetst model performs just as well as the 2rnestmod model fig 3 table 1 3 1 2 sensitivity analyses for tracer tests one dimensional sensitivity analyses of the 2rnetst model which involves varying one parameter while the others remain constant showed that the rsme is mostly sensitive to changes in the velocity v the transport distance x and the partitioning coefficient β which is favourable with regard to its use for source tracking fig 4 the sensitivity is generally lower towards changes in m d and ω which explains the differences in those values in tracer test 1 table 1 only minor differences can be observed in the sensitivities of the two tracer tests rmse related to changes in β and x have local maxima at about 15 and rmse related to vmean at 15 all followed by a plateau with reduced sensitivities at the opposite side of each plateau the rmse increases steadily with the steepest gradient and hence the highest sensitivity at values of 85 and 115 the variation in β is restricted towards its upper value of 1 where the 2rne model approaches the ade model but the impact that lower values of β have on the rmse is similar to that of vmean and x since β has a distinct impact on the shape of the btc it can be better fitted compared to distance and velocity both of which only result in an effective shift of the btc 2d sensitivity plots derived from the 2rnetst model fig 5 describe the effect of β and vmean in combination with the transport distance x as 1d sensitivity analyses showed that these are the most relevant parameters the sensitivity plots for v x fig 5a and c show a linear relationship between vmean and x as can be expected from a v x t relationship bearing in mind that vmean is a constant input parameter this underlines the importance of choosing correct velocity parameters as any error in vmean translates directly into an error in x the slope of minimal rmse defined by the mean transit time tmean in contrast the two dimensional sensitivity analysis for β x shows a negative linear trend with a well defined depression around the optimal fit parameters fig 5b and d this means that if both β and x are fitted the model converges towards this depression overestimating β has less impact on x than underestimating this parameter as the slope of minimal rmse is almost constant at β values close to 1 for tracer test 1 this is in contrast to tracer test 2 where errors in β can translate to a considerable underestimation of the distance x as the optimal fit occurs at lower β values than in tracer test 1 3 1 3 application of peak velocities and related uncertainties the mean tracer velocity has so far been assumed to be known in terms of vmean to demonstrate the proper functioning and the sensitivity of the 2rnetst model to the input parameters the flow velocity can vary significantly between different contamination events especially in karst aquifers and rivers and needs to be determined individually for each particular event peak velocity data is easily obtained from btc it is independent of the model and is often recorded in public archives it can therefore be used as an alternative input parameter the conversion of vpeak to vmean is performed in an adaptive loop after a first rough fit of the btc see section 0 modelling the aforementioned q vpeak regression was used to determine vpeak for individual events for which tracer tests 1 and 2 were excluded vpeak 156 2 q 6 4 predicting velocities based on a q vpeak relationship introduces uncertainties in the modelled 1d transport distance the regression reveals uncertainties in the predicted vpeak of about 7m h 1 for the presented dataset table 2 the prediction interval for 1d transport distance was modelled based on the uncertainties in the peak velocity fig 6 table 2 since upper and lower limits of the prediction interval in the q vpeak relationship are almost parallel the relative errors in vpeak and hence also in x increase for small velocities absolute values of the modelled prediction interval for the 1d transport distance is virtually the same for both tracer studies because the absolute uncertainties in the predicted vpeak are similar relative errors in x are 6 for tracer test 2 conducted at high flow velocities and 16 for tracer test 1 conducted at low flow velocities table 2 the displayed distances in fig 6 must be considered as maximum 1d transport distances since the tracer velocities on which they are based are expected to represent maximum flow velocities within the catchment the prediction interval in fig 6 is drawn with a solid line in regions where the most tracer studies were performed and where velocities can therefore be well predicted on the basis of spring discharge rates in the north eastern part of the catchment the resulting prediction intervals in fig 6 are dashed indicating high levels of uncertainty due to the absence of information from tracer tests 3 1 4 application of tst models to a contamination event using microbial source tracking methods stange and tiehm investigated a bacterial contamination event that was detected together with a slight increase in turbidity in the gallusquelle spring water following a short series of periods of intense rainfall on the basis of relatively small quantities of human dna markers the contamination was related to the remobilization of bacteria by rainwater rather than fresh sewage input stange and tiehm 2020 the bacteria were therefore probably mobilized by the first rain event which took place between 22 00 on 06 10 12 and 07 00 on 07 10 12 fitting a normal distribution gave a mean input time for the event of 02 24 on 07 10 12 the fitting was performed in fityk 1 3 1 data processing and nonlinear curve fitting software wojdyr 2010 using data points of precipitation and a gauss normal distribution the maximum error of 9 hours in the input timing is relatively small considering the peak transit time for the coliforms of 200 hours steady state conditions were almost achieved during the event due to a rather slight increase in the spring s discharge rate from 0 2 m3 s 1 to 0 3 m3 s 1 a peak velocity of 45 m h 1 was modelled with upper and lower values of 38 3 m h 1 and 51 6 m h 1 using the established q vpeak regression for a mean discharge of 0 25 m3 s 1 a distance of 9520 m was modelled using the 2rnetst model with r2 0 992 and an rmse of 72 cfu l 1 fig 7 table 3 the adetst model hardly fits the tailing of the btc and the rmse of 178 n l 1 is more than twice that of the 2rnetst model and results in a much lower mass recovery the uncertainties in both the velocity and the input time need to be taken into account when estimating transport distances the modelled 1d transport distance of 9500 m from the 2rnetst model roughly coincides with a stormwater retention tank at a distance of 9100 m fig 1 this tank is assumed to be an important factor in water quality impairment and a connection between the tank and the gallusquelle spring has already been suspected by a number of previous authors following investigations using mst stange and tiehm 2020 organic micropollutants heinz et al 2006 and 2009 schiperski et al 2015b zirlewagen et al 2016 and artificial tracers tranter et al 2017 uncertainties indicated by the q vpeak prediction interval yielded upper and lower boundaries of 8100 m and 10 900 m for the 2rnetst model r2 0 994 and rmse 75 cfu l 1 for both uncertainties relating to the input time were taken into account by using the beginning and end of the precipitation event as input times i e 22 00 on 06 10 12 and 07 00 on 07 10 12 together with the predicted peak velocity of 45 m h 1 this yielded lower and upper distances of xlow 9300 m and xupp 9700 m r2 0 995 and rmse 71 n l 1 for both 4 discussion 4 1 general model application and applicability analytical solutions of the ade and 2rne implemented in octave are useful for simplified analyses of contaminant transport and also for rapid sensitivity analyses especially in situations where distributed numerical models are inappropriate due to a sparsity of spatial information van genuchten et al 2012 and 2013 which is the case for most karst aquifers kavousi et al 2020 while the presented models are specifically intended for use in karst aquifers at a catchment scale they also have the potential for a broader range of applications in flow systems such as in fractured aquifers in which transport can be adequately described by 1d ade and 2rne models vincenzi et al 2009 streams and rivers including exchanges within hyporheic zones field 1997 van genuchten et al 2013 wu and hunkeler 2013 and in heterogeneous porous media binder et al 2021 such as alluvial or sandy aquifers goeppert 2021 epikarst flynn and synreich 2010 and glaciers dahlke et al 2015 the main disadvantage of the presented approach is the necessity of estimating or quantifying the time of contaminant input the type of input function and the flow velocity ab initio this is mainly attributed to complex hydraulics in karst aquifers e g oehlmann et al 2013 which can to date not be fitted simultaneously to breakthrough curve data of contaminants in comparison approaches in porous media are much more sophisticated and allow for modelling complex input function simultaneously with groundwater hydraulics gómez hernández and xu 2021 feasibilities and specific limitations of the adetst and 2rnetst models in view of their specific assumptions whether applied to karst aquifers or other flow systems need to be taken into account as discussed in the following subsections 4 1 1 parameters and parameter sensitivity sensitivity analyses of the 2rnetst model show that fitting of the transport distance should be performed with initial parameter estimates that are larger than the final ones in order to obtain a high level of sensitivity and avoid local minima in the rsme velocity input time and to a certain extent the β value all have a strong impact on the 1d transport distance errors in any one of these will translate into errors in x depending on the transit time i e higher flow velocities earlier input times longer transit times and smaller β values will all result in larger estimates of the 1d transport distance prediction intervals for the transport distance can be substantially reduced by using accurate estimates of the flow velocity and the input time determination of the input time is strongly dependant on the nature of the contamination and its release history for example sewer overflow might show a certain delay while remobilization from the unsaturated zone might occur at almost the same time as the onset of precipitation dispersion d and the dimensionless mobile immobile mass transfer coefficient ω are of minor importance when estimating the transport distance x nonetheless these parameters can be compared to those obtained from tracer tests or other contamination events and thereby serve as quality criteria and indicate discrepancies in the model s assumptions e g non point pulse like inputs such non dirac inputs would become evident from the transport parameters provided the duration of input is not negligible compared to the transit time schiperski et al 2019 if the dispersivity d v is high compared to previous data over a particular transport distance it could indicate either a prolonged input non dirac like or a non point source the proposed model performs well over a broad range of parameter sets compared to stanmod we observed anomalously low concentrations at certain timesteps when using the quadgl algorithm with a low tolerance of integration e g 10 2 or 10 4 for the 2rnetst model at high p values together with low β values p 10 000 β 0 6 if values for p and ω are high and the values for β are low e g p 10 000 β 0 65 and ω 0 5 then we suggest reducing the tolerance criterion in the quadgl algorithm to 10 10 or alternatively applying the gauss konrod rule quadgk algorithm at the cost of additional calculation time 4 1 2 implementation of peak velocity using the peak velocity vpeak as an input parameter has a number of advantages it can be readily determined from tracer test btcs where the transport distance is known and its temporal resolution and measurement precision depend only on the quality of the data peak velocities are therefore more likely to be recorded by authorities as historical data in contrast the mean velocity vmean has a number of disadvantages as its value depends on the method used for btc analysis for example whether the method of moments is used or transport model fitting in the latter case the mean velocity will depend on the type of model used e g ade or 2rne this difference is roughly illustrated by the variable vmean values but consistent vpeak values in bacterial contamination source tracking table 3 with the vmean obtained from the adetst model being 20 higher than that obtained from the 2rnetst model where the btc tails are significant vmean may also be affected by the time span over which the btc is evaluated and in a similar manner by the quantification limit of the tracer analysis transit times or flow velocities that are obtained from different evaluation approaches need to be converted the relationship between peak transit time and mean transit time depends mainly on the p and β values and only to a minor extent on ω within a range of 0 5 to 1 5 fig 8 a and 8b if both mean and peak transit times are used for the calculations a correction term from fig 8b needs to be used in order to avoid errors provided p and β can be estimated alternatively the use of a correction algorithm is recommended as used in this study the correction term can be simplified to tmean tpeak β and thus vmean β vpeak for p values greater than 100 in the 2rne model for the ade model tpeak equals tpeak tmean which can be calculated using 1 t p e a k 1 p p 2 9 3 the relative error associated with using tpeak instead of tmean falls below 5 at p 60 for the derivation see si section 1 2 4 2 constant coefficients lumped parameters and steady state spatially constant transport parameters v d β and ω need to be considered to be lumped parameters that summarize all flow transport processes over the whole transport path aiming at an adequate explanation of the btc the term velocities refers to apparent velocities averaged over the distance and ignoring vadose transit times and tortuosity which does not affect tst as long as tortuosity is applied consistently to either all or none of the data tortuosity is generally unknown accept for in cave studies and only empirical values from published literature can therefore be used actual conduit flow velocities and their spatial variations are consequently very difficult to obtain they can however vary significantly with distance from the spring lauber et al 2014 gabrovšek et al 2010 for the gallusquelle catchment virtually all variation in the apparent velocities obtained from artificial tracer tests could be explained by variations in the rate of discharge and no distance dependency could be inferred although numerical modelling suggested significant variations in conduit flow velocities with distance from the spring oehlmann et al 2015 the presented discharge velocity correlation was obtained from tracer tests conducted during periods of prolonged flow recession when the flow regime can be assumed to be in a steady state over the duration of the tests tst under transient conditions would however be highly beneficial considering that contamination of spring water is often detected following intense recharge events e g pronk et al 2006 stange and tiehm 2020 for contamination events at the gallusquelle spring associated with marked variations in discharge rates heinz et al 2009 recorded much higher peak velocities and poorer correlation with time averaged discharge rates than the q vpeak relationship that we found in this study considerable discrepancies must therefore be expected between q vpeak data obtained from tracer tests during base flow periods and event based q vpeak data steady state models that for example average discharge or velocity over time are generally not suitable for interpreting contaminant transport under highly transient conditions zuber 1986 it might however be valid to use steady state models for events that have only small direct recharge components and hence minimal variations in discharge rates werner et al 1997 indeed tst performed well for the particular event investigated in this study suggesting that both the model was suitable and the velocity prediction based on the discharge rate valid 4 3 flow velocity and transport distance in karst aquifers flow velocities in the gallusquelle spring under highly transient conditions can not currently be predicted even under steady state conditions discharge velocity correlations are strictly only valid for the flow paths covered by the particular tracer tests used or a within a major branch of the conduit system as can be deduced from lauber et al 2014 a fundamental assumption of the proposed approach is that the selected artificial tracer tests represent the best possible connections and hence the highest apparent velocities for substances released at the land surface i e infiltration conditions are optimized by the removal of soil cover release into sinkholes and flushing before and after tracer input using maximum velocities for tst results in estimates of the maximum transport distances lower velocities and therefore shorter transport distances should certainly be expected for transport through soil cover and less permeable parts of the vadose and phreatic zones the approach presented herein therefore targets the maximum transport distance this maximum transport distance approaches the actual input distance if the input location is located on highly permeable karst features such as dry valleys or dolines results obtained from tst that have high levels of uncertainty and or velocity ambiguity should be considered indicative rather than definitive confirmation of tst results with artificial tracer tests may therefore be necessary especially in environmental forensics 5 conclusions the approach presented in this manuscript using the 1d distance between a sampling point and the input location of a compound is feasible for source tracking of contaminants in a karst aquifer it allows rapid analysis of uncertainties and sensitivities and it is advantageous in situations where the applicability of distributed models is limited ambiguities in the results obtained with microbial or chemical source tracking similar location but different sources can be significantly reduced by incorporating this transport based source tracking approach uncertainties relate mainly to the tracer velocity and the input time although velocities in karst aquifers are heterogeneously distributed a maximum distance approach using tracer test data is proposed there are some specific requirements concerning the suitability of the model these being 1 approximately steady state flow conditions 2 an instantaneous point input dirac input 3 conservative transport of the tracing compound 4 the input time and tracer velocity input parameters must be known 5 the velocity is assumed to be constant along the transport path and 6 only single peak fitting is possible to date additional transport phenomena such as equilibrium sorption retardation and degradation as well as other input functions multipeak fitting and certain v x relationship can be readily incorporated into the model the applicability of the model has been demonstrated for tracking the input of bacterial contamination in spring water within a karst aquifer at close to steady state conditions the approach is expected to be applicable under the aforementioned specific requirements to other flow systems such as fractured and porous aquifers glaciers and especially rivers where flow velocities are easier to obtain declaration of competing

16228,identification and location of contamination sources is crucial for water resource protection especially in karst aquifers which provide 25 of the world s population with water but are highly vulnerable to contamination transport based source tracking is proposed and verified here as a complementary approach to microbial and chemical source tracking in karst aquifers for identifying and locating such sources of contamination and for avoiding ambiguities that might arise from using one method alone the transport distance is inversely modelled from contaminant breakthrough curves btc based on analytical solutions of the 1d two region non equilibrium advection dispersion equation using gnu octave besides the btc the model requires reliable estimates of transport velocity and input time the model is shown to be robust allows scripted based automated 2d sensitivity analyses interplay of two parameters and can be favourable when distributed numerical models are inappropriate due to insufficient data sensitivity analyses illustrate that the model is highly sensitive to the input time the flow velocity and the fraction of the mobile fluid region a conclusive verification approach was performed by applying the method to synthetic data tracer tests and event based field data transport distances were correctly modelled for a set of artificial tracer tests using a discharge velocity relationship that could be established for the respective karst catchment for the first time such an approach was shown to be applicable to estimate the maximum distance to the contamination source for coliform bacteria in karst spring water combined with microbial source tracking however prediction intervals for the transport distance can be large even in well studied karst catchments mainly related to uncertainties in the flow velocity and the input time using a maximum transport distance is proposed to account for less permeable slower pathways in general transport

protection especially for those water resources that have a high intrinsic vulnerability to contamination due to for example low transit times and low natural attenuation e g neukum and azzam 2009 gurdak and qi 2012 carbonate and karst aquifers are present over about 15 of the world s continents and an estimated 17 of the world s population in 2015 lived within karst catchment areas goldscheider et al 2020 understanding and modelling flow within carbonate aquifers is extremely challenging due to their unique hydrology and exceptional heterogeneity especially when they are karstified ford and williams 2007 the hydrology of such karstified carbonate aquifers can be described as a network of highly permeable fissures and conduits embedded in a less permeable matrix resulting in flows that are governed by two or three different types of porosity e g white and schmidt 1966 vulnerability assessments in karst catchments are therefore particularly challenging doerfliger et al 1999 daly et al 2002 a number of methods have been developed to identify the type of contaminant source in karst aquifers through specific characteristics or fingerprinting in

be source specific e g zirlewagen et al 2016 nödler et al 2016 vystavna et al 2019 carrey et al 2021 mccance et al 2020 while mst and cst are indispensable for identifying the type of source both approaches run into problems if a number of similar source signals are present and individual sources can no longer be distinguished james et al 2016 the resulting ambiguities can sometimes be resolved by combining mst and cst with information on contaminant transport within the particular system allowing an estimate to be made of the transport distance and hence the input location e g zirlewagen et al 2016 however such attempts are rare even in porous media the one dimensional 1d transport distance in karst aquifers is based on a transit time determined from breakthrough curves btcs with known or estimated input times and flow velocities the peak velocity also called dominant velocity is calculated based on the peak transit time time at which a maximum in concentration is reached tpeak and can be easily read out from btcs provided they have high temporal resolutions and accuracies käss 1998 goldscheider et al 2008 however btcs for event based data on bacterial contamination or organic pollutants in karst catchments often do not satisfy these conditions since sampling and analysis usually polymerase chain reaction pcr and high performance liquid chromatography hplc are both expensive and time consuming sampling intervals are often large in relation to transit times e g ryan and meimann 1996 stange and tiehm 2020 uncertainties associated with the determination of tpeak can be to some extent mitigated by using appropriate transport distance modelling transport modelling based on analytical solutions of the advection dispersion equation ade has become the standard approach for evaluating btcs from tracer studies in karst aquifers in fact most tracer studies in groundwater have been performed in karst aquifers worthington 1999 a large number of tracer studies in karst aquifers have revealed rapid flows within the networks of conduits e g worthington and ford 1995 in addition to the 1d ade model field and pinsky 2000 also used a 1d two region non equilibrium 2rne model to model tracer transport in karst aquifers in order to take into account non fickian transport as is often indicated by strongly skewed breakthrough curves with long tailings within the model non fickian behaviour is partly accounted for by lumping it into a mass exchange term see chapter 2 1 the 2rne model has since become popular for analysing artificial

for detecting the sources of pollutants is a state of the art technique in porous media sidauruk et al 1998 ayaz et al 2021 gómez hernández and xu 2021 but it has to date not yet been implemented in the stanmod software package or evaluated for karst specific problems in this study we propose the use of transport based source tracking tst i e 1d inverse modelling to track the source of contaminants assuming that the transport velocities and input time are either known or can be estimated with sufficient accuracy the aims of this study were 1 to make use of 1d analytical solutions from ade and 2rne models to inversely model transport distances on the basis of breakthrough curve data input time and transport velocity 2 to evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of this method using reference tracers to test the potential of the tst method and 3 to apply the model to event based data thereby revealing the specific requirements and uncertainties involved and discuss the general feasibility of this approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling transport modelling in this study is based on analytical solutions of the one dimensional advection dispersion eq 1d ade with constant coefficients in time and space velocity v dispersion d mass m and one of its extensions the two region non equilibrium model 2rne with additional non equilibrium parameters the partitioning coefficient β and the mass transfer coefficient ω as described in toride et al 1999 only non reactive transport was considered i e retardation equilibrium adsorption degradation and production were not implemented yet analytical solutions for a semi infinite domain with a neumann boundary condition at the outlet a dirac δ boundary condition at the inlet and zero initial concentration c x t 0 0 were applied the ade and 2rne as described in toride et al 1999 were implemented in gnu octave version 6 1 0 henceforth referred to as adetst and 2rnetst model analytical solutions and parameter descriptions are given in the supplementary information si section 1 numerical integration within the 2rne model si equ 5 was performed using either the quadgk algorithm or the quadgl algorithm the first of these algorithms is based on an adaptive gauß konrod quadrature shampine et al 2008 with a relative error tolerance in the adaption procedure set to 10 6 and an absolute tolerance set to 10 10 the second algorithm is based on an adaptive lobatto rule gander and gautschi 2000 using a relative tolerance of 10 8 the levenberg marquardt nonlinear regression method from the optim software package was used to solve inverse problems bard 1974 inverse modelling for source tracking included fitting following parameters transport distance x dispersion d mass m partitioning coefficient β and the mass transfer coefficient ω the consistency of the ade and 2rne models implemented in octave was tested against the cxtfit code for estimating transport parameters from laboratory or field tracer experiments toride et al 1999 implemented in the stanmod software package version 6 1 0 van genuchten et al 2012 stanmod models are hereinafter referred to as standmod model or adestmod and 2rnestmod model forward and inverse models were compared for a broad range of input parameters and verfied the general functioning of the code see si section 3 model benchmark using the peak velocity vpeak as the model s input velocity has a number of advantages it can be readily determined from tracer test btcs where the transport distance is known and its precision depends only on the temporal resolution and quality of the data see chapter 4 1 2 for further discussion therefore using vpeak as the model s input velocity would be advantageous yet analytical solutions of the ade and 2rne are based on the mean velocity vmean and cannot be solved using the peak velocity without further ado one way to still use vpeak as the model s input velocity is to adapt vmean iteratively until vpeak of the model vpeak mod converges to the input vpeak vpeak in for convenience vpeak in is used as the initial value for vmean the convergence criterion of the model was set so that the difference of vpeak mod and vpeak in normalized to vpeak mod is lower than 0 5 this procedure of adapting and comparing was implemented in octave using a loop so that vpeak can be used as an alternative input parameter for further details see si section 5 both 1d and 2d sensitivity analyses were performed for the 1d analyses a single optimized fit parameter was varied between 60 and 140 of its actual value while the others remained fixed and the root mean square error rmse was calculated for the 2d analyses two parameters were varied systematically between 80 and 120 of the fitted result except for β which was only varied up to its maximum value of 1 2 2 study area contaminations of spring water were investigated within a karst catchment located in south west germany about 70 km south of stuttgart fig 1 the investigated gallusquelle spring is fed predominantly by autogenic recharge it has a mean discharge rate of 0 45 m3 s 1 the first second and third quartiles are 0 24 0 35 and 0 57 m3 s 1 the catchment covers about 45 km2 and consists mainly of rural land 55 forest 27 grassland 15 crops with only 3 urban land zirlewagen et al 2016 the aquifer consists of upper jurassic limestones with groundwater flowing through a network of conduits fractures and small scale solution channels sauter 1992 the spring water is generally of high quality but is frequently affected by bacterial contamination often associated with organic micropollutants such as cyclamate metazachlor or caffeine heinz et al 2006 and 2009 hillebrand et al 2012a and 2014 schiperski et al 2015b zirlewagen et al 2016 different sources of contamination have previously been identified within the catchment associated with different types of input 1 a stormwater tank discharging sporadically into a dry valley distance to the spring is about 9 1 km heinz et al 2009 zirlewagen et al 2016 2 a combined sewer system hillebrand et al 2012a 3 herbicides applied in agricultural areas throughout the catchment schiperski et al 2015b hillebrand et al 2014 zirlewagen et al 2016 and 4 possible contamination from roadway runoff schiperski et al 2015a a number of tracer studies based on injections at different sinkholes within the catchment area have shown a linear relationship between spring discharge and flow velocity for discharge rates of between 0 1 and 0 8 m3 s 1 which indicates phreatic conditions merkel 1991 sauter 1992 tranter et al 2017 we have reviewed all tracer tests documented for the catchment area and observed at the gallusquelle spring si table s2 and only data from tests that used the well established tracer compounds uranine and sulforhodamine g have been used in our investigations the differences in mobility between the two compounds within the catchment appear to be negligible with their travel times only varying by about 2 geyer et al 2007 only tracer tests with a direct input into highly permeable surface karst features were selected all of the tracer tests were conducted during dry weather and periods of flow recession when flow conditions were very close to a steady state over the duration of each tracer test most tracer studies have been analysed using a 2rne model as the equilibrium ade model has been shown to be less appropriate e g birk et al 2005 schiperski et al 2019 a linear relationship between discharge rate and peak velocity velocity associated with the peak transit time i e time at which the peak concentration occurs is observed that not correlated to the input distance fig 2 this has also been inferred at other karst aquifers using modelling approaches jeannin 2001 the linear regression for the discharge q and the peak velocity vpeak shows a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 996 for the study area based on data from 10 tracer tests with data points being located within a 2σ confidence interval fig 2 blue dashed line the principal considerations and assumptions involved when using this determined q vpeak relationship for source tracking in this study are discussed in a later section see section 4 3 3 results 3 1 proof of concept 3 1 1 modelling tracer tests using tst models after successfully benchmarking the tst models with synthetic data si section 3 model benchmark the 2rnetst was then used with field data the 2rnetst model was evaluated for two of the tracer tests at the gallusquelle that were considered to be particularly suitable due to their high resolution data different skewness different travel distances 3000 m and 9100 m representing 25 and 75 of the extent of the catchment respectively and similar p values schiperski et al 2016 tranter et al 2017 for a general validation of the 2rnetst model with field tracer data the mean velocity was calculated from tracer btcs using the 2rnestmod model and subsequently applied as a fixed input parameter for the 2rnetst model to obtain the transport distance x the dispersion d the mass m the portioning coefficient β and the mass transfer coefficient ω for tracer test 1 uranine was released into the aquifer at a distance of 3000 m from the spring when the spring s discharge rate was 0 225 m3 s 1 schiperski et al 2016 a mean velocity of 36 90 m h 1 and a dispersion of 150 m2 h 1 were obtained from the 2rnestmod model p 738 r2 0 999 rmse 0 28 µg l 1 for full details see schiperski et al 2016 using this mean velocity a distance of 2992 m was obtained from the 2rnetst model yielding an r2 of 0 999 and an rmse of 0 28 µg l 1 the distance of 2992 m is equivalent to a tmean of 81 08 h and a relative difference of 0 3 from stanmod s input distance of 3000 m fig 3 table 1 the remaining fit parameters are similar to those in schiperski et al 2016 with the exception of ω table 1 which was observed to have low impact on the overall fit at beta values close to 1 this means that the 2rnetst model performs well with field data compared to the 2rnestmod model since the resulting r2 and rmse of the 2rnetst model are very close to those from the 2rnestmod model table 1 tracer test 2 was performed over a distance of 9100 m from the injection point to the spring when the spring s discharge rate was 0 8 m3 s 1 using sulforhodamine g tranter et al 2017 the btc originally fitted using the 2rnestmod model revealed a mean velocity of 115 3 m h 1 and a dispersion of 1626 m2 h 1 p 645 r2 0 993 rmse 0 14 µg l 1 tranter et al 2017 the tailing in this btc is more pronounced compared to tracer test 1 the 2rnetst model yields a distance of 9090 m which is almost identical to stanmod s input distance 9100 m 0 1 difference r2 0 993 rmse 0 14 µg l 1 again this means that the inverse 2rnetst model performs just as well as the 2rnestmod model fig 3 table 1 3 1 2 sensitivity analyses for tracer tests one dimensional sensitivity analyses of the 2rnetst model which involves varying one parameter while the others remain constant showed that the rsme is mostly sensitive to changes in the velocity v the transport distance x and the partitioning coefficient β which is favourable with regard to its use for source tracking fig 4 the sensitivity is generally lower towards changes in m d and ω which explains the differences in those values in tracer test 1 table 1 only minor differences can be observed in the sensitivities of the two tracer tests rmse related to changes in β and x have local maxima at about 15 and rmse related to vmean at 15 all followed by a plateau with reduced sensitivities at the opposite side of each plateau the rmse increases steadily with the steepest gradient and hence the highest sensitivity at values of 85 and 115 the variation in β is restricted towards its upper value of 1 where the 2rne model approaches the ade model but the impact that lower values of β have on the rmse is similar to that of vmean and x since β has a distinct impact on the shape of the btc it can be better fitted compared to distance and velocity both of which only result in an effective shift of the btc 2d sensitivity plots derived from the 2rnetst model fig 5 describe the effect of β and vmean in combination with the transport distance x as 1d sensitivity analyses showed that these are the most relevant parameters the sensitivity plots for v x fig 5a and c show a linear relationship between vmean and x as can be expected from a v x t relationship bearing in mind that vmean is a constant input parameter this underlines the importance of choosing correct velocity parameters as any error in vmean translates directly into an error in x the slope of minimal rmse defined by the mean transit time tmean in contrast the two dimensional sensitivity analysis for β x shows a negative linear trend with a well defined depression around the optimal fit parameters fig 5b and d this means that if both β and x are fitted the model converges towards this depression overestimating β has less impact on x than underestimating this parameter as the slope of minimal rmse is almost constant at β values close to 1 for tracer test 1 this is in contrast to tracer test 2 where errors in β can translate to a considerable underestimation of the distance x as the optimal fit occurs at lower β values than in tracer test 1 3 1 3 application of peak velocities and related uncertainties the mean tracer velocity has so far been assumed to be known in terms of vmean to demonstrate the proper functioning and the sensitivity of the 2rnetst model to the input parameters the flow velocity can vary significantly between different contamination events especially in karst aquifers and rivers and needs to be determined individually for each particular event peak velocity data is easily obtained from btc it is independent of the model and is often recorded in public archives it can therefore be used as an alternative input parameter the conversion of vpeak to vmean is performed in an adaptive loop after a first rough fit of the btc see section 0 modelling the aforementioned q vpeak regression was used to determine vpeak for individual events for which tracer tests 1 and 2 were excluded vpeak 156 2 q 6 4 predicting velocities based on a q vpeak relationship introduces uncertainties in the modelled 1d transport distance the regression reveals uncertainties in the predicted vpeak of about 7m h 1 for the presented dataset table 2 the prediction interval for 1d transport distance was modelled based on the uncertainties in the peak velocity fig 6 table 2 since upper and lower limits of the prediction interval in the q vpeak relationship are almost parallel the relative errors in vpeak and hence also in x increase for small velocities absolute values of the modelled prediction interval for the 1d transport distance is virtually the same for both tracer studies because the absolute uncertainties in the predicted vpeak are similar relative errors in x are 6 for tracer test 2 conducted at high flow velocities and 16 for tracer test 1 conducted at low flow velocities table 2 the displayed distances in fig 6 must be considered as maximum 1d transport distances since the tracer velocities on which they are based are expected to represent maximum flow velocities within the catchment the prediction interval in fig 6 is drawn with a solid line in regions where the most tracer studies were performed and where velocities can therefore be well predicted on the basis of spring discharge rates in the north eastern part of the catchment the resulting prediction intervals in fig 6 are dashed indicating high levels of uncertainty due to the absence of information from tracer tests 3 1 4 application of tst models to a contamination event using microbial source tracking methods stange and tiehm investigated a bacterial contamination event that was detected together with a slight increase in turbidity in the gallusquelle spring water following a short series of periods of intense rainfall on the basis of relatively small quantities of human dna markers the contamination was related to the remobilization of bacteria by rainwater rather than fresh sewage input stange and tiehm 2020 the bacteria were therefore probably mobilized by the first rain event which took place between 22 00 on 06 10 12 and 07 00 on 07 10 12 fitting a normal distribution gave a mean input time for the event of 02 24 on 07 10 12 the fitting was performed in fityk 1 3 1 data processing and nonlinear curve fitting software wojdyr 2010 using data points of precipitation and a gauss normal distribution the maximum error of 9 hours in the input timing is relatively small considering the peak transit time for the coliforms of 200 hours steady state conditions were almost achieved during the event due to a rather slight increase in the spring s discharge rate from 0 2 m3 s 1 to 0 3 m3 s 1 a peak velocity of 45 m h 1 was modelled with upper and lower values of 38 3 m h 1 and 51 6 m h 1 using the established q vpeak regression for a mean discharge of 0 25 m3 s 1 a distance of 9520 m was modelled using the 2rnetst model with r2 0 992 and an rmse of 72 cfu l 1 fig 7 table 3 the adetst model hardly fits the tailing of the btc and the rmse of 178 n l 1 is more than twice that of the 2rnetst model and results in a much lower mass recovery the uncertainties in both the velocity and the input time need to be taken into account when estimating transport distances the modelled 1d transport distance of 9500 m from the 2rnetst model roughly coincides with a stormwater retention tank at a distance of 9100 m fig 1 this tank is assumed to be an important factor in water quality impairment and a connection between the tank and the gallusquelle spring has already been suspected by a number of previous authors following investigations using mst stange and tiehm 2020 organic micropollutants heinz et al 2006 and 2009 schiperski et al 2015b zirlewagen et al 2016 and artificial tracers tranter et al 2017 uncertainties indicated by the q vpeak prediction interval yielded upper and lower boundaries of 8100 m and 10 900 m for the 2rnetst model r2 0 994 and rmse 75 cfu l 1 for both uncertainties relating to the input time were taken into account by using the beginning and end of the precipitation event as input times i e 22 00 on 06 10 12 and 07 00 on 07 10 12 together with the predicted peak velocity of 45 m h 1 this yielded lower and upper distances of xlow 9300 m and xupp 9700 m r2 0 995 and rmse 71 n l 1 for both 4 discussion 4 1 general model application and applicability analytical solutions of the ade and 2rne implemented in octave are useful for simplified analyses of contaminant transport and also for rapid sensitivity analyses especially in situations where distributed numerical models are inappropriate due to a sparsity of spatial information van genuchten et al 2012 and 2013 which is the case for most karst aquifers kavousi et al 2020 while the presented models are specifically intended for use in karst aquifers at a catchment scale they also have the potential for a broader range of applications in flow systems such as in fractured aquifers in which transport can be adequately described by 1d ade and 2rne models vincenzi et al 2009 streams and rivers including exchanges within hyporheic zones field 1997 van genuchten et al 2013 wu and hunkeler 2013 and in heterogeneous porous media binder et al 2021 such as alluvial or sandy aquifers goeppert 2021 epikarst flynn and synreich 2010 and glaciers dahlke et al 2015 the main disadvantage of the presented approach is the necessity of estimating or quantifying the time of contaminant input the type of input function and the flow velocity ab initio this is mainly attributed to complex hydraulics in karst aquifers e g oehlmann et al 2013 which can to date not be fitted simultaneously to breakthrough curve data of contaminants in comparison approaches in porous media are much more sophisticated and allow for modelling complex input function simultaneously with groundwater hydraulics gómez hernández and xu 2021 feasibilities and specific limitations of the adetst and 2rnetst models in view of their specific assumptions whether applied to karst aquifers or other flow systems need to be taken into account as discussed in the following subsections 4 1 1 parameters and parameter sensitivity sensitivity analyses of the 2rnetst model show that fitting of the transport distance should be performed with initial parameter estimates that are larger than the final ones in order to obtain a high level of sensitivity and avoid local minima in the rsme velocity input time and to a certain extent the β value all have a strong impact on the 1d transport distance errors in any one of these will translate into errors in x depending on the transit time i e higher flow velocities earlier input times longer transit times and smaller β values will all result in larger estimates of the 1d transport distance prediction intervals for the transport distance can be substantially reduced by using accurate estimates of the flow velocity and the input time determination of the input time is strongly dependant on the nature of the contamination and its release history for example sewer overflow might show a certain delay while remobilization from the unsaturated zone might occur at almost the same time as the onset of precipitation dispersion d and the dimensionless mobile immobile mass transfer coefficient ω are of minor importance when estimating the transport distance x nonetheless these parameters can be compared to those obtained from tracer tests or other contamination events and thereby serve as quality criteria and indicate discrepancies in the model s assumptions e g non point pulse like inputs such non dirac inputs would become evident from the transport parameters provided the duration of input is not negligible compared to the transit time schiperski et al 2019 if the dispersivity d v is high compared to previous data over a particular transport distance it could indicate either a prolonged input non dirac like or a non point source the proposed model performs well over a broad range of parameter sets compared to stanmod we observed anomalously low concentrations at certain timesteps when using the quadgl algorithm with a low tolerance of integration e g 10 2 or 10 4 for the 2rnetst model at high p values together with low β values p 10 000 β 0 6 if values for p and ω are high and the values for β are low e g p 10 000 β 0 65 and ω 0 5 then we suggest reducing the tolerance criterion in the quadgl algorithm to 10 10 or alternatively applying the gauss konrod rule quadgk algorithm at the cost of additional calculation time 4 1 2 implementation of peak velocity using the peak velocity vpeak as an input parameter has a number of advantages it can be readily determined from tracer test btcs where the transport distance is known and its temporal resolution and measurement precision depend only on the quality of the data peak velocities are therefore more likely to be recorded by authorities as historical data in contrast the mean velocity vmean has a number of disadvantages as its value depends on the method used for btc analysis for example whether the method of moments is used or transport model fitting in the latter case the mean velocity will depend on the type of model used e g ade or 2rne this difference is roughly illustrated by the variable vmean values but consistent vpeak values in bacterial contamination source tracking table 3 with the vmean obtained from the adetst model being 20 higher than that obtained from the 2rnetst model where the btc tails are significant vmean may also be affected by the time span over which the btc is evaluated and in a similar manner by the quantification limit of the tracer analysis transit times or flow velocities that are obtained from different evaluation approaches need to be converted the relationship between peak transit time and mean transit time depends mainly on the p and β values and only to a minor extent on ω within a range of 0 5 to 1 5 fig 8 a and 8b if both mean and peak transit times are used for the calculations a correction term from fig 8b needs to be used in order to avoid errors provided p and β can be estimated alternatively the use of a correction algorithm is recommended as used in this study the correction term can be simplified to tmean tpeak β and thus vmean β vpeak for p values greater than 100 in the 2rne model for the ade model tpeak equals tpeak tmean which can be calculated using 1 t p e a k 1 p p 2 9 3 the relative error associated with using tpeak instead of tmean falls below 5 at p 60 for the derivation see si section 1 2 4 2 constant coefficients lumped parameters and steady state spatially constant transport parameters v d β and ω need to be considered to be lumped parameters that summarize all flow transport processes over the whole transport path aiming at an adequate explanation of the btc the term velocities refers to apparent velocities averaged over the distance and ignoring vadose transit times and tortuosity which does not affect tst as long as tortuosity is applied consistently to either all or none of the data tortuosity is generally unknown accept for in cave studies and only empirical values from published literature can therefore be used actual conduit flow velocities and their spatial variations are consequently very difficult to obtain they can however vary significantly with distance from the spring lauber et al 2014 gabrovšek et al 2010 for the gallusquelle catchment virtually all variation in the apparent velocities obtained from artificial tracer tests could be explained by variations in the rate of discharge and no distance dependency could be inferred although numerical modelling suggested significant variations in conduit flow velocities with distance from the spring oehlmann et al 2015 the presented discharge velocity correlation was obtained from tracer tests conducted during periods of prolonged flow recession when the flow regime can be assumed to be in a steady state over the duration of the tests tst under transient conditions would however be highly beneficial considering that contamination of spring water is often detected following intense recharge events e g pronk et al 2006 stange and tiehm 2020 for contamination events at the gallusquelle spring associated with marked variations in discharge rates heinz et al 2009 recorded much higher peak velocities and poorer correlation with time averaged discharge rates than the q vpeak relationship that we found in this study considerable discrepancies must therefore be expected between q vpeak data obtained from tracer tests during base flow periods and event based q vpeak data steady state models that for example average discharge or velocity over time are generally not suitable for interpreting contaminant transport under highly transient conditions zuber 1986 it might however be valid to use steady state models for events that have only small direct recharge components and hence minimal variations in discharge rates werner et al 1997 indeed tst performed well for the particular event investigated in this study suggesting that both the model was suitable and the velocity prediction based on the discharge rate valid 4 3 flow velocity and transport distance in karst aquifers flow velocities in the gallusquelle spring under highly transient conditions can not currently be predicted even under steady state conditions discharge velocity correlations are strictly only valid for the flow paths covered by the particular tracer tests used or a within a major branch of the conduit system as can be deduced from lauber et al 2014 a fundamental assumption of the proposed approach is that the selected artificial tracer tests represent the best possible connections and hence the highest apparent velocities for substances released at the land surface i e infiltration conditions are optimized by the removal of soil cover release into sinkholes and flushing before and after tracer input using maximum velocities for tst results in estimates of the maximum transport distances lower velocities and therefore shorter transport distances should certainly be expected for transport through soil cover and less permeable parts of the vadose and phreatic zones the approach presented herein therefore targets the maximum transport distance this maximum transport distance approaches the actual input distance if the input location is located on highly permeable karst features such as dry valleys or dolines results obtained from tst that have high levels of uncertainty and or velocity ambiguity should be considered indicative rather than definitive confirmation of tst results with artificial tracer tests may therefore be necessary especially in environmental forensics 5 conclusions the approach presented in this manuscript using the 1d distance between a sampling point and the input location of a compound is feasible for source tracking of contaminants in a karst aquifer it allows rapid analysis of uncertainties and sensitivities and it is advantageous in situations where the applicability of distributed models is limited ambiguities in the results obtained with microbial or chemical source tracking similar location but different sources can be significantly reduced by incorporating this transport based source tracking approach uncertainties relate mainly to the tracer velocity and the input time although velocities in karst aquifers are heterogeneously distributed a maximum distance approach using tracer test data is proposed there are some specific requirements concerning the suitability of the model these being 1 approximately steady state flow conditions 2 an instantaneous point input dirac input 3 conservative transport of the tracing compound 4 the input time and tracer velocity input parameters must be known 5 the velocity is assumed to be constant along the transport path and 6 only single peak fitting is possible to date additional transport phenomena such as equilibrium sorption retardation and degradation as well as other input functions multipeak fitting and certain v x relationship can be readily incorporated into the model the applicability of the model has been demonstrated for tracking the input of bacterial contamination in spring water within a karst aquifer at close to steady state conditions the approach is expected to be applicable under the aforementioned specific requirements to other flow systems such as fractured and porous aquifers glaciers and especially rivers where flow velocities are easier to obtain declaration of competing

16229,contamination detection in drinking water is crucial for water utilities in terms of public health however current online water quality sensors can be unresponsive to various possible contaminants consisting of particulate and dissolved content or require a constant supply of reagents and sample preparation we used a two line test environment connected to a drinking water distribution system with flow imaging particle counters and conventional sensors to assess their responses to the injection of contaminants into one line including stormwater treated wastewater wastewater well water and escherichia coli while simultaneously measuring responses to normal water quality fluctuations in the other line these water quality fluctuations were detected with all of the conventional sensors except conductivity and with 3 out of 5 of the size and shape derived particle classes of the flow imaging particle counter the flow imaging particle counter was able to detect all of the studied contaminants e g municipal wastewater at 0 001 v v while the oxidation reduction potential sensor outperformed other conventional sensors detecting the same wastewater at 0 03 v v the presence of particles less than 1 µm in size was shown to be a generic parameter for the detection of particulates present in the studied contaminants however they manifested a considerable response to fluctuations which led to lower relative response to contaminants in comparison to larger particles the particle size and class distributions of contaminants were different from those of drinking water and thus monitoring particles larger than 1 µm or specific particle classes of flow imaging particle counter which are substantially more abundant in contaminated water than in pure drinking water can improve the detection of contamination events water utilities could optimize contamination detection by selecting water quality parameters with a minimal response to quality fluctuations and or a high relative response to contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords online particle counting water quality monitoring contamination detection drinking water distribution flow imaging 1 introduction contamination in drinking water can cause public health and economic consequences such contamination can occur in the production and distribution stages of the water supply via various pathways including raw water quality impairments whelton et al 2015 treatment deficiencies rhoads et al 2017 and failures in the distribution system ds besner et al 2011 examples of contamination pathways include wastewater discharge or surface runoff entering the raw water source larsson et al 2014 mellou et al 2014 treated wastewater entering the ds from a cross connection laine et al 2011 and wastewater surface runoff or groundwater in the proximity of drinking water infrastructure of low physical integrity intruding into the ds when pressure transients are present besner et al 2011 the contamination is likely to increase particulate and dissolved content in the contaminated water to prevent these external contaminants from reaching water consumers an early warning system ews can be established that utilizes online water quality sensors and algorithms to detect contamination among normal water quality variations in the ds liu et al 2015 conventional online water quality sensors used in water treatment plant process monitoring and also considered for routine ds monitoring as well as for ews measure parameters such as turbidity conductivity chlorine concentration and ph liu et al 2014 even though the performance of conventional online water quality sensors has been deemed sufficient for ews liu et al 2016 many of these sensors such as those for measuring ph and conductivity are more likely to detect dissolved than particulate contaminants in addition conventional online water quality sensors cannot determine the characteristics of particulate content for example turbidity is a sum parameter for particulate content but it does not provide information on the number of particles their size distribution or whether they are microbes or chemical precipitates pronk et al 2007 since many potential contamination scenarios in ds include particles such as microbes and chemical precipitates or their aggregates the need for accurate and reliable particulate monitoring is evident for that reason the recent emergence of optical counting based online technologies has been studied for their capacity to monitor suspended particles at high frequency in ds including online flow cytometry safford and bischel 2019 and online flow imaging based particle counting højris et al 2018 2016 flow imaging involves the capture of images of flowing water at a certain volume through a microscope and data analysis methods to analyze the images for the size and form of particles ripple and derose 2018 on the other hand flow cytometry forces suspended particles pre stained with reagents into a single file and measures the scattered light and or fluorescence with a laser beam safford and bischel 2019 comparing these two technologies selective staining in flow cytometry requires reagents and incubation and can be used to qualitatively distinguish cells and their viability and activity among other particulate material safford and bischel 2019 while flow imaging can be used to estimate the total cell count tcc by classifying particles according to their morphology in addition to particle size distribution with no additional reagents or sample preparation staining and incubation højris et al 2016 thus flow imaging is expected to result in less frequent maintenance and higher measurement frequency for instance højris et al 2016 presented an online flow imaging method based on dark field microscopy that classifies particle images into abiotic particles and bacteria the present study introduces a novel online flow imaging particle counter based on lensless digital inline holographic microscopy dihm which classifies particles by machine learned features not typical in drinking water and by their size when compared to conventional microscopy using a magnifying objective lensless dihm allows much larger water volumes to be measured because of the considerably larger field of view and depth of field of a single image and the ability to take images in rapid succession in a flow cell arrangement ozcan and mcleod 2016 xu et al 2001 ews require information on the detection performance of sensors to set correct levels of alarm the development of contamination detection methods typically occurs using pilot scale test environments in which contaminants are injected into drinking water without the risk of contaminating the ds these studies commonly use tap water as a source of drinking water however drinking water quality normally varies in a ds and may result in fluctuations in a signal of a measured parameter hall et al 2007 which should be taken into account by determining a baseline signal pilot scale studies reduce the presence of these quality fluctuations by pre collecting water in large tanks 1000 l before conveying it to the test environment dejus et al 2018 ikonen et al 2017 or recirculating the water to establish a stable baseline hall et al 2007 helbling and vanbriesen 2008 mckenna et al 2008 suggested that the water quality fluctuations in similar pilot scale test environments may be considerably smaller than the quality fluctuations in the actual ds thereby possibly overestimating sensor performance in contaminant detection in natural conditions the present study considered the water quality changes arising both from injected contaminants and from normal water quality fluctuations in a ds by monitoring the water quality simultaneously from two identical measurement lines by subtracting the response of the sensors in the line measuring normal water quality fluctuations later referred to as reference line from that of the sensors in the line measuring injected contaminants later referred to as contamination line the water quality change caused by the contaminant alone was obtained the aim of the present study was to evaluate the responses of a novel flow imaging particle counter and conventional water quality sensors to fluctuating drinking water quality and real life contaminants including stormwater treated wastewater wastewater and well water in addition to escherichia coli e coli in the ds an ideal sensor would have a far greater response for a real contamination than for normal water quality fluctuations thus the secondary aim was to study whether particle characteristics can be utilized to improve contamination detection due to the vast amount of recorded data the present work highlights the most considerable observations by examples 2 materials and methods 2 1 test environment the test environment was connected via a tap to the drinking water ds at tampere university hervanta campus tampere finland in this test environment eight sets of contaminant injections referred to as contamination experiments were introduced to drinking water by means of a continuously running test environment in the study period namely summer and autumn 2020 jun 2nd jul 16th sep 21st nov 26th the water mainly originated from the rusko surface water treatment plant produces ca 13 million m3 annually operated by tampere water which uses lake roine as a raw water source the treatment plant is approximately 2 km away from the university the variation in drinking water quality in 24 hour periods on the contamination experiment days is shown in table 1 the free chlorine concentration varied between 0 19 and 0 31 mg l the test environment consisted of a contamination line and reference line both including a feed container 10 l polypropylene and a mixing container diameter 110 mm height 600 3 mm polypropylene followed by a line for the flow imaging particle counter and light scattering particle counter contamination line only and a sensor rack for the conventional online water quality sensors diameter 50 mm polypropylene fig 1 in the mixing container the drinking water was mixed with the selected contaminant or reference feed during the contamination experiments while including an air gap to prevent backflow and an air hole to maintain atmospheric pressure in the containers the reference feed was drinking water except in the e coli experiment in which drinking water diluted phosphate buffered saline pbs was used instead between the contamination experiments only the drinking water flowed through the mixing containers water flowed gravitationally out of the mixing containers since the water level in the containers was approximately 245 cm higher than the end of the effluent tube in the test environment the water level of the mixing containers was held constant by water level sensors that were connected to a control system based on a microcontroller leonardo arduino usa and electric solenoid valves geoline my18 40 bar tecomec italy the flow in the lines was adjusted to approximately 5500 ml min via a half inch manual ball valve the flow was measured by ultrasound flow sensors uf08b cynergy3 uk during the contaminant injections the contaminant and reference feeds were injected into the corresponding mixing containers by a single peristaltic pump tube inner diameter 3 1 mm at 300 ml min the retention time from the feed containers to the sensors was approximately 1 min as confirmed by injecting sodium chloride from the feed container and monitoring the increase of conductivity results not shown thus minimizing the warming of the drinking water the test environment was qualified by determining the efficient mixing for particles up to 6 µm in size and ensuring that the contamination and reference line had similar tcc concentration prior to the contamination experiments for details see s1 text s1 s2 2 2 contamination experiments in the eight contamination experiments each with a single contaminant and varying concentrations five different types of contaminants including non artificial contaminants stormwater treated wastewater wastewater and well water and a reference microbial contaminant e coli were injected into the drinking water table 1 the non artificial contaminants were filtered prior to injections through 100 µm nylon filters to homogenize them and avoid clogging the flow imaging and light scattering particle counter the stormwater was sampled from a stormwater pipe at the edge of a suburban area hervanta tampere finland after rain in june the incoming wastewater and effluent were 24 hour composite samples collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant viinikanlahti tampere the well water meant for watering plants was sampled in the proximity of an allotment garden in tampere vuores e coli strain mg1655 was prepared by cultivating cells overnight in lysogeny broth medium supplemented with 0 4 glucose the cells were collected by centrifugation and thereafter washed and resuspended in pbs buffer ph 7 4 the solution of approximately 1 2 109 cells ml optical density at 600 nm 4 was vortexed gently before use all of the contaminant samples were stored in the dark at 4 c the contamination experiments with each contaminant consisted of a set of 3 6 target concentrations which included a range of supposedly undetectable concentrations in the low end and concentrations causing particle counter saturation in the high end for details see table s1 the target concentrations varied from the 0 0000083 v v 100 cells ml of e coli to the 3 v v of treated wastewater b excluding the well water experiment the experiments were performed stepwise after a 29 35 min of injection the injection pump was turned off for a period of 12 85 min the well water experiment consisted of a single injection in which the well water concentration was increased after a period of time in the test environment by gradually increasing the well water concentration in the feeding container all of the experiments were performed between 8 and 16 o clock on working days to ensure the presence of water quality fluctuations on the day of the experiments the filtered contaminants were diluted with the drinking water sampled from the same laboratory on the previous day and transferred to the feed containers no more than 60 min before the corresponding injection this drinking water used for the dilution of the contaminants and as the reference feed was stored in tightly closed plastic containers at room temperature storing drinking water overnight reduced the free chlorine concentration by as much as by half but its use in contaminant dilution did not impact the free chlorine concentration of the reference line during the experiments approximately 5 of the water in both lines was feed in addition diluting the contaminant with the sampled drinking water decreased the chlorine concentration of the contaminant feed since chlorine oxidized the natural organic matter and microbes of the contaminant before the diluted contaminant was injected these issues were considered unavoidable for two reasons first sampling dilution water during the experiments would have forced the use of dilution water with a possible high particle concentration due to water quality fluctuations second the removal of chlorine from the sampled drinking water by volatilization into the air was considered too time consuming the chlorine was deliberately removed from the test environment in the e coli experiment by dissolving approximately 0 3 g l of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate into the dilution water 2 3 online instrumentation the online instrumentation of the study consisted of two types of particle counters and four conventional online water quality sensors as described in table 2 the studied particle counters included a flow imaging particle counter a development version of qumo water quality monitoring station uponor corporation finland and a light scattering particle counter ols50p water with scattered light sensor sls 25 25 pamas partikelmess und analysesysteme gmbh germany which worked as a reference particle counter to gain knowledge of particle concentrations and size distributions during the experiments the conventional water quality sensors later referred to as the sensors included turbidity turbimax cus51d free chlorine memosens ccs51d conductivity memosens cls82d and ph orp memosens cps16d sensors all from endress hauser switzerland the placement of sensors and particle counters in the test environment is shown in fig 1 during the study period the maintenance of sensors and particle counters was instrument specific the flow cells of the flow imaging particle counters were periodically flushed except on the experiment days and their windows were cleaned when deemed necessary by the inspection of the image quality the light scattering particle counter typically encountered clogging after running for 5 7 days which resulted in zero responses in all channels this was overcome by feeding 1 m of hydrochloric acid into the particle counter until the responses were stabilized before connecting the online particle counter back to the test environment milli q water was fed into the particle counter for at least 10 min the conventional sensors were mechanically cleaned at the same time when the test environment was maintained all of the sensors used factory calibration during the measurement periods turbidity results were later calibrated based on the turbidity of grab samples prior to the data analysis due to wall scattering issues observed in the 50 mm sensor rack the sensor measurements were manually processed and the observed measurement artifacts due to faulty sensors or test environment maintenance were removed from the figures when the measurement artifacts were present during an experiment a corresponding sensor was completely left out from figures and further analysis the operating principle of the flow imaging particle counter is shown in fig 2 the water flows through a transparent flow channel directly on one of the windows of the flow channel is an image sensor which is illuminated from the other side by a diverging beam from a pulsed diode laser wavelength 405 nm the particles suspended in the water scatter the light forward in an expanding cone the scattered light interferes with the unscattered light and forms holograms on the image sensor the images are captured continuously and the particle holograms are detected counted and analyzed to classify the particles by the software embedded in the particle counter the software used internally literally thousands of measurement channels but for simplicity we reported the particle data collected into six measurement channels n b c f small and large expressed as particles ml fig 2 n particles represent the total concentration of particles small approx 1 µm and large approx 2 µm particle classifications resulted from estimating the particle size by the amplitude of the hologram and by comparison with the light scattering particle counter the b c and f classifications resulted from a hybrid machine learning model combining several deep neural networks trained on data obtained prior to the contamination experiments with stormwater uponor r d unpublished since the b c and f classifications stem from neural networks their properties cannot easily be described in terms of usual morphological parameters however sample images of the particles are shown in s2 figure s8 and some practical descriptions are given below b particles are larger than a few micrometers and tend to be irregularly shaped they are often found in pipe sediment set loose by for example sudden flow changes in ds uponor r d unpublished f particles are fiber like i e they are much longer than they are wide c particles do not appear in normal pipe sediment and are more indicative of particles in stormwater or wastewater uponor r d unpublished due to properties of the classification algorithm used at the time of the experiments a given particle can in principle belong simultaneously to c and either b or f classes since the c classification results from a different algorithm than the b and f classifications in addition a particle in the large class can simultaneously belong to any of b c or f classes 2 4 analyses to determine the water quality similarity in the contamination and reference lines on the days of the experiments drinking water grab samples were characterized for ph oxidation reduction potential orp turbidity conductivity free chlorine concentration and dissolved organic carbon doc the grab samples of drinking water were taken in 500 1000 ml pyrex bottles from the effluent tube in the test environment simultaneously from both lines no more than two hours prior to the first contaminant injection these were stored in the dark at 4 c and analyzed in two steps first ph and free chlorine were analyzed immediately after sampling second orp conductivity turbidity and doc were analyzed within six hours of sampling orp and ph were analyzed with a wtw ph 315i using wtw sentix 41 and si analytics blueline 31 rx electrodes respectively conductivity measurements were performed with a wtw inolab cond level 1 with a wtw tetracon 325 electrode and turbidity measurements were performed with a wtw turb 555 for free chlorine a dpd reagent hach dpd free chlorine reagent for 10 ml samples was mixed with a 10 ml drinking water sample and measured by a hach dr1900 portable spectrophotometer doc was measured according to en 1484 1997 with a shimadzu toc vcph instrument the characterization of filtered contaminants included the same aforementioned analyses as those for drinking water and in addition the filtered contaminants including stormwater treated wastewater wastewater and well water were analyzed for total suspended solids tss according to standard procedure en 872 2005 filters whatman gf c 1 2 µm within 24 h from the first injection 2 5 signal to noise ratio of online measurements the water quality signals of all of the sensors and particle counters were analyzed to assess sensor class responses later referred to as sensor responses caused by the contaminant injections and to determine a limit of detection lod for each sensor the analysis consisted of calculating a mean difference of sensor response between a period of contaminant injection a period in which the feed pump was on and a period of a selected baseline the mean difference was used in two methods in the first method a relative difference was calculated by dividing the difference by the mean of a selected baseline response to make it comparable between sensors classes the linearity of the relative difference in comparison to contaminant concentration was evaluated by calculating the linear regression coefficients of determination r2 using python v 3 8 3 library scikit learn v 0 23 1 and its linearregression class in the second method the mean difference was extended to a signal to noise ratio snr by dividing the resulting difference by the standard deviation of the selected baseline response szabo et al 2008 unlike szabo et al 2008 the baseline sensor response was selected via two approaches 1 a corresponding reference line sensor response during each injection was used for the flow imaging particle counter and conventional water quality sensors 2 a contamination line sensor response after each experiment namely 18 21 o clock was used to evaluate the first approach and to compare the responses of the flow imaging and light scattering particle counters an snr depicts a standardized and unitless difference of a sensor response a positive snr indicates that sensor response increases due to contaminant injection whereas a negative snr indicates that sensor response decreases due to contaminant injection the following representation was used in this study 1 s n r μ c o n t μ r e f σ r e f where μ c o n t is the mean of the sensor response caused by contaminant injection in the contamination line μ r e f is the mean of the selected baseline sensor response and σ r e f is the standard deviation of the selected baseline sensor response for example eq 1 results in an snr of 3 if the difference μ c o n t μ r e f is 3 σ r e f even though the same water was fed into the contamination line and the reference line the sensor responses were occasionally different due to apparent differences in sensor quality for example orp in fig 3 which are related to sensor accuracy table 2 this led to occasionally absolute snr values of 3 in the control periods no contaminant 18 21 o clock for details see table s4 which was overcome by selecting a conservative lod value snr 10 to assume the identical baseline fluctuations for both lines the sensor and flow imaging particle counter responses of both lines were subsequently adjusted to the same initial level based on the sensor responses 20 min prior to the first injection of an experiment 2 6 the relative proportions of particle classes and sizes the relative proportions of different particle classes of the flow imaging particle counter and size classes of the light scattering particle counter for the different contaminants were determined as follows first the absolute concentration differences between the contamination and reference line or the reference period for the light scattering instrument were determined at one of the higher concentrations of the experiment but not always the highest concentration to avoid artefacts due to saturation of the instruments then the baseline subtracted concentrations were divided by that of the summary class of the instrument namely n or total to obtain the relative proportions of the particle classes for drinking water the relative proportions of particle classes and sizes were calculated from data collected at the experiment site during the first experiment period jun 2nd jul 16th 2020 for the flow imaging particle counter the reference line instrument was used while the only light scattering particle counter available to us was installed in the contamination line for every time point of this six week data the particle size class concentrations were divided by the respective summary class n or total to obtain the relative particle proportions from this proportion data the 25th and 75th percentiles were calculated since the light scattering instrument was in the contamination line the raw data also included the contamination periods washings of the systems etc we estimated that these exceptional times represented much less than 25 of the total measurement time and chose a safe upper limit of 75th percentile in order to obtain normal limits of fluctuation not affected by the known contaminations 3 results and discussion 3 1 normal water quality fluctuations in the present study normal water quality fluctuations were determined for the 24 hour periods on the experiment days in order to separate the response to contaminants from the response to normal water quality fluctuations these fluctuations were assessed for the flow imaging particle counter and conventional water quality sensors the concentration of particles was higher during working hours 7 18 o clock especially in the morning than at other times of the day which was assumed to be caused by the rapid increase in water demand in the ds and surrounding property for example in fig 3 the total number of particles n particles and small particles measured by the flow imaging particle counter fluctuate strongly in both lines also when contaminants are not added especially between 7 and 18 o clock the n particles in the reference line between 7 and 18 o clock had a mean of 1367 ml 1 39 std n 220 whereas outside of these hours the mean was 822 ml 1 11 std n 254 in contrast b c f and large particle concentrations fluctuated visibly considerably less than n particle concentrations fig 3 similarly the light scattering particle counter in the contamination line outside the contaminant additions recorded considerably larger concentration fluctuations for particles up to 1 2 µm than for the larger ones fig 3 middle column the fluctuations in water quality measured by of the conventional sensors except for turbidity and conductivity started around 7 o clock and continued until midnight typically free chlorine concentration and orp fluctuations manifested a similar trend they decreased from midnight to the morning hours and then increased until achieving a peak value between 9 and 18 o clock the ph was typically inversely proportional to the free chlorine concentration and orp temperature fluctuations were occasionally very similar to free chlorine concentration orp and ph fig 3 turbidity fluctuations were similar to the particle concentration fluctuations conductivity showed no daily fluctuations typically it showed an increasing decreasing trend daily fluctuations of water quality in a ds are known to be related to varying water demand since the alternating high flow during the day and low flow during the night may lead to the mobilization and accumulation of particulate material in pipes nescerecka et al 2014 prest et al 2016 sunny et al 2020 in addition the changes in the residence time in a ds may lead to varying temperatures chlorine concentrations ph etc in a ds which likely explain the observed occasional similarity between temperature free chlorine orp and ph fluctuations other explanations for the origins of water quality fluctuations include changes on water supply operation and maintenance and construction work in the water supply prest et al 2016 the observed quality fluctuations in the present study were most likely related to the water demand of the property and the ds indicating that the fluctuations were not caused by sensor artifacts or produced from the test environment in which the water flow was gravitational and constant 3 2 sensor responses to wastewater and detection limits contamination detection of the flow imaging particle counter and conventional sensors was studied in the presence of normal water quality fluctuations by injecting different contaminants in various concentrations into one line of the continuously running test environment and analyzing simultaneously collected measurement data from both contamination and reference line as discussed in section 3 1 water quality fluctuations were present on all experiment days as detected with all particle counters and sensors except for conductivity the sensor responses to the contaminants were sudden positive particle concentrations turbidity or negative free chlorine concentration orp ph shifts to a new range which lasted until the contaminant left the test environment fig 3 the magnitudes of the shifts caused by contaminant injections were determined as the relative differences between the contamination and reference lines which were calculated by dividing the difference between contamination and reference line by the reference line value for all contaminants table s3 to evaluate how identical the two similar sensors flow particle counters performed in the two lines the relative differences were calculated for the control period between 18 and 21 o clock marked as 0 mg l concentration in which no contaminant was injected wastewater experiment b was selected as an example to illustrate the differences in sensor responses due to the high particulate and dissolved content of the wastewater compared to the drinking water table 1 the high particulate content in the wastewater increased the particle concentration and turbidity of the water in the contamination line thus the relative differences were positive and increased linearly with wastewater concentration r2 0 878 0 999 fig 4 by far the steepest slope of the linear fit is observed for f and c particles followed by large and b particles while the relative responses of n total and small particles and turbidity are substantially weaker as seen in fig 3 and discussed in more detail in section 3 4 very few f and c particles normally are present in drinking water however they do exist in wastewater making the relative difference large in contrast due to a high number of small particles in drinking water the relative increase in n small and turbidity caused by the contamination is considerably smaller contrary to parameters measuring the particle content directly free chlorine concentration and orp decreased linearly with wastewater concentration r2 0 962 0 997 this is attributed to the particulate content of the wastewater consuming the free chlorine orp is a chlorine concentration surrogate and the 5 fold lower orp value of the wastewater compared to that of the drinking water table 1 the sensors for temperature ph and conductivity did not respond to the wastewater injection at the studied concentrations the difference between the contamination and reference line responses were extended to take into account the magnitude of normal water quality fluctuations by determining a signal to noise ratio snr which was calculated by dividing the mean difference between the contamination line and reference line by the standard deviation of the reference line snr was used to determine the limit of detection value lod of the classes sensors for a contaminant concentration by setting the lod to snr 10 which indicates the response of ten times the standard deviation of the reference line even though the relative responses were typically linear fig 4 after the lod had been exceeded fig 5 wastewater b the snr responses varied due to normal water quality fluctuations to demonstrate the importance of taking normal water quality fluctuations into account in order to avoid overestimating the detection performance of difference classes sensors snrs were determined by using the reference line as a baseline and using a period of 18 21 o clock of the contamination line when no contaminants were injected as a baseline the utilization of the reference line showed for example that the 0 01 wastewater b injection increased the mean n particles by 2173 particles ml 90 fig 4 in the flow imaging particle counter in contamination line compared to that of the reference line however the corresponding standard deviation of the reference line 440 particles ml varied due to water quality fluctuations thus the snr was 5 remaining below the lod for all contaminants and injections see table s2 s4 in contrast using only the contamination line data and thus the baseline period outside the working hours a mean of 18 21 o clock in the contamination line can result in too optimistic lod shown as an increase in the mean n particles in the contamination line by 3813 particles ml 486 with an snr of 94 for all contaminants and injections see table s5 s7 due to the high standard deviation of the n particles in the reference line during the injections the snr surpassed the lod only for the highest concentration 0 03 table s4 while the baseline period using only contamination line data indicated that even the 0 001 wastewater b injection was detectable table s7 the use of the reference line in the test environment allowed for the analysis of sensor performance mimicking realistic conditions such as those in ds in comparison previous pilot scale drinking water contamination detection studies have concentrated on eliminating normal water quality fluctuations by recirculating drinking water besmer et al 2017 hall et al 2007 helbling and vanbriesen 2008 szabo et al 2008 in the test environment rather than determining sensor performance in the presence of fluctuations in an actual ews a reference line is not available and a baseline period must be estimated based on the already measured data however the present study highlighted that normal water quality fluctuations should be considered in improving contamination detection 3 3 impact of contaminants and their characteristics to sensor responses and detection limits to investigate the flow imaging particle counter and conventional sensor responses to different contaminants in the presence of normal water quality fluctuations a total of 33 injections with eight contaminants were analyzed for the absolute values of snrs the classes of flow imaging particle counter and turbidity were selected to analyze the responses to the particle content of contaminants as a simplified illustration fig 5 shows only the classes of small large and c particles for all particle classes see table s4 the small particles 1 µm of the flow imaging particle counter detected all of the studied contaminants by the criterion that snr exceeded 10 fig 5 similarly than the n particles total in turn the large particles 2 µm detected all of the studied contaminants except for the reference microbial contaminant e coli by the criterion that snr exceeded 10 fig 5 the c particles showed similar response to large particles however the number of c particles in the studied contaminants were considerably smaller than that of large particles see for example fig 3 in addition lod was not exceeded for well water and e coli contaminants the particle classes are discussed in more detail in section 3 4 the turbidity sensor could detect contamination for one of the highest suspended solid tss concentrations of all of the injections based on the contaminant concentration 0 5 stormwater a in this case tss of stormwater was 29 mg l on average table 1 resulting in a 0 15 mg l tss concentration in the water flowing through the contamination line moreover the lod almost 9 4 exceeded the 0 1 wastewater b injection which lead to 0 16 mg tss l for these two injections the small and large particles exceeded the lod in a 2 10 fold lower contaminant concentration with up to a 11 fold higher snr in comparison to those of turbidity turbidity was not measured for the other high tss concentration injections namely 3 treated wastewater b and 0 5 well water table s1 the sensors responding to the consumption of chlorine i e free chlorine concentration and orp can be considered as measuring both dissolved content as well as particulate content indirectly when the particulate content is assumed to consist of microorganisms or particulate organic matter both of which are oxidized by chlorine the free chlorine sensor could detect the highest concentrations of the filtered contaminant types stormwater treated wastewater wastewater and well water as indicated by exceeding the lod for all of them except for the stormwater 0 5 stormwater b snr 9 2 fig 5 the lod of the orp sensor was up to 4 times lower than those of the free chlorine sensor in addition to orp and free chlorine the dissolved content in the contaminants was measured by conductivity and ph sensors the conductivity responded to one of the highest dissolved solid concentrations measured as conductivity in drinking water of all of the injections based on the contaminant concentration 0 3 treated wastewater a and the contaminant conductivity 971 µs cm the response of ph sensor to contaminants did not exceed the lod in these experiments the small particle class was able to detect e coli fig 5 which was not possible for the conventional sensors tested previous studies hall et al 2007 ikonen et al 2017 have suggested that turbidity responds to e coli concentrations 1 6 10 fold higher than those in the present study indicating that the sensitivity of the turbidity and other conventional sensors for detecting individual microorganisms from drinking water is one thousandth of the sensitivity of the flow imaging particle counter the concentrations of e coli in the present study are very high in comparison to typical drinking water quality guideline of 1 cells 100 ml and the studied particle counters cannot separate bacteria from other particles in this respect flow cytometry outperforms particle counters the conventional sensors typically exceeded the lod only at the highest studied contaminant concentrations or not at all which indicates that higher contaminant concentrations would have been needed to determine lod for conventional sensors in the literature for example szabo et al 2008 injected 0 8 v v unchlorinated secondary effluent from the wastewater treatment plant with characteristics likely similar to treated wastewater a and b in the present study into the pilot scale test environment running chloraminated drinking water 2 mg l which resulted in the following relative responses and snrs conductivity 3 7 snr 28 4 orp 4 8 snr 6 2 ph 0 5 snr 7 2 and turbidity 116 snr 23 1 the conductivity response was in line with that in the present study treated wastewater a while the turbidity response was considerably higher which might be related to the selection of the baseline period or to the performance of the individual sensors the low response of the orp compared to the responses of the present study might have resulted from the chloraminated drinking water in which the free chlorine is not present even though orp has been considered to be a surrogate for the free total chlorine concentration hall et al 2007 the high snr values of the orp in the present study compared to those of the free chlorine suggest that the other dissolved constituents also play a role the orp had a relatively slow response to the contaminants compared to other sensors for example s2 figure s5 shows that the reference line had not returned to the normal level after injecting 0 1 wastewater a 0 3 g l thiosulfate thus leading to an orp value below the lod the responses of different sensors and particle counters to contaminants in drinking water are heavily dependent on the characteristics of the drinking water chlorination water source treatment process and contaminants as well as fluctuations in the quality of drinking water in general the particle content of the drinking water is strictly regulated for instance the drinking water directive european union 2020 regulates the effluent water of drinking water plants thus the reference value of the treatment plants producing over 10000 m3 day is set to 0 3 ntu in 95 of the samples and none to exceed 1 ntu on the other hand the dissolved content of the drinking water is not considered a threat to public health similar to that of pathogens and it varies more except in terms of chlorine concentration and ph which are used to maximize the effectiveness of disinfection and reduce the pipe corrosion even though the orp and conductivity sensors seem to respond considerably to contaminants in drinking water they might not be suitable sensors for all kinds of ds to illustrate drinking water deriving from several water sources results in a high orp and conductivity fluctuations depending on in what ratios water is fed to ds however in the studied ds the conductivity did not fluctuate while other sensors and the most classes of particle counters did thus making conductivity suitable option for an ews the sensor selection for an ews should be conducted based on the comparison of existing water quality data as well as preliminary online measurements in which the sensor responses to normal fluctuations are determined for different sensors the present study showed that the use of conventional sensors for detecting contaminants from drinking water might still be convenient in applications in which sensitivity is not the highest priority 3 4 the different particle classes as indicators for contamination since the flow imaging particle counter classifies the particles in drinking water into six classes namely n b c f small and large fig 2 based on particle characteristics such as size and shape the effect of particle class onto detection performance was further studied it was illustrated in fig 4 and discussed in section 3 2 that in wastewater b experiment the relative responses of the flow imaging particle counter classes c f b large were considerably larger than those of the n or small particles the light scattering particle counter results corroborated this observation by recording substantially greater relative increases in the concentrations of larger particles 1600 for particles 1 µm than those of small particles 270 for particles 1 µm using the 0 03 v v injection as an example table s6 this result was quite general during injections with stormwater treated wastewater and wastewater the relative increases of the particles larger than 1 µm as measured with the light scattering particle counter and the b c f and large particles of the flow imaging particle counter table s3 were manifold compared to the relative increases of particles smaller than 1 µm and the n small particles at most concentrations with stormwater and treated or untreated wastewater the c particles showed the greatest relative concentration changes of all flow imaging particle classes with well water and e coli however the largest relative changes were observed for the small particles at most concentrations to understand why the relative concentrations of certain particle classes increase more rapidly than others when a contaminant is added it is useful to compare the relative compositions of the contaminant and drinking water in fig 6 the relative abundances of particle classes characterized by both the flow imaging and light scattering particle counters are shown for the studied contaminants in essence fig 6 shows the resulting relative particle class or size distribution if the contaminant were injected to ultrapure water with no particles at all this facilitates comparison between the different contaminants moreover fig 6 shows the limits of normal fluctuation of drinking water shown as a shading between the 25th and 75th percentiles the key to understanding fig 6 is to look whether the relative proportion of a particle class in a contaminant is considerably above the normal range of pure drinking water if so that particle class may be a good indicator for that contaminant the above condition was true for stormwater treated wastewater and wastewater with particle classes b c f and large and for particle sizes larger than 1 µm well water and e coli particle class distributions were different by having substantially higher proportion of small particles and lower proportion of b c f and large particles than the other contaminants with the light scattering particle counter the distinction was less clear but still apparent well water and e coli have a high proportion of the smallest particles and a very low proportion of particles larger than 5 10 µm the snr did not generally follow the same trend as the relative increase for the flow imaging particle counter using the reference line as a baseline only in the following cases was the snr higher for a specific particle class than for both the n and small particles stormwater b 0 1 0 25 c particles wastewaters a and b c large and b particles table s4 for the light scattering particle counter the snr for particles larger than 1 µm was higher than that for particles smaller than 1 µm in the following cases stormwater a and b wastewater a 5 µm and wastewater b table s7 the reason for the apparent discrepancy between the relative concentration increase and the snr may lie in the statistics large particles were quite rare both in the reference line or during baseline measurement and during the rather dilute contaminations therefore the standard deviation in the denominator of the snr equation eq 1 is relatively large compared with the absolute concentration difference making the snr smaller the snrs at all contaminant concentrations are listed in table s4 for the flow imaging particle counter and conventional sensors and in table s7 for the light scattering particle counter and are shown graphically for selected parameters in fig 5 from that data it can be gleaned for example that in most cases for stormwaters treated wastewaters and wastewaters whenever the snr for n or small particles exceeded 10 so did also the snr for b c or large particles to illustrate the feasibility of machine learned particle classes namely b c and f their contamination detection performance was further analyzed although the relative proportion of b particles was considerably higher than that of c particles for all the studied contaminants fig 6 the c particles may be a better contamination indicator since also pure drinking water contains b particles the b particles might represent sediment particles that occasionally detach and are transported in a ds curiously the well water was visually rusty and contained a considerable number of b particles fig 6 the high content of iron and manganese was confirmed by laboratory analyses results not shown the fiber like f particles were still substantially rarer than c particles in the studied stormwater wastewater and treated wastewater contaminants fig 6 which limited their usefulness as generic contamination indicator however the distinct shape of f particles may help to identify certain types of contaminants recent research on drinking water contamination monitoring has mainly focused on online microbial monitoring besmer et al 2017 favere et al 2021 however a particle size range of 1 8 µm has been proposed for detecting contaminants in general in ds ikonen et al 2017 microbial content tends to fluctuate due to varying hydraulic conditions water temperature water source and treatment prest et al 2016 which was shown in the present study to be true also for particle sizes smaller than 10 µm the present study suggests that the relative proportion of larger particles in pure drinking water is low based on the particle concentration observation of six weeks fig 6 where 75 of the time less than 0 7 of particles were in size range 1 2 µm less than 0 2 2 5 µm and less than 0 02 larger than 5 µm on the smaller end of the size spectrum 75 of the time more than 90 of particles were in size range 0 5 0 7 µm and more than 4 4 between 0 7 and 1 µm comparing relative particle size distributions obtained using different instruments may not be straightforward if the lod smallest detectable particle size or the size bins differ with this in mind the above finding generally agrees with observations from various danish drinking water dss in which less than 0 1 of particles were larger than 5 µm højris et al 2016 probably due to downstream water treatment processes such as sand filtration and activated carbon filtration as mentioned in section 3 3 however the larger particles in dss have been observed in more downstream locations prest et al 2021 verberk et al 2006 and they have been associated with discoloration events vreeburg et al 2008 since the test environment of the present study was located only two kilometers away from the treatment plant the observed fluctuations of larger particles may be less than those of further down the ds for future studies it might be useful to determine if the particle classes of the flow imaging particle counter could also detect discoloration events to distinguish real contamination events from normal water quality fluctuations in general one should select parameters that have a high relative response to contaminants and a low response to normal water quality fluctuations an ideal parameter candidate has a response proportional to the contaminant concentration for the sensor in the contamination line and a flat profile otherwise fig 3 and table s2 s7 the c and f particle classes of the flow imaging particle counter and classes for particles larger than 10 µm light scattering particle counter seem to be most specific to contamination by stormwater and wastewater the small and n particle classes and those pertaining to particles smaller than 2 µm are catch all parameters that responded to the studied contaminants in addition to normal fluctuations the b particle class was hypothesized to be associated with sediment particles that may be regarded as an indicator for non harmful discoloration events and not actual contamination of the conventional water quality sensors only conductivity was relatively immune to normal quality fluctuations but it only responded strongly to treated wastewater for parameters that respond to both contaminants and normal fluctuations one needs to utilize detection algorithms that are able to eliminate the effect of normal water quality fluctuations however normal water quality fluctuations can be somewhat irregular due to their nature which can in turn lead to false alarms in an ews 4 conclusions the simultaneous and continuous baseline measurements during contaminant injections made it possible to separate sensor responses caused by contaminants from those caused by normal water quality fluctuations present in a ds not taking into account normal quality fluctuations may lead to overestimating a sensor s capability to detect contaminants normal water quality fluctuations impacted the responses of the particle classes n small large b of the flow imaging particle counter particle size classes less than 10 µm of the light scattering particle counter as well as the conventional sensors except conductivity particle classes c and f of the flow imaging particle counter and particle sizes 10 µm of the light scattering particle counter were relatively immune to normal water quality fluctuations in addition to that they had a high relative response to contaminations with stormwater and wastewater small particle class of the flow imaging particle counter and the 1 µm classes of the light scattering particle counter detected all the studied contaminants including those with an especially high content of small particles well water and e coli however they were susceptible to normal water quality fluctuations orp which responded both to dissolved and particulate contaminants detected the presence of all of the studied contaminants except e coli

16229,contamination detection in drinking water is crucial for water utilities in terms of public health however current online water quality sensors can be unresponsive to various possible contaminants consisting of particulate and dissolved content or require a constant supply of reagents and sample preparation we used a two line test environment connected to a drinking water distribution system with flow imaging particle counters and conventional sensors to assess their responses to the injection of contaminants into one line including stormwater treated wastewater wastewater well water and escherichia coli while simultaneously measuring responses to normal water quality fluctuations in the other line these water quality fluctuations were detected with all of the conventional sensors except conductivity and with 3 out of 5 of the size and shape derived particle classes of the flow imaging particle counter the flow imaging particle counter was able to detect all of the studied contaminants e g municipal wastewater at 0 001 v v while the oxidation reduction potential sensor outperformed other conventional sensors detecting the same wastewater at 0 03 v v the presence of particles less than 1 µm in size was shown to be a generic parameter for the detection of particulates present in the studied contaminants however they manifested a considerable response to fluctuations which led to lower relative response to contaminants in comparison to larger particles the particle size and class distributions of contaminants were different from those of drinking water and thus monitoring particles larger than 1 µm or specific particle classes of flow imaging particle counter which are substantially more abundant in contaminated water than in pure drinking water can improve the detection of contamination events water utilities could optimize contamination detection by selecting water quality parameters with a minimal response to quality fluctuations and or a high relative response to contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords online particle counting water quality monitoring contamination detection drinking water distribution flow imaging 1 introduction contamination in drinking water can cause public health and economic consequences such contamination can occur in the production and distribution stages of the water supply via various pathways including raw water quality impairments whelton et al 2015 treatment deficiencies rhoads et al 2017 and failures in the distribution system ds besner et al 2011 examples of contamination pathways include wastewater discharge or surface runoff entering the raw water source larsson et al 2014 mellou et al 2014 treated wastewater entering the ds from a cross connection laine et al 2011 and wastewater surface runoff or groundwater in the proximity of drinking water infrastructure of low physical integrity intruding into the ds when pressure transients are present besner et al 2011 the contamination is likely to increase particulate and dissolved content in the contaminated water to prevent these external contaminants from reaching water consumers an early warning system ews can be established that utilizes online water quality sensors and algorithms to detect contamination among normal water quality variations in the ds liu et al 2015 conventional online water quality sensors used in water treatment plant process monitoring and also considered for routine ds monitoring as well as for ews measure parameters such as turbidity conductivity chlorine concentration and ph liu et al 2014 even though the performance of conventional online water quality sensors has been deemed sufficient for ews liu et al 2016 many of these sensors such as those for measuring ph and conductivity are more likely to detect dissolved than particulate contaminants in addition conventional online water quality sensors cannot determine the characteristics of particulate content for example turbidity is a sum parameter for particulate content but it does not provide information on the number of particles their size distribution or whether they are microbes or chemical precipitates pronk et al 2007 since many potential contamination scenarios in ds include particles such as microbes and chemical precipitates or their aggregates the need for accurate and reliable particulate monitoring is evident for that reason the recent emergence of optical counting based online technologies has been studied for their capacity to monitor suspended particles at high frequency in ds including online flow cytometry safford and bischel 2019 and online flow imaging based particle counting højris et al 2018 2016 flow imaging involves the capture of images of flowing water at a certain volume through a microscope and data analysis methods to analyze the images for the size and form of particles ripple and derose 2018 on the other hand flow cytometry forces suspended particles pre stained with reagents into a single file and measures the scattered light and or fluorescence with a laser beam safford and bischel 2019 comparing these two technologies selective staining in flow cytometry requires reagents and incubation and can be used to qualitatively distinguish cells and their viability and activity among other particulate material safford and bischel 2019 while flow imaging can be used to estimate the total cell count tcc by classifying particles according to their morphology in addition to particle size distribution with no additional reagents or sample preparation staining and incubation højris et al 2016 thus flow imaging is expected to result in less frequent maintenance and higher measurement frequency for instance højris et al 2016 presented an online flow imaging method based on dark field microscopy that classifies particle images into abiotic particles and bacteria the present study introduces a novel online flow imaging particle counter based on lensless digital inline holographic microscopy dihm which classifies particles by machine learned features not typical in drinking water and by their size when compared to conventional microscopy using a magnifying objective lensless dihm allows much larger water volumes to be measured because of the considerably larger field of view and depth of field of a single image and the ability to take images in rapid succession in a flow cell arrangement ozcan and mcleod 2016 xu et al 2001 ews require information on the detection performance of sensors to set correct levels of alarm the development of contamination detection methods typically occurs using pilot scale test environments in which contaminants are injected into drinking water without the risk of contaminating the ds these studies commonly use tap water as a source of drinking water however drinking water quality normally varies in a ds and may result in fluctuations in a signal of a measured parameter hall et al 2007 which should be taken into account by determining a baseline signal pilot scale studies reduce the presence of these quality fluctuations by pre collecting water in large tanks 1000 l before conveying it to the test environment dejus et al 2018 ikonen et al 2017 or recirculating the water to establish a stable baseline hall et al 2007 helbling and vanbriesen 2008 mckenna et al 2008 suggested that the water quality fluctuations in similar pilot scale test environments may be considerably smaller than the quality fluctuations in the actual ds thereby possibly overestimating sensor performance in contaminant detection in natural conditions the present study considered the water quality changes arising both from injected contaminants and from normal water quality fluctuations in a ds by monitoring the water quality simultaneously from two identical measurement lines by subtracting the response of the sensors in the line measuring normal water quality fluctuations later referred to as reference line from that of the sensors in the line measuring injected contaminants later referred to as contamination line the water quality change caused by the contaminant alone was obtained the aim of the present study was to evaluate the responses of a novel flow imaging particle counter and conventional water quality sensors to fluctuating drinking water quality and real life contaminants including stormwater treated wastewater wastewater and well water in addition to escherichia coli e coli in the ds an ideal sensor would have a far greater response for a real contamination than for normal water quality fluctuations thus the secondary aim was to study whether particle characteristics can be utilized to improve contamination detection due to the vast amount of recorded data the present work highlights the most considerable observations by examples 2 materials and methods 2 1 test environment the test environment was connected via a tap to the drinking water ds at tampere university hervanta campus tampere finland in this test environment eight sets of contaminant injections referred to as contamination experiments were introduced to drinking water by means of a continuously running test environment in the study period namely summer and autumn 2020 jun 2nd jul 16th sep 21st nov 26th the water mainly originated from the rusko surface water treatment plant produces ca 13 million m3 annually operated by tampere water which uses lake roine as a raw water source the treatment plant is approximately 2 km away from the university the variation in drinking water quality in 24 hour periods on the contamination experiment days is shown in table 1 the free chlorine concentration varied between 0 19 and 0 31 mg l the test environment consisted of a contamination line and reference line both including a feed container 10 l polypropylene and a mixing container diameter 110 mm height 600 3 mm polypropylene followed by a line for the flow imaging particle counter and light scattering particle counter contamination line only and a sensor rack for the conventional online water quality sensors diameter 50 mm polypropylene fig 1 in the mixing container the drinking water was mixed with the selected contaminant or reference feed during the contamination experiments while including an air gap to prevent backflow and an air hole to maintain atmospheric pressure in the containers the reference feed was drinking water except in the e coli experiment in which drinking water diluted phosphate buffered saline pbs was used instead between the contamination experiments only the drinking water flowed through the mixing containers water flowed gravitationally out of the mixing containers since the water level in the containers was approximately 245 cm higher than the end of the effluent tube in the test environment the water level of the mixing containers was held constant by water level sensors that were connected to a control system based on a microcontroller leonardo arduino usa and electric solenoid valves geoline my18 40 bar tecomec italy the flow in the lines was adjusted to approximately 5500 ml min via a half inch manual ball valve the flow was measured by ultrasound flow sensors uf08b cynergy3 uk during the contaminant injections the contaminant and reference feeds were injected into the corresponding mixing containers by a single peristaltic pump tube inner diameter 3 1 mm at 300 ml min the retention time from the feed containers to the sensors was approximately 1 min as confirmed by injecting sodium chloride from the feed container and monitoring the increase of conductivity results not shown thus minimizing the warming of the drinking water the test environment was qualified by determining the efficient mixing for particles up to 6 µm in size and ensuring that the contamination and reference line had similar tcc concentration prior to the contamination experiments for details see s1 text s1 s2 2 2 contamination experiments in the eight contamination experiments each with a single contaminant and varying concentrations five different types of contaminants including non artificial contaminants stormwater treated wastewater wastewater and well water and a reference microbial contaminant e coli were injected into the drinking water table 1 the non artificial contaminants were filtered prior to injections through 100 µm nylon filters to homogenize them and avoid clogging the flow imaging and light scattering particle counter the stormwater was sampled from a stormwater pipe at the edge of a suburban area hervanta tampere finland after rain in june the incoming wastewater and effluent were 24 hour composite samples collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant viinikanlahti tampere the well water meant for watering plants was sampled in the proximity of an allotment garden in tampere vuores e coli strain mg1655 was prepared by cultivating cells overnight in lysogeny broth medium supplemented with 0 4 glucose the cells were collected by centrifugation and thereafter washed and resuspended in pbs buffer ph 7 4 the solution of approximately 1 2 109 cells ml optical density at 600 nm 4 was vortexed gently before use all of the contaminant samples were stored in the dark at 4 c the contamination experiments with each contaminant consisted of a set of 3 6 target concentrations which included a range of supposedly undetectable concentrations in the low end and concentrations causing particle counter saturation in the high end for details see table s1 the target concentrations varied from the 0 0000083 v v 100 cells ml of e coli to the 3 v v of treated wastewater b excluding the well water experiment the experiments were performed stepwise after a 29 35 min of injection the injection pump was turned off for a period of 12 85 min the well water experiment consisted of a single injection in which the well water concentration was increased after a period of time in the test environment by gradually increasing the well water concentration in the feeding container all of the experiments were performed between 8 and 16 o clock on working days to ensure the presence of water quality fluctuations on the day of the experiments the filtered contaminants were diluted with the drinking water sampled from the same laboratory on the previous day and transferred to the feed containers no more than 60 min before the corresponding injection this drinking water used for the dilution of the contaminants and as the reference feed was stored in tightly closed plastic containers at room temperature storing drinking water overnight reduced the free chlorine concentration by as much as by half but its use in contaminant dilution did not impact the free chlorine concentration of the reference line during the experiments approximately 5 of the water in both lines was feed in addition diluting the contaminant with the sampled drinking water decreased the chlorine concentration of the contaminant feed since chlorine oxidized the natural organic matter and microbes of the contaminant before the diluted contaminant was injected these issues were considered unavoidable for two reasons first sampling dilution water during the experiments would have forced the use of dilution water with a possible high particle concentration due to water quality fluctuations second the removal of chlorine from the sampled drinking water by volatilization into the air was considered too time consuming the chlorine was deliberately removed from the test environment in the e coli experiment by dissolving approximately 0 3 g l of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate into the dilution water 2 3 online instrumentation the online instrumentation of the study consisted of two types of particle counters and four conventional online water quality sensors as described in table 2 the studied particle counters included a flow imaging particle counter a development version of qumo water quality monitoring station uponor corporation finland and a light scattering particle counter ols50p water with scattered light sensor sls 25 25 pamas partikelmess und analysesysteme gmbh germany which worked as a reference particle counter to gain knowledge of particle concentrations and size distributions during the experiments the conventional water quality sensors later referred to as the sensors included turbidity turbimax cus51d free chlorine memosens ccs51d conductivity memosens cls82d and ph orp memosens cps16d sensors all from endress hauser switzerland the placement of sensors and particle counters in the test environment is shown in fig 1 during the study period the maintenance of sensors and particle counters was instrument specific the flow cells of the flow imaging particle counters were periodically flushed except on the experiment days and their windows were cleaned when deemed necessary by the inspection of the image quality the light scattering particle counter typically encountered clogging after running for 5 7 days which resulted in zero responses in all channels this was overcome by feeding 1 m of hydrochloric acid into the particle counter until the responses were stabilized before connecting the online particle counter back to the test environment milli q water was fed into the particle counter for at least 10 min the conventional sensors were mechanically cleaned at the same time when the test environment was maintained all of the sensors used factory calibration during the measurement periods turbidity results were later calibrated based on the turbidity of grab samples prior to the data analysis due to wall scattering issues observed in the 50 mm sensor rack the sensor measurements were manually processed and the observed measurement artifacts due to faulty sensors or test environment maintenance were removed from the figures when the measurement artifacts were present during an experiment a corresponding sensor was completely left out from figures and further analysis the operating principle of the flow imaging particle counter is shown in fig 2 the water flows through a transparent flow channel directly on one of the windows of the flow channel is an image sensor which is illuminated from the other side by a diverging beam from a pulsed diode laser wavelength 405 nm the particles suspended in the water scatter the light forward in an expanding cone the scattered light interferes with the unscattered light and forms holograms on the image sensor the images are captured continuously and the particle holograms are detected counted and analyzed to classify the particles by the software embedded in the particle counter the software used internally literally thousands of measurement channels but for simplicity we reported the particle data collected into six measurement channels n b c f small and large expressed as particles ml fig 2 n particles represent the total concentration of particles small approx 1 µm and large approx 2 µm particle classifications resulted from estimating the particle size by the amplitude of the hologram and by comparison with the light scattering particle counter the b c and f classifications resulted from a hybrid machine learning model combining several deep neural networks trained on data obtained prior to the contamination experiments with stormwater uponor r d unpublished since the b c and f classifications stem from neural networks their properties cannot easily be described in terms of usual morphological parameters however sample images of the particles are shown in s2 figure s8 and some practical descriptions are given below b particles are larger than a few micrometers and tend to be irregularly shaped they are often found in pipe sediment set loose by for example sudden flow changes in ds uponor r d unpublished f particles are fiber like i e they are much longer than they are wide c particles do not appear in normal pipe sediment and are more indicative of particles in stormwater or wastewater uponor r d unpublished due to properties of the classification algorithm used at the time of the experiments a given particle can in principle belong simultaneously to c and either b or f classes since the c classification results from a different algorithm than the b and f classifications in addition a particle in the large class can simultaneously belong to any of b c or f classes 2 4 analyses to determine the water quality similarity in the contamination and reference lines on the days of the experiments drinking water grab samples were characterized for ph oxidation reduction potential orp turbidity conductivity free chlorine concentration and dissolved organic carbon doc the grab samples of drinking water were taken in 500 1000 ml pyrex bottles from the effluent tube in the test environment simultaneously from both lines no more than two hours prior to the first contaminant injection these were stored in the dark at 4 c and analyzed in two steps first ph and free chlorine were analyzed immediately after sampling second orp conductivity turbidity and doc were analyzed within six hours of sampling orp and ph were analyzed with a wtw ph 315i using wtw sentix 41 and si analytics blueline 31 rx electrodes respectively conductivity measurements were performed with a wtw inolab cond level 1 with a wtw tetracon 325 electrode and turbidity measurements were performed with a wtw turb 555 for free chlorine a dpd reagent hach dpd free chlorine reagent for 10 ml samples was mixed with a 10 ml drinking water sample and measured by a hach dr1900 portable spectrophotometer doc was measured according to en 1484 1997 with a shimadzu toc vcph instrument the characterization of filtered contaminants included the same aforementioned analyses as those for drinking water and in addition the filtered contaminants including stormwater treated wastewater wastewater and well water were analyzed for total suspended solids tss according to standard procedure en 872 2005 filters whatman gf c 1 2 µm within 24 h from the first injection 2 5 signal to noise ratio of online measurements the water quality signals of all of the sensors and particle counters were analyzed to assess sensor class responses later referred to as sensor responses caused by the contaminant injections and to determine a limit of detection lod for each sensor the analysis consisted of calculating a mean difference of sensor response between a period of contaminant injection a period in which the feed pump was on and a period of a selected baseline the mean difference was used in two methods in the first method a relative difference was calculated by dividing the difference by the mean of a selected baseline response to make it comparable between sensors classes the linearity of the relative difference in comparison to contaminant concentration was evaluated by calculating the linear regression coefficients of determination r2 using python v 3 8 3 library scikit learn v 0 23 1 and its linearregression class in the second method the mean difference was extended to a signal to noise ratio snr by dividing the resulting difference by the standard deviation of the selected baseline response szabo et al 2008 unlike szabo et al 2008 the baseline sensor response was selected via two approaches 1 a corresponding reference line sensor response during each injection was used for the flow imaging particle counter and conventional water quality sensors 2 a contamination line sensor response after each experiment namely 18 21 o clock was used to evaluate the first approach and to compare the responses of the flow imaging and light scattering particle counters an snr depicts a standardized and unitless difference of a sensor response a positive snr indicates that sensor response increases due to contaminant injection whereas a negative snr indicates that sensor response decreases due to contaminant injection the following representation was used in this study 1 s n r μ c o n t μ r e f σ r e f where μ c o n t is the mean of the sensor response caused by contaminant injection in the contamination line μ r e f is the mean of the selected baseline sensor response and σ r e f is the standard deviation of the selected baseline sensor response for example eq 1 results in an snr of 3 if the difference μ c o n t μ r e f is 3 σ r e f even though the same water was fed into the contamination line and the reference line the sensor responses were occasionally different due to apparent differences in sensor quality for example orp in fig 3 which are related to sensor accuracy table 2 this led to occasionally absolute snr values of 3 in the control periods no contaminant 18 21 o clock for details see table s4 which was overcome by selecting a conservative lod value snr 10 to assume the identical baseline fluctuations for both lines the sensor and flow imaging particle counter responses of both lines were subsequently adjusted to the same initial level based on the sensor responses 20 min prior to the first injection of an experiment 2 6 the relative proportions of particle classes and sizes the relative proportions of different particle classes of the flow imaging particle counter and size classes of the light scattering particle counter for the different contaminants were determined as follows first the absolute concentration differences between the contamination and reference line or the reference period for the light scattering instrument were determined at one of the higher concentrations of the experiment but not always the highest concentration to avoid artefacts due to saturation of the instruments then the baseline subtracted concentrations were divided by that of the summary class of the instrument namely n or total to obtain the relative proportions of the particle classes for drinking water the relative proportions of particle classes and sizes were calculated from data collected at the experiment site during the first experiment period jun 2nd jul 16th 2020 for the flow imaging particle counter the reference line instrument was used while the only light scattering particle counter available to us was installed in the contamination line for every time point of this six week data the particle size class concentrations were divided by the respective summary class n or total to obtain the relative particle proportions from this proportion data the 25th and 75th percentiles were calculated since the light scattering instrument was in the contamination line the raw data also included the contamination periods washings of the systems etc we estimated that these exceptional times represented much less than 25 of the total measurement time and chose a safe upper limit of 75th percentile in order to obtain normal limits of fluctuation not affected by the known contaminations 3 results and discussion 3 1 normal water quality fluctuations in the present study normal water quality fluctuations were determined for the 24 hour periods on the experiment days in order to separate the response to contaminants from the response to normal water quality fluctuations these fluctuations were assessed for the flow imaging particle counter and conventional water quality sensors the concentration of particles was higher during working hours 7 18 o clock especially in the morning than at other times of the day which was assumed to be caused by the rapid increase in water demand in the ds and surrounding property for example in fig 3 the total number of particles n particles and small particles measured by the flow imaging particle counter fluctuate strongly in both lines also when contaminants are not added especially between 7 and 18 o clock the n particles in the reference line between 7 and 18 o clock had a mean of 1367 ml 1 39 std n 220 whereas outside of these hours the mean was 822 ml 1 11 std n 254 in contrast b c f and large particle concentrations fluctuated visibly considerably less than n particle concentrations fig 3 similarly the light scattering particle counter in the contamination line outside the contaminant additions recorded considerably larger concentration fluctuations for particles up to 1 2 µm than for the larger ones fig 3 middle column the fluctuations in water quality measured by of the conventional sensors except for turbidity and conductivity started around 7 o clock and continued until midnight typically free chlorine concentration and orp fluctuations manifested a similar trend they decreased from midnight to the morning hours and then increased until achieving a peak value between 9 and 18 o clock the ph was typically inversely proportional to the free chlorine concentration and orp temperature fluctuations were occasionally very similar to free chlorine concentration orp and ph fig 3 turbidity fluctuations were similar to the particle concentration fluctuations conductivity showed no daily fluctuations typically it showed an increasing decreasing trend daily fluctuations of water quality in a ds are known to be related to varying water demand since the alternating high flow during the day and low flow during the night may lead to the mobilization and accumulation of particulate material in pipes nescerecka et al 2014 prest et al 2016 sunny et al 2020 in addition the changes in the residence time in a ds may lead to varying temperatures chlorine concentrations ph etc in a ds which likely explain the observed occasional similarity between temperature free chlorine orp and ph fluctuations other explanations for the origins of water quality fluctuations include changes on water supply operation and maintenance and construction work in the water supply prest et al 2016 the observed quality fluctuations in the present study were most likely related to the water demand of the property and the ds indicating that the fluctuations were not caused by sensor artifacts or produced from the test environment in which the water flow was gravitational and constant 3 2 sensor responses to wastewater and detection limits contamination detection of the flow imaging particle counter and conventional sensors was studied in the presence of normal water quality fluctuations by injecting different contaminants in various concentrations into one line of the continuously running test environment and analyzing simultaneously collected measurement data from both contamination and reference line as discussed in section 3 1 water quality fluctuations were present on all experiment days as detected with all particle counters and sensors except for conductivity the sensor responses to the contaminants were sudden positive particle concentrations turbidity or negative free chlorine concentration orp ph shifts to a new range which lasted until the contaminant left the test environment fig 3 the magnitudes of the shifts caused by contaminant injections were determined as the relative differences between the contamination and reference lines which were calculated by dividing the difference between contamination and reference line by the reference line value for all contaminants table s3 to evaluate how identical the two similar sensors flow particle counters performed in the two lines the relative differences were calculated for the control period between 18 and 21 o clock marked as 0 mg l concentration in which no contaminant was injected wastewater experiment b was selected as an example to illustrate the differences in sensor responses due to the high particulate and dissolved content of the wastewater compared to the drinking water table 1 the high particulate content in the wastewater increased the particle concentration and turbidity of the water in the contamination line thus the relative differences were positive and increased linearly with wastewater concentration r2 0 878 0 999 fig 4 by far the steepest slope of the linear fit is observed for f and c particles followed by large and b particles while the relative responses of n total and small particles and turbidity are substantially weaker as seen in fig 3 and discussed in more detail in section 3 4 very few f and c particles normally are present in drinking water however they do exist in wastewater making the relative difference large in contrast due to a high number of small particles in drinking water the relative increase in n small and turbidity caused by the contamination is considerably smaller contrary to parameters measuring the particle content directly free chlorine concentration and orp decreased linearly with wastewater concentration r2 0 962 0 997 this is attributed to the particulate content of the wastewater consuming the free chlorine orp is a chlorine concentration surrogate and the 5 fold lower orp value of the wastewater compared to that of the drinking water table 1 the sensors for temperature ph and conductivity did not respond to the wastewater injection at the studied concentrations the difference between the contamination and reference line responses were extended to take into account the magnitude of normal water quality fluctuations by determining a signal to noise ratio snr which was calculated by dividing the mean difference between the contamination line and reference line by the standard deviation of the reference line snr was used to determine the limit of detection value lod of the classes sensors for a contaminant concentration by setting the lod to snr 10 which indicates the response of ten times the standard deviation of the reference line even though the relative responses were typically linear fig 4 after the lod had been exceeded fig 5 wastewater b the snr responses varied due to normal water quality fluctuations to demonstrate the importance of taking normal water quality fluctuations into account in order to avoid overestimating the detection performance of difference classes sensors snrs were determined by using the reference line as a baseline and using a period of 18 21 o clock of the contamination line when no contaminants were injected as a baseline the utilization of the reference line showed for example that the 0 01 wastewater b injection increased the mean n particles by 2173 particles ml 90 fig 4 in the flow imaging particle counter in contamination line compared to that of the reference line however the corresponding standard deviation of the reference line 440 particles ml varied due to water quality fluctuations thus the snr was 5 remaining below the lod for all contaminants and injections see table s2 s4 in contrast using only the contamination line data and thus the baseline period outside the working hours a mean of 18 21 o clock in the contamination line can result in too optimistic lod shown as an increase in the mean n particles in the contamination line by 3813 particles ml 486 with an snr of 94 for all contaminants and injections see table s5 s7 due to the high standard deviation of the n particles in the reference line during the injections the snr surpassed the lod only for the highest concentration 0 03 table s4 while the baseline period using only contamination line data indicated that even the 0 001 wastewater b injection was detectable table s7 the use of the reference line in the test environment allowed for the analysis of sensor performance mimicking realistic conditions such as those in ds in comparison previous pilot scale drinking water contamination detection studies have concentrated on eliminating normal water quality fluctuations by recirculating drinking water besmer et al 2017 hall et al 2007 helbling and vanbriesen 2008 szabo et al 2008 in the test environment rather than determining sensor performance in the presence of fluctuations in an actual ews a reference line is not available and a baseline period must be estimated based on the already measured data however the present study highlighted that normal water quality fluctuations should be considered in improving contamination detection 3 3 impact of contaminants and their characteristics to sensor responses and detection limits to investigate the flow imaging particle counter and conventional sensor responses to different contaminants in the presence of normal water quality fluctuations a total of 33 injections with eight contaminants were analyzed for the absolute values of snrs the classes of flow imaging particle counter and turbidity were selected to analyze the responses to the particle content of contaminants as a simplified illustration fig 5 shows only the classes of small large and c particles for all particle classes see table s4 the small particles 1 µm of the flow imaging particle counter detected all of the studied contaminants by the criterion that snr exceeded 10 fig 5 similarly than the n particles total in turn the large particles 2 µm detected all of the studied contaminants except for the reference microbial contaminant e coli by the criterion that snr exceeded 10 fig 5 the c particles showed similar response to large particles however the number of c particles in the studied contaminants were considerably smaller than that of large particles see for example fig 3 in addition lod was not exceeded for well water and e coli contaminants the particle classes are discussed in more detail in section 3 4 the turbidity sensor could detect contamination for one of the highest suspended solid tss concentrations of all of the injections based on the contaminant concentration 0 5 stormwater a in this case tss of stormwater was 29 mg l on average table 1 resulting in a 0 15 mg l tss concentration in the water flowing through the contamination line moreover the lod almost 9 4 exceeded the 0 1 wastewater b injection which lead to 0 16 mg tss l for these two injections the small and large particles exceeded the lod in a 2 10 fold lower contaminant concentration with up to a 11 fold higher snr in comparison to those of turbidity turbidity was not measured for the other high tss concentration injections namely 3 treated wastewater b and 0 5 well water table s1 the sensors responding to the consumption of chlorine i e free chlorine concentration and orp can be considered as measuring both dissolved content as well as particulate content indirectly when the particulate content is assumed to consist of microorganisms or particulate organic matter both of which are oxidized by chlorine the free chlorine sensor could detect the highest concentrations of the filtered contaminant types stormwater treated wastewater wastewater and well water as indicated by exceeding the lod for all of them except for the stormwater 0 5 stormwater b snr 9 2 fig 5 the lod of the orp sensor was up to 4 times lower than those of the free chlorine sensor in addition to orp and free chlorine the dissolved content in the contaminants was measured by conductivity and ph sensors the conductivity responded to one of the highest dissolved solid concentrations measured as conductivity in drinking water of all of the injections based on the contaminant concentration 0 3 treated wastewater a and the contaminant conductivity 971 µs cm the response of ph sensor to contaminants did not exceed the lod in these experiments the small particle class was able to detect e coli fig 5 which was not possible for the conventional sensors tested previous studies hall et al 2007 ikonen et al 2017 have suggested that turbidity responds to e coli concentrations 1 6 10 fold higher than those in the present study indicating that the sensitivity of the turbidity and other conventional sensors for detecting individual microorganisms from drinking water is one thousandth of the sensitivity of the flow imaging particle counter the concentrations of e coli in the present study are very high in comparison to typical drinking water quality guideline of 1 cells 100 ml and the studied particle counters cannot separate bacteria from other particles in this respect flow cytometry outperforms particle counters the conventional sensors typically exceeded the lod only at the highest studied contaminant concentrations or not at all which indicates that higher contaminant concentrations would have been needed to determine lod for conventional sensors in the literature for example szabo et al 2008 injected 0 8 v v unchlorinated secondary effluent from the wastewater treatment plant with characteristics likely similar to treated wastewater a and b in the present study into the pilot scale test environment running chloraminated drinking water 2 mg l which resulted in the following relative responses and snrs conductivity 3 7 snr 28 4 orp 4 8 snr 6 2 ph 0 5 snr 7 2 and turbidity 116 snr 23 1 the conductivity response was in line with that in the present study treated wastewater a while the turbidity response was considerably higher which might be related to the selection of the baseline period or to the performance of the individual sensors the low response of the orp compared to the responses of the present study might have resulted from the chloraminated drinking water in which the free chlorine is not present even though orp has been considered to be a surrogate for the free total chlorine concentration hall et al 2007 the high snr values of the orp in the present study compared to those of the free chlorine suggest that the other dissolved constituents also play a role the orp had a relatively slow response to the contaminants compared to other sensors for example s2 figure s5 shows that the reference line had not returned to the normal level after injecting 0 1 wastewater a 0 3 g l thiosulfate thus leading to an orp value below the lod the responses of different sensors and particle counters to contaminants in drinking water are heavily dependent on the characteristics of the drinking water chlorination water source treatment process and contaminants as well as fluctuations in the quality of drinking water in general the particle content of the drinking water is strictly regulated for instance the drinking water directive european union 2020 regulates the effluent water of drinking water plants thus the reference value of the treatment plants producing over 10000 m3 day is set to 0 3 ntu in 95 of the samples and none to exceed 1 ntu on the other hand the dissolved content of the drinking water is not considered a threat to public health similar to that of pathogens and it varies more except in terms of chlorine concentration and ph which are used to maximize the effectiveness of disinfection and reduce the pipe corrosion even though the orp and conductivity sensors seem to respond considerably to contaminants in drinking water they might not be suitable sensors for all kinds of ds to illustrate drinking water deriving from several water sources results in a high orp and conductivity fluctuations depending on in what ratios water is fed to ds however in the studied ds the conductivity did not fluctuate while other sensors and the most classes of particle counters did thus making conductivity suitable option for an ews the sensor selection for an ews should be conducted based on the comparison of existing water quality data as well as preliminary online measurements in which the sensor responses to normal fluctuations are determined for different sensors the present study showed that the use of conventional sensors for detecting contaminants from drinking water might still be convenient in applications in which sensitivity is not the highest priority 3 4 the different particle classes as indicators for contamination since the flow imaging particle counter classifies the particles in drinking water into six classes namely n b c f small and large fig 2 based on particle characteristics such as size and shape the effect of particle class onto detection performance was further studied it was illustrated in fig 4 and discussed in section 3 2 that in wastewater b experiment the relative responses of the flow imaging particle counter classes c f b large were considerably larger than those of the n or small particles the light scattering particle counter results corroborated this observation by recording substantially greater relative increases in the concentrations of larger particles 1600 for particles 1 µm than those of small particles 270 for particles 1 µm using the 0 03 v v injection as an example table s6 this result was quite general during injections with stormwater treated wastewater and wastewater the relative increases of the particles larger than 1 µm as measured with the light scattering particle counter and the b c f and large particles of the flow imaging particle counter table s3 were manifold compared to the relative increases of particles smaller than 1 µm and the n small particles at most concentrations with stormwater and treated or untreated wastewater the c particles showed the greatest relative concentration changes of all flow imaging particle classes with well water and e coli however the largest relative changes were observed for the small particles at most concentrations to understand why the relative concentrations of certain particle classes increase more rapidly than others when a contaminant is added it is useful to compare the relative compositions of the contaminant and drinking water in fig 6 the relative abundances of particle classes characterized by both the flow imaging and light scattering particle counters are shown for the studied contaminants in essence fig 6 shows the resulting relative particle class or size distribution if the contaminant were injected to ultrapure water with no particles at all this facilitates comparison between the different contaminants moreover fig 6 shows the limits of normal fluctuation of drinking water shown as a shading between the 25th and 75th percentiles the key to understanding fig 6 is to look whether the relative proportion of a particle class in a contaminant is considerably above the normal range of pure drinking water if so that particle class may be a good indicator for that contaminant the above condition was true for stormwater treated wastewater and wastewater with particle classes b c f and large and for particle sizes larger than 1 µm well water and e coli particle class distributions were different by having substantially higher proportion of small particles and lower proportion of b c f and large particles than the other contaminants with the light scattering particle counter the distinction was less clear but still apparent well water and e coli have a high proportion of the smallest particles and a very low proportion of particles larger than 5 10 µm the snr did not generally follow the same trend as the relative increase for the flow imaging particle counter using the reference line as a baseline only in the following cases was the snr higher for a specific particle class than for both the n and small particles stormwater b 0 1 0 25 c particles wastewaters a and b c large and b particles table s4 for the light scattering particle counter the snr for particles larger than 1 µm was higher than that for particles smaller than 1 µm in the following cases stormwater a and b wastewater a 5 µm and wastewater b table s7 the reason for the apparent discrepancy between the relative concentration increase and the snr may lie in the statistics large particles were quite rare both in the reference line or during baseline measurement and during the rather dilute contaminations therefore the standard deviation in the denominator of the snr equation eq 1 is relatively large compared with the absolute concentration difference making the snr smaller the snrs at all contaminant concentrations are listed in table s4 for the flow imaging particle counter and conventional sensors and in table s7 for the light scattering particle counter and are shown graphically for selected parameters in fig 5 from that data it can be gleaned for example that in most cases for stormwaters treated wastewaters and wastewaters whenever the snr for n or small particles exceeded 10 so did also the snr for b c or large particles to illustrate the feasibility of machine learned particle classes namely b c and f their contamination detection performance was further analyzed although the relative proportion of b particles was considerably higher than that of c particles for all the studied contaminants fig 6 the c particles may be a better contamination indicator since also pure drinking water contains b particles the b particles might represent sediment particles that occasionally detach and are transported in a ds curiously the well water was visually rusty and contained a considerable number of b particles fig 6 the high content of iron and manganese was confirmed by laboratory analyses results not shown the fiber like f particles were still substantially rarer than c particles in the studied stormwater wastewater and treated wastewater contaminants fig 6 which limited their usefulness as generic contamination indicator however the distinct shape of f particles may help to identify certain types of contaminants recent research on drinking water contamination monitoring has mainly focused on online microbial monitoring besmer et al 2017 favere et al 2021 however a particle size range of 1 8 µm has been proposed for detecting contaminants in general in ds ikonen et al 2017 microbial content tends to fluctuate due to varying hydraulic conditions water temperature water source and treatment prest et al 2016 which was shown in the present study to be true also for particle sizes smaller than 10 µm the present study suggests that the relative proportion of larger particles in pure drinking water is low based on the particle concentration observation of six weeks fig 6 where 75 of the time less than 0 7 of particles were in size range 1 2 µm less than 0 2 2 5 µm and less than 0 02 larger than 5 µm on the smaller end of the size spectrum 75 of the time more than 90 of particles were in size range 0 5 0 7 µm and more than 4 4 between 0 7 and 1 µm comparing relative particle size distributions obtained using different instruments may not be straightforward if the lod smallest detectable particle size or the size bins differ with this in mind the above finding generally agrees with observations from various danish drinking water dss in which less than 0 1 of particles were larger than 5 µm højris et al 2016 probably due to downstream water treatment processes such as sand filtration and activated carbon filtration as mentioned in section 3 3 however the larger particles in dss have been observed in more downstream locations prest et al 2021 verberk et al 2006 and they have been associated with discoloration events vreeburg et al 2008 since the test environment of the present study was located only two kilometers away from the treatment plant the observed fluctuations of larger particles may be less than those of further down the ds for future studies it might be useful to determine if the particle classes of the flow imaging particle counter could also detect discoloration events to distinguish real contamination events from normal water quality fluctuations in general one should select parameters that have a high relative response to contaminants and a low response to normal water quality fluctuations an ideal parameter candidate has a response proportional to the contaminant concentration for the sensor in the contamination line and a flat profile otherwise fig 3 and table s2 s7 the c and f particle classes of the flow imaging particle counter and classes for particles larger than 10 µm light scattering particle counter seem to be most specific to contamination by stormwater and wastewater the small and n particle classes and those pertaining to particles smaller than 2 µm are catch all parameters that responded to the studied contaminants in addition to normal fluctuations the b particle class was hypothesized to be associated with sediment particles that may be regarded as an indicator for non harmful discoloration events and not actual contamination of the conventional water quality sensors only conductivity was relatively immune to normal quality fluctuations but it only responded strongly to treated wastewater for parameters that respond to both contaminants and normal fluctuations one needs to utilize detection algorithms that are able to eliminate the effect of normal water quality fluctuations however normal water quality fluctuations can be somewhat irregular due to their nature which can in turn lead to false alarms in an ews 4 conclusions the simultaneous and continuous baseline measurements during contaminant injections made it possible to separate sensor responses caused by contaminants from those caused by normal water quality fluctuations present in a ds not taking into account normal quality fluctuations may lead to overestimating a sensor s capability to detect contaminants normal water quality fluctuations impacted the responses of the particle classes n small large b of the flow imaging particle counter particle size classes less than 10 µm of the light scattering particle counter as well as the conventional sensors except conductivity particle classes c and f of the flow imaging particle counter and particle sizes 10 µm of the light scattering particle counter were relatively immune to normal water quality fluctuations in addition to that they had a high relative response to contaminations with stormwater and wastewater small particle class of the flow imaging particle counter and the 1 µm classes of the light scattering particle counter detected all the studied contaminants including those with an especially high content of small particles well water and e coli however they were susceptible to normal water quality fluctuations orp which responded both to dissolved and particulate contaminants detected the presence of all of the studied contaminants except e coli
