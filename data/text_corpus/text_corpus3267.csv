16335,drinking water treatment plants use granular activated carbon gac to adsorb and remove trace organics but the gac has a limited lifetime in terms of adsorptive capacity and needs to be replaced before it is exhausted biological degradation of target contaminants can also occur in gac filters which might allow the gac to remain in service longer than expected however gac biofiltration remains poorly understood and unpredictable to increase the understanding of adsorption and biodegradation in gac previous studies have conducted parallel column tests that use one column of gac potentially biologically active to assess overall removal via both adsorption and biodegradation and one column with either sterilized gac or biological non adsorbing media to assess adsorption or biodegradation alone mathematical models have also been established to give insight into the adsorption and biodegradation processes in gac in this review the experimental and modeling approaches and results used to distinguish between the role of adsorption and biodegradation were summarized and critically discussed we identified several limitations 1 using biological non adsorbing media in column tests might lead to non representative extents of biodegradation 2 sterilization methods may not effectively inhibit biological activity and may affect adsorption 3 using virgin gac coated with biofilm could overestimate adsorption 4 potential biofilm detachment during column experiments could lead to biased results 5 the parallel column test approach itself is not universally applicable 6 competitive adsorption was neglected by previous models 7 model formulations were based on virgin gac only to overcome these limitations we proposed four new approaches the use of gamma irradiation for sterilization a novel minicolumn test compound specific isotope analysis to decipher the role of adsorption and biodegradation in situ and a new model to simulate trace organic adsorption and

granular activated carbon gac is a common treatment method to remove trace organics i e organic compounds with a typical concentration at ng l to μg l level in drinking water treatment plants over time the adsorption capacity of gac is reduced due to the loading of natural organic matter nom and the trace organics themselves with the gac eventually becoming saturated yu et al 2009 for example many utilities in the great lakes region install gac to remove taste and odor compounds that are associated with seasonal algal blooms particularly geosmin and 2 methylisoborneoal mib for such taste and odor control gac bed life was expected to be less than eighteen months even when the filter at an empty bed contact time ebct of 20 min was periodically exposed to low ng l of mib in source water gillogly et al 1999 since algal blooms are periodic it is difficult to track performance degradation in real time utilities typically replace gac based on a calendar schedule or the gac testing characteristics such as iodine number uniformity coefficient effective size and abrasion resistance however none of these methods could be able to determine an accurate remaining life of an existing gac filter in terms of geosmin and mib removal which might lead to either unnecessary costs due to too frequent gac replacement or plant vulnerability if replacement is not in time to address this issue huang et al 2019 conducted a survey using pilot scale column tests to evaluate the performance of gac for geosmin and mib removal at a number of treatment plants in ontario canada the authors observed that gac that had been left in service for more than five years i e beyond the expected lifetime of two years in this region could still achieve significant decreases in geosmin concentrations hereafter referred to as removal i e 70 in some locations while the gac performance deteriorated somewhat over the first year it remained relatively unchanged thereafter one hypothesis for the sustained performance is that the previously adsorbed contaminants were desorbed and subsequently degraded by microorganisms that grow on carbon surface thus partially regenerating the in service gac an alternative hypothesis is that biodegradation becomes an alternative mechanism responsible for geosmin removal in gac termed biofiltration when the adsorptive capacity of the gac is near exhaustion the conversion of gac from solely an adsorption process to gac biofiltration could potentially extend the gac service time avoiding costly replacement however biological processes in gac remain poorly understood and are not predictable hindering their intentional utilization to prolong gac lifetime and maximize contaminant removal in gac filters a number of previous studies have attempted to understand the biological processes in gac using alternative biological activity parameters including phospholipid measurement wang et al 1995 biomass respiration potential urfer and huck 2001 adenosine triphosphate atp magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 and enzyme activity mckie et al 2020 however it is difficult to establish a direct relationship between biological activity parameters and the contaminant biodegradation in gac filters since contaminant removal in gac might be due to both adsorption and biodegradation to address this issue and differentiate between adsorption and biodegradation in gac previous studies have used parallel column tests in which a bench bed depth 40 cm or pilot scale bed depth 40 cm column of gac is tested for overall contaminant removal via both adsorption and biodegradation and the other parallel column uses either sterilized gac to evaluate adsorption alone or biological non adsorbing media to evaluate biodegradation alone e g persson et al 2007 wang et al 2007 ma et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2019 however such parallel column tests have arguably employed experimental approaches or techniques that are not without potential problems making it difficult to conclusively distinguish between the relative contributions of adsorption and biodegradation to contaminant removal for example persson et al 2007 investigated the fate of geosmin and mib using gac and biologically active crushed expanded clay filters both adsorption and biodegradation were considered to take place in the gac filter while only biodegradation was expected in the crushed expanded clay filter however the different surface characteristics between the media might have led to different amounts and composition of microbial community magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 resulting in different levels of biodegradation shimabuku et al 2019 autoclaved gac to hinder biodegradation of mib however autoclaving may alter the chemical and physical properties of gac shaw et al 1999 thus affecting adsorption in addition to parallel column tests a number of mathematical models have been established to give insight into adsorption and biodegradation processes in gac and help predict performance under typical operational conditions of empty bed contact time ebct dissolved organic carbon doc level and water temperature e g kim and pirbazari 1989 badriyha et al 2003 liang et al 2007 existing models to date cannot accurately predict contaminant removal in field scale gac filters due to unrealistic model assumptions for instance badriyha et al 2003 assumed that there was no competitive adsorption between nom and alachlor when modeling alachlor removal in gac filters however under field conditions the competitive adsorption between alachlor and nom in natural water cannot be neglected knappe et al 1997 graham et al 2000 moreover model parameter values may not be accurate thus resulting in biased model simulation results for example modeling studies e g kim and pirbazari 1989 badriyha et al 2003 estimated the film diffusion coefficient k f using empirical correlations but such correlations are not universally applicable and have constraints for the reynolds number and the schmidt number in fixed bed reactors sontheimer et al 1988 and consequently may lead to inaccurate k f values parallel column tests and mathematical models are complementary to each other parallel column tests can contribute to the verification and calibration of mathematical models and the mathematical models can quickly establish the optimum experimental conditions for parallel column tests and eliminate the need for time consuming and labor intensive lab trials however they must be improved to become useful tools to develop guidelines for optimum gac operation in the field the objective of this article is to critically review previous parallel column tests and modeling approaches highlighting their limitations and proposing improvements for future studies the search strategy and study eligibility criteria are described in detail in text s1 in the supplementary information si 2 parallel column tests for distinguishing biodegradation and adsorption in gac 2 1 lessons learned from parallel column tests parallel column tests can help distinguish between the contributions of contaminant adsorption and biodegradation in gac as shown in table 1 the tests have typically involved one column containing gac under normal conditions a control and the other containing either non adsorbing media to isolate biodegradation or sterilized media to isolate adsorption the non adsorbing media may be glass beads sand or anthracite which can support biofilm attachment and growth the sterilized media may be gac that has been either baked at 250 c autoclaved or sterilized with sodium azide to limit microbial growth it is important to note that a number of previous studies e g rattier et al 2012 piai et al 2020 also conducted parallel batch tests to differentiate between adsorption and biodegradation in gac however batch tests do not fully represent gac in field conditions in water treatment plants where gac is installed in fixed bed reactors batch tests are therefore not discussed in this review as shown in table 1 these studies have selected target compounds that can be both adsorbed and biodegraded e g geosmin and mib in most cases trace organics that have adverse effects on the environment or human health were chosen as compounds of interest however trace organics alone may not support long term microbial cell growth due to their low concentrations or periodic occurrences namkung and rittmann 1987 several strategies have been applied to maintain and promote microbial activity one strategy is to add additional nutrients or easily biodegradable compounds such as p hydroxybenzoic acid into the influent chang and rittmann 1987b liang et al 2003 another strategy is to use ozonation as a pretreatment to form easily biodegradable intermediates including carboxylic acids and low molecular weight aliphatic aldehydes urfer et al 1997 liang et al 2003 gac filters are not operated at steady state which may affect the relative importance of adsorption and biodegradation for a virgin gac adsorption is the dominant removal mechanism the adsorption capacity of the gac decreases with time until all accessible adsorption sites are occupied while the biodegradation ability of the gac increases with time to reach a steady state after a bioacclimation process at this stage biodegradation may become the dominant removal mechanism to evaluate this dynamic process some studies e g chang and rittmann 1987b zhang et al 1991 wang et al 2007 used virgin gac and ran the tests for an extended period of time e g 20 000 bed volumes until the biological removal efficiency i e in sand column or bac column reached a stead state value and recorded the contaminant breakthrough curve to track the progression of adsorption and biodegradation in gac during the whole experiment period alternately other studies e g persson et al 2007 ma et al 2018 used preloaded gac and ran the tests for a short period of time e g 2000 bed volumes and recorded only several breakthrough points to understand the current conditions of adsorption and biodegradation in the gac fig 1 summarizes the reported removal efficiencies i e percent concentration decreases due to adsorption or biodegradation compared to overall removal efficiencies i e adsorption biodegradation in gac for each target compound evaluated in the studies this figure excludes some data points in the studies that spiked high concentrations at the mg l level of contaminants in the experiments chang and rittmann 1987b zhang et al 1991 liang et al 2003 li et al 2008 or only monitored general parameters such as doc uv254 and dissolved oxygen do reaume et al 2015 since the transferability of such results to gac application for trace organic removal may be limited for some studies that recorded the whole breakthrough curves during the experiments e g wang et al 2007 zhiteneva et al 2020 only the data points 20 000 bed volumes for which the biological removal efficiency e g biological sand column reaches a steady state value were included it is important to note that the observed overall removal in gac is not necessarily equal to the sum of observed adsorption efficiency in sterilized gac and observed biodegradation efficiency in biological non adsorbing media for example persson et al 2007 observed 97 overall removal of geosmin in a gac column potentially biologically active due to both adsorption and biodegradation 97 removal in a sterile gac column presumably due to adsorption alone and 88 removal in a sand column presumably due to biodegradation alone thus it is not appropriate to directly deduct the observed adsorption efficiency in sterilized gac or biodegradation efficiency in biological non adsorbing media from the overall removal efficiency in gac to estimate the corresponding biodegradation or adsorption in gac a preliminary meta analysis of the reported removal efficiencies of each individual test in previous studies was conducted here to assess the relative importance of adsorption and biodegradation in gac as shown in fig 1 a adsorption was the prevailing removal mechanism i e the ratio of adsorption efficiency to overall removal is greater than 50 in most cases this may be because gac has a large number of micropores and mesopores providing a large adsorption capacity for the target compounds newcombe et al 1997 for example persson et al 2007 evaluated geosmin and mib adsorption and biodegradation using a 4 year old gac and observed a similar phenomenon adsorption dominated geosmin and mib removal in contrast fig 1 b shows that biodegradation efficiency i e removal in non adsorbing columns is relatively minor compared to the overall removal of compounds in the control columns this may be because most of the selected compounds are recalcitrant to biodegradation however several studies did observe both high biodegradation efficiency and high overall removal efficiency these were studies that employed easily biodegradable contaminants e g fluoxetine ma et al 2018 a long ebct e g 30 min persson et al 2007 or a long biological acclimation time e g 7 months wang et al 2007 as shown in fig 1 the relative importance of adsorption and biodegradation in gac can vary significantly this variability might depend on a variety of factors including compound type water quality characteristics or typical filter design parameters ma et al 2018 thus a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the significance of a specific factor s effect on the relative quantity of adsorption or biodegradation in gac at the 95 confidence level shown in text s2 in the si the factors selected include the octanol water partition coefficient logkow the biodegradability value biowin 6 i e the probability of rapid aerobic biodegradation estimated using the epi suitetm biowin v4 10 miti nonlinear model with a detailed explanation in text s2 total organic carbon toc concentration ebct and gac particle size we found that the relative extent of adsorption in gac was significantly increased at higher toc concentration coefficient 0 011 p value 0 025 and longer ebct coefficient 0 0070 p value 0 016 however none of factors were identified to significantly affect the relative extent of biodegradation in gac the results of regression analysis are shown in table s2 please note that the ratio of adsorption or biodegradation to the overall contaminant removal may also depend on other factors such as initial concentrations water background matrices competitive adsorbates carbon surface chemistry and the loading of activated carbon however not all of these parameters were included in the previous studies and none of these parameters were kept constant this meta analysis is not comprehensive and includes data from not full controlled experiments and may therefore not provide an unbiased evaluation more research should be conducted in the future 2 2 limitations of parallel column tests there are several potential limitations to the previously described parallel column tests that make it difficult to accurately distinguish adsorption from biodegradation in gac the most common problem is that biological non adsorbing media such as glass beads crushed expanded clay sand or anthracite e g chang and rittmann 1987b persson et al 2007 wang et al 2007 ma et al 2018 have been used in parallel to a gac potentially biologically active column despite exhibiting different surface characteristics biofilm community and biomass amounts potentially resulting in non comparable biodegradation shimabuku et al 2019 the second potential problem is related to the effectiveness of sterilization and its effect on gac adsorption characteristics e g sbardella et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2019 for example sodium azide might inactivate only certain microbial species but other species might use alternative routes of energy supply such as bypassing atp synthesis rattier et al 2012 moreover the methods that suppress biodegradation may impact adsorption it was reported that sodium azide might increase the ionic strength of the water sample thus decreasing the adsorption of ionic compounds lotrario et al 1995 baking at 250 c or autoclaving may reactivate gac and increase its adsorption capacity shaw et al 1999 thus future research should evaluate the effectiveness of inactivation methods and their effect on adsorption third some experiments liang et al 2003 li et al 2008 used virgin gac coated with a biofilm in practice the adsorption capacity of gac may be partially saturated before a biofilm develops since nom can block or occupy gac pores during long acclimation periods thus when virgin gac is directly coated with a biofilm for experimental purposes the resulting gac would have a higher adsorption capacity than in practice fourth the effect of biofilm on adsorption has not been investigated some microbes and their metabolic macromolecular products in the biofilm could increase the film resistance and block the pore openings on the carbon surface thus reducing the adsorption compared to virgin gac stewart 2003 rattier et al 2012 sharaf and liu 2021 experimental approaches using a high contaminant concentration e g 500 mg l li et al 2008 or long exposure to sodium azide e g 44 months persson et al 2007 might have resulted in detachment of the biofilm from the carbon surface and resulted in a larger adsorption potential than in the initial conditions fifth the parallel column test approach itself may not accurately estimate the relative contributions of adsorption and biodegradation in gac for example the mass of compounds adsorbed in the sterilized gac column might be larger than that actually adsorbed in the gac column in the gac column when an easily biodegradable compound passes through the biofilm it may be biodegraded to a large extent leaving only a limited quantity that can diffuse into pores and eventually be adsorbed however in the sterilized gac column all of the compound could diffuse into pores without being biodegraded resulting in a larger amount of compounds that can be adsorbed than that in the gac column 2 3 suggestions for improvements three potential experimental techniques designed to overcome the above mentioned limitations are proposed to differentiate adsorption from biodegradation in parallel column tests gamma irradiation minicolumn test and compound specific isotope analysis 2 3 1 gamma irradiation the typical approaches that eliminate bacterial activity e g adding sodium azide baking at 250 c or autoclaving may alter the adsorptive characteristics of gac gamma irradiation is reported to be able to sterilize gac with a minimal effect on these characteristics lotrario et al 1995 during inactivation gac is suspended in a water filled bottle that is exposed to gamma rays where highly reactive compounds such as hydroxyl radicals protons and hydrated electrons are formed modifying the dna rna and protein structure of organisms in the biofilm thornley 1963 zhao et al 1999 irradiated both virgin gac and biofilm covered gac by gamma rays at a dose of 20 kgy and found that the adsorption capacity of the two gacs did not change an important consideration for gamma irradiation is the selection of the optimum irradiation dose a high dose e g 20 kgy may lead to a radiolytic decomposition of oxygen complexes on the carbon surface thus increasing the carbon pore size el shobaky et al 1987 but a low dose e g 5 kgy may result in incomplete inactivation of biological activity stoquart et al 2013 stoquart et al 2013 demonstrated that an irradiation dose of 10 to 15 kgy could effectively inactivate microbial activity without affecting the adsorption of methylene blue however methylene blue is an ionic compound whose adsorption might be governed by electrostatic force instead of hydrophobic force which is considered the dominant mechanism for the adsorption of trace organics in gac rattier et al 2012 thus it is still unknown whether gamma irradiation would impact trace organic adsorption moreover since gamma irradiation is expensive and not widely available an important first step is to compare the efficiency of gamma irradiation with that of other common sterilization and inactivation methods based on which a cost effective method can be selected 2 3 2 minicolumn test the minicolumn test is a bench scale approach developed by gillogly et al 1999 to evaluate the removal of a contaminant in preloaded gac the term minicolumn comes from the fact that its dimensions 1 cm bed depth 1 1 cm internal diameter aspect ratio 1 1 are smaller than the typical parallel column tests described above 5 100 cm depth 1 5 9 53 cm in diameter aspect ratio 1 2 1 40 table 1 the original design figure s1 consists of small volume glass columns packed with a size representative fraction of a core gac sample collected from a full scale gac contactor and spiked with the target compounds and it is conducted at the same ebct as that of the full scale contactors a major advance with this test is that it requires less gac and water e g 30 g gac and 20 l water as opposed to up to 1355 g gac and 57 000 l water in previous tests table 1 which reduces the burden of labor intensive gac and water sampling from full scale gac contactors the minicolumn test duration is typically 1 3 days as opposed to 5 486 days in previous parallel column tests table 1 which may preserve the integrity and composition of biofilm and decrease the possibility of the biofilm detachment from the gac surface during the experiment additionally the minicolumn test uses gac directly harvested from an existing filter i e naturally preloaded gac thus better simulating the field gac potentially biologically active this is different from the previous column tests that use virgin gac under artificially controlled experimental conditions to examine the progression of the extent of adsorption and biodegradation in gac during the experiment gillogly et al 1999 validated the minicolumn tests by showing that a near identical breakthrough of mib could be obtained in the minicolumns compared to that in pilot scale columns which presumably represent the performance of full scale gac contactors huang et al 2019 further confirmed the validity of the minicolumn test approach under more conditions different gac types and ages different water matrices yuan et al 2021 later experimentally verified the key requirement of this test the gac bed must have a broad mass transfer zone for the target compounds additionally nie et al 2020 tested the effect of bed depth flow velocity column diameter particle size distribution temperature on the minicolumn test results using the pore and surface diffusion model and provided a theoretical validation of the minicolumn approach the minicolumn test can be used as a suitable tool to compare the performance of naturally preloaded gac potentially biologically active harvested from water treatment plants and that of sterilized gac which enables the differentiation between adsorption and biodegradation in gac it is important to note that the minicolumn test is different from the other well known laboratory test the rapid small scale column test rssct in an rssct a small column e g 10 cm bed depth and 3 74 mm internal diameter aspect ratio 1 30 is used to simulate the breakthrough profile of a full scale adsorber using a scaled down ebct and ground virgin gac crittenden et al 1986 1987a the scaling relationship between the ebct of the rssct and that of the full scale gac contactor can be determined based on eq 1 crittenden et al 1991 1 e b c t s c e b c t l c r s c 2 r l c 2 d s l c d s s c β t s c t l c however the rssct can be applied for only virgin gac since grinding preloaded gac may open pores blocked by background nom and lead to a higher adsorption capacity knappe et al 1999 the majority of biological gac is naturally preloaded with nom since nom can block or occupy the gac pores during microbial acclimation and growth in this case the nom loading might increase biodegradation in gac by stimulating microbial growth due to greater availability of food sources while nom fouling could decrease adsorption in gac by reducing both the adsorption capacity and rate it can be argued that rsscts might be an alternative way to differentiate adsorption and biodegradation in gac since its short experimental time may not be sufficient for biological acclimation and consequently enables observation of only adsorption in gac for example zhiteneva et al 2020 conducted rsscts in parallel to a biological gac column to determine the contribution of adsorption for selected chemicals in gac however there is potentially a risk here in that the contribution of biodegradation to contaminant removal cannot be strictly eliminated under such conditions since the feedwater may also contain some bacteria which can degrade contaminants additionally rsscts may overestimate the adsorption capacity of gac since less nom fouling may be present in the pulverized gac corwin and summers 2010 thus it is argued that the minicolumn test is a more suitable tool to evaluate the gac performance 2 3 3 compound specific isotope analysis compound specific isotope analysis csia is a promising method with the potential to distinguish adsorption from biodegradation in a single gac column test it is based on the natural abundance of different stable isotopes in compounds and does not involve the use of labelled compounds the isotope ratio r is the ratio of heavy to light stable isotopes of an element x in eq 2 in a compound e g 13c 12c 15n 14n 2h 1h while the absolute abundance of the heavy isotope e g 13c 15n 2h cannot be measured with great precision the difference in isotope ratio between two compounds can be determined with high accuracy mckinney et al 1950 a common convention for expressing r is to use δ notation by comparing the isotope ratio in a sample rsample to the isotope ratio in an international standard rstandard expressed in mur corresponding to the ratio reported as parts per thousand eq 2 2 δ h x r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 due to differences in activation energies chemical bonds involving a heavy isotope e g 13c 1h tend to break more slowly than those exclusively containing light isotopes e g 12c 1h during bond breaking e g via biodegradation the residual compound pool becomes enriched in heavy isotopes this phenomenon in which the isotope ratio changes in the course of a given reaction mechanism is referred to as isotope fractionation adsorption which is a non degradative process i e no bond breaking does not involve significant isotope fractionation harrington et al 1999 slater et al 2000 thus leading the isotope ratio unchanged thus whereas a decrease in compound concentration in a gac filter can only indicate overall removal a concurrent significant enrichment in heavy isotope can provide direct evidence that biodegradation dominates over adsorption these concepts are reviewed with practical applications in hunkeler et al 2009 and are applied widely for traditional groundwater contaminants and more recently for emerging organic contaminants elsner et al 2005 elsner and imfeld 2016 before wide application there are several prerequisites first methods must be developed and validated for each substance second the extent and reproducibility of isotope fractionation much be quantified for a given compound for each expected degradative and non degradative reaction mechanism and pathway in controlled laboratory conditions in some cases isotope effects can be masked by rate limiting steps other than bond cleavage e g cell uptake transport in the cell binding to the enzyme which should be investigated before accurate interpretation of field data can be made nijenhuis and richnow 2016 multi element isotope analysis is often required to distinguish reaction mechanisms if multiple mechanisms are expected simultaneously ojeda et al 2020 mariotti et al 1981 proposed the rayleigh model which correlates the change in the isotope ratio to the biodegradation efficiency eq 3 shown for carbon 3 α 1 l n f b i o l n δ 13 c r e s i d u a l 1000 1 δ 13 c o r i g i n a l 1000 1 the isotope fractionation or enrichment ε α 1 factors represent the extent of isotope fractionation for a specific contaminant during degradation mariotti et al 1981 they can be estimated from fitting the rayleigh model to data obtained in laboratory degradation experiments the determination of ε could make it possible to assess the extent of biodegradation in gac filters by measuring the isotope ratios in filter influent and effluent thus allowing to estimate the relative importance of biodegradation and adsorption in gac filters the main caveat for the wide application of csia to trace organics such as mib and geosmin is the high detection limits of isotope ratio mass spectrometers however recent advances in sampling techniques sample preparation and isotope analytical chemistry elsner and imfled 2016 bakkour et al 2018 torrentó et al 2019 showed promising results for the application of csia to this new field in addition to csia the use of 14c labeled compounds may also allow differentiation between adsorption and biodegradation in gac by tracking the radioactivity in water solid and gas phases for example betsholtz et al 2021 estimated the contributions of biodegradation in gac by tracking the formation of 14co2 however the applied method can only demonstrate the biodegradation of contaminants through mineralization but neglects the biodegradation of contaminants through biotransformation which could be considered as major pathways for micropollutant biodegradation badriyha et al 2003 3 mathematical models for simulating adsorption and biodegradation in gac 3 1 general approach ideally an accurate mathematical model would be able to predict gac performance over its service life under specific operating conditions this would then allow the model user to identify conditions that maximize contaminant removal and possibly also enhance the gac service life several models table 2 have been developed to describe the gac system based on four major processes including diffusion through a liquid film diffusion and biodegradation within the biofilm diffusion into pores and adsorption and biofilm growth and loss shown in fig 2 as shown in table 2 the models that have been developed to date have typically simulated two types of reactors for the gac fixed bed reactors and completely stirred tank reactors cstr while three studies prior to 1992 describe adsorption and biodegradation processes in gac based on a cstr more recent studies have switched to model the gac processes based on a more realistic fixed bed reactor the gac system has been described using up to four mechanisms dispersion advection adsorption and biodegradation mass balances of a compound in three phases liquid biofilm and solid and biomass in the biofilm were established to formulate model equations since differential equations in the models cannot be directly solved using analytical solutions several numerical approaches were applied including the orthogonal collocation method the finite difference method using the crank nicholson scheme and the hybrid method the orthogonal collocation method employs a trial function expansion such as legendre or jacobi s polynomials to get numerical approximations to solutions villadsen and stewart 1967 the finite difference method is an approach that solves differential equations by approximating them with difference equations where finite differences approximate the derivatives however for a gac mathematical model which consists of several partial differential equations applying only either orthogonal collocation or the finite difference method may not be computationally efficient kim and pirbazari 1989 thus a hybrid numerical procedure that involves both orthogonal collocation and finite difference methods has been developed and applied in several studies kim and pirbazari 1989 ravindran et al 1997 badriyha et al 2003 sinel nikova et al 2012 in this approach a number of dimensionless groups were used to characterize the gac reactors table 3 which can represent the relative importance of each mass transport mechanism the first 4 parameters in table 3 sh bis bip and b i describe the diffusion of a compound in reactors the sherwood number sh represents a ratio of liquid film transport to biofilm dispersion badriyha et al 2003 a high sh value means that liquid film resistance is not important in other words the difference between the compound concentration in bulk liquid and that at the biofilm surface is negligible the original biot number represents either the ratio of liquid film diffusion to intraparticle surface diffusion bis or the ratio of liquid film diffusion to intraparticle pore diffusion bip to take the biofilm on gac surface into account a modified biot number b i was proposed representing the ratio of biofilm diffusion to intraparticle surface diffusion çeçen and aktaş 2012 if b i is low the diffusion through biofilm is lower than the diffusion on carbon surface the péclet number pe shows the ratio of advective transport to diffusive transport when pe is close to zero the reactor behaves in a completely mixed regime conversely when pe approaches infinity the reactor can be considered as a plug flow reactor crittenden et al 1986 the stanton number st represents the comparison between liquid film transport and advective transport crittenden et al 1987a if the st value is high liquid film transport is dominant a certain minimum value of st must be maintained to ensure that a bioadsorber does not undergo channeling without adequate film transfer badriyha et al 2003 the solute distribution number dg a ratio of solid phase loading to liquid phase loading depends on adsorption capacity friedman 1984 a larger value of dg means a greater affinity of an adsorbate for the adsorbent the damköhler number da compares the biological reaction rate to that of the mass transfer processes including advection or liquid film dispersion kleijin et al 1996 a low da value indicates that biodegradation is a rate limiting factor 3 2 lessons learned from previous models among the models listed in table 2 seven models speitel et al 1987 kim and pirbazari 1989 ravindran et al 1997 badriyha et al 2003 liang et al 2007 sinel nikova et al 2012 alonso et al 2021 provide the most comprehensive descriptions of physical and biological phenomena occurring in gac filters and are therefore critically reviewed below thus the focus of the following section is to discuss the seven models in detail providing useful information for gac operation and future model development these models have described the compound mass balances in three different phases liquid biofilm and solid along with biofilm thickness variations using eq 4 to 7 respectively 4 s t d z 2 s z 2 v z s z 3 1 ε r p l f 2 ε r p 3 k f s s s 5 s f t d f 2 s f r 2 k

to model the diffusion of a compound in both the liquid film and the biofilm the transport of a compound in the solid phase was considered to be dominated by surface diffusion and the adsorption equilibrium was described by the freundlich eq 8 or langmuir eq 9 isotherms additionally the monod equation was used to describe the biodegradation in the biofilm monod 1949 the adsorption isotherm parameters biofilm parameters biochemical kinetic parameters and mass transfer parameters might affect the model outputs the values of the isotherm parameters k and 1 n q m and k l were typically estimated based on experimental data of isotherm tests however several potential problems associated with the previous isotherm tests may make it impossible to obtain accurate isotherm parameters for example some modeling studies e g badriyha et al 2003 liang et al 2007 sinel nikova et al 2012 failed to demonstrate the attainment of the real equilibrium in the isotherm test possibly resulting in inaccurate isotherm parameters for the model simulation thus it is essential to conduct a well designed isotherm test 8 q k s 1 n 9 q q m k l s 1 k l s biofilm parameters maximum biofilm thickness l f m a x and biofilm density x f were determined experimentally previous studies used two methods to estimate l f m a x the first method is based on bed expansion due to biofilm growth eq 10 alonso et al 2021 however it is difficult to accurately measure the bed expansion volume δ v since the bed volume change due to biofilm growth is almost negligible in drinking water treatment the second method is based on the biofilm water content eq 11 law et al 1975 a typical approach for determining the water weight in biofilm was to randomly select several hundreds of carbon particles from a gac bed and measure the weight difference before and after drying them at 103 c for 48 h badriyha et al 2003 subsequently r w a weight ratio of water to biofilm including water was used to approximate biofilm weight which enables calculation of l f m a x based on the experimentally determined l f m a x biofilm density x f was calculated using eq 12 kim and pirbazari 1989 however drying the gac with a temperature less than 150 c may not completely remove the water within the carbon pores thus leading to misinterpretations in the biofilm mass additionally previous studies e g kim and pirbazari 1989 set an arbitrary value at 99 for r w without confirming it experimentally which might result in biased l f m a x and x f values 10 l f m a x δ v n p 4 π r p 2 11 l f m a x w e ρ l n w a p r w 12 x f b w n w a p l f m a x biochemical kinetic parameters include the monod constants μ m a x and k s the yield coefficient y and the overall biofilm loss coefficient b the values of the biochemical kinetic parameters were typically determined by experiments a stock solution of target compounds was fed to continuous flow reactors seeded with a microbial culture during the experiment samples were periodically collected to determine the compound concentration s t the data were modelled to obtain estimates for k s and μ m a x from eq 13 by plotting x f t s 0 s t against 1 s t and for y and b from eq 14 by plotting 1 t against s 0 s t x f t 13 x f t s 0 s t k s μ m a x 1 s t 1 μ m a x 14 1 t y s 0 s t x f t b mass transfer parameters including axial diffusivity d z film diffusion coefficient k f liquid diffusivity d l biofilm diffusivity d f and surface diffusivity d s were typically estimated using empirical correlations to determine d z chung and wen 1968 developed a correlation that relates the modified reynolds number r e and the galibeo number g a eq 15 15 d z μ l r e ρ l x 0 02 0 01 r e 0 48 16 x r e r e 17 r e 2 r p v z ρ l μ l ε 18 r e 33 7 2 0 0408 g a 1 2

1978 eq 20 however it is often difficult to obtain an accurate k f value for preloaded gac potentially biologically active due to the complexity of gac topography and nom fouling yu et al 2009 additionally there is limited range of validity for the empirical correlations it was therefore recommended that k f be experimentally determined yuan et al 2020 20 s h 2 0 644 r e 0 5 s c 1 3 for 3 r

et al 1987b eq 25 some studies kim and pirbazari 1989 badriyha et al 2003 also determined d s by conducting completely mixed batch experiments 24 d l 13 26 10 5 μ l 1 14 v b 0 589 25 d s ε p d l s o τ p ρ c q 0 s p d f r previous studies have verified the predictive capability of the models by comparing the model simulation results with the experimental results four studies kim and pirbazari 1989 ravindran et al 1997 badriyha et al 2003 liang et al 2007 have shown that model predictions were typically in good agreement with the experimental data of both non bioactive and bioactive adsorbers indicating that the gac mathematical models are powerful tools to understand the behavior of the gac filters under conditions similar to their experiments however the other three studies speitel et al 1987 sinel nikova et al 2012 alonso et al 2021 observed some discrepancies between modeled and experimental data speitel etal 1987 and sinel nikova et al 2012 calibrated the model by adjusting the model parameters to fit the experimental data and found that overall biofilm loss coefficient b and biofilm density x f played an important role as a correcting factor alonso et al 2021 explained that the pseudo first order adsorption model used may not adequately describe the adsorption kinetics during the initial stage of gac filter operation thus resulting in the poor fit of model it should also be noted that the model verification greatly depends on the quality of the experimental data the previous modeling studies typically conducted parallel column tests that used gac and biological non adsorbing media sand or anthracite columns to verify their models however different microbial communities might settle in sorptive and non sorptive media to address this issue future modeling studies may need to conduct an alternative type of parallel tests which use gac and sterilized gac columns model sensitivity analysis can assess the effect of varying the value of a selected model parameter on the model output which enables identification of key parameters that profoundly affect gac performance and provides information regarding process adjustment to enhance efficiency the previous studies ravindran et al 1997 badriyha et al 2003 liang and chiang 2007 have selected the following model parameters for the sensitivity analysis mass transfer coefficients k f d z d f d s biological rate coefficients y k s μ m a x k m a x maximum biofilm thickness l f m a x and adsorption isotherm parameters k 1 n as a result there was general agreement on the significant effect of biological parameters k s μ m a x k m a x and l f m a x and insignificant effect of adsorption mass transfer parameters k f d z d s on simulated effluent concentration curves ravindran et al 1997 badriyha et al 2003 liang and chiang 2007 however there were contrasting results regarding the sensitivity of model simulation to adsorption isotherm parameters k and 1 n and biofilm diffusivity d f ravindran et al 1997 reported that simulated gac performance was insensitive to k and 1 n while badriyha et al 2003 observed that k and 1 n had a significant impact on compound removal during the initial operation stage but the effect became less significant as the effluent concentration became steady state the potential cause for such a discrepancy is the different adsorption characteristics of the selected compounds liang and chiang 2007 found that the variation in d f could significantly affect biodegradation efficiency but both ravindran et al 1997 and badriyha et al 2003 observed the lack of model sensitivity to d f the observed difference may be due to the different biodegradability of the selected target compounds aldehydes and ketoacids selected by liang and chiang 2007 are known to be highly biodegradable schechter and singer 1995 but alachlor used by badriyha et al 2003 is a secondary substrate and can only be biodegraded in the presence of more easily degradable organics wilber and wang 1997 future modeling studies may need to select some representative compounds with different biodegradability to evaluate the model sensitivity to d f the sensitivity analysis showed that biological parameters k s μ m a x k m a x and l f m a x could most significantly affect the gac performance thus several strategies including strain improvement biofilm maintenance and enhancing enzyme activity were proposed for improving these parameters badriyha et al 2003 improving bacteria strains can increase the degradation rate of compounds through enhancing the kinetics of metabolic pathways which can increase μ m a x or k m a x and decrease k s techniques for improving bacteria strains include genome modification of target strain natural recombinant between conjugative plasmids of strains and transferring the gene of interest into a bacterial or fungal host kirisits et al 2019 however such techniques have not been applied in drinking water treatment additional work is needed to further refine those tools maximum biofilm thickness l f m a x should be maintained at an optimum value e g 5 10 μ m to maximize both substrate utilization and mass transfer rates schreyer and coughlin 1999 liang and chiang 2007 approaches for maintaining the biofilm thickness involve employing appropriate media types pre oxidants and backwash frequency and protocols enhancing enzyme activity can greatly increase biodegradation resulting in increased μ m a x or k m a x and decreased k s desirable measures to enhance enzyme activity include supplementing nutrients or adding pre oxidation liang et al 2003 these strategies have already been implemented in some biofilters in north america brown et al 2016 it should be noted that pre oxidation might enhance general enzyme activity but not necessarily the degradation of individual chemicals urfer et al 1997 previous studies have evaluated the effect of a specific factor on adsorption and biodegradation efficiency in gac which provide useful information for future gac operation first the biofilm thickness was closely related to the ratio of adsorption to biodegradation liang and chiang 2007 at the early operation stage when the biofilm coverage is slight adsorption controlled the gac performance as the biofilm thickness increased to half of the maximum thickness adsorption decreased while biodegradation increased liang and chiang 2007 when the biofilm thickness increased to the maximum minimum adsorption and maximum biodegradation occurred this was because the increased biofilm greatly hindered intraparticle diffusion and the increased biomass uptake lowered the driving force for adsorption liang and chiang 2007 based on this observation the biofilm thickness could be used as a potential monitoring parameter to identify the presence of unintentional gac biofiltration compared to the parallel column tests measuring the biofilm thickness is easier to conduct efficient biofilm thickness measurement techniques include x ray computed tomography nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and small angle neutron scattering azeredo et al 2017 second an active biofilm can greatly increase the effective service life for a gac filter with respect to trace organics especially at short ebcts badriyha et al 2003 found that the effective service life for a gac adsorber at a flow rate of 5 mgd short ebct to maintain 80 of alachlor removal would have been increased from 30 000 bed volumes to 65 000 bed volumes if it was converted into a biological filter while a gac adsorber at a flow rate of 1 mgd long ebct would extend its service life from 38 000 bed volumes to 68 000 bed volumes after conversion third decreasing gac particle size significantly increased adsorption efficiency but did not significantly improve the biodegradation efficiency of p hydroxybenzoic acid liang et al 2007 a smaller particle size results in a lower sherwood number sh and damköhler number da indicating a higher mass transfer rate within the biofilm under such conditions the compound can diffuse faster across the biofilm which leads to lower biodegradation and more adsorption onto the gac surface based on this observation selecting finer gac media might contribute to a better utilization of gac adsorption capacity however smaller gac size could also result in increased rates of head loss accumulation and shorter filter run time since fine media promotes rapid clogging of the filter surface graese et al 1987 consequently an appropriate gac size should be selected depending on the site specific conditions such as gac filter dimensions ebct and water quality characteristics previous gac mathematical models have some limitations which make it difficult to predict trace organic removal one of the weaknesses is that most studies assumed that there was no competitive adsorption which cannot be neglected when modeling trace organic removal in gac filters under field conditions knappe et al 1997 graham et al 2000 trace organics may be co metabolized in the presence of easily biodegradable primary substrates such as nom since they are unable to solely support the long term microbial growth due to their low concentration but primary substrates such as nom could inhibit trace organic adsorption so it is necessary to consider competitive adsorption the second limitation is that previous models were formulated only based on virgin gac compound transport into the gac is typically represented by both surface diffusion and pore diffusion surface diffusion was considered to be the dominant mechanism on virgin gac liang et al 2007 nie et al 2020 and pore diffusion was therefore typically neglected in previous studies however during biofilm development the gac could be preloaded with nom which greatly reduces the surface diffusion flux sontheimer et al 1988 pore diffusion would become dominant in the presence of significant background nom jarvie et al 2005 thus it is necessary to also consider pore diffusion in the model 3 3 new model for trace organic adsorption and biodegradation prediction based on the above critical review of previous gac mathematical models we propose a new model that can be used to simulate and estimate both the adsorption and biodegradation of trace organics in a gac filter to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first model that combines multi component adsorption and biofilm kinetics to predict the removal of trace organics in a drinking treatment context the basic assumptions of the proposed model are 1 there is only axial dispersion for the liquid phase 2 the gac particles are spherical in shape 3 suspended microbial growth in the liquid phase is negligible 4 the biofilm covering the outer layer of the gac particles is homogeneous so that its density thickness and porosity are constant 5 biological growth is limited by the availability of the substrate only 6 intraparticle mass transport is governed by both surface and pore diffusion 7 local equilibrium exists throughout the adsorbent 8 biomass loss is mainly due to biofilm decay and shear loss by fluid shear the detailed procedure for deriving model equations is shown in text s3 eq s1 s35 in the si the mass balance for compound i in the liquid phase in a multi solute system can be described by an advection dispersion equation eq 26 similar to that used in previous models i e eq 4 however in previous models the transport of only the compound of interest was considered whereas the model we propose can be applied to both the target compound and the equivalent background compounds ebc which is a fictive component that represents the entire background of competitive adsorbates to compete for adsorption sites with the target compound graham et al 2000 applied the ebc approach to simulate the competitive adsorption between ebc and geosmin and mib the authors found that the initial concentration of ebc was approximately 0 45 of toc concentration however different trace organics have different ebcs thus ebc concentration should be determined for specific trace organic 26 s i t d z i 2 s i z 2 v z s i z 3 1 ε r p l f 2 ε

presence of easily biodegradable primary substrates i e a fraction of nom in practice a pseudo mono component approach can be applied to determine the mass transfer coefficient d f and biological monod parameters k s and k m a x since the trace organic is the main component and the primary substrates can serve as the background matrix badriyha et al 2003 experiments that determine biological monod parameters k s and k m a x should be conducted under conditions where both nom and the trace organics are present which would enable k s and k m a x to be obtained for both primary substrates and secondary substrates for example the experiments may use natural water e g lake water spiked with trace organics as a growing medium to incubate the microbial culture isolated from the gac it should be noted that such experiments may be challenging since microbes may not easily grow under such nutrient limited conditions since the exact concentration of primary substrates is difficult to determine ebc concentration was used to represent primary substrates concentration which enables determination of the pseudo biological parameters for primary substrates surface and pore diffusion can be expressed as eq 35 different from the previous models this model considers both surface and pore diffusion for the solute transport into gac considering both diffusion mechanisms can benefit the simulation of different operation stages since it was reported that surface diffusion is dominant for virgin gac the early stage of gac operation liang et al 2007 and pore diffusion is dominant for preloaded gac the late stage of gac operation carter and weber 1994 35 t q i ε p ρ c s p i 1 r 2 r r 2 d s i q i r r 2 d p i ε p ρ c s p i r the initial and boundary conditions for eq 35 are shown in

should be conducted using ultrapure water and nom containing water to determine k and n values for the trace organic and ebc respectively wang et al 2021 recently defined a term called dissolved organic matter adsorbability to quantify the competitiveness of low molecular weight nom competitors to trace organics moreover desorption should be modeled if the trace organic occurs only periodically such as seasonal geosmin and mib it is important to determine accurate isotherm parameters for preloaded gac since both desorption rate and quantity are affected by the isotherm values

eq 39 uses the ebc concentration to represent the primary substrates concentration and the previously determined pseudo biological parameters μ m a x and k s can be used as correction factors to

this model can better simulate gac long term operation the current paper only presents a new model that may provide a better simulation of gac filters however more additional work is needed to determine the accurate values of the model parameters based on that further research is needed to verify and calibrate the proposed model 4 conclusions and perspectives this article critically reviews the two main tools that can contribute to a better understanding of adsorption and biodegradation of trace organics in gac filters parallel column tests and mathematical models previous parallel column tests showed that the relative importance of adsorption and biodegradation in gac varies significantly but adsorption was found to be the dominant removal mechanism for trace organics in most cases a meta analysis showed that toc concentration and ebct could significantly affect the relative role of adsorption in gac but none of the factors significantly impacted the relative role of biodegradation in gac the review also highlighted that the most important model parameters were those related to biological growth i e k s μ m a x k m a x and l f m a x techniques should be developed to better characterize these parameters and optimize their values in this review we identified several limitations for the two tools 1 using biological non adsorbing media in the test might lead to non representative extents of biodegradation 2 sterilization methods may not effectively inhibit biological activity and may affect adsorption 3 using virgin gac coated with biofilm could overestimate adsorption 4 the potential biofilm detachment during the experiment could lead to biased results 5 the parallel column test approach itself is not universally applicable 6 competitive adsorption was neglected by the previous models 7 the model formulation was based on virgin gac only for improvement we proposed three alternative experimental approaches gamma irradiation minicolumn test and compound specific isotope analysis and a new mathematical model to quantify and predict the overall performance and relative contributions of adsorption and biodegradation of trace organics in a gac

16335,drinking water treatment plants use granular activated carbon gac to adsorb and remove trace organics but the gac has a limited lifetime in terms of adsorptive capacity and needs to be replaced before it is exhausted biological degradation of target contaminants can also occur in gac filters which might allow the gac to remain in service longer than expected however gac biofiltration remains poorly understood and unpredictable to increase the understanding of adsorption and biodegradation in gac previous studies have conducted parallel column tests that use one column of gac potentially biologically active to assess overall removal via both adsorption and biodegradation and one column with either sterilized gac or biological non adsorbing media to assess adsorption or biodegradation alone mathematical models have also been established to give insight into the adsorption and biodegradation processes in gac in this review the experimental and modeling approaches and results used to distinguish between the role of adsorption and biodegradation were summarized and critically discussed we identified several limitations 1 using biological non adsorbing media in column tests might lead to non representative extents of biodegradation 2 sterilization methods may not effectively inhibit biological activity and may affect adsorption 3 using virgin gac coated with biofilm could

granular activated carbon gac is a common treatment method to remove trace organics i e organic compounds with a typical concentration at ng l to μg l level in drinking water treatment plants over time the adsorption capacity of gac is reduced due to the loading of natural organic matter nom and the trace organics themselves with the gac eventually becoming saturated yu et al 2009 for example many utilities in the great lakes region install gac to remove taste and odor compounds that are associated with seasonal algal blooms particularly geosmin and 2 methylisoborneoal mib for such taste and odor control gac bed life was expected to be less than eighteen months even when the filter at an empty bed contact time ebct of 20 min was periodically exposed to low ng l of mib in source water gillogly et al 1999 since algal blooms are periodic it is difficult to track performance degradation in real time utilities typically replace gac based on a calendar schedule or the gac testing characteristics such as iodine number uniformity coefficient effective size and abrasion resistance however none of these methods could be able to determine an accurate remaining life of an existing gac filter in terms of geosmin and mib removal which might lead to either unnecessary costs due to too frequent gac replacement or plant vulnerability if replacement is not in time to address this issue huang et al 2019 conducted a survey using pilot scale column tests to evaluate the performance of gac for geosmin and mib removal at a number of treatment plants in ontario canada the authors observed that gac that had been left in service for more than five years i e beyond the expected lifetime of two years in this region could still achieve significant decreases in geosmin concentrations hereafter referred to as removal i e 70 in some locations while the gac performance deteriorated somewhat over the first year it remained relatively unchanged thereafter one hypothesis for the sustained performance is that the previously adsorbed contaminants were desorbed and subsequently degraded by microorganisms that grow on carbon surface thus partially regenerating the in service gac an alternative hypothesis is that biodegradation becomes an alternative mechanism responsible for geosmin removal in gac termed biofiltration when the adsorptive capacity of the gac is near exhaustion the conversion of gac from solely an adsorption process to gac biofiltration could potentially extend the gac service time avoiding costly replacement however biological processes in gac remain poorly understood and are not predictable hindering their intentional utilization to prolong gac lifetime and maximize contaminant removal in gac filters a number of previous studies have attempted to understand the biological processes in gac using alternative biological activity parameters including phospholipid measurement wang et al 1995 biomass respiration potential urfer and huck 2001 adenosine triphosphate atp magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 and enzyme activity mckie et al 2020 however it is difficult to establish a direct relationship between biological activity parameters and the contaminant biodegradation in gac filters since contaminant removal in gac might be due to both adsorption and biodegradation to address this issue and differentiate between adsorption and biodegradation in gac previous studies have used parallel column tests in which a bench bed depth 40 cm or pilot scale bed depth 40 cm column of gac is tested for overall contaminant removal via both adsorption and biodegradation and the other parallel column uses either sterilized gac to evaluate adsorption alone or biological non adsorbing media to evaluate biodegradation alone e g persson et al 2007 wang et al 2007 ma et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2019 however such parallel column tests have arguably employed experimental approaches or techniques that are not without potential problems making it difficult to conclusively distinguish between the relative contributions of adsorption and biodegradation to contaminant removal for example persson et al 2007 investigated the fate of geosmin and mib using gac and biologically active crushed expanded clay filters both adsorption and biodegradation were considered to take place in the gac filter while only biodegradation was expected in the crushed expanded clay filter however the different surface characteristics between the media might have led to different amounts and composition of microbial community magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 resulting in different levels of biodegradation shimabuku et al 2019 autoclaved gac to hinder biodegradation of mib however autoclaving may alter the chemical and physical properties of gac shaw et al 1999 thus affecting adsorption in addition to parallel column tests a number of mathematical models have been established to give insight into adsorption and biodegradation processes in gac and help predict performance under typical operational conditions of empty bed contact time ebct dissolved organic carbon doc level and water temperature e g kim and pirbazari 1989 badriyha et al 2003 liang et al 2007 existing models to date cannot accurately predict contaminant removal in field scale gac filters due to unrealistic model assumptions for instance badriyha et al 2003 assumed that there was no competitive adsorption between nom and alachlor when modeling alachlor removal in gac filters however under field conditions the competitive adsorption between alachlor and nom in natural water cannot be neglected knappe et al 1997 graham et al 2000 moreover model parameter values may not be accurate thus resulting in biased model simulation results for example modeling studies e g kim and pirbazari 1989 badriyha et al 2003 estimated the film diffusion coefficient k f using empirical correlations but such correlations are not universally applicable and have constraints for the reynolds number and the schmidt number in fixed bed reactors sontheimer et al 1988 and consequently may lead to inaccurate k f values parallel column tests and mathematical models are complementary to each other parallel column tests can contribute to the verification and calibration of mathematical models and the mathematical models can quickly establish the optimum experimental conditions for parallel column tests and eliminate the need for time consuming and labor intensive lab trials however they must be improved to become useful tools to develop guidelines for optimum gac operation in the field the objective of this article is to critically review previous parallel column tests and modeling approaches highlighting their limitations and proposing improvements for future studies the search strategy and study eligibility criteria are described in detail in text s1 in the supplementary information si 2 parallel column tests for distinguishing biodegradation and adsorption in gac 2 1 lessons learned from parallel column tests parallel column tests can help distinguish between the contributions of contaminant adsorption and biodegradation in gac as shown in table 1 the tests have typically involved one column containing gac under normal conditions a control and the other containing either non adsorbing media to isolate biodegradation or sterilized media to isolate adsorption the non adsorbing media may be glass beads sand or anthracite which can support biofilm attachment and growth the sterilized media may be gac that has been either baked at 250 c autoclaved or sterilized with sodium azide to limit microbial growth it is important to note that a number of previous studies e g rattier et al 2012 piai et al 2020 also conducted parallel batch tests to differentiate between adsorption and biodegradation in gac however batch tests do not fully represent gac in field conditions in water treatment plants where gac is installed in fixed bed reactors batch tests are therefore not discussed in this review as shown in table 1 these studies have selected target compounds that can be both adsorbed and biodegraded e g geosmin and mib in most cases trace organics that have adverse effects on the environment or human health were chosen as compounds of interest however trace organics alone may not support long term microbial cell growth due to their low concentrations or periodic occurrences namkung and rittmann 1987 several strategies have been applied to maintain and promote microbial activity one strategy is to add additional nutrients or easily biodegradable compounds such as p hydroxybenzoic acid into the influent chang and rittmann 1987b liang et al 2003 another strategy is to use ozonation as a pretreatment to form easily biodegradable intermediates including carboxylic acids and low molecular weight aliphatic aldehydes urfer et al 1997 liang et al 2003 gac filters are not operated at steady state which may affect the relative importance of adsorption and biodegradation for a virgin gac adsorption is the dominant removal mechanism the adsorption capacity of the gac decreases with time until all accessible adsorption sites are occupied while the biodegradation ability of the gac increases with time to reach a steady state after a bioacclimation process at this stage biodegradation may become the dominant removal mechanism to evaluate this dynamic process some studies e g chang and rittmann 1987b zhang et al 1991 wang et al 2007 used virgin gac and ran the tests for an extended period of time e g 20 000 bed volumes until the biological removal efficiency i e in sand column or bac column reached a stead state value and recorded the contaminant breakthrough curve to track the progression of adsorption and biodegradation in gac during the whole experiment period alternately other studies e g persson et al 2007 ma et al 2018 used preloaded gac and ran the tests for a short period of time e g 2000 bed volumes and recorded only several breakthrough points to understand the current conditions of adsorption and biodegradation in the gac fig 1 summarizes the reported removal efficiencies i e percent concentration decreases due to adsorption or biodegradation compared to overall removal efficiencies i e adsorption biodegradation in gac for each target compound evaluated in the studies this figure excludes some data points in the studies that spiked high concentrations at the mg l level of contaminants in the experiments chang and rittmann 1987b zhang et al 1991 liang et al 2003 li et al 2008 or only monitored general parameters such as doc uv254 and dissolved oxygen do reaume et al 2015 since the transferability of such results to gac application for trace organic removal may be limited for some studies that recorded the whole breakthrough curves during the experiments e g wang et al 2007 zhiteneva et al 2020 only the data points 20 000 bed volumes for which the biological removal efficiency e g biological sand column reaches a steady state value were included it is important to note that the observed overall removal in gac is not necessarily equal to the sum of observed adsorption efficiency in sterilized gac and observed biodegradation efficiency in biological non adsorbing media for example persson et al 2007 observed 97 overall removal of geosmin in a gac column potentially biologically active due to both adsorption and biodegradation 97 removal in a sterile gac column presumably due to adsorption alone and 88 removal in a sand column presumably due to biodegradation alone thus it is not appropriate to directly deduct the observed adsorption efficiency in sterilized gac or biodegradation efficiency in biological non adsorbing media from the overall removal efficiency in gac to estimate the corresponding biodegradation or adsorption in gac a preliminary meta analysis of the reported removal efficiencies of each individual test in previous studies was conducted here to assess the relative importance of adsorption and biodegradation in gac as shown in fig 1 a adsorption was the prevailing removal mechanism i e the ratio of adsorption efficiency to overall removal is greater than 50 in most cases this may be because gac has a large number of micropores and mesopores providing a large adsorption capacity for the target compounds newcombe et al 1997 for example persson et al 2007 evaluated geosmin and mib adsorption and biodegradation using a 4 year old gac and observed a similar phenomenon adsorption dominated geosmin and mib removal in contrast fig 1 b shows that biodegradation efficiency i e removal in non adsorbing columns is relatively minor compared to the overall removal of compounds in the control columns this may be because most of the selected compounds are recalcitrant to biodegradation however several studies did observe both high biodegradation efficiency and high overall removal efficiency these were studies that employed easily biodegradable contaminants e g fluoxetine ma et al 2018 a long ebct e g 30 min persson et al 2007 or a long biological acclimation time e g 7 months wang et al 2007 as shown in fig 1 the relative importance of adsorption and biodegradation in gac can vary significantly this variability might depend on a variety of factors including compound type water quality characteristics or typical filter design parameters ma et al 2018 thus a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the significance of a specific factor s effect on the relative quantity of adsorption or biodegradation in gac at the 95 confidence level shown in text s2 in the si the factors selected include the octanol water partition coefficient logkow the biodegradability value biowin 6 i e the probability of rapid aerobic biodegradation estimated using the epi suitetm biowin v4 10 miti nonlinear model with a detailed explanation in text s2 total organic carbon toc concentration ebct and gac particle size we found that the relative extent of adsorption in gac was significantly increased at higher toc concentration coefficient 0 011 p value 0 025 and longer ebct coefficient 0 0070 p value 0 016 however none of factors were identified to significantly affect the relative extent of biodegradation in gac the results of regression analysis are shown in table s2 please note that the ratio of adsorption or biodegradation to the overall contaminant removal may also depend on other factors such as initial concentrations water background matrices competitive adsorbates carbon surface chemistry and the loading of activated carbon however not all of these parameters were included in the previous studies and none of these parameters were kept constant this meta analysis is not comprehensive and includes data from not full controlled experiments and may therefore not provide an unbiased evaluation more research should be conducted in the future 2 2 limitations of parallel column tests there are several potential limitations to the previously described parallel column tests that make it difficult to accurately distinguish adsorption from biodegradation in gac the most common problem is that biological non adsorbing media such as glass beads crushed expanded clay sand or anthracite e g chang and rittmann 1987b persson et al 2007 wang et al 2007 ma et al 2018 have been used in parallel to a gac potentially biologically active column despite exhibiting different surface characteristics biofilm community and biomass amounts potentially resulting in non comparable biodegradation shimabuku et al 2019 the second potential problem is related to the effectiveness of sterilization and its effect on gac adsorption characteristics e g sbardella et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2019 for example sodium azide might inactivate only certain microbial species but other species might use alternative routes of energy supply such as bypassing atp synthesis rattier et al 2012 moreover the methods that suppress biodegradation may impact adsorption it was reported that sodium azide might increase the ionic strength of the water sample thus decreasing the adsorption of ionic compounds lotrario et al 1995 baking at 250 c or autoclaving may reactivate gac and increase its adsorption capacity shaw et al 1999 thus future research should evaluate the effectiveness of inactivation methods and their effect on adsorption third some experiments liang et al 2003 li et al 2008 used virgin gac coated with a biofilm in practice the adsorption capacity of gac may be partially saturated before a biofilm develops since nom can block or occupy gac pores during long acclimation periods thus when virgin gac is directly coated with a biofilm for experimental purposes the resulting gac would have a higher adsorption capacity than in practice fourth the effect of biofilm on adsorption has not been investigated some microbes and their metabolic macromolecular products in the biofilm could increase the film resistance and block the pore openings on the carbon surface thus reducing the adsorption compared to virgin gac stewart 2003 rattier et al 2012 sharaf and liu 2021 experimental approaches using a high contaminant concentration e g 500 mg l li et al 2008 or long exposure to sodium azide e g 44 months persson et al 2007 might have resulted in detachment of the biofilm from the carbon surface and resulted in a larger adsorption potential than in the initial conditions fifth the parallel column test approach itself may not accurately estimate the relative contributions of adsorption and biodegradation in gac for example the mass of compounds adsorbed in the sterilized gac column might be larger than that actually adsorbed in the gac column in the gac column when an easily biodegradable compound passes through the biofilm it may be biodegraded to a large extent leaving only a limited quantity that can diffuse into pores and eventually be adsorbed however in the sterilized gac column all of the compound could diffuse into pores without being biodegraded resulting in a larger amount of compounds that can be adsorbed than that in the gac column 2 3 suggestions for improvements three potential experimental techniques designed to overcome the above mentioned limitations are proposed to differentiate adsorption from biodegradation in parallel column tests gamma irradiation minicolumn test and compound specific isotope analysis 2 3 1 gamma irradiation the typical approaches that eliminate bacterial activity e g adding sodium azide baking at 250 c or autoclaving may alter the adsorptive characteristics of gac gamma irradiation is reported to be able to sterilize gac with a minimal effect on these characteristics lotrario et al 1995 during inactivation gac is suspended in a water filled bottle that is exposed to gamma rays where highly reactive compounds such as hydroxyl radicals protons and hydrated electrons are formed modifying the dna rna and protein structure of organisms in the biofilm thornley 1963 zhao et al 1999 irradiated both virgin gac and biofilm covered gac by gamma rays at a dose of 20 kgy and found that the adsorption capacity of the two gacs did not change an important consideration for gamma irradiation is the selection of the optimum irradiation dose a high dose e g 20 kgy may lead to a radiolytic decomposition of oxygen complexes on the carbon surface thus increasing the carbon pore size el shobaky et al 1987 but a low dose e g 5 kgy may result in incomplete inactivation of biological activity stoquart et al 2013 stoquart et al 2013 demonstrated that an irradiation dose of 10 to 15 kgy could effectively inactivate microbial activity without affecting the adsorption of methylene blue however methylene blue is an ionic compound whose adsorption might be governed by electrostatic force instead of hydrophobic force which is considered the dominant mechanism for the adsorption of trace organics in gac rattier et al 2012 thus it is still unknown whether gamma irradiation would impact trace organic adsorption moreover since gamma irradiation is expensive and not widely available an important first step is to compare the efficiency of gamma irradiation with that of other common sterilization and inactivation methods based on which a cost effective method can be selected 2 3 2 minicolumn test the minicolumn test is a bench scale approach developed by gillogly et al 1999 to evaluate the removal of a contaminant in preloaded gac the term minicolumn comes from the fact that its dimensions 1 cm bed depth 1 1 cm internal diameter aspect ratio 1 1 are smaller than the typical parallel column tests described above 5 100 cm depth 1 5 9 53 cm in diameter aspect ratio 1 2 1 40 table 1 the original design figure s1 consists of small volume glass columns packed with a size representative fraction of a core gac sample collected from a full scale gac contactor and spiked with the target compounds and it is conducted at the same ebct as that of the full scale contactors a major advance with this test is that it requires less gac and water e g 30 g gac and 20 l water as opposed to up to 1355 g gac and 57 000 l water in previous tests table 1 which reduces the burden of labor intensive gac and water sampling from full scale gac contactors the minicolumn test duration is typically 1 3 days as opposed to 5 486 days in previous parallel column tests table 1 which may preserve the integrity and composition of biofilm and decrease the possibility of the biofilm detachment from the gac surface during the experiment additionally the minicolumn test uses gac directly harvested from an existing filter i e naturally preloaded gac thus better simulating the field gac potentially biologically active this is different from the previous column tests that use virgin gac under artificially controlled experimental conditions to examine the progression of the extent of adsorption and biodegradation in gac during the experiment gillogly et al 1999 validated the minicolumn tests by showing that a near identical breakthrough of mib could be obtained in the minicolumns compared to that in pilot scale columns which presumably represent the performance of full scale gac contactors huang et al 2019 further confirmed the validity of the minicolumn test approach under more conditions different gac types and ages different water matrices yuan et al 2021 later experimentally verified the key requirement of this test the gac bed must have a broad mass transfer zone for the target compounds additionally nie et al 2020 tested the effect of bed depth flow velocity column diameter particle size distribution temperature on the minicolumn test results using the pore and surface diffusion model and provided a theoretical validation of the minicolumn approach the minicolumn test can be used as a suitable tool to compare the performance of naturally preloaded gac potentially biologically active harvested from water treatment plants and that of sterilized gac which enables the differentiation between adsorption and biodegradation in gac it is important to note that the minicolumn test is different from the other well known laboratory test the rapid small scale column test rssct in an rssct a small column e g 10 cm bed depth and 3 74 mm internal diameter aspect ratio 1 30 is used to simulate the breakthrough profile of a full scale adsorber using a scaled down ebct and ground virgin gac crittenden et al 1986 1987a the scaling relationship between the ebct of the rssct and that of the full scale gac contactor can be determined based on eq 1 crittenden et al 1991 1 e b c t s c e b c t l c r s c 2 r l c 2 d s l c d s s c β t s c t l c however the rssct can be applied for only virgin gac since grinding preloaded gac may open pores blocked by background nom and lead to a higher adsorption capacity knappe et al 1999 the majority of biological gac is naturally preloaded with nom since nom can block or occupy the gac pores during microbial acclimation and growth in this case the nom loading might increase biodegradation in gac by stimulating microbial growth due to greater availability of food sources while nom fouling could decrease adsorption in gac by reducing both the adsorption capacity and rate it can be argued that rsscts might be an alternative way to differentiate adsorption and biodegradation in gac since its short experimental time may not be sufficient for biological acclimation and consequently enables observation of only adsorption in gac for example zhiteneva et al 2020 conducted rsscts in parallel to a biological gac column to determine the contribution of adsorption for selected chemicals in gac however there is potentially a risk here in that the contribution of biodegradation to contaminant removal cannot be strictly eliminated under such conditions since the feedwater may also contain some bacteria which can degrade contaminants additionally rsscts may overestimate the adsorption capacity of gac since less nom fouling may be present in the pulverized gac corwin and summers 2010 thus it is argued that the minicolumn test is a more suitable tool to evaluate the gac performance 2 3 3 compound specific isotope analysis compound specific isotope analysis csia is a promising method with the potential to distinguish adsorption from biodegradation in a single gac column test it is based on the natural abundance of different stable isotopes in compounds and does not involve the use of labelled compounds the isotope ratio r is the ratio of heavy to light stable isotopes of an element x in eq 2 in a compound e g 13c 12c 15n 14n 2h 1h while the absolute abundance of the heavy isotope e g 13c 15n 2h cannot be measured with great precision the difference in isotope ratio between two compounds can be determined with high accuracy mckinney et al 1950 a common convention for expressing r is to use δ notation by comparing the isotope ratio in a sample rsample to the isotope ratio in an international standard rstandard expressed in mur corresponding to the ratio reported as parts per thousand eq 2 2 δ h x r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 due to differences in activation energies chemical bonds involving a heavy isotope e g 13c 1h tend to break more slowly than those exclusively containing light isotopes e g 12c 1h during bond breaking e g via biodegradation the residual compound pool becomes enriched in heavy isotopes this phenomenon in which the isotope ratio changes in the course of a given reaction mechanism is referred to as isotope fractionation adsorption which is a non degradative process i e no bond breaking does not involve significant isotope fractionation harrington et al 1999 slater et al 2000 thus leading the isotope ratio unchanged thus whereas a decrease in compound concentration in a gac filter can only indicate overall removal a concurrent significant enrichment in heavy isotope can provide direct evidence that biodegradation dominates over adsorption these concepts are reviewed with practical applications in hunkeler et al 2009 and are applied widely for traditional groundwater contaminants and more recently for emerging organic contaminants elsner et al 2005 elsner and imfeld 2016 before wide application there are several prerequisites first methods must be developed and validated for each substance second the extent and reproducibility of isotope fractionation much be quantified for a given compound for each expected degradative and non degradative reaction mechanism and pathway in controlled laboratory conditions in some cases isotope effects can be masked by rate limiting steps other than bond cleavage e g cell uptake transport in the cell binding to the enzyme which should be investigated before accurate interpretation of field data can be made nijenhuis and richnow 2016 multi element isotope analysis is often required to distinguish reaction mechanisms if multiple mechanisms are expected simultaneously ojeda et al 2020 mariotti et al 1981 proposed the rayleigh model which correlates the change in the isotope ratio to the biodegradation efficiency eq 3 shown for carbon 3 α 1 l n f b i o l n δ 13 c r e s i d u a l 1000 1 δ 13 c o r i g i n a l 1000 1 the isotope fractionation or enrichment ε α 1 factors represent the extent of isotope fractionation for a specific contaminant during degradation mariotti et al 1981 they can be estimated from fitting the rayleigh model to data obtained in laboratory degradation experiments the determination of ε could make it possible to assess the extent of biodegradation in gac filters by measuring the isotope ratios in filter influent and effluent thus allowing to estimate the relative importance of biodegradation and adsorption in gac filters the main caveat for the wide application of csia to trace organics such as mib and geosmin is the high detection limits of isotope ratio mass spectrometers however recent advances in sampling techniques sample preparation and isotope analytical chemistry elsner and imfled 2016 bakkour et al 2018 torrentó et al 2019 showed promising results for the application of csia to this new field in addition to csia the use of 14c labeled compounds may also allow differentiation between adsorption and biodegradation in gac by tracking the radioactivity in water solid and gas phases for example betsholtz et al 2021 estimated the contributions of biodegradation in gac by tracking the formation of 14co2 however the applied method can only demonstrate the biodegradation of contaminants through mineralization but neglects the biodegradation of contaminants through biotransformation which could be considered as major pathways for micropollutant biodegradation badriyha et al 2003 3 mathematical models for simulating adsorption and biodegradation in gac 3 1 general approach ideally an accurate mathematical model would be able to predict gac performance over its service life under specific operating conditions this would then allow the model user to identify conditions that maximize contaminant removal and possibly also enhance the gac service life several models table 2 have been developed to describe the gac system based on four major processes including diffusion through a liquid film diffusion and biodegradation within the biofilm diffusion into pores and adsorption and biofilm growth and loss shown in fig 2 as shown in table 2 the models that have been developed to date have typically simulated two types of reactors for the gac fixed bed reactors and completely stirred tank reactors cstr while three studies prior to 1992 describe adsorption and biodegradation processes in gac based on a cstr more recent studies have switched to model the gac processes based on a more realistic fixed bed reactor the gac system has been described using up to four mechanisms dispersion advection adsorption and biodegradation mass balances of a compound in three phases liquid biofilm and solid and biomass in the biofilm were established to formulate model equations since differential equations in the models cannot be directly solved using analytical solutions several numerical approaches were applied including the orthogonal collocation method the finite difference method using the crank nicholson scheme and the hybrid method the orthogonal collocation method employs a trial function expansion such as legendre or jacobi s polynomials to get numerical approximations to solutions villadsen and stewart 1967 the finite difference method is an approach that solves differential equations by approximating them with difference equations where finite differences approximate the derivatives however for a gac mathematical model which consists of several partial differential equations applying only either orthogonal collocation or the finite difference method may not be computationally efficient kim and pirbazari 1989 thus a hybrid numerical procedure that involves both orthogonal collocation and finite difference methods has been developed and applied in several studies kim and pirbazari 1989 ravindran et al 1997 badriyha et al 2003 sinel nikova et al 2012 in this approach a number of dimensionless groups were used to characterize the gac reactors table 3 which can represent the relative importance of each mass transport mechanism the first 4 parameters in table 3 sh bis bip and b i describe the diffusion of a compound in reactors the sherwood number sh represents a ratio of liquid film transport to biofilm dispersion badriyha et al 2003 a high sh value means that liquid film resistance is not important in other words the difference between the compound concentration in bulk liquid and that at the biofilm surface is negligible the original biot number represents either the ratio of liquid film diffusion to intraparticle surface diffusion bis or the ratio of liquid film diffusion to intraparticle pore diffusion bip to take the biofilm on gac surface into account a modified biot number b i was proposed representing the ratio of biofilm diffusion to intraparticle surface diffusion çeçen and aktaş 2012 if b i is low the diffusion through biofilm is lower than the diffusion on carbon surface the péclet number pe shows the ratio of advective transport to diffusive transport when pe is close to zero the reactor behaves in a completely mixed regime conversely when pe approaches infinity the reactor can be considered as a plug flow reactor crittenden et al 1986 the stanton number st represents the comparison between liquid film transport and advective transport crittenden et al 1987a if the st value is high liquid film transport is dominant a certain minimum value of st must be maintained to ensure that a bioadsorber does not undergo channeling without adequate film transfer badriyha et al 2003 the solute distribution number dg a ratio of solid phase loading to liquid phase loading depends on adsorption capacity friedman 1984 a larger value of dg means a greater affinity of an adsorbate for the adsorbent the damköhler number da compares the biological reaction rate to that of the mass transfer processes including advection or liquid film dispersion kleijin et al 1996 a low da value indicates that biodegradation is a rate limiting factor 3 2 lessons learned from previous models among the models listed in table 2 seven models speitel et al 1987 kim and pirbazari 1989 ravindran et al 1997 badriyha et al 2003 liang et al 2007 sinel nikova et al 2012 alonso et al 2021 provide the most comprehensive descriptions of physical and biological phenomena occurring in gac filters and are therefore critically reviewed below thus the focus of the following section is to discuss the seven models in detail providing useful information for gac operation and future model development these models have described the compound mass balances in three different phases liquid biofilm and solid along with biofilm thickness variations using eq 4 to 7 respectively 4 s t d z 2 s z 2 v z s z 3 1 ε r p l f 2 ε r p 3 k f s s s 5 s f t d f 2 s f r 2 k

to model the diffusion of a compound in both the liquid film and the biofilm the transport of a compound in the solid phase was considered to be dominated by surface diffusion and the adsorption equilibrium was described by the freundlich eq 8 or langmuir eq 9 isotherms additionally the monod equation was used to describe the biodegradation in the biofilm monod 1949 the adsorption isotherm parameters biofilm parameters biochemical kinetic parameters and mass transfer parameters might affect the model outputs the values of the isotherm parameters k and 1 n q m and k l were typically estimated based on experimental data of isotherm tests however several potential problems associated with the previous isotherm tests may make it impossible to obtain accurate isotherm parameters for example some modeling studies e g badriyha et al 2003 liang et al 2007 sinel nikova et al 2012 failed to demonstrate the attainment of the real equilibrium in the isotherm test possibly resulting in inaccurate isotherm parameters for the model simulation thus it is essential to conduct a well designed isotherm test 8 q k s 1 n 9 q q m k l s 1 k l s biofilm parameters maximum biofilm thickness l f m a x and biofilm density x f were determined experimentally previous studies used two methods to estimate l f m a x the first method is based on bed expansion due to biofilm growth eq 10 alonso et al 2021 however it is difficult to accurately measure the bed expansion volume δ v since the bed volume change due to biofilm growth is almost negligible in drinking water treatment the second method is based on the biofilm water content eq 11 law et al 1975 a typical approach for determining the water weight in biofilm was to randomly select several hundreds of carbon particles from a gac bed and measure the weight difference before and after drying them at 103 c for 48 h badriyha et al 2003 subsequently r w a weight ratio of water to biofilm including water was used to approximate biofilm weight which enables calculation of l f m a x based on the experimentally determined l f m a x biofilm density x f was calculated using eq 12 kim and pirbazari 1989 however drying the gac with a temperature less than 150 c may not completely remove the water within the carbon pores thus leading to misinterpretations in the biofilm mass additionally previous studies e g kim and pirbazari 1989 set an arbitrary value at 99 for r w without confirming it experimentally which might result in biased l f m a x and x f values 10 l f m a x δ v n p 4 π r p 2 11 l f m a x w e ρ l n w a p r w 12 x f b w n w a p l f m a x biochemical kinetic parameters include the monod constants μ m a x and k s the yield coefficient y and the overall biofilm loss coefficient b the values of the biochemical kinetic parameters were typically determined by experiments a stock solution of target compounds was fed to continuous flow reactors seeded with a microbial culture during the experiment samples were periodically collected to determine the compound concentration s t the data were modelled to obtain estimates for k s and μ m a x from eq 13 by plotting x f t s 0 s t against 1 s t and for y and b from eq 14 by plotting 1 t against s 0 s t x f t 13 x f t s 0 s t k s μ m a x 1 s t 1 μ m a x 14 1 t y s 0 s t x f t b mass transfer parameters including axial diffusivity d z film diffusion coefficient k f liquid diffusivity d l biofilm diffusivity d f and surface diffusivity d s were typically estimated using empirical correlations to determine d z chung and wen 1968 developed a correlation that relates the modified reynolds number r e and the galibeo number g a eq 15 15 d z μ l r e ρ l x 0 02 0 01 r e 0 48 16 x r e r e 17 r e 2 r p v z ρ l μ l ε 18 r e 33 7 2 0 0408 g a 1 2

1978 eq 20 however it is often difficult to obtain an accurate k f value for preloaded gac potentially biologically active due to the complexity of gac topography and nom fouling yu et al 2009 additionally there is limited range of validity for the empirical correlations it was therefore recommended that k f be experimentally determined yuan et al 2020 20 s h 2 0 644 r e 0 5 s c 1 3 for 3 r

of hayduk and laudie 1974 eq 24 a ratio of d f d l 0 8 was typically used to estimate the value of d f williamson and mccarty 1976 d s could be estimated based on its relationship with d l crittenden et al 1987b eq 25 some studies kim and pirbazari 1989 badriyha et al 2003 also determined d s by conducting completely mixed batch experiments 24 d l 13 26 10 5 μ l 1 14 v b 0 589 25 d s ε p d l s o τ p ρ c q 0 s p d f r previous studies have verified the predictive capability of the models by comparing the model simulation results with the experimental results four studies kim and pirbazari 1989 ravindran et al 1997 badriyha et al 2003 liang et al 2007 have shown that model predictions were typically in good agreement with the experimental data of both non bioactive and bioactive adsorbers indicating that the gac mathematical models are powerful tools to understand the behavior of the gac filters under conditions similar to their experiments however the other three studies speitel et al 1987 sinel nikova et al 2012 alonso et al 2021 observed some discrepancies between modeled and experimental data speitel etal 1987 and sinel nikova et al 2012 calibrated the model by adjusting the model parameters to fit the experimental data and found that overall biofilm loss coefficient b and biofilm density x f played an important role as a correcting factor alonso et al 2021 explained that the pseudo first order adsorption model used may not adequately describe the adsorption kinetics during the initial stage of gac filter operation thus resulting in the poor fit of model it should also be noted that the model verification greatly depends on the quality of the experimental data the previous modeling studies typically conducted parallel column tests that used gac and biological non adsorbing media sand or anthracite columns to verify their models however different microbial communities might settle in sorptive and non sorptive media to address this issue future modeling studies may need to conduct an alternative type of parallel tests which use gac and sterilized gac columns model sensitivity analysis can assess the effect of varying the value of a selected model parameter on the model output which enables identification of key parameters that profoundly affect gac performance and provides information regarding process adjustment to enhance efficiency the previous studies ravindran et al 1997 badriyha et al 2003 liang and chiang 2007 have selected the following model parameters for the sensitivity analysis mass transfer coefficients k f d z d f d s biological rate coefficients y k s μ m a x k m a x maximum biofilm thickness l f m a x and adsorption isotherm parameters k 1 n as a result there was general agreement on the significant effect of biological parameters k s μ m a x k m a x and l f m a x and insignificant effect of adsorption mass transfer parameters k f d z d s on simulated effluent concentration curves ravindran et al 1997 badriyha et al 2003 liang and chiang 2007 however there were contrasting results regarding the sensitivity of model simulation to adsorption isotherm parameters k and 1 n and biofilm diffusivity d f ravindran et al 1997 reported that simulated gac performance was insensitive to k and 1 n while badriyha et al 2003 observed that k and 1 n had a significant impact on compound removal during the initial operation stage but the effect became less significant as the effluent concentration became steady state the potential cause for such a discrepancy is the different adsorption characteristics of the selected compounds liang and chiang 2007 found that the variation in d f could significantly affect biodegradation efficiency but both ravindran et al 1997 and badriyha et al 2003 observed the lack of model sensitivity to d f the observed difference may be due to the different biodegradability of the selected target compounds aldehydes and ketoacids selected by liang and chiang 2007 are known to be highly biodegradable schechter and singer 1995 but alachlor used by badriyha et al 2003 is a secondary substrate and can only be biodegraded in the presence of more easily degradable organics wilber and wang 1997 future modeling studies may need to select some representative compounds with different biodegradability to evaluate the model sensitivity to d f the sensitivity analysis showed that biological parameters k s μ m a x k m a x and l f m a x could most significantly affect the gac performance thus several strategies including strain improvement biofilm maintenance and enhancing enzyme activity were proposed for improving these parameters badriyha et al 2003 improving bacteria strains can increase the degradation rate of compounds through enhancing the kinetics of metabolic pathways which can increase μ m a x or k m a x and decrease k s techniques for improving bacteria strains include genome modification of target strain natural recombinant between conjugative plasmids of strains and transferring the gene of interest into a bacterial or fungal host kirisits et al 2019 however such techniques have not been applied in drinking water treatment additional work is needed to further refine those tools maximum biofilm thickness l f m a x should be maintained at an optimum value e g 5 10 μ m to maximize both substrate utilization and mass transfer rates schreyer and coughlin 1999 liang and chiang 2007 approaches for maintaining the biofilm thickness involve employing appropriate media types pre oxidants and backwash frequency and protocols enhancing enzyme activity can greatly increase biodegradation resulting in increased μ m a x or k m a x and decreased k s desirable measures to enhance enzyme activity include supplementing nutrients or adding pre oxidation liang et al 2003 these strategies have already been implemented in some biofilters in north america brown et al 2016 it should be noted that pre oxidation might enhance general enzyme activity but not necessarily the degradation of individual chemicals urfer et al 1997 previous studies have evaluated the effect of a specific factor on adsorption and biodegradation efficiency in gac which provide useful information for future gac operation first the biofilm thickness was closely related to the ratio of adsorption to biodegradation liang and chiang 2007 at the early operation stage when the biofilm coverage is slight adsorption controlled the gac performance as the biofilm thickness increased to half of the maximum thickness adsorption decreased while biodegradation increased liang and chiang 2007 when the biofilm thickness increased to the maximum minimum adsorption and maximum biodegradation occurred this was because the increased biofilm greatly hindered intraparticle diffusion and the increased biomass uptake lowered the driving force for adsorption liang and chiang 2007 based on this observation the biofilm thickness could be used as a potential monitoring parameter to identify the presence of unintentional gac biofiltration compared to the parallel column tests measuring the biofilm thickness is easier to conduct efficient biofilm thickness measurement techniques include x ray computed tomography nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and small angle neutron scattering azeredo et al 2017 second an active biofilm can greatly increase the effective service life for a gac filter with respect to trace organics especially at short ebcts badriyha et al 2003 found that the effective service life for a gac adsorber at a flow rate of 5 mgd short ebct to maintain 80 of alachlor removal would have been increased from 30 000 bed volumes to 65 000 bed volumes if it was converted into a biological filter while a gac adsorber at a flow rate of 1 mgd long ebct would extend its service life from 38 000 bed volumes to 68 000 bed volumes after conversion third decreasing gac particle size significantly increased adsorption efficiency but did not significantly improve the biodegradation efficiency of p hydroxybenzoic acid liang et al 2007 a smaller particle size results in a lower sherwood number sh and damköhler number da indicating a higher mass transfer rate within the biofilm under such conditions the compound can diffuse faster across the biofilm which leads to lower biodegradation and more adsorption onto the gac surface based on this observation selecting finer gac media might contribute to a better utilization of gac adsorption capacity however smaller gac size could also result in increased rates of head loss accumulation and shorter filter run time since fine media promotes rapid clogging of the filter surface graese et al 1987 consequently an appropriate gac size should be selected depending on the site specific conditions such as gac filter dimensions ebct and water quality characteristics previous gac mathematical models have some limitations which make it difficult to predict trace organic removal one of the weaknesses is that most studies assumed that there was no competitive adsorption which cannot be neglected when modeling trace organic removal in gac filters under field conditions knappe et al 1997 graham et al 2000 trace organics may be co metabolized in the presence of easily biodegradable primary substrates such as nom since they are unable to solely support the long term microbial growth due to their low concentration but primary substrates such as nom could inhibit trace organic adsorption so it is necessary to consider competitive adsorption the second limitation is that previous models were formulated only based on virgin gac compound transport into the gac is typically represented by both surface diffusion and pore diffusion surface diffusion was considered to be the dominant mechanism on virgin gac liang et al 2007 nie et al 2020 and pore diffusion was therefore typically neglected in previous studies however during biofilm development the gac could be preloaded with nom which greatly reduces the surface diffusion flux sontheimer et al 1988 pore diffusion would become dominant in the presence of significant background nom jarvie et al 2005 thus it is necessary to also consider pore diffusion in the model 3 3 new model for trace organic adsorption and biodegradation prediction based on the above critical review of previous gac mathematical models we propose a new model that can be used to simulate and estimate both the adsorption and biodegradation of trace organics in a gac filter to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first model that combines multi component adsorption and biofilm kinetics to predict the removal of trace organics in a drinking treatment context the basic assumptions of the proposed model are 1 there is only axial dispersion for the liquid phase 2 the gac particles are spherical in shape 3 suspended microbial growth in the liquid phase is negligible 4 the biofilm covering the outer layer of the gac particles is homogeneous so that its density thickness and porosity are constant 5 biological growth is limited by the availability of the substrate only 6 intraparticle mass transport is governed by both surface and pore diffusion 7 local equilibrium exists throughout the adsorbent 8 biomass loss is mainly due to biofilm decay and shear loss by fluid shear the detailed procedure for deriving model equations is shown in text s3 eq s1 s35 in the si the mass balance for compound i in the liquid phase in a multi solute system can be described by an advection dispersion equation eq 26 similar to that used in previous models i e eq 4 however in previous models the transport of only the compound of interest was considered whereas the model we propose can be applied to both the target compound and the equivalent background compounds ebc which is a fictive component that represents the entire background of competitive adsorbates to compete for adsorption sites with the target compound graham et al 2000 applied the ebc approach to simulate the competitive adsorption between ebc and geosmin and mib the authors found that the initial concentration of ebc was approximately 0 45 of toc concentration however different trace organics have different ebcs thus ebc concentration should be determined for specific trace organic 26 s i t d z i 2 s i z 2 v z s i z 3 1 ε r p l f 2 ε

presence of easily biodegradable primary substrates i e a fraction of nom in practice a pseudo mono component approach can be applied to determine the mass transfer coefficient d f and biological monod parameters k s and k m a x since the trace organic is the main component and the primary substrates can serve as the background matrix badriyha et al 2003 experiments that determine biological monod parameters k s and k m a x should be conducted under conditions where both nom and the trace organics are present which would enable k s and k m a x to be obtained for both primary substrates and secondary substrates for example the experiments may use natural water e g lake water spiked with trace organics as a growing medium to incubate the microbial culture isolated from the gac it should be noted that such experiments may be challenging since microbes may not easily grow under such nutrient limited conditions since the exact concentration of primary substrates is difficult to determine ebc concentration was used to represent primary substrates concentration which enables determination of the pseudo biological parameters for primary substrates surface and pore diffusion can be expressed as eq 35 different from the previous models this model considers both surface and pore diffusion for the solute transport into gac considering both diffusion mechanisms can benefit the simulation of different operation stages since it was reported that surface diffusion is dominant for virgin gac the early stage of gac operation liang et al 2007 and pore diffusion is dominant for preloaded gac the late stage of gac operation carter and weber 1994 35 t q i ε p ρ c s p i 1 r 2 r r 2 d s i q i r r 2 d p i ε p ρ c s p i r the initial and boundary conditions for eq 35 are shown in eq 36 to 38 it should be noted that ebc coupled with the freundlich isotherm approach eq 38 is used to describe the direct competitive adsorption between the trace organic and nom isotherm tests should be conducted using ultrapure water and nom containing water to determine k and n values for the trace organic and ebc respectively wang et al 2021 recently defined a term called dissolved organic matter adsorbability to quantify the competitiveness of low molecular weight nom competitors to trace organics moreover desorption should be modeled if the trace organic occurs only periodically such as seasonal geosmin and mib it is important to determine accurate isotherm parameters for preloaded gac since both desorption rate and quantity are affected by the isotherm values

eq 39 uses the ebc concentration to represent the primary substrates concentration and the previously determined pseudo biological parameters μ m a x and k s can be used as correction factors to correlate the concentration of ebc with that of primary substrates 39 l f t r p r p l f μ m a x i s i k s i s i b d r the initial and boundary conditions for eq 39 are 40 l f t 0 l f 0 41 l f t t 0 l m a x the proposed model is the first biological gac model that considers the competitive adsorption between target trace organics and background compounds as well as pore diffusion in preloaded gac this model can better simulate gac long term operation the current paper only presents a new model that may provide a better simulation of gac filters however more additional work is needed to determine the accurate values of the model parameters based on that further research is needed to verify and calibrate the proposed model 4 conclusions and perspectives this article critically reviews the two main tools that can contribute to a better understanding of adsorption and biodegradation of trace organics in gac filters parallel column tests and mathematical models previous parallel column tests showed that the relative importance of adsorption and biodegradation in gac varies significantly but adsorption was found to be the dominant removal mechanism for trace organics in most cases a meta analysis showed that toc concentration and ebct could significantly affect the relative role of adsorption in gac but none of the factors significantly impacted the relative role of biodegradation in gac the review also highlighted that the most important model parameters were those related to biological growth i e k s μ m a x k m a x and l f m a x techniques should be developed to better characterize these parameters and optimize their values in this review we identified several limitations for the two tools 1 using biological non adsorbing media in the test might lead to non representative extents of biodegradation 2 sterilization methods may not effectively inhibit biological activity and may affect adsorption 3 using virgin gac coated with biofilm could overestimate adsorption 4 the potential biofilm detachment during the experiment could lead to biased results 5 the parallel column test approach itself is not universally applicable 6 competitive adsorption was neglected by the previous models 7 the model formulation was based on virgin gac only for improvement we proposed three alternative experimental approaches gamma irradiation minicolumn test and compound specific isotope analysis and a new mathematical model to quantify and predict the overall performance and relative contributions of adsorption and biodegradation of trace organics in a gac filter future work should focus on testing the feasibility of the proposed new tools and determining parameters in the proposed model for representing trace organic adsorption and biodegradation in

16336,as a natural source of visible light and a type of renewable energy solar energy is extensively used in the field of photochemistry in this study solar was employed to activate persulfate ps to degrade typical micropollutants the removal kinetics of aspirin asa and flunixin meglumine fmme in the solar ps system were well fitted by pseudo first order models r 2 0 99 in the system containing 1

respectively qualitative and quantitative analyses of the reactive oxygen species ros indicated that sulfate radical so4 played a major role in degradation with the maximum contributions of 77 7 and 88 8 for the degradation of asa and fmme whereas the maximum contributions of hydroxyl radical oh were only 11 6 and 6 5 respectively the contributions of singlet oxygen 1o2 were less than 15 at ph 5 5 but increased to 25 6 and 45 5 at ph 8 5 respectively solar ps pre oxidation increased disinfection byproducts dbps 95 8 for trihalomethanes thms and 47 9 for haloacetic acids haas at ph 7 0 after chlorination in deionized water and an opposite trend was found in systems coexisting with natural organic matter nom residual ps after oxidation resulted in a high aquatic toxicity with an inhibition rate of 18 70 to algae growth economic analysis showed that the electrical energy per order values of the system ranged from 23 5 to 86 5 kwh m 3 order 1 indicating that the solar ps system shows

visible light 400 760 nm and infrared light 760 4000 nm exist in the solar irradiation spectrum gueymard 2004 shu et al 2014 according to data from the world meteorological organization the intensity of solar irradiation at the surface of the earth is approximately 1120 w m2 in summer mcguigan et al 2012 nearly 99 of all solar energy is concentrated within the wavelength range of 300 3000 nm with visible light accounting for approximately 43 gueymard 2004 as the main natural source of visible light solar irradiation constitutes almost half of all surface radiation making it abundant and obtainable therefore compared with technologies based on uvc radiation solar based technologies have better long term sustainability and feasibility cambié and noël 2018 and have been broadly applied in practical applications including seawater desalination sansaniwal 2019 and soil remediation shikha and singh 2021 attention to solar based technologies has also emerged as solar can generate short lived reactive oxygen species ros table a 1 by emitting photons with high energy and irradiating oxidants legrini et al 1993 the second order rate constants for the reactions between ros and organic materials are usually in the order of 106 l09 m 1 s 1 malato et al 2002 currently numerous oxidants such as ozone chlorine and chloramine have been reported to cooperate well with solar for example ozone is an electrophilic oxidant that absorbs energy in the wavelength range of 200 360 nm to produce ros including oh o2 and o3 and promote pollutant degradation beltrán and rey 2017 chlorine and chloramine can also produce reactive chlorine species rcs including cl cl2 and clo in the near uv window of solar light cheng et al 2020 persulfate ps can produce sulfate radicals so4 because the high wavelength tail of the ps absorption spectrum partly overlaps with the uv c window 190 280 nm and the uv end of the solar emission spectrum 300 320 nm fig a 1 jessen et al 2018 a uv253 7 nm ps system was reported to produce radical species oh and so4 during the reaction contributing to 44 21 and 52 82 of the carbamazepine degradation respectively xu et al 2021 ps irradiated by uv light at wavelengths longer than 275 nm was also discovered to degrade bisphenol a effectively and achieved higher removal rates than the uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 system huang et al 2018 however little research has been conducted on the solar ps system in the previous study we preliminarily investigated the kinetic degradation of phenacetin using the solar ps system and obtained high phenacetin removal performance nearly 100 under solar irradiation 1 14 10 4 e m 2 s 1 with 0 3 mm ps demonstrating the promise of the solar ps system tan et al 2021b since the degradation procedure was treated as a black box reaction and focused only on pollutant removal in the solar ps system the degradation mechanism remains unclear including the roles of superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 along with the reaction pathway therefore it is necessary to explore the mechanism of ros generation along with the contributions of ros to the degradation of organic micropollutants in the solar ps system advanced oxidation processes aops are pre oxidation steps that may affect the production of disinfection byproducts dbps in the subsequent disinfection process antoniou et al 2010 gao et al 2012 lau et al 2007 for example it has been demonstrated that the generation of trichloromethane and chloral hydrate after chlorination increased significantly with uv254 nm ps pretreatment hua et al 2019 however few studies have examined the effects of the solar ps system on subsequent dbps formation consequently it is important to explore how the solar ps system affects dbps generation after chlorination in this study the degradation kinetics of four pollutants aspirin asa flunixin meglumine fmme nitrobenzene nb and benzoic acid ba were evaluated in the simulated solar activated ps system as newly emerging ppcps asa and fmme widely exist in the environment for example asa was detected at 0 47 19 4 μg l in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp influent in japan simazaki et al 2015 meanwhile industrial pollutants of nb and ba could not be completely removed by conventional treatment rayaroth et al 2017 wang et al 2018 approximately 19 million pounds of nb were released into the ecosystem annually wei et al 2019 the goals were to 1 explore the efficacy of the solar ps system in degrading pollutants 2 analyze the mechanism of pollutant removal including the contributions of ros and 3 evaluate the degradation efficiency of the system in actual water samples to assess the application proficiency of the solar ps system for the first time the effect of solar ps pre oxidation on dbps

anova using spss 22 0 spss inc chicago usa p 0 05 was considered a significant difference between the two data groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph on pollutant degradation in the solar ps system the degradation percentages of asa fmme nb and ba in the solar alone system and the ps alone system were less than 4 in the ph range of 5 5 8 5 thus the four target pollutants could not be effectively degraded through irradiation by visible light or direct reaction with only ps fig a 2 the decay of the pollutants at different ph values followed pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 95 fig a 3 at ph 7 0 the removal rates of asa fmme nb and ba in the solar ps system were 72 6 97 5 21 8 and 93 1 respectively with corresponding k obs values of 0 099 0 231 0 018 and 0 015 min 1 respectively fig 1 thus ros were generated in the solar ps system the pollutant degradation efficiency decreased in the order of fmme ba asa nb and the optimal ph was 7 0 the highest removal rate obtained at ph 7 0 in solar ps system can be explained as follows first in acidic solution ps existed primarily as hs2o8 thus it was difficult to produce so4 in the presence of a high concentration of h in addition the pka values of asa nb ba and fmme are 3 5 5 8 4 0 and 4 2 respectively newton and kluza 1978 sennaoui et al 2019 at ph 5 5 the ionic state concentrations of asa fmme nb and ba were calculated to be 100 0 5 31 and 20 times the proton state concentrations respectively with ph increasing the ratio of the ionic state concentration to the proton state concentration gradually increased for asa nb and ba implying that these pollutants existed mainly in the ionic form at high ph however since ros are electronegative the ionic pollutant state is not conducive to degradation besides phosphate was used as a buffer to adjust the ph of the solution in the range of 5 5 8 5 phosphate has three ionization constants in aqueous solution pka 1 2 1 pka 2 7 2 and pka 3 12 3 at ph 5 5 the distribution coefficients of h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 are 3 90 10 4 9 80 10 1 1 95 10 2 and 3 10 10 8 respectively indicating that the main form of phosphate under acidic conditions was h2po4 with increasing ph the h2po4 concentration in the system decreased while the hpo4 2 concentration increased according to past studies the second order reaction rates k so4 h2po4 k oh h2po4 k so4 hpo42 and k oh hpo42 are 7 2 104 1 2 106 2 104 and 1 5 105 m 1s 1 respectively tan et al 2021b apparently oh and so4 in the system reacted faster with hpo4 2 than with h2po4 indicating the strong affinity of ros for hpo4 2 although the second order reaction rates of phosphate ions and ros are lower than those of target pollutants and ros phosphate buffer solution was added to the system at a concentration of 10 mm which was 1000 times the initial concentration of target pollutants therefore h2po4 and hpo4 2 also competed for ros in the system as the ph increased the affinity of hpo4 2 for ros increased thereby inhibiting the pollutant degradation efficiency unlike the other three pollutants although the pka of fmme indicated that it exists predominantly in the proton form under alkaline conditions considering the combination effect of other explanations including the presence of oxidants and phosphate ions the results still showed the highest removal rate of fmme at ph 7 0 to evaluate the application potential of the solar ps system the ps consumption was investigated the ps concentration gradually decreased from 238 mg l by approximately 20 mg l in 15 min in the solar ps system equivalent to a consumption of 8 0 fig a 4a meanwhile the so4 2 concentration in the system continuously increased to 17 mg l consistent with the rate of ps consumption the k obs of ps decomposition ranged from 0 006 to 0 007 min 1 at ph 5 5 8 5 fig a 4b much lower than the corresponding k obs values for pollutant degradation 0 013 0 231 min 1 indicating the high utilization potential and sustainability of ps assuming the complete activation and consumption of ps so4 2 concentration in the solution 238 mg l would still not exceed the standard of 250 mg l recommended by usepa the mineralization percentages of toc in the system were 22 7 17 4 and 28 0 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively fig a 5 indicating that most pollutants were converted into organic intermediates further experiments were conducted to investigate whether high ps dosage could promote the mineralizing capacity of the system fig a 6 at ph 7 0 the mineralization rate reached 15 6 98 7 and 98 1 at 10 mm 100 mm and 500 mm ps respectively nevertheless corresponding so4 2 concentrations were measured to be 292 5 2600 and 8625 mg l respectively far exceeded the standard set by usepa 250 mg l with ps utilization rates of 15 23 13 54 and 17 97 the results indicated that higher ps dosage inevitably brought in high level of byproduct so4 2 while enhancing the mineralization rate therefore considering secondary pollutions and oxidant costs ps dosage that is higher than 1 mm was not recommended 3 2 ros identification and contribution to degradation typical tests using probes including nb ba and ffa were conducted to indirectly identify the ros species produced in the solar ps system nb rapidly reacts with oh k ohnb 4 7 109 m 1 s 1 while its reaction with so4 is negligible ba is reported to react rapidly with both oh k oh ba 5 3 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 k so4 ba 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 meanwhile ffa reacts selectively with 1o2 k1o2 ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 the removal percentages of nb and ba were 11 3 and 64 2 with corresponding k obs values of 0 008 and 0 067 min 1 respectively at ph 7 0 fig a 7 according to eq 11 the steady state concentration of oh oh ss in the system was calculated as 3 0 10 14 m 11 k obs nb oh ss k oh nb the removal rate of ffa reached 96 5 within 15 min and the corresponding k obs value was 0 310 min 1 suggesting the possibility of 1o2 existence in the solar ps system consistent with previous findings regarding 1o2 generation in the uv365 led ps system tan et al 2021a ffa reacts with oh at a high rate k oh ffa 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 el sheikh and sweileh 2007 although ffa was well degraded it was difficult to distinguish the contributions of 1o2 and oh consequently alcohol quenching tests were employed to determine the mechanism of degradation the changes of probe removal were evaluated by adding scavengers of meoh and tert butanol tba to the system because the scavengers react differently with various ros k so4 meoh 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k oh tba 3 7 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and k so4 tba 4 9 5 105 m 1 s 1 bu et al 2021 buxton et al 1988 tan et al 2021b 2020 the variations of the concentrations of ffa nb and ba with time are shown in fig a 8 the addition of 10 0 mm meoh completely inhibited the degradation of nb and reduced the removal rate of ba from 64 1 to 16 4 indicating that oh and so4 were eliminated from the system the degradation efficiency of ffa decreased from 96 5 to 79 9 which was not disturbed by oh indicating the presence of a large amount of 1o2 similarly as the dose of tba increased from 1 0 to 10 0 mm the degradation of nb was almost completely inhibited demonstrating that oh in the solar ps system was scavenged completely the removal of ffa was hardly affected over 15 min which can be attributed to its reaction with 1o2 compared to the results of the equal concentration meoh quenching test the removal of ba decreased from 64 1 to 46 1 which was attributed to the remaining so4 in the system thus the existence of so4 and 1o2 was confirmed in the solar ps system the lifetime of 1o2 in deuterium oxide d2o is 20 32 μs much longer than that in water 2 μs yang et al 2018 to better verify the existence of 1o2 in the solar ps system d2o was used as the solvent fig a 9 the k obs values for ffa degradation in 15 min were 0 314 min 1 in the h2o system and 0 377 min 1 in the d2o system confirming the presence of 1o2 in the system the increase of 1o2 ss in the system due to the longer lifetime of 1o2 in d2o compared to h2o led to the growth in the pollutant degradation rate generally 1o2 can be produced in several pathways in a study of alkaline periodate system kio4 and koh were found to react and generate o2 as an intermediate and then be converted into 1o2 bokare and choi 2015 similar results were also reported in the previous study about uv led365 ps system with dmpo as a capture agent and methanol solution as a medium for esr experiments tan et al 2020 to confirm the generation of o2 and its transformation to 1o2 carbonate ion co3 2 was employed as a quencher of o2 k 5 108 m 1 s 1 as is shown in fig a 9 the removal of ffa was only negligibly affected by the addition of 2 0 mm co3 2 within 15 min whereas the k obs decreased from 0 314 to 0 218 min 1 these results demonstrate that o2 was produced in the system and participated as an intermediate in the process of 1o2 generation eqs 12 and 13 12 c o 3 2 o 2 c o 3 o 2 2 13 c o 3 o 2 c o 3 2 o 2 previous studies found that the concentration of dissolved oxygen do affected the production of o2 which subsequently affected the conversion of o2 to 1o2 cao et al 2004 lin and yamada 1999 to investigate the mechanism of 1o2 generation and the effect of do on the generation of ros the do concentration was reduced to less than 0 1 mg l 1 by continuously bubbling nitrogen n2 into the system for 15 min the removal rate of ffa in the absence of do was higher than 95 over 15 min while the k obs value of ffa decreased from 0 314 to 0 307 min 1 fig a 9 the presence of do did not significantly affect the degradation of ffa suggesting that do did not participate in the conversion from o2 to 1o2 this result is consistent with a previous study on the photocatalytic fuel cell activated ps system tang et al 2019 in conclusion at least four major ros oh so4 1o2 and o2 were produced during ps activation by solar light and the mechanism of ros generation in the solar ps system may be described by eqs 14 17 14 s 2 o 8 2 hv 2 s o 4 15 s o 4 h 2 o ho hs o 4 16 2 ho 2 h o 2 17 2 o 2 2 h 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 to further investigate the contribution of each ros kinetic calculation was carried out due to the low oxidation reduction potential of o2 0 33 ev nosaka and nosaka 2017 the reaction rates between o2 and most compounds are 1 105 m 1 s 1 hayyan et al 2016 sawyer and valentine 1981 much lower than those between ros and contaminants approximately 108 m 1 s 1 for example the reaction rate between asa and o2 is less than 8 104 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1985 additionally o2 has a short survival period in water and is rapidly converted to o2 eq 18 zhang et al 2014 therefore it could be assumed that the pollutants in this study were rapidly degraded by the oxidation of oh so4 and 1o2 eq 19 despite the presence of o2 18 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 19 k asa k oh asa k so 4 asa k 1 o 2 asa where k asa represents the k obs min 1 of asa degradation in the solar ps system and k oh asa k so4 asa and k 1o2 asa are the k obs min 1 values of asa degradation by oh so4 and 1o2 respectively the contributions of these three ros were obtained by calculating the ratios of k oh asa k so4 asa and k 1o2 asa to k asa the contribution of oh to pollutant degradation was first evaluated as follows the secondary reaction rates of asa with oh and so4 k oh asa and k so4 asa respectively are 2 53 109 and 5 25 108 m 1 s 1 respectively while k oh fmme and k so4 fmme were determined to be 3 73 109 and 2 36 109 m 1 s 1 tan et al 2021b the oh ss in the solar ps system can be determined by the degradation of nb according to eq 11 the k obs value of nb and oh ss at ph 5 5 in the solar ps system were calculated to be 0 013 min 1 and 4 70 10 14 m respectively next k oh asa and k oh fmme were respectively determined to be 1 19 10 4 and 1 75 10 4 s 1 according to eqs 20 and 21 20 k oh asa k oh asa oh ss 21 k oh fmme k oh fmme oh ss therefore the contributions of oh to asa and fmme degradation at ph 5 5 were 9 5 and 6 5 respectively following the above process the oh ss values at ph 7 0 and 8 5 were calculated to be 6 46 10 14 and 5 23 10 14 m respectively thus the contributions of oh to the degradation of asa and fmme at ph 7 0 were 9 9 and 6 3 respectively while those at ph 8 5 were 11 6 and 5 4 respectively similarly so4 ss was determined based on the degradation of ba and nb in the system ba degradation was achieved by the synergistic effect of oh and so4 with k obs values of 0 148 0 154 and 0 115 min 1 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively fig a 3 the value of k so4 ba is 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 thus so4 ss at ph 5 5 8 5 was calculated to be 1 36 1 85 10 12 m based on eq 22 22 k ba k oh ba oh ss k so 4 ba s o 4 ss the k obs values of so4 for asa and fmme k so4 asa and k so4 fmme respectively at ph 5 5 were respectively determined as 9 69 10 4 and 4 37 10 3 s 1 according to eqs 23 and 24 23 k so 4 asa k so 4 asa s o 4 ss 24 k so 4 fmme k so 4 fmme s o 4 ss the contributions of so4 to asa and fmme degradation were 77 7 and 88 8 respectively following the same procedure the contributions of so4 to asa and fmme degradation were respectively calculated as 59 1 and 62 5 at ph 7 0 and 62 8 and 49 1 at ph 8 5 according to the previous study the contribution ratios of oh and so4 to the degradation of dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride in uv254 ps system at ph 7 0 were 30 and 62 respectively lee et al 2019 conformably indicating the predominant role of so4 in ps mediated aops the remaining pollutant degradation could be attributed to oxidation by 1o2 in this study the contributions of 1o2 to asa and fmme degradation were respectively calculated to be 12 7 and 4 6 at ph 5 5 30 9 and 31 2 at ph 7 0 and 25 6 and 45 5 at ph 8 5 fig 2 thus the primary ros involved in pollutant degradation was so4 which accounted for over 75 of asa and fmme removal at ph 5 5 meanwhile the contributions of oh to the degradation of both asa and fmme were low approximately 10 and 6 respectively with increasing ph the contribution of so4 gradually decreased while 1o2 showed a different trend the contribution of 1o2 to asa degradation was maximized at ph 7 0 30 0 while its greatest contribution to fmme removal 45 5 was observed at ph 8 0 this result indicates that the formation of 1o2 is favored under neutral and alkaline conditions with increasing ph so4 is converted to oh with oh and oh is further transformed to o2 and 1o2 thus alkaline conditions promote the generation of 1o2 the mechanism of pollutant degradation in the solar ps system under alkaline conditions is summarized in fig 3 in the solar ps system large amounts of so4 were produced after ps was activated by solar the oh was produced by the reaction of so4 with h2o under acid or neutral conditions or with oh at higher ph liang et al 2007 after that oh was converted to o2 and then 1o2 during which do played an insignificant role among the four ros the contribution of o2 presented to be relatively negligible while the other three ros had noteworthy effects on the degradation of pollutants 3 3 effects of anions nom and temperature bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl nitrate no3 and phosphate ions po4 3 are typical anions whose concentrations are usually at ranges of 10 500 mg l in the environment due to high rates of anions with oh and so4 106 108 m 1s 1 yang et al 2014 the effect of four anions on the degradation efficiency of pollutants in the solar ps system was further investigated fig a 10 without extra anions added the removal rates of asa fmme nb and ba within 15 min were 65 1 97 5 21 8 and 93 1 respectively however when hco3 concentration increased to 0 5 mm the removal rates of the four pollutants decreased to 54 7 74 7 8 60 and 68 8 respectively hco3 was discovered to effectively capture oh k 2 0 106 m 1 s 1 and so4 k 1 5 106 m 1 s 1 and be converted to co3 whose oxidation reduction potential 1 78 v is lower than oh and so4 subsequently it presented to be a significant inhibition zuo et al 1999 after adding 0 5 mm cl the removal rates of asa fmme and ba decreased to 55 2 75 5 and 73 0 respectively this may be due to lower rates of a series of rcs including cl cl2 and cloh formed during the reactions between cl and part of the oh and so4 bu et al 2020 moreover the degradation of pollutants decreased to 17 14 36 85 21 96 and 32 17 with 0 5 mm po4 3 added and dropped to 13 75 35 79 6 87 and 22 21 coexisted with 0 5 mm no3 among the four anions no3 had the strongest inhibitory effect as a photosensitizer no3 could capture photons from uv and reduce the ros concentration leading to the inhibition of removal keen et al 2012 meanwhile no3 would be converted into no2 under solar irradiation text a 5 which was discovered to rapidly quench oh k no2 oh 1010 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2020 equations between ros and anions are displayed in text a 5 the effect of nom 0 0 6 0 mg l on pollutant degradation in the solar ps system is shown in fig 4 in the ps system without solar irradiation the removal rates of all four pollutants were less than 6 0 indicating that nom could not directly activate ps to produce ros thus the adsorption of nom by pollutants could be ignored fig a 11a similarly in the solar system without ps removal rates of pollutants did not exceed 5 0 indicating that solar irradiation did not effectively activate nom to produce ros fig a 11b however nom exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the depletion of pollutants in the solar ps system fig a 12 at 0 0 mg l nom the removal percentages of asa fmme nb and ba within 15 min were 72 7 97 5 21 8 and 93 1 respectively when the concentration of nom was 6 0 mg l the removals of asa fmme nb and ba decreased to 21 6 68 0 9 8 and 67 9 respectively the kobs values of asa fmme nb and ba obtained for different nom concentrations in the solar ps system are shown in fig 4 when the nom concentration increased from 0 0 to 6 0 mg l the kobs of asa decreased from 0 099 to 0 018 min 1 similarly the kobs of fmme nb and ba were reduced to 46 2 46 0 and 50 6 of those obtained in the absence of nom respectively these findings are attributed to the ability of nom to diminish the quantum yield by absorbing solar irradiation and directly consume oh so4 and 1o2 in the system k nom oh 1 21 9 37 108 m 1 s 1 crapulli et al 2014 subsequently the degradation of asa fmme nb and ba in water samples from the yangtze river and effluent of the sungnan wastewater treatment plant wwtp nanjing jiangsu china was investigated fig a 13 compared to results in the deionized water system the removal rates of asa within 15 min were inhibited to 17 6 and 12 3 in samples from the yangtze river and wwtp effluent respectively while the removal rates of ba decreased to 35 4 and 21 4 respectively the elimination of nb and fmme dropped to less than 20 which might be attributed to the high concentration of nom toc 4 0 mg l in the two real water samples leading to the consumption of ros moreover the concentrations of common anions were determined in samples from yangtze river and wwtp effluent table a 3 hco3 in both samples 164 and 517 mg l respectively and cl in wwtp effluent 78 1 mg l exceeded 0 5 mm which may capture the ros generated through ps activation leading to the inhibition of the degradation efficacy of solar ps system the specific analysis about the effect of anions could be referred to the previous discussion the removal rates of the four pollutants were higher in the yangtze river samples than in the wwtp effluent samples possibly due to the lower toc in the yangtze river samples table a 3 the temperature of the reaction solution may affect the performance of oxidants and the physicochemical properties of pollutants as the temperature increased from 25 to 70 c the removal percentages of asa and nb increased from 35 1 and 15 6 to 55 6 and 70 2 respectively fig a 14 indicating that the increasing temperature facilitated ps activation and ros generation the plot of lnk obs with temperature fig 5 shows an excellent linear relationship r 2 0 98 confirming the pseudo first order kinetics of pollutant degradation between 25 c and 70 c at 70 c the k obs values of asa fmme na and ba were 0 055 0 160 0 270 and 0 081 min 1 respectively the activation energy of a chemical reaction indicates the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur tan et al 2012 based on the arrhenius equation eq 2 in the temperature range of 291 335 k lnk obs was linearly related to t 1 r2 0 98 and the average activation energy for pollutant degradation was 12 8 7 8 25 93 and 6 4 kj mol 1 for asa fmme nb and ba respectively compared to the activation energy for the degradation of nb by heat activated ps 54 3 kj mol 1 duan et al 2020 the activation energy was lower for the solar ps system suggesting a lower energy threshold for o o bond breaking during ps activation 3 4 effects on dbps the dbps formation after chlorination without pre oxidation of the four pollutants was estimated tables a 4 a 5 and fig a 15 nine dbps fourthms and five haas that are commonly generated during chlorination disinfection were selected to evaluate the feasibility of using the solar ps system to control dbps generation during chlorination without pretreatment the concentrations of thms increased gradually with increasing ph the total thms concentrations at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 were 6 1 7 2 and 11 4 μg l respectively lower than the usepa standard for thms in water 80 μg l at ph 8 5 bromodichloromethane bdcm accounted for 50 3 5 7 μg l of total thms while trichloromethane chcl3 and dibromomonochloromethane dbcm accounted for 42 8 4 9 μg l and 6 9 0 8 μg l respectively after chlorination with solar ps pretreatment the concentration of thms increased slightly at ph 7 0 and 8 5 the concentration of bdcm increased from 2 1 to 5 7 μg l to 3 6 and 6 4 μg l respectively while it decreased slightly from 3 0 to 2 1 μg l at ph 5 5 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 the chcl3 concentration increased by 128 116 and 219 respectively in general the concentrations of total thms increased after solar ps pre oxidation 38 89 95 83 and 49 11 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively these results could be explained by the production of thms precursors such as aldehydes and ketones which were observed during the degradation of organics with benzene rings by oh de vera et al 2015 as these intermediates are constantly produced the concentrations of thms increase correspondingly after chlorination xie et al 2015 with increasing ph the increase of oh content in the system further promotes the formation of thms precursors meanwhile the reaction rate of ba with rcs such as clo2 is relatively low k ba clo2 4 103 m 1 s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 as a result only low concentrations of dbps are generated by direct chlorination since the mineralization of pollutants in the solar ps system did not exceed 25 the pollutants were mainly oxidized to low molecular mass organic compounds after solar ps pretreatment ba was converted into several hydroxylated intermediates like phenol 2 hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid zrinyi and pham 2017 the reaction rates between these intermediates and rcs are greater than those between ba and rcs e g k hocl phloroglucinol 1 2 106 m 1 s 1 resulting in the generation of thms during ba degradation criquet et al 2015 lu et al 2016 moreover trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dichloroacetic acid dcaa were the two main haas generated in the system the concentrations of chloroacetic acid caa bromoacetic acid baa and dibromoacetic acid dbaa were below the detection limits after chlorination the total haas concentration in the system without pre oxidation ranged from 5 8 to 11 9 μg l with the highest concentration occurring at ph 7 0 tcaa accounted for over 50 of total haas however after pretreatment with the solar ps system the total haas concentration in the system increased by 155 44 and 458 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively compared to the values in the system without pre oxidation despite these increases the haas concentration remained below the usepa standard total haas 60 μg l and the sanitation standard for domestic drinking water in china gb 5749 2006 dcaa 50 μg l and tcaa 100 μg l at ph 8 5 the tcaa and dcaa increased from 3 2 to 2 5 μg l to 8 3 and 9 2 μg l after chlorination respectively due to the low mineralization rate of the contaminants in the solar ps system the structure and properties of the contaminants were altered by ros through oxidation these changes could lead to an increase in the production of haas precursors such as aldehydes and ketones thereby increasing the haas in the system in this way the solar ps pre oxidation can influence the generation of dbps during the subsequent chlorination process in the previous study on a solar ps system for degrading phenacetin thms concentration decreased by 8 1 from 16 0 to 14 7 μg l at ph 7 0 after solar ps pre oxidation showing an opposite trend tan et al 2021b this result may due to its higher mineralizing capacity to phenacetin 24 8 compared to 17 4 and lower production of dbps precursors therefore combinations with pre and post treatment are supposed to reduce organics which would be potentially converted into dbps based on frontier orbital theory regions susceptible to electrophilic species such as the aromatic rings of antibiotic molecules tend to be attacked by oh he et al 2013 several studies have shown that sites with high fed2 can be attacked by electrophiles like oh the fed2 values of the homos of asa and fmme are tabulated in table a6 for asa the c atoms at the ortho and para positions of the acetoxy group 3c 6c have high fed2 values 22 074 and 19 006 respectively for fmme the n atom connecting the benzene ring with the pyridine group 27 n and the c atom attached to the benzene ring 16c have high fed2 values of 19 269 and 13 340 respectively besides the fed2 values of the ortho and para positions of nitro and carboxyl groups on the benzene ring of nb 2c 3c 5c and 6c and ba 1c 2c 4c and 5c reached around 20 which made them susceptible to electrophilic substitution reactions fig 6 an et al 2015 meanwhile the summation of the hammett constant σ was calculated for the substituents at each site on the aromatic ring fig a 16 sites with lower σ values tend to be attacked by chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 due to interference from spatial effects σo is sometimes considered to be approximately equal to σp lee and von gunten 2012 comparing the σ values of the unsubstituted sites on the benzene ring of asa the most possible sites to be attacked by chlorine are the ortho positions of the carboxylate group and the para positions the acetoxy group 2c 4c the attack of chlorine at these positions might lead to the formation of haas the electron cloud on the pyridinyl ring in fmme is shifted toward the electronegative n atom making it difficult for electrophilic substitution reactions to occur on the pyridinyl group giurg et al 2009 based on the σ values of the methyl trifluoromethyl and amino groups the ortho and para positions 17c 19c of the trifluoromethyl group on the benzene ring in fmme are the most likely to be attacked by chlorine similarly the para positions of the nitro and carboxyl groups on the benzene rings of nb 2c and 6c with σ of 0 71 and ba 1c and 5c with σ of 0 37 are susceptible to be attacked and generate the corresponding dbps in addition the cleavage of the benzene ring would make it more susceptible to chlorine attack to form thms fig a 17 the cytotoxicity of dbps and proportion of total toxicity contributed by different dbps were calculated without and with solar ps pre oxidation based on the concentrations and lc50 of the five dbps detected in the system fig a 18 the total toxicity of dbps increased from 0 020 to 0 045 at ph 5 5 from 0 031 to 0 043 at ph 7 0 and from 0 019 to 0 080 at ph 8 5 after solar ps pre oxidation tcaa accounted for the largest proportion of total dbps cytotoxicity without pre oxidation followed by dcaa after pre oxidation by the solar ps system the proportions of total toxicity contributed by tcaa and bdcm decreased while the proportion contributed by dcaa increased however solar ps pre oxidation generally increased the toxicity of each of the five dbps at ph 5 5 8 5 leading to an increase in total cytotoxicity the effects of solar ps pre oxidation on dbps were compared between the nom only system and the nom pollutants system fig 7 in the nom only system the chcl3 and dbcm contents after chlorination decreased by 60 3 and 35 in the system with solar ps pre oxidation compared to the values in the system without pre oxidation respectively similarly in the nom pollutants system total thms production decreased by 29 8 with solar ps pre oxidation this could be attributed to the change in nom properties after oxidation by ps sra et al 2010 solar ps pre oxidation also reduced the total haas concentration from 23 6 to 12 3 μg l in the nom only system and from 67 8 to 32 9 μg l in the nom pollutants system besides the content of tcaa which was the primary haas decreased by 68 9 in the nom only system and 50 7 in the nom pollutants system dbps formation during chlorination in the yangtze river water and wwtp effluent samples was also evaluated with and without solar ps pre oxidation in the samples without pollutants pre oxidation reduced the concentration of total thms generated during chlorination from 18 3 to 14 8 μg l for yangtze river water and from 21 6 to 21 2 μg l for wwtp effluent the total haas concentration decreased from 22 3 to 12 6 μg l and from 18 1 to 12 2 μg l respectively in contrast in samples with pollutants solar ps pre oxidation increased the average thms and haas concentrations by 23 for yangtze river water and 16 for wwtp effluent after chlorination fig a 19 in this case the organic and inorganic salts in the actual water samples competed with the ros resulting in the generation of numerous organic intermediates which were converted into dbps in summary the combination of solar ps pre oxidation and chlorination disinfection effectively controlled the generation of dbps in the nom system nom pollutants system and the actual water samples however in deionized water and actual water samples adding pollutants the dbps concentration would considerably increase after the solar ps pretreatment thus the solar ps system shows potential for the simultaneous decontamination and control of dbps in actual water matrices demonstrating its application value in the treatment of drinking water 3 5 aquatic toxicity analysis the variation of algae density with incubation time 0 96 h in samples pollutants solar ps and pollutants solar ps was employed to investigate the toxicity to microform after treatment by the solar ps system chen and pei 2016 as is shown in fig 8 a the biomass of algae accumulated with time p 0 05 the algae densities in 3 samples at 24 h were higher than those in the control group with promotion rates of 6 30 4 76 and 7 23 respectively it was probably because certain organic matter was broken up and served as nutrients at 24 h slightly promoting the growth and reproduction of algae however at 96 h all samples showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of microalgae with inhibition rates of 8 54 22 08 and 18 70 among them ps samples presented the strongest restriction indicating the high toxicity with the extension of time easily bioavailable organic matter in the system was consumed up and the algae were susceptible to toxicity from the incompletely degraded pollutants like nb and asa residual ps as well as refractory intermediates moreover photosynthesis is an important process that considerably affects the vital movement of algae reid et al 2004 consequently the changes of photosynthetic pigment content of algae in 3 samples were also examined after 96 h incubation fig 8b at 96 h the contents of chlorophyll a b and carotenoid in pollutants solar ps samples decreased from 2 36 1 99 and 1 96 mg l to 0 92 0 80 and 0 73 mg l respectively solar ps system inhibited the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments of algae which prevented their photosynthesis and therefore their growth liu et al 2017 above all the biological toxicity of the residual ps 20 utilization rate after 15 min of solar ps oxidation should not be overlooked in future applications it is significant to reduce the risk of potential ecological hazards of ps in combination with subsequent treatment 3 6 economic analysis the costs of the solar ps system include expenses related to electricity and oxidants the ee o value was employed to evaluate the economic efficiency of the system usman et al 2012 and analyze the electrical energy required to degrade pollutants at different ps dosages the variation in the energy consumption of the solar device ee osolar with ps concentration is plotted in fig 9 the cost of the oxidant ee ops was positively related to the ps concentration while ee osolar showed an opposite trend for low concentrations of ps 1 02 mm ee osolar dominated the total energy consumption ee ototal of the system and decreased with increasing ps dosage as the ps concentration increased ee ops became the primary contributor to ee ototal for asa degradation the minimum ee ototal 30 9 kwhm 3order 1 was observed at the ps concentration of 1 02 mm the minimum ee ototal values for fmme nb and ba degradation were 25 3 86 5 and 23 5 kwhm 3order 1 at ps concentrations of 1 20 2 99 and 1 29 mm respectively in summary the ee ototal values of the solar ps system for pollutant degradation ranged from 23 5 to 86 5 kwhm 3order 1 and the corresponding optimal ps concentrations were 1 02 2 99 mm in previous studies the ee o of uv254 ps systems on degrading amoxicillin and brilliant green was calculated as 1 11 and 5 4 kwhm 3order 1 zhang et al 2019 rehman et al 2018 however for degradation of asa fmme nb and ba the ee ototal required in uv254 ps system 65 0 749 4 kwh m 3 order 1 and optimal ps dosages 3 2 4 5 mm were found to be higher than those in the solar ps system fig a 10 implying lower energy consumption and secondary contamination of solar ps system 4 conclusions simulated solar irradiation was well combined with ps to decompose typical micropollutants effectively the following main results were creatively demonstrated in the research i the degradation of the four contaminants followed pseudo first order kinetics with removal percentages of 72 6 97 5 21 8 and 93 1 for asa fmme nb and ba respectively within 15 min at ph 7 0 with a ps dosage of 1 mm ii so4 contributed most to the degradation of asa and fmme 49 1 88 8 while oh played a minor role 10 3 and 6 1 the contributions of 1o2 4 6 45 5 to asa and fmme depletion varied with ph iii solar ps pre oxidation led to the decrease of thms and haas in nom only 54 34 and 48 83 respectively and nom pollutants 52 68 and 51 76 respectively systems indicating its facility for reducing dbps when pollutants coexist with nom iv aquatic toxicity analysis indicated that residual oxidant of ps in the system would lead to the inhibition of growth and reproduction of microalgae therefore in practical applications subsequent treatments should be seriously considered to combine with solar ps system to reduce negative impacts

16336,as a natural source of visible light and a type of renewable energy solar energy is extensively used in the field of photochemistry in this study solar was employed to activate persulfate ps to degrade typical micropollutants the removal kinetics of aspirin asa and flunixin meglumine fmme in the solar ps system were well fitted by pseudo first order models r 2 0 99 in the system containing 1 0 mm ps activated by solar irradiation at a fluence of 1 14 10 4 e m 2 s 1 72 6 and 97 5 of asa and fmme were degraded and the corresponding kinetic constants were 6 8 9 8 10 2 and 1 6 9 8 10 1 min 1 respectively qualitative and quantitative analyses of the reactive oxygen species ros indicated that sulfate radical so4 played a major role in degradation with the maximum contributions of 77 7 and 88 8 for the degradation of asa and fmme whereas the maximum contributions of hydroxyl radical oh were only 11 6 and 6 5 respectively the contributions of singlet oxygen 1o2 were less than 15 at ph 5 5 but increased to 25 6 and 45 5 at ph 8 5 respectively solar ps pre oxidation increased disinfection byproducts dbps 95 8 for trihalomethanes thms and 47 9 for haloacetic acids haas at ph 7 0 after chlorination in deionized water and an opposite trend was found in systems coexisting with natural organic matter nom residual ps after oxidation resulted in a high aquatic toxicity with an inhibition rate of 18 70 to algae growth economic analysis showed that the electrical energy per order values of the system ranged from 23 5 to 86 5 kwh m 3 order 1 indicating that the solar ps system shows

visible light 400 760 nm and infrared light 760 4000 nm exist in the solar irradiation spectrum gueymard 2004 shu et al 2014 according to data from the world meteorological organization the intensity of solar irradiation at the surface of the earth is approximately 1120 w m2 in summer mcguigan et al 2012 nearly 99 of all solar energy is concentrated within the wavelength range of 300 3000 nm with visible light accounting for approximately 43 gueymard 2004 as the main natural source of visible light solar irradiation constitutes almost half of all surface radiation making it abundant and obtainable therefore compared with technologies based on uvc radiation solar based technologies have better long term sustainability and feasibility cambié and noël 2018 and have been broadly applied in practical applications including seawater desalination sansaniwal 2019 and soil remediation shikha and singh 2021 attention to solar based technologies has also emerged as solar can generate short lived reactive oxygen species ros table a 1 by emitting photons with high energy and irradiating oxidants legrini et al 1993 the second order rate constants for the reactions between ros and organic materials are usually in the order of 106 l09 m 1 s 1 malato et al 2002 currently numerous oxidants such as ozone chlorine and chloramine have been reported to cooperate well with solar for example ozone is an electrophilic oxidant that absorbs energy in the wavelength range of 200 360 nm to produce ros including oh o2 and o3 and promote pollutant degradation beltrán and rey 2017 chlorine and chloramine can also produce reactive chlorine species rcs including cl cl2 and clo in the near uv window of solar light cheng et al 2020 persulfate ps can produce sulfate radicals so4 because the high wavelength tail of the ps absorption spectrum partly overlaps with the uv c window 190 280 nm and the uv end of the solar emission spectrum 300 320 nm fig a 1 jessen et al 2018 a uv253 7 nm ps system was reported to produce radical species oh and so4 during the reaction contributing to 44 21 and 52 82 of the carbamazepine degradation respectively xu et al 2021 ps irradiated by uv light at wavelengths longer than 275 nm was also discovered to degrade bisphenol a effectively and achieved higher removal rates than the uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 system huang et al 2018 however little research has been conducted on the solar ps system in the previous study we preliminarily investigated the kinetic degradation of phenacetin using the solar ps system and obtained high phenacetin removal performance nearly 100 under solar irradiation 1 14 10 4 e m 2 s 1 with 0 3 mm ps demonstrating the promise of the solar ps system tan et al 2021b since the degradation procedure was treated as a black box reaction and focused only on pollutant removal in the solar ps system the degradation mechanism remains unclear including the roles of superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 along with the reaction pathway therefore it is necessary to explore the mechanism of ros generation along with the contributions of ros to the degradation of organic micropollutants in the solar ps system advanced oxidation processes aops are pre oxidation steps that may affect the production of disinfection byproducts dbps in the subsequent disinfection process antoniou et al 2010 gao et al 2012 lau et al 2007 for example it has been demonstrated that the generation of trichloromethane and chloral hydrate after chlorination increased significantly with uv254 nm ps pretreatment hua et al 2019 however few studies have examined the effects of the solar ps system on subsequent dbps formation consequently it is important to explore how the solar ps system affects dbps generation after chlorination in this study the degradation kinetics of four pollutants aspirin asa flunixin meglumine fmme nitrobenzene nb and benzoic acid ba were evaluated in the simulated solar activated ps system as newly emerging ppcps asa and fmme widely exist in the environment for example asa was detected at 0 47 19 4 μg l in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp influent in japan simazaki et al 2015 meanwhile industrial pollutants of nb and ba could not be completely removed by conventional treatment rayaroth et al 2017 wang et al 2018 approximately 19 million pounds of nb were released into the ecosystem annually wei et al 2019 the goals were to 1 explore the efficacy of the solar ps system in degrading pollutants 2 analyze the mechanism of pollutant removal including the contributions of ros and 3 evaluate the degradation efficiency of the system in actual water samples to assess the application proficiency of the solar ps system for the first time the effect of solar ps pre oxidation on dbps generation in following disinfection process and aquatic toxicity of the degradation products in solar ps system were evaluated providing valuable references for applications 2 experimental 2 1

hach module no 8051 according to the methods described in usepa 375 4 malato et al 1997 the total organic carbon toc was determined using a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan nine dbps including four trihalomethanes thms and five haloacetic acids haas were examined by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector agilent gc ecd 6890 after extraction with methyl tert butyl ether according to usepa 551 and 552 aikawa and burk 1997 allonier et al 1999 2 4 data processing methods 2 4 1 kinetic calculation pseudo first order kinetic equations were employed to describe pollutant

4 6 quantum chemistry analysis and determination of dbps cytotoxicity gaussian 09 software du et al 2018 was employed to conduct molecular orbital calculations and obtain the wavefunction based on

anova using spss 22 0 spss inc chicago usa p 0 05 was considered a significant difference between the two data groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph on pollutant degradation in the solar ps system the degradation percentages of asa fmme nb and ba in the solar alone system and the ps alone system were less than 4 in the ph range of 5 5 8 5 thus the four target pollutants could not be effectively degraded through irradiation by visible light or direct reaction with only ps fig a 2 the decay of the pollutants at different ph values followed pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 95 fig a 3 at ph 7 0 the removal rates of asa fmme nb and ba in the solar ps system were 72 6 97 5 21 8 and 93 1 respectively with corresponding k obs values of 0 099 0 231 0 018 and 0 015 min 1 respectively fig 1 thus ros were generated in the solar ps system the pollutant degradation efficiency decreased in the order of fmme ba asa nb and the optimal ph was 7 0 the highest removal rate obtained at ph 7 0 in solar ps system can be explained as follows first in acidic solution ps existed primarily as hs2o8 thus it was difficult to produce so4 in the presence of a high concentration of h in addition the pka values of asa nb ba and fmme are 3 5 5 8 4 0 and 4 2 respectively newton and kluza 1978 sennaoui et al 2019 at ph 5 5 the ionic state concentrations of asa fmme nb and ba were calculated to be 100 0 5 31 and 20 times the proton state concentrations respectively with ph increasing the ratio of the ionic state concentration to the proton state concentration gradually increased for asa nb and ba implying that these pollutants existed mainly in the ionic form at high ph however since ros are electronegative the ionic pollutant state is not conducive to degradation besides phosphate was used as a buffer to adjust the ph of the solution in the range of 5 5 8 5 phosphate has three ionization constants in aqueous solution pka 1 2 1 pka 2 7 2 and pka 3 12 3 at ph 5 5 the distribution coefficients of h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 are 3 90 10 4 9 80 10 1 1 95 10 2 and 3 10 10 8 respectively indicating that the main form of phosphate under acidic conditions was h2po4 with increasing ph the h2po4 concentration in the system decreased while the hpo4 2 concentration increased according to past studies the second order reaction rates k so4 h2po4 k oh h2po4 k so4 hpo42 and k oh hpo42 are 7 2 104 1 2 106 2 104 and 1 5 105 m 1s 1 respectively tan et al 2021b apparently oh and so4 in the system reacted faster with hpo4 2 than with h2po4 indicating the strong affinity of ros for hpo4 2 although the second order reaction rates of phosphate ions and ros are lower than those of target pollutants and ros phosphate buffer solution was added to the system at a concentration of 10 mm which was 1000 times the initial concentration of target pollutants therefore h2po4 and hpo4 2 also competed for ros in the system as the ph increased the affinity of hpo4 2 for ros increased thereby inhibiting the pollutant degradation efficiency unlike the other three pollutants although the pka of fmme indicated that it exists predominantly in the proton form under alkaline conditions considering the combination effect of other explanations including the presence of oxidants and phosphate ions the results still showed the highest removal rate of fmme at ph 7 0 to evaluate the application potential of the solar ps system the ps consumption was investigated the ps concentration gradually decreased from 238 mg l by approximately 20 mg l in 15 min in the solar ps system equivalent to a consumption of 8 0 fig a 4a meanwhile the so4 2 concentration in the system continuously increased to 17 mg l consistent with the rate of ps consumption the k obs of ps decomposition ranged from 0 006 to 0 007 min 1 at ph 5 5 8 5 fig a 4b much lower than the corresponding k obs values for pollutant degradation 0 013 0 231 min 1 indicating the high utilization potential and sustainability of ps assuming the complete activation and consumption of ps so4 2 concentration in the solution 238 mg l would still not exceed the standard of 250 mg l recommended by usepa the mineralization percentages of toc in the system were 22 7 17 4 and 28 0 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively fig a 5 indicating that most pollutants were converted into organic intermediates further experiments were conducted to investigate whether high ps dosage could promote the mineralizing capacity of the system fig a 6 at ph 7 0 the mineralization rate reached 15 6 98 7 and 98 1 at 10 mm 100 mm and 500 mm ps respectively nevertheless corresponding so4 2 concentrations were measured to be 292 5 2600 and 8625 mg l respectively far exceeded the standard set by usepa 250 mg l with ps utilization rates of 15 23 13 54 and 17 97 the results indicated that higher ps dosage inevitably brought in high level of byproduct so4 2 while enhancing the mineralization rate therefore considering secondary pollutions and oxidant costs ps dosage that is higher than 1 mm was not recommended 3 2 ros identification and contribution to degradation typical tests using probes including nb ba and ffa were conducted to indirectly identify the ros species produced in the solar ps system nb rapidly reacts with oh k ohnb 4 7 109 m 1 s 1 while its reaction with so4 is negligible ba is reported to react rapidly with both oh k oh ba 5 3 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 k so4 ba 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 meanwhile ffa reacts selectively with 1o2 k1o2 ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 the removal percentages of nb and ba were 11 3 and 64 2 with corresponding k obs values of 0 008 and 0 067 min 1 respectively at ph 7 0 fig a 7 according to eq 11 the steady state concentration of oh oh ss in the system was calculated as 3 0 10 14 m 11 k obs nb oh ss k oh nb the removal rate of ffa reached 96 5 within 15 min and the corresponding k obs value was 0 310 min 1 suggesting the possibility of 1o2 existence in the solar ps system consistent with previous findings regarding 1o2 generation in the uv365 led ps system tan et al 2021a ffa reacts with oh at a high rate k oh ffa 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 el sheikh and sweileh 2007 although ffa was well degraded it was difficult to distinguish the contributions of 1o2 and oh consequently alcohol quenching tests were employed to determine the mechanism of degradation the changes of probe removal were evaluated by adding scavengers of meoh and tert butanol tba to the system because the scavengers react differently with various ros k so4 meoh 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 k oh meoh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k oh tba 3 7 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and k so4 tba 4 9 5 105 m 1 s 1 bu et al 2021 buxton et al 1988 tan et al 2021b 2020 the variations of the concentrations of ffa nb and ba with time are shown in fig a 8 the addition of 10 0 mm meoh completely inhibited the degradation of nb and reduced the removal rate of ba from 64 1 to 16 4 indicating that oh and so4 were eliminated from the system the degradation efficiency of ffa decreased from 96 5 to 79 9 which was not disturbed by oh indicating the presence of a large amount of 1o2 similarly as the dose of tba increased from 1 0 to 10 0 mm the degradation of nb was almost completely inhibited demonstrating that oh in the solar ps system was scavenged completely the removal of ffa was hardly affected over 15 min which can be attributed to its reaction with 1o2 compared to the results of the equal concentration meoh quenching test the removal of ba decreased from 64 1 to 46 1 which was attributed to the remaining so4 in the system thus the existence of so4 and 1o2 was confirmed in the solar ps system the lifetime of 1o2 in deuterium oxide d2o is 20 32 μs much longer than that in water 2 μs yang et al 2018 to better verify the existence of 1o2 in the solar ps system d2o was used as the solvent fig a 9 the k obs values for ffa degradation in 15 min were 0 314 min 1 in the h2o system and 0 377 min 1 in the d2o system confirming the presence of 1o2 in the system the increase of 1o2 ss in the system due to the longer lifetime of 1o2 in d2o compared to h2o led to the growth in the pollutant degradation rate generally 1o2 can be produced in several pathways in a study of alkaline periodate system kio4 and koh were found to react and generate o2 as an intermediate and then be converted into 1o2 bokare and choi 2015 similar results were also reported in the previous study about uv led365 ps system with dmpo as a capture agent and methanol solution as a medium for esr experiments tan et al 2020 to confirm the generation of o2 and its transformation to 1o2 carbonate ion co3 2 was employed as a quencher of o2 k 5 108 m 1 s 1 as is shown in fig a 9 the removal of ffa was only negligibly affected by the addition of 2 0 mm co3 2 within 15 min whereas the k obs decreased from 0 314 to 0 218 min 1 these results demonstrate that o2 was produced in the system and participated as an intermediate in the process of 1o2 generation eqs 12 and 13 12 c o 3 2 o 2 c o 3 o 2 2 13 c o 3 o 2 c o 3 2 o 2 previous studies found that the concentration of dissolved oxygen do affected the production of o2 which subsequently affected the conversion of o2 to 1o2 cao et al 2004 lin and yamada 1999 to investigate the mechanism of 1o2 generation and the effect of do on the generation of ros the do concentration was reduced to less than 0 1 mg l 1 by continuously bubbling nitrogen n2 into the system for 15 min the removal rate of ffa in the absence of do was higher than 95 over 15 min while the k obs value of ffa decreased from 0 314 to 0 307 min 1 fig a 9 the presence of do did not significantly affect the degradation of ffa suggesting that do did not participate in the conversion from o2 to 1o2 this result is consistent with a previous study on the photocatalytic fuel cell activated ps system tang et al 2019 in conclusion at least four major ros oh so4 1o2 and o2 were produced during ps activation by solar light and the mechanism of ros generation in the solar ps system may be described by eqs 14 17 14 s 2 o 8 2 hv 2 s o 4 15 s o 4 h 2 o ho hs o 4 16 2 ho 2 h o 2 17 2 o 2 2 h 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 to further investigate the contribution of each ros kinetic calculation was carried out due to the low oxidation reduction potential of o2 0 33 ev nosaka and nosaka 2017 the reaction rates between o2 and most compounds are 1 105 m 1 s 1 hayyan et al 2016 sawyer and valentine 1981 much lower than those between ros and contaminants approximately 108 m 1 s 1 for example the reaction rate between asa and o2 is less than 8 104 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1985 additionally o2 has a short survival period in water and is rapidly converted to o2 eq 18 zhang et al 2014 therefore it could be assumed that the pollutants in this study were rapidly degraded by the oxidation of oh so4 and 1o2 eq 19 despite the presence of o2 18 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 o 2 19 k asa k oh asa k so 4 asa k 1 o 2 asa where k asa represents the k obs min 1 of asa degradation in the solar ps system and k oh asa k so4 asa and k 1o2 asa are the k obs min 1 values of asa degradation by oh so4 and 1o2 respectively the contributions of these three ros were obtained by calculating the ratios of k oh asa k so4 asa and k 1o2 asa to k asa the contribution of oh to pollutant degradation was first evaluated as follows the secondary reaction rates of asa with oh and so4 k oh asa and k so4 asa respectively are 2 53 109 and 5 25 108 m 1 s 1 respectively while k oh fmme and k so4 fmme were determined to be 3 73 109 and 2 36 109 m 1 s 1 tan et al 2021b the oh ss in the solar ps system can be determined by the degradation of nb according to eq 11 the k obs value of nb and oh ss at ph 5 5 in the solar ps system were calculated to be 0 013 min 1 and 4 70 10 14 m respectively next k oh asa and k oh fmme were respectively determined to be 1 19 10 4 and 1 75 10 4 s 1 according to eqs 20 and 21 20 k oh asa k oh asa oh ss 21 k oh fmme k oh fmme oh ss therefore the contributions of oh to asa and fmme degradation at ph 5 5 were 9 5 and 6 5 respectively following the above process the oh ss values at ph 7 0 and 8 5 were calculated to be 6 46 10 14 and 5 23 10 14 m respectively thus the contributions of oh to the degradation of asa and fmme at ph 7 0 were 9 9 and 6 3 respectively while those at ph 8 5 were 11 6 and 5 4 respectively similarly so4 ss was determined based on the degradation of ba and nb in the system ba degradation was achieved by the synergistic effect of oh and so4 with k obs values of 0 148 0 154 and 0 115 min 1 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively fig a 3 the value of k so4 ba is 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 thus so4 ss at ph 5 5 8 5 was calculated to be 1 36 1 85 10 12 m based on eq 22 22 k ba k oh ba oh ss k so 4 ba s o 4 ss the k obs values of so4 for asa and fmme k so4 asa and k so4 fmme respectively at ph 5 5 were respectively determined as 9 69 10 4 and 4 37 10 3 s 1 according to eqs 23 and 24 23 k so 4 asa k so 4 asa s o 4 ss 24 k so 4 fmme k so 4 fmme s o 4 ss the contributions of so4 to asa and fmme degradation were 77 7 and 88 8 respectively following the same procedure the contributions of so4 to asa and fmme degradation were respectively calculated as 59 1 and 62 5 at ph 7 0 and 62 8 and 49 1 at ph 8 5 according to the previous study the contribution ratios of oh and so4 to the degradation of dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride in uv254 ps system at ph 7 0 were 30 and 62 respectively lee et al 2019 conformably indicating the predominant role of so4 in ps mediated aops the remaining pollutant degradation could be attributed to oxidation by 1o2 in this study the contributions of 1o2 to asa and fmme degradation were respectively calculated to be 12 7 and 4 6 at ph 5 5 30 9 and 31 2 at ph 7 0 and 25 6 and 45 5 at ph 8 5 fig 2 thus the primary ros involved in pollutant degradation was so4 which accounted for over 75 of asa and fmme removal at ph 5 5 meanwhile the contributions of oh to the degradation of both asa and fmme were low approximately 10 and 6 respectively with increasing ph the contribution of so4 gradually decreased while 1o2 showed a different trend the contribution of 1o2 to asa degradation was maximized at ph 7 0 30 0 while its greatest contribution to fmme removal 45 5 was observed at ph 8 0 this result indicates that the formation of 1o2 is favored under neutral and alkaline conditions with increasing ph so4 is converted to oh with oh and oh is further transformed to o2 and 1o2 thus alkaline conditions promote the generation of 1o2 the mechanism of pollutant degradation in the solar ps system under alkaline conditions is summarized in fig 3 in the solar ps system large amounts of so4 were produced after ps was activated by solar the oh was produced by the reaction of so4 with h2o under acid or neutral conditions or with oh at higher ph liang et al 2007 after that oh was converted to o2 and then 1o2 during which do played an insignificant role among the four ros the contribution of o2 presented to be relatively negligible while the other three ros had noteworthy effects on the degradation of pollutants 3 3 effects of anions nom and temperature bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl nitrate no3 and phosphate ions po4 3 are typical anions whose concentrations are usually at ranges of 10 500 mg l in the environment due to high rates of anions with oh and so4 106 108 m 1s 1 yang et al 2014 the effect of four anions on the degradation efficiency of pollutants in the solar ps system was further investigated fig a 10 without extra anions added the removal rates of asa fmme nb and ba within 15 min were 65 1 97 5 21 8 and 93 1 respectively however when hco3 concentration increased to 0 5 mm the removal rates of the four pollutants decreased to 54 7 74 7 8 60 and 68 8 respectively hco3 was discovered to effectively capture oh k 2 0 106 m 1 s 1 and so4 k 1 5 106 m 1 s 1 and be converted to co3 whose oxidation reduction potential 1 78 v is lower than oh and so4 subsequently it presented to be a significant inhibition zuo et al 1999 after adding 0 5 mm cl the removal rates of asa fmme and ba decreased to 55 2 75 5 and 73 0 respectively this may be due to lower rates of a series of rcs including cl cl2 and cloh formed during the reactions between cl and part of the oh and so4 bu et al 2020 moreover the degradation of pollutants decreased to 17 14 36 85 21 96 and 32 17 with 0 5 mm po4 3 added and dropped to 13 75 35 79 6 87 and 22 21 coexisted with 0 5 mm no3 among the four anions no3 had the strongest inhibitory effect as a photosensitizer no3 could capture photons from uv and reduce the ros concentration leading to the inhibition of removal keen et al 2012 meanwhile no3 would be converted into no2 under solar irradiation text a 5 which was discovered to rapidly quench oh k no2 oh 1010 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2020 equations between ros and anions are displayed in text a 5 the effect of nom 0 0 6 0 mg l on pollutant degradation in the solar ps system is shown in fig 4 in the ps system without solar irradiation the removal rates of all four pollutants were less than 6 0 indicating that nom could not directly activate ps to produce ros thus the adsorption of nom by pollutants could be ignored fig a 11a similarly in the solar system without ps removal rates of pollutants did not exceed 5 0 indicating that solar irradiation did not effectively activate nom to produce ros fig a 11b however nom exerted a significant inhibitory effect on the depletion of pollutants in the solar ps system fig a 12 at 0 0 mg l nom the removal percentages of asa fmme nb and ba within 15 min were 72 7 97 5 21 8 and 93 1 respectively when the concentration of nom was 6 0 mg l the removals of asa fmme nb and ba decreased to 21 6 68 0 9 8 and 67 9 respectively the kobs values of asa fmme nb and ba obtained for different nom concentrations in the solar ps system are shown in fig 4 when the nom concentration increased from 0 0 to 6 0 mg l the kobs of asa decreased from 0 099 to 0 018 min 1 similarly the kobs of fmme nb and ba were reduced to 46 2 46 0 and 50 6 of those obtained in the absence of nom respectively these findings are attributed to the ability of nom to diminish the quantum yield by absorbing solar irradiation and directly consume oh so4 and 1o2 in the system k nom oh 1 21 9 37 108 m 1 s 1 crapulli et al 2014 subsequently the degradation of asa fmme nb and ba in water samples from the yangtze river and effluent of the sungnan wastewater treatment plant wwtp nanjing jiangsu china was investigated fig a 13 compared to results in the deionized water system the removal rates of asa within 15 min were inhibited to 17 6 and 12 3 in samples from the yangtze river and wwtp effluent respectively while the removal rates of ba decreased to 35 4 and 21 4 respectively the elimination of nb and fmme dropped to less than 20 which might be attributed to the high concentration of nom toc 4 0 mg l in the two real water samples leading to the consumption of ros moreover the concentrations of common anions were determined in samples from yangtze river and wwtp effluent table a 3 hco3 in both samples 164 and 517 mg l respectively and cl in wwtp effluent 78 1 mg l exceeded 0 5 mm which may capture the ros generated through ps activation leading to the inhibition of the degradation efficacy of solar ps system the specific analysis about the effect of anions could be referred to the previous discussion the removal rates of the four pollutants were higher in the yangtze river samples than in the wwtp effluent samples possibly due to the lower toc in the yangtze river samples table a 3 the temperature of the reaction solution may affect the performance of oxidants and the physicochemical properties of pollutants as the temperature increased from 25 to 70 c the removal percentages of asa and nb increased from 35 1 and 15 6 to 55 6 and 70 2 respectively fig a 14 indicating that the increasing temperature facilitated ps activation and ros generation the plot of lnk obs with temperature fig 5 shows an excellent linear relationship r 2 0 98 confirming the pseudo first order kinetics of pollutant degradation between 25 c and 70 c at 70 c the k obs values of asa fmme na and ba were 0 055 0 160 0 270 and 0 081 min 1 respectively the activation energy of a chemical reaction indicates the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur tan et al 2012 based on the arrhenius equation eq 2 in the temperature range of 291 335 k lnk obs was linearly related to t 1 r2 0 98 and the average activation energy for pollutant degradation was 12 8 7 8 25 93 and 6 4 kj mol 1 for asa fmme nb and ba respectively compared to the activation energy for the degradation of nb by heat activated ps 54 3 kj mol 1 duan et al 2020 the activation energy was lower for the solar ps system suggesting a lower energy threshold for o o bond breaking during ps activation 3 4 effects on dbps the dbps formation after chlorination without pre oxidation of the four pollutants was estimated tables a 4 a 5 and fig a 15 nine dbps fourthms and five haas that are commonly generated during chlorination disinfection were selected to evaluate the feasibility of using the solar ps system to control dbps generation during chlorination without pretreatment the concentrations of thms increased gradually with increasing ph the total thms concentrations at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 were 6 1 7 2 and 11 4 μg l respectively lower than the usepa standard for thms in water 80 μg l at ph 8 5 bromodichloromethane bdcm accounted for 50 3 5 7 μg l of total thms while trichloromethane chcl3 and dibromomonochloromethane dbcm accounted for 42 8 4 9 μg l and 6 9 0 8 μg l respectively after chlorination with solar ps pretreatment the concentration of thms increased slightly at ph 7 0 and 8 5 the concentration of bdcm increased from 2 1 to 5 7 μg l to 3 6 and 6 4 μg l respectively while it decreased slightly from 3 0 to 2 1 μg l at ph 5 5 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 the chcl3 concentration increased by 128 116 and 219 respectively in general the concentrations of total thms increased after solar ps pre oxidation 38 89 95 83 and 49 11 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively these results could be explained by the production of thms precursors such as aldehydes and ketones which were observed during the degradation of organics with benzene rings by oh de vera et al 2015 as these intermediates are constantly produced the concentrations of thms increase correspondingly after chlorination xie et al 2015 with increasing ph the increase of oh content in the system further promotes the formation of thms precursors meanwhile the reaction rate of ba with rcs such as clo2 is relatively low k ba clo2 4 103 m 1 s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 as a result only low concentrations of dbps are generated by direct chlorination since the mineralization of pollutants in the solar ps system did not exceed 25 the pollutants were mainly oxidized to low molecular mass organic compounds after solar ps pretreatment ba was converted into several hydroxylated intermediates like phenol 2 hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid zrinyi and pham 2017 the reaction rates between these intermediates and rcs are greater than those between ba and rcs e g k hocl phloroglucinol 1 2 106 m 1 s 1 resulting in the generation of thms during ba degradation criquet et al 2015 lu et al 2016 moreover trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dichloroacetic acid dcaa were the two main haas generated in the system the concentrations of chloroacetic acid caa bromoacetic acid baa and dibromoacetic acid dbaa were below the detection limits after chlorination the total haas concentration in the system without pre oxidation ranged from 5 8 to 11 9 μg l with the highest concentration occurring at ph 7 0 tcaa accounted for over 50 of total haas however after pretreatment with the solar ps system the total haas concentration in the system increased by 155 44 and 458 at ph 5 5 7 0 and 8 5 respectively compared to the values in the system without pre oxidation despite these increases the haas concentration remained below the usepa standard total haas 60 μg l and the sanitation standard for domestic drinking water in china gb 5749 2006 dcaa 50 μg l and tcaa 100 μg l at ph 8 5 the tcaa and dcaa increased from 3 2 to 2 5 μg l to 8 3 and 9 2 μg l after chlorination respectively due to the low mineralization rate of the contaminants in the solar ps system the structure and properties of the contaminants were altered by ros through oxidation these changes could lead to an increase in the production of haas precursors such as aldehydes and ketones thereby increasing the haas in the system in this way the solar ps pre oxidation can influence the generation of dbps during the subsequent chlorination process in the previous study on a solar ps system for degrading phenacetin thms concentration decreased by 8 1 from 16 0 to 14 7 μg l at ph 7 0 after solar ps pre oxidation showing an opposite trend tan et al 2021b this result may due to its higher mineralizing capacity to phenacetin 24 8 compared to 17 4 and lower production of dbps precursors therefore combinations with pre and post treatment are supposed to reduce organics which would be potentially converted into dbps based on frontier orbital theory regions susceptible to electrophilic species such as the aromatic rings of antibiotic molecules tend to be attacked by oh he et al 2013 several studies have shown that sites with high fed2 can be attacked by electrophiles like oh the fed2 values of the homos of asa and fmme are tabulated in table a6 for asa the c atoms at the ortho and para positions of the acetoxy group 3c 6c have high fed2 values 22 074 and 19 006 respectively for fmme the n atom connecting the benzene ring with the pyridine group 27 n and the c atom attached to the benzene ring 16c have high fed2 values of 19 269 and 13 340 respectively besides the fed2 values of the ortho and para positions of nitro and carboxyl groups on the benzene ring of nb 2c 3c 5c and 6c and ba 1c 2c 4c and 5c reached around 20 which made them susceptible to electrophilic substitution reactions fig 6 an et al 2015 meanwhile the summation of the hammett constant σ was calculated for the substituents at each site on the aromatic ring fig a 16 sites with lower σ values tend to be attacked by chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 due to interference from spatial effects σo is sometimes considered to be approximately equal to σp lee and von gunten 2012 comparing the σ values of the unsubstituted sites on the benzene ring of asa the most possible sites to be attacked by chlorine are the ortho positions of the carboxylate group and the para positions the acetoxy group 2c 4c the attack of chlorine at these positions might lead to the formation of haas the electron cloud on the pyridinyl ring in fmme is shifted toward the electronegative n atom making it difficult for electrophilic substitution reactions to occur on the pyridinyl group giurg et al 2009 based on the σ values of the methyl trifluoromethyl and amino groups the ortho and para positions 17c 19c of the trifluoromethyl group on the benzene ring in fmme are the most likely to be attacked by chlorine similarly the para positions of the nitro and carboxyl groups on the benzene rings of nb 2c and 6c with σ of 0 71 and ba 1c and 5c with σ of 0 37 are susceptible to be attacked and generate the corresponding dbps in addition the cleavage of the benzene ring would make it more susceptible to chlorine attack to form thms fig a 17 the cytotoxicity of dbps and proportion of total toxicity contributed by different dbps were calculated without and with solar ps pre oxidation based on the concentrations and lc50 of the five dbps detected in the system fig a 18 the total toxicity of dbps increased from 0 020 to 0 045 at ph 5 5 from 0 031 to 0 043 at ph 7 0 and from 0 019 to 0 080 at ph 8 5 after solar ps pre oxidation tcaa accounted for the largest proportion of total dbps cytotoxicity without pre oxidation followed by dcaa after pre oxidation by the solar ps system the proportions of total toxicity contributed by tcaa and bdcm decreased while the proportion contributed by dcaa increased however solar ps pre oxidation generally increased the toxicity of each of the five dbps at ph 5 5 8 5 leading to an increase in total cytotoxicity the effects of solar ps pre oxidation on dbps were compared between the nom only system and the nom pollutants system fig 7 in the nom only system the chcl3 and dbcm contents after chlorination decreased by 60 3 and 35 in the system with solar ps pre oxidation compared to the values in the system without pre oxidation respectively similarly in the nom pollutants system total thms production decreased by 29 8 with solar ps pre oxidation this could be attributed to the change in nom properties after oxidation by ps sra et al 2010 solar ps pre oxidation also reduced the total haas concentration from 23 6 to 12 3 μg l in the nom only system and from 67 8 to 32 9 μg l in the nom pollutants system besides the content of tcaa which was the primary haas decreased by 68 9 in the nom only system and 50 7 in the nom pollutants system dbps formation during chlorination in the yangtze river water and wwtp effluent samples was also evaluated with and without solar ps pre oxidation in the samples without pollutants pre oxidation reduced the concentration of total thms generated during chlorination from 18 3 to 14 8 μg l for yangtze river water and from 21 6 to 21 2 μg l for wwtp effluent the total haas concentration decreased from 22 3 to 12 6 μg l and from 18 1 to 12 2 μg l respectively in contrast in samples with pollutants solar ps pre oxidation increased the average thms and haas concentrations by 23 for yangtze river water and 16 for wwtp effluent after chlorination fig a 19 in this case the organic and inorganic salts in the actual water samples competed with the ros resulting in the generation of numerous organic intermediates which were converted into dbps in summary the combination of solar ps pre oxidation and chlorination disinfection effectively controlled the generation of dbps in the nom system nom pollutants system and the actual water samples however in deionized water and actual water samples adding pollutants the dbps concentration would considerably increase after the solar ps pretreatment thus the solar ps system shows potential for the simultaneous decontamination and control of dbps in actual water matrices demonstrating its application value in the treatment of drinking water 3 5 aquatic toxicity analysis the variation of algae density with incubation time 0 96 h in samples pollutants solar ps and pollutants solar ps was employed to investigate the toxicity to microform after treatment by the solar ps system chen and pei 2016 as is shown in fig 8 a the biomass of algae accumulated with time p 0 05 the algae densities in 3 samples at 24 h were higher than those in the control group with promotion rates of 6 30 4 76 and 7 23 respectively it was probably because certain organic matter was broken up and served as nutrients at 24 h slightly promoting the growth and reproduction of algae however at 96 h all samples showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of microalgae with inhibition rates of 8 54 22 08 and 18 70 among them ps samples presented the strongest restriction indicating the high toxicity with the extension of time easily bioavailable organic matter in the system was consumed up and the algae were susceptible to toxicity from the incompletely degraded pollutants like nb and asa residual ps as well as refractory intermediates moreover photosynthesis is an important process that considerably affects the vital movement of algae reid et al 2004 consequently the changes of photosynthetic pigment content of algae in 3 samples were also examined after 96 h incubation fig 8b at 96 h the contents of chlorophyll a b and carotenoid in pollutants solar ps samples decreased from 2 36 1 99 and 1 96 mg l to 0 92 0 80 and 0 73 mg l respectively solar ps system inhibited the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments of algae which prevented their photosynthesis and therefore their growth liu et al 2017 above all the biological toxicity of the residual ps 20 utilization rate after 15 min of solar ps oxidation should not be overlooked in future applications it is significant to reduce the risk of potential ecological hazards of ps in combination with subsequent treatment 3 6 economic analysis the costs of the solar ps system include expenses related to electricity and oxidants the ee o value was employed to evaluate the economic efficiency of the system usman et al 2012 and analyze the electrical energy required to degrade pollutants at different ps dosages the variation in the energy consumption of the solar device ee osolar with ps concentration is plotted in fig 9 the cost of the oxidant ee ops was positively related to the ps concentration while ee osolar showed an opposite trend for low concentrations of ps 1 02 mm ee osolar dominated the total energy consumption ee ototal of the system and decreased with increasing ps dosage as the ps concentration increased ee ops became the primary contributor to ee ototal for asa degradation the minimum ee ototal 30 9 kwhm 3order 1 was observed at the ps concentration of 1 02 mm the minimum ee ototal values for fmme nb and ba degradation were 25 3 86 5 and 23 5 kwhm 3order 1 at ps concentrations of 1 20 2 99 and 1 29 mm respectively in summary the ee ototal values of the solar ps system for pollutant degradation ranged from 23 5 to 86 5 kwhm 3order 1 and the corresponding optimal ps concentrations were 1 02 2 99 mm in previous studies the ee o of uv254 ps systems on degrading amoxicillin and brilliant green was calculated as 1 11 and 5 4 kwhm 3order 1 zhang et al 2019 rehman et al 2018 however for degradation of asa fmme nb and ba the ee ototal required in uv254 ps system 65 0 749 4 kwh m 3 order 1 and optimal ps dosages 3 2 4 5 mm were found to be higher than those in the solar ps system fig a 10 implying lower energy consumption and secondary contamination of solar ps system 4 conclusions simulated solar irradiation was well combined with ps to decompose typical micropollutants effectively the following main results were creatively demonstrated in the research i the degradation of the four contaminants followed pseudo first order kinetics with removal percentages of 72 6 97 5 21 8 and 93 1 for asa fmme nb and ba respectively within 15 min at ph 7 0 with a ps dosage of 1 mm ii so4 contributed most to the degradation of asa and fmme 49 1 88 8 while oh played a minor role 10 3 and 6 1 the contributions of 1o2 4 6 45 5 to asa and fmme depletion varied with ph iii solar ps pre oxidation led to the decrease of thms and haas in nom only 54 34 and 48 83 respectively and nom pollutants 52 68 and 51 76 respectively systems indicating its facility for reducing dbps when pollutants coexist with nom iv aquatic toxicity analysis indicated that residual oxidant of ps in the system would lead to the inhibition of growth and reproduction of microalgae therefore in practical applications subsequent treatments should be seriously considered to combine with solar ps system to reduce negative impacts

16337,the sediment dissolved organic phosphorus dop for the internal phosphorus p loading has raised intensive concern but its bioavailability and intrinsic degradation mechanism have not been fully elucidated in this work multi techniques were combined to construct the response of sediments dop s bioavailability to molecular weight mw based on ten lakes of china thereby elucidating the intrinsic degradation mechanism of sediment dop a high percentage 74 5 on average and significantly positive correlations with respect to different mws were observed highlighting the importance of dop to dissolved p in sediments dop is mainly composed of a low mw lmw portion 63 8 and the substances are primarily derived from microbial sources bioavailable dop species were closely related to mw with labile monoester p and diester p decreased with decreasing mw analysis of environmental processes showed that microbial utilization capacity and the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom with different mws were the dominant drivers in determining the bioavailability of dop that is microorganisms exhibit high dom utilization capacity in lmw portion promoting the degradation and transformation of bioavailable dop species furthermore the increased humic and fulvic like substances by microbial degradation might in turn inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis of lmw dop this pattern explains why the contents of lmw dop are very high but it contains less bioavailable dop by studying the bioavailability of sediment dops with different mws it is found that under natural conditions labile monoester and diester p in lmw dop have a high tendency to degrade than those in hmw dop the results further show that microbial utilization and dom characteristics as well as their linkage with dop s bioavailability and degradability have important implications for assessing dop s degradation potential the insights from this study might shed light on more effective strategies for mitigating the risks of internal p loading graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic phosphorus bioavailability degradation mechanism molecular weight lake sediment

reduction of sediment phosphorus p loading has long been as a bottleneck in lake eutrophication control over the world horppila 2019 ma et al 2021 the diffusion and release of orthophosphate play a key role in sediment p release through ion exchange and molecular diffusion of orthophosphate engenders internal p loading seiki et al 1989 gardolinski et al 2004 though the orthophosphate is regarded as a favored p source the organic p op usually acts as the dominant part in lake sediments ding et al 2010 rofner et al 2016 ni et al 2016 the biogeochemical cycling of op is realized through the exchange of sediment water interface and microorganism algae and macrophyte life process feng et al 2018 wang et al 2019 due to the complexity in bioavailability and degradation op is generally treated as a refractory fraction ruban et al 1999 bai et al 2009 sediment dissolved op dop refers to the dop that can be extracted by water including op attached on solid sediment surfaces and in pore waters some recent studies have demonstrated that sediment dop is of high importance to biogeochemical cycle of p in aquatic ecosystems zhu et al 2013 ni et al 2021 duhamel et al 2021 however few studies have looked into the bioavailability and intrinsic degradation mechanisms of dop in lake sediments given that dop s bioavailability is usually considered as the most important basis for estimating potential risk of dop degradation zhu et al 2018 it is imperative to better understand the bioavailability and related dop degradation mechanisms in sediments so as to implement better control strategies for mitigating internal p loading the sediment dop is an intrinsic component of dissolved organic matter dom lü et al 2016 mackay et al 2020 as a basic property of dom molecular weight mw affects the composition and degradability of dom li et al 2019 kiikkila et al 2012 xu et al 2019 which could also influence the bioavailability of dop for example amon and benner 1992 showed that the bacterial growth rate and the respiration rate in water bodies with high mw dom hmw dom were respectively three and six times as high as that of low mw dom lmw dom in comparison young and ingall 2010 found that p esters with low mw are likely consisted of small carbohydrates and phosphoamino acids which is prone to bacterial utilization in marine ecosystems li et al 2019 noticed that in the sediments of lake taihu lmw dom mainly consists of humic and fulvic like substances which are resistant to degradation since they are not easily accessible to microorganisms hudson et al 2008 furthermore mclaren et al 2015 investigated soil samples from different countries and reported that the op with hmw was significantly different from that with lmw zheng 2018 demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of op to iron oxide was related to relative molecular mass of op with higher adsorption capacity in the lower molecular mass although many evidences from previous studies all point to the fact that mw plays an important role in the biogeochemical process of op little is known about the response mechanism between dop s bioavailability and its mw a better understanding of dop s dynamic response to mw as well as of internal drivers of dop s bioavailability and degradability in sediments will shed light on more effective strategies for reducing p loadings in lakes in this work we presume that the bioavailability and degradability of sediments dop are related to its mw characteristics we tested such hypothesis by conducting a detailed analysis on lake samples from two pilot regions namely the eastern plain and yun gui plateau of china both of which have typical high internal p loadings li et al 2015a moreover a a multi analytic approach is proposed where we combined ultrafiltration enzymatic hydrolysis uv vis absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques in order to 1 construct the response relationship between the abundance and bioavailability of dop to mw fractions 2 investigate the degradation mechanism of dop on the basis of mw and 3 assess the potential risk of sediment dop in local lake systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection the case study was conducted in the eastern plain and yun gui plateau of china which serve as natural barriers for regional ecological environment and buckets of resources to support rapid development of local social economy however a number of lakes here have been facing the threat of eutrophication and ecological degradation due to excessive external p inputs and enhanced release of internal p loads from sediments in recent years the eastern plain is mostly located in temperate and subtropical monsoon zones most of the lakes are as shallow as 3 meters deep in average with plentiful solar radiation and warm climate the yun gui plateau is located in subtropical monsoon area characterized by strong uv radiation due to high altitude a total of ten lakes from different regions were chosen in order to capture mw gradient along the study sites figure 1 shows the locations of sampled lakes which include six lakes in eastern plain region lake poyang lake taihu lake wuhan dong lake dianshan lake hengshui and lake baiyangdian and four lakes in yun gui plateau region lake lugu lake erhai lake dianchi and lake yilong respectively a detailed description of the limnological characteristics per lake is presented in table s1 in 2018 19 surface sediment samples were collected in the ten lakes the sample size and location is based on lake area and characteristics of pollutants right after the collection the samples were stored in airtight plastic bags at 4 c and immediately transported to laboratory the samples then were freeze dried grounded to powder and screened through a 100 mesh sieve to ensure homogeneity 2 2 extraction of dop the dried sediment samples were mixed with milli q water 18 2 mω cm millipore us solid liquid ratio of 1 10 on a thermostatic shaker 220 r min 1 for 16 h at 25 c the mixed solution were then centrifuged at 10 000 r min 1 for 10 min with the supernatant filtering through 0 45 μm glass fiber jinlong precombusted at 450 c the filtrate was collected and kept at 4 c for analysis 2 3 mw fractionation the dop and dom were separated into different fractions of mw fractions using ultrafiltration system milliporer usa to reduce the concentration difference in high mw fractions sequential extraction was adopted on subsequent ultrafiltration process using regenerated cellulose membrane pretreated by soaking in deionized water with nominal mw limits of 10 3 and 1 kda and were stored in a stirred ultrafiltration cup millipore 8400 the first 100 ml filtrate was discarded and the remaining was used for the following analysis after serial fractionation the filtrates were divided into four groups based on their mw ranges namely 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda respectively the contents of each parameter with different mw fractions were calculated according to eqs 1 to 3 ged and boyer 2013 1 ω 10 kda ω raw ω 10 kda 2 ω 3 10 kda ω 10 kda ω 3 kda 3 ω 1 3 kda ω 3 kda ω 1 kda where ω is the concentration of each parameter range sediment dop and dom were fractionated into hmw i e 1 kda and lmw i e 1 kda according to the ultrafiltration procedure by helms et al 2008 and xu et al 2019 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 physicochemical analysis the dissolved total phosphorus dtp content in the filtrate was estimated using a molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method after digestion 121 c 30 min in an autoclave with peroxydisulfuric acid soluble reactive phosphate srp was measured by molybdenum blue colorimetric method without digestion murphy and riley 1962 srp includes inorganic p and some acid hydrolysable organics but is usually referred to as dissolved inorganic p duhamel et al 2021 due to complex structure and variety of dop in environment the sediment dop content cannot be determined directly hence dop content was calculated as the difference between dtp and srp values the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000 japan 2 4 2 enzymatic hydrolysis procedures of dop following the procedure in zhu et al 2013 three main enzymes that are alkaline phosphatase apase diesterase pdease and phytase were chosen to characterize the bioavailable dop species namely labile monoester p diester p and phytate like p 2 4 3 excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy of dom eem spectroscopy is regarded as an effective method to identify the composition of dom birdwell and engel 2010 eem spectroscopy of the dom and its mw fractions were determined using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies japan in a quartz cuvette excitation and emission were simultaneously scanned at wavelengths ranging from 200 to 450 nm and from 250 to 600 nm respectively at a 5 nm interval eem values were estimated as the difference between sample results and blank milli q water values afterwards the eem were divided into five regions i v based on the range of excitation intensity ex and emission intensity em using the area integral method chen et al 2003 ahmad and reynolds 1999 region i ex 200 250 nm em 260 320 nm and region ii ex 200 250 nm em 320 380 nm represent simple aromatic

soluble microbial metabolites region ⅴ ex 250 450 nm em 380 nm corresponds to humic acid like organic substances 2 4 4 uv vis absorbance spectroscopy of dom uv vis spectroscopy has been widely employed in dom source and humification identification zhou and meng 2016 uv vis absorbance of the dom was measured with hach dr 5000 spectrophotometer hach usa at a wavelength range of 200 700 nm the slit width and wavelength scan rate were 1 nm and 210 nm min 1 respectively the ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and 260 nm suva260 were calculated as 100 times the ratio of uv vis absorbance at each respective wavelength to the concentration of doc the ratio between uv vis absorbance at 253 nm and that at 203 nm is denoted as a253 a203 2 5 data analysis and quality control data was processed and analyzed using orgin 2018 origin lab usa microsoft excel 2007 and spss 21 ibm armonk new york usa spiked duplicate field and blank samples were used as control groups one way analysis of variance was used to test the significance of difference among four mw fractions results with p value less than 0 05 were regarded as significant 3 results and discussions 3 1 sediment dop abundance and distribution response to mw fractions the dop ranging from 2 5 13 6 mg kg 1 6 4 mg kg 1 on average is the dominant part of dtp in the sediments accounting for 74 5 of dtp on average fig 2 furthermore sediment dop contents are significantly and positively correlated with the contents of dtp in different mws fig s1 with the correlation coefficients of 0 944 0 877 0 754 and 0 947 p 0 01 for mw 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1kda respectively thes results indicate that dop has a predominant role in the migration and transformation of dissolved p in lake sediments therefore the contribution of sediment dop on the internal p loading cannot be neglected figure 2 shows the mw distributions for sediment dtp srp dop and doc similar distribution is also observed among different mw fractions of dtp srp dop and doc dop exists mainly in the 1 kda fraction with percentage ranging from 25 2 to 94 4 63 8 in average while a relatively less proportion is observed in hmw fractions with percentage of 1 8 59 5 19 9 in average for 10 kda 0 3 42 3 10 0 in average for 3 10 kda and 1 4 19 1 6 2 in average for 1 3 kda respectively this is consistent with the results of ged and boyer 2013 who found that approximately 60 of dop falled in lmw category 1 kda in the water body of an everglades agricultural area this result indicates that in the lakes of eastern plain and yun gui plateau sediments dop exists mainly in lmw fraction a plausible explanation is that the sediments dop may have degraded producing more dop with lmw the warm climate in the eastern plain combined with strong ultraviolet light radiation due to high altitude in yun gui plateau creates favorable conditions for the degradation of organic molecules thus it is inferred that the large percentage of lmw dop results from the degradation of sediments op furthermore the lmw dop should be primarily derived from microbial source since lmw organic molecules were always linked to microbial source other than terrestrial ones xu et al 2019 lmw organic molecules are usually regarded as available parts for microorganisms and algae uptake he et al 2011 thus highlighting a huge degradation potential of dop as well as a high environmental risk from its release 3 2 response of dop enzymatic hydrolysis to mw fractions alkaline phosphatase is a widespread enzyme in water and sediments it plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycle of p by hydrolyzing op to orthophosphate a process called enzymatic hydrolysis labry et al 2005 zhou et al 2008 rofner et al 2016 which has developed into a major analytical technique in quantitative assessment of dop bioavailability in this work three kinds of active dop species namely labile monoester p diester p and phytate like p were hydrolyzed by apase pdease and phytase in different mws respectively see fig s2 the phytate like p is the inositol phosphate associated with protein humus and esters although known to be resistant to biodegradation bowman and cole 1978 in the results the phytate like p is the dominant dop fraction accounting for 6 1 88 6 34 5 on average of the total dop labile monoester p represents the active op in sediments and is the second dominant op fraction in the sampled sediments accounting for 2 9 23 7 12 6 on average of the total dop diester p includes mainly dna p rna p and phospholipid makarov et al 2002 accounting for 1 0 23 7 5 8 on average of the total dop such small fraction might be attributed to the high reactivity of the diester p ahlgren et al 2006 reported that the diester p in microorganisms would be rapidly degraded to monoester p or srp since microorganism s death the concentrations of enzymatic hydrolysable dop sum of labile monoester diester p and phytate like p ranges between 0 8 96 6 mg kg 1 accounting for 18 4 125 5 of the total dop with 52 8 on average almost half of dop can not be hydrolyzed by apase pdease and phytase this implies the complexity of its composition where many components in the dop are yet unknown therefore the composition and bioavailability of dop requires further investigations as mw decreases the content of labile monoester p in the sediments decreases fig 3 a d with average proportion of 46 0 26 8 13 2 and 14 0 for 10 kda 3 10 k da 1 3 kda and 1 kda respectively a similar pattern is found in diester p where the proportion of diester p decreases from 38 2 to 22 9 respectively as the mw fraction decreases from 10 kda to 1 kda compared with labile monoester p and diester p phytate like p showed little dependence on mw fractions with average proportion of 29 6 30 4 25 1 and 22 5 in 10 kda 3 10 k da 1 3 kda and 1 kda respectively this indicates that the mw plays more a significant role in active species of dop e g labile monoester p and diester p than that in the resistant ones phytate like p overall the contents of total dop from enzymatic hydrolysis show a decreasing trend with decreasing mw similar to the trend of labile monoester p and diester p in the sediments it is further revealed that the hydrolysable ratio of hmw dop is noticeably higher than that of lmw fig 3e f the relative percentages of labile monoester p diester p and phytate like p are 52 7 35 5 and 77 3 respectively in the 10 kda by contrast their relative percentages are only 3 3 1 7 and 13 1 in the 1 kda portion these results show that the lmw dop has a lower bioavailability than that of hmw portion the reasons might be two fold 1 lmw dop undergones a strong degradation process in natural conditions especially for active species e g labile monoester p and diester p leading to the decline of enzymatic hydrolysable dop content and 2 enzymatic hydrolysis might be inhibited by some materials in lmw dop although further evidences are needed 3 3 mw related drivers for the bioavailability and degradability of dop the composition and mineralization of om are the major processes determining the p bioavailability avnimelech et al 1984 zhu et al 2015 thus the influence of dom characteristics with different mw on the bioavailability of dop was analyzed to explore possible reasons 3 3 1 dom contents the mw distribution of doc in sediments is mainly concentrated in the lmw fraction with proportion of 44 7 94 9 81 8 on average in 1 kda portion fig 2 consistent with observations in other ecosystems such as lake water with 70 of doc in the 1 kda in lake michigan xu and guo 2017 sea water with almost 80 of doc in the 1 kda in northern gulf mexico xu and guo 2017 river water with 80 95 in the 1 kda in siberia rivers pokrovsky et al 2006 pore water from sediments with 60 90 in the 3 kda in chesapeake bay burdige and gardner 1998 the distributions of sediment doc in different mws are consistent with those of dop among the ten lakes fig 2 a statistically significant correlation can be confirmed among doc contents and labile monoester p diester p phytate like p as well as enzymatic hydrolysable dop in raw sediment samples see table 1 with the correlation coefficients being 0 468 0 564 0 654 and 0 721 p 0 05 respectively this suggests that the greater accumulation of dom in sediments the higher bioavailability of dop it would be for mw fraction contents of labile monoester p r 0 490 p 0 05 and enzymatic hydrolysable dop r 0 520 p 0 05 are significantly correlated with doc in the 1 kda portion though no significant relationship exists between diester p phytate like p and doc contents in the 1 kda portion the correlation coefficient is greater than that of other mw fractions this result suggests that the accumulation level of dom would positively impact the bioavailability of dop especially in lmw portion 3 3 2 eem spectroscopy the eem spectra changes of dom with different mws are shown in fig s3 and fig 4 the sediments dom in the samples mainly comprises fulvic humic acid like substances region iii and ⅳ 75 9 5 0 and soluble microbial byproduct material region iv 14 6 2 8 with a few tryptophan and tyrosine like compounds regions i and i 9 5 3 6 the ri ii n ratio decreases significantly as decreased mw with ratio of 10 4 4 1 7 3 2 7 and 7 1 2 9 in 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda respectively fig 4a table s3 instead the riv n ratio increases significantly as decreased mw with ratio of 15 0 2 6 17 3 3 0 and 18 0 3 1 in 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda respectively fig 4b table s3 these results can also be confirmed by the different locations of peaks within regions i ii and iv of the visual eem spectra the peaks within regions i ii gradually weaken but rise again in regions iv with the increases of mw fig s3 these results suggested that lmw dom contains more microbial metabolites but less protein than that of hmw portion a phenomenon attributed to microbial utilization generally macromolecular materials are hardly used by microorganisms he et al 2011 hur et al 2011 leading to more microbial metabolites in the lmw portion tyrosine and tryptophan are preferentially used by microorganism hur et al 2011 lee et al 2018 thereby the proteinaceous fluorescence peak is flattened by biodegradation especially in the lmw portion the rⅲ ⅴ n value remains stable as mw changes fig 4c which is largely attributed to the high stability of humic fulvic acid substances li et al 2015 and the low accessibility to microorganisms he et al 2011 the above results suggest that the mw plays a key role in dom degradation through microbial utilization as the inherent part of dom the bioavailable dop in the lmw portion undergoes a stronger biodegradation this may partially explain why the contents of lmw dop are very high but it contains less bioavailable dop e g labile monoester p diester p since parts of bioavailable dop have already been consumed by microbial metabolism 3 3 3 uv vis spectroscopy the results of uv vis spectroscopy analysis are shown in fig s4 and fig 4 d f suva254 reflects the sources and hydrophilic properities of dom previous studies showed that the suva254 value ranging between 0 6 and 5 3 implies humic substances while a lower value indicates microbial sources weishaar et al 2003 a suva254 value less than 3 indicates that the dom contains a specific hydrophilic substance matilainen et al 2011 in this study the suva254 values for dom of different mws are all significantly lower than 0 2 indicating that the sediment dom is primarily derived from microbial sources and it mainly consists of hydrophilic substances this may explain why the sediment dom and dop mainly exist in lmw portion 1 kda since microbial dom is usually correspondent to lmw while terrigenous material can enhance the accumulation of hmw om shi et al 2013 xu et al 2019 suva254 value is related to humification and aromaticity of dom with large suva254 values indicating a strong degree of humification and aromaticity yeh et al 2014 the suva254 values increase with decreasing mw i e 0 091 0 031 0 096 0 032 0 107 0 039 and 0 110 0 041 for the mw in raw 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda fraction respectively fig 4d f indicating that the lower mw dom has stronger aromaticity and degree of humification this is consistent with the results of xu et al 2019 who conducted dom analysis in lake taihu and demonstrated that lmw dom has higher suva254 values than that of hmw dom the higher suva254 value in lmw dom is related to microbial biodegradation because non aromatic moieties are preferentially utilized by microorganisms or and labile compounds are transformed into aromatic carbon structures hur et al 2009 hur et al 2011 suva260 represents the proportion of hydrophobic substances in dom with a large value corresponding a high hydrophobicity jaffrain et al 2007 the suva260 value increases as the mw decreases with values of 0 086 0 029 0 091 0 030 0 102 0 037 and 0 105 0 039 from raw to 1 kda respectively indicating that the lmw dom contains more hydrophobic substances than that of hmw one this is because hydrophobic material is less accessible to microbial degradation than hydrophilic compounds thereby enhancing the hydrophobicity in lmw dom deng et al 2021 kalbitz et al 2003 the a253 a203 ratio can be used to infer the number of functional groups and substituents with a high ratio impling a high concentration of substitution groups li et al 2014 the a253 a203 ratio increases with decreasing mw i e 0 257 0 053 0 258 0 055 0 278 0 060 and 0 275 0 062 in raw 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda fraction respectively this suggested that the lmw dom contains higher concentration of substitution groups than that of hmw dom regarding the correlation there is a negative relationship between suva254 suva260 values and enzymatic hydrolysable dop contents in the raw sediment samples r suva254 0 647 r suva260 0 651 p 0 01 table 2 similarly significant negative correlation exists between suva254 suva260 values and enzymatic hydrolysable dop in the mw 10 kda portion humic bound p is usually resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis brannon and sommers 1985 crecchio and stotzky 1998 zhu et al 2015 thus the higher degree of humification and hydrophobicity of dom in sediments the less enzymatic hydrolysable dop it will be there is no significant relationship between suva254 suva260 values and enzymatic hydrolysable dop contents in lmw fractions e g 3 kda and 1 kda which could be attributed to the high resistance of enzymatic hydrolysis by humus and hydrophobic material in lmw dom furthermore despite that the correlation were not strong the a253 a203 ratios all show negative correlation with enzymatic hydrolysable dop contents in different mw fractions suggesting that functional groups may increase adsorption of p and form more stable dop thereby resisting enzymatic hydrolysis therefore the degree of humification hydrophobicity and the number of functional groups may be another reason to explain the decreasing bioavailability of dop in lmw 3 4 environmental implications this study provides strong evidence that dop s bioavailability and degradability are directly linked to its mw environmental processes analysis shows that lmw dop especially bioavailable species such as labile monoester p and diester p can be more easily degraded and transformed by microorganism in natural conditions instead hmw bioavailable dop is not likely to be used and hence remains in sediments in other words under natural conditions labile monoester and diester p in lmw dop have a high tendency to degrade than those in hmw dop furthermore an increase of humic and fulvic like substances higher suva254 through microbial degradation would inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis of lmw dop crecchio and stotzky 1998 zhu et al 2015 these explain the decrease in the enzymatic hydrolysable dop contents with decreasing mw in sediments and might be an important mechanism in the dop degradation fig 5 zhu et al 2013 showed that the biogeochemical cycle of bioavailable op might play a key role in maintaining the eutrophic status of lakes figure 6 gives an overview of the changes of sediment dop and bioavailable dop with different mws from lakes of various trophic levels in general lake with high trophic levels is characterized by high dop contents and bioavailable dop in sediments this is mainly because the sedimentation of organic materials increases with lake eutrophication higher trophic level lakes usually feature high biodegradation as well due to abundant microorganisms and alkaline phosphatase wobus et al 2003 chen et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 adamovich et al 2019 as a result bioavailable dop presents as a potential threat to lake ecosystem due to the p release from sediments therefore bioavailable dop from sediments should be taken care of to reduce potential environmental hazards 4 conclusions this study examined the importance of dop in the internal p loading ultrafiltration enzymatic hydrolysis uv vis absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques were combined to explore the bioavailability and intrinsic degradability of dop in lake sediments the results show that dop is the dominant dissolved p in sediments 74 5 average with the correlation coefficents of 0 944 0 877 0 754 and 0 947 p 0 01 in mw 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda dop is mainly composed of lmw portion 63 8 and substances are primarily derived from microbial sources the massive storage of dop plays as a predominant role in the migration and transformation of dissolved p and has a great degradation potential bioavailable dop species are more closely related to mw fractions e g labile monoester p and diester p as the enzymatic hydrolysis decreases with decreasing mw phytate like p instead shows little dependence on mw the dual influences of microbial utilization capacity and characteristics of dom with different mws are dominant drivers in determining the bioavailability of dop microorganisms exhibit high dom utilization capacity in lmw portion which promotes the degradation and transformation of bioavailable dop species as a result the increased humic and fulvic like substances and functional groups by microbial degradation might inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis of lmw dop this pattern might imply an important mechanism in the dop bioavailability and degradation by studying the bioavailability of sediment dops with different mws it is found that under natural conditions labile monoester and diester p in lmw dop have a high tendency to degrade than those in hmw dop therefore this work provides novel insights to understanding bioavailability and intrinsic degradability of dop from lake sediment appendix a supplementary

16337,the sediment dissolved organic phosphorus dop for the internal phosphorus p loading has raised intensive concern but its bioavailability and intrinsic degradation mechanism have not been fully elucidated in this work multi techniques were combined to construct the response of sediments dop s bioavailability to molecular weight mw based on ten lakes of china thereby elucidating the intrinsic degradation mechanism of sediment dop a high percentage 74 5 on average and significantly positive correlations with respect to different mws were observed highlighting the importance of dop to dissolved p in sediments dop is mainly composed of a low mw lmw portion 63 8 and the substances are primarily derived from microbial sources bioavailable dop species were closely related to mw with labile monoester p and diester p decreased with decreasing mw analysis of environmental processes showed that microbial utilization capacity and the characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom with different mws were the dominant drivers in determining the bioavailability of dop that is microorganisms exhibit high dom utilization capacity in lmw portion promoting the degradation and transformation of bioavailable dop species furthermore the increased humic and fulvic like substances by microbial degradation might in turn inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis of lmw dop this pattern explains why the contents of lmw dop are very high but it contains less bioavailable dop by studying the bioavailability of sediment dops with different mws it is found that under natural conditions labile monoester and diester p in lmw dop have a high tendency to degrade than those in hmw dop the results further show that microbial utilization and dom characteristics as well as their linkage with dop s bioavailability and degradability have important implications for assessing dop s degradation potential the insights from this study might shed light on more effective strategies for

reduction of sediment phosphorus p loading has long been as a bottleneck in lake eutrophication control over the world horppila 2019 ma et al 2021 the diffusion and release of orthophosphate play a key role in sediment p release through ion exchange and molecular diffusion of orthophosphate engenders internal p loading seiki et al 1989 gardolinski et al 2004 though the orthophosphate is regarded as a favored p source the organic p op usually acts as the dominant part in lake sediments ding et al 2010 rofner et al 2016 ni et al 2016 the biogeochemical cycling of op is realized through the exchange of sediment water interface and microorganism algae and macrophyte life process feng et al 2018 wang et al 2019 due to the complexity in bioavailability and degradation op is generally treated as a refractory fraction ruban et al 1999 bai et al 2009 sediment dissolved op dop refers to the dop that can be extracted by water including op attached on solid sediment surfaces and in pore waters some recent studies have demonstrated that sediment dop is of high importance to biogeochemical cycle of p in aquatic ecosystems zhu et al 2013 ni et al 2021 duhamel et al 2021 however few studies have looked into the bioavailability and intrinsic degradation mechanisms of dop in lake sediments given that dop s bioavailability is usually considered as the most important basis for estimating potential risk of dop degradation zhu et al 2018 it is imperative to better understand the bioavailability and related dop degradation mechanisms in sediments so as to implement better control strategies for mitigating internal p loading the sediment dop is an intrinsic component of dissolved organic matter dom lü et al 2016 mackay et al 2020 as a basic property of dom molecular weight mw affects the composition and degradability of dom li et al 2019 kiikkila et al 2012 xu et al 2019 which could also influence the bioavailability of dop for example amon and benner 1992 showed that the bacterial growth rate and the respiration rate in water bodies with high mw dom hmw dom were respectively three and six times as high as that of low mw dom lmw dom in comparison young and ingall 2010 found that p esters with low mw are likely consisted of small carbohydrates and phosphoamino acids which is prone to bacterial utilization in marine ecosystems li et al 2019 noticed that in the sediments of lake taihu lmw dom mainly consists of humic and fulvic like substances which are resistant to degradation since they are not easily accessible to microorganisms hudson et al 2008 furthermore mclaren et al 2015 investigated soil samples from different countries and reported that the op with hmw was significantly different from that with lmw zheng 2018 demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of op to iron oxide was related to relative molecular mass of op with higher adsorption capacity in the lower molecular mass although many evidences from previous studies all point to the fact that mw plays an important role in the biogeochemical process of op little is known about the response mechanism between dop s bioavailability and its mw a better understanding of dop s dynamic response to mw as well as of internal drivers of dop s bioavailability and degradability in sediments will shed light on more effective strategies for reducing p loadings in lakes in this work we presume that the bioavailability and degradability of sediments dop are related to its mw characteristics we tested such hypothesis by conducting a detailed analysis on lake samples from two pilot regions namely the eastern plain and yun gui plateau of china both of which have typical high internal p loadings li et al 2015a moreover a a multi analytic approach is proposed where we combined ultrafiltration enzymatic hydrolysis uv vis absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques in order to 1 construct the response relationship between the abundance and bioavailability of dop to mw fractions 2 investigate the degradation mechanism of dop on the basis of mw and 3 assess the potential risk of sediment dop in local lake systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection the case study was conducted in the eastern plain and yun gui plateau of china which serve as natural barriers for regional ecological environment and buckets of resources to support rapid development of local social economy however a number of lakes here have been facing the threat of eutrophication and ecological degradation due to excessive external p inputs and enhanced release of internal p loads from sediments in recent years the eastern plain is mostly located in temperate and subtropical monsoon zones most of the lakes are as shallow as 3 meters deep in average with plentiful solar radiation and warm climate the yun gui plateau is located in subtropical monsoon area characterized by strong uv radiation due to high altitude a total of ten lakes from different regions were chosen in order to capture mw gradient along the study sites figure 1 shows the locations of sampled lakes which include six lakes in eastern plain region lake poyang lake taihu lake wuhan dong lake dianshan lake hengshui and lake baiyangdian and four lakes in yun gui plateau region lake lugu lake erhai lake dianchi and lake yilong respectively a detailed description of the limnological characteristics per lake is presented in table s1 in 2018 19 surface sediment samples were collected in the ten lakes the sample size and location is based on lake area and characteristics of pollutants right after the collection the samples were stored in airtight plastic bags at 4 c and immediately transported to laboratory the samples then were freeze dried grounded to powder and screened through a 100 mesh sieve to ensure homogeneity 2 2 extraction of dop the dried sediment samples were mixed with milli q water 18 2 mω cm millipore us solid liquid ratio of 1 10 on a thermostatic shaker 220 r min 1 for 16 h at 25 c the mixed solution were then centrifuged at 10 000 r min 1 for 10 min with the supernatant filtering through 0 45 μm glass fiber jinlong precombusted at 450 c the filtrate was collected and kept at 4 c for analysis 2 3 mw fractionation the dop and dom were separated into different fractions of mw fractions using ultrafiltration system milliporer usa to reduce the concentration difference in high mw fractions sequential extraction was adopted on subsequent ultrafiltration process using regenerated cellulose membrane pretreated by soaking in deionized water with nominal mw limits of 10 3 and 1 kda and were stored in a stirred ultrafiltration cup millipore 8400 the first 100 ml filtrate was discarded and the remaining was used for the following analysis after serial fractionation the filtrates were divided into four groups based on their mw ranges namely 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda respectively the contents of each parameter with different mw fractions were calculated according to eqs 1 to 3 ged and boyer 2013 1 ω 10 kda ω raw ω 10 kda 2 ω 3 10 kda ω 10 kda ω 3 kda 3 ω 1 3 kda ω 3 kda ω 1 kda where ω is the concentration of each parameter range sediment dop and dom were fractionated into hmw i e 1 kda and lmw i e 1 kda according to the ultrafiltration procedure by helms et al 2008 and xu et al 2019 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 physicochemical analysis the dissolved total phosphorus dtp content in the filtrate was estimated using a molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method after digestion 121 c 30 min in an autoclave with peroxydisulfuric acid soluble reactive phosphate srp was measured by molybdenum blue colorimetric method without digestion murphy and riley 1962 srp includes inorganic p and some acid hydrolysable organics but is usually referred to as dissolved inorganic p duhamel et al 2021 due to complex structure and variety of dop in environment the sediment dop content cannot be determined directly hence dop content was calculated as the difference between dtp and srp values the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc 5000 japan 2 4 2 enzymatic hydrolysis procedures of dop following the procedure in zhu et al 2013 three main enzymes that are alkaline phosphatase apase diesterase pdease and phytase were chosen to characterize the bioavailable dop species namely labile monoester p diester p and phytate like p 2 4 3 excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy of dom eem spectroscopy is regarded as an effective method to identify the composition of dom birdwell and engel 2010 eem spectroscopy of the dom and its mw fractions were determined using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies japan in a quartz cuvette excitation and emission were simultaneously scanned at wavelengths ranging from 200 to 450 nm and from 250 to 600 nm respectively at a 5 nm interval eem values were estimated as the difference between sample results and blank milli q water values afterwards the eem were divided into five regions i v based on the range of excitation intensity ex and emission intensity em using the area integral method chen et al 2003 ahmad and reynolds 1999 region i ex 200 250 nm em 260 320 nm and region ii ex 200 250 nm em 320 380 nm represent simple aromatic

soluble microbial metabolites region ⅴ ex 250 450 nm em 380 nm corresponds to humic acid like organic substances 2 4 4 uv vis absorbance spectroscopy of dom uv vis spectroscopy has been widely employed in dom source and humification identification zhou and meng 2016 uv vis absorbance of the dom was measured with hach dr 5000 spectrophotometer hach usa at a wavelength range of 200 700 nm the slit width and wavelength scan rate were 1 nm and 210 nm min 1 respectively the ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and 260 nm suva260 were calculated as 100 times the ratio of uv vis absorbance at each respective wavelength to the concentration of doc the ratio between uv vis absorbance at 253 nm and that at 203 nm is denoted as a253 a203 2 5 data analysis and quality control data was processed and analyzed using orgin 2018 origin lab usa microsoft excel 2007 and spss 21 ibm armonk new york usa spiked duplicate field and blank samples were used as control groups one way analysis of variance was used to test the significance of difference among four mw fractions results with p value less than 0 05 were regarded as significant 3 results and discussions 3 1 sediment dop abundance and distribution response to mw fractions the dop ranging from 2 5 13 6 mg kg 1 6 4 mg kg 1 on average is the dominant part of dtp in the sediments accounting for 74 5 of dtp on average fig 2 furthermore sediment dop contents are significantly and positively correlated with the contents of dtp in different mws fig s1 with the correlation coefficients of 0 944 0 877 0 754 and 0 947 p 0 01 for mw 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1kda respectively thes results indicate that dop has a predominant role in the migration and transformation of dissolved p in lake sediments therefore the contribution of sediment dop on the internal p loading cannot be neglected figure 2 shows the mw distributions for sediment dtp srp dop and doc similar distribution is also observed among different mw fractions of dtp srp dop and doc dop exists mainly in the 1 kda fraction with percentage ranging from 25 2 to 94 4 63 8 in average while a relatively less proportion is observed in hmw fractions with percentage of 1 8 59 5 19 9 in average for 10 kda 0 3 42 3 10 0 in average for 3 10 kda and 1 4 19 1 6 2 in average for 1 3 kda respectively this is consistent with the results of ged and boyer 2013 who found that approximately 60 of dop falled in lmw category 1 kda in the water body of an everglades agricultural area this result indicates that in the lakes of eastern plain and yun gui plateau sediments dop exists mainly in lmw fraction a plausible explanation is that the sediments dop may have degraded producing more dop with lmw the warm climate in the eastern plain combined with strong ultraviolet light radiation due to high altitude in yun gui plateau creates favorable conditions for the degradation of organic molecules thus it is inferred that the large percentage of lmw dop results from the degradation of sediments op furthermore the lmw dop should be primarily derived from microbial source since lmw organic molecules were always linked to microbial source other than terrestrial ones xu et al 2019 lmw organic molecules are usually regarded as available parts for microorganisms and algae uptake he et al 2011 thus highlighting a huge degradation potential of dop as well as a high environmental risk from its release 3 2 response of dop enzymatic hydrolysis to mw fractions alkaline phosphatase is a widespread enzyme in water and sediments it plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycle of p by hydrolyzing op to orthophosphate a process called enzymatic hydrolysis labry et al 2005 zhou et al 2008 rofner et al 2016 which has developed into a major analytical technique in quantitative assessment of dop bioavailability in this work three kinds of active dop species namely labile monoester p diester p and phytate like p were hydrolyzed by apase pdease and phytase in different mws respectively see fig s2 the phytate like p is the inositol phosphate associated with protein humus and esters although known to be resistant to biodegradation bowman and cole 1978 in the results the phytate like p is the dominant dop fraction accounting for 6 1 88 6 34 5 on average of the total dop labile monoester p represents the active op in sediments and is the second dominant op fraction in the sampled sediments accounting for 2 9 23 7 12 6 on average of the total dop diester p includes mainly dna p rna p and phospholipid makarov et al 2002 accounting for 1 0 23 7 5 8 on average of the total dop such small fraction might be attributed to the high reactivity of the diester p ahlgren et al 2006 reported that the diester p in microorganisms would be rapidly degraded to monoester p or srp since microorganism s death the concentrations of enzymatic hydrolysable dop sum of labile monoester diester p and phytate like p ranges between 0 8 96 6 mg kg 1 accounting for 18 4 125 5 of the total dop with 52 8 on average almost half of dop can not be hydrolyzed by apase pdease and phytase this implies the complexity of its composition where many components in the dop are yet unknown therefore the composition and bioavailability of dop requires further investigations as mw decreases the content of labile monoester p in the sediments decreases fig 3 a d with average proportion of 46 0 26 8 13 2 and 14 0 for 10 kda 3 10 k da 1 3 kda and 1 kda respectively a similar pattern is found in diester p where the proportion of diester p decreases from 38 2 to 22 9 respectively as the mw fraction decreases from 10 kda to 1 kda compared with labile monoester p and diester p phytate like p showed little dependence on mw fractions with average proportion of 29 6 30 4 25 1 and 22 5 in 10 kda 3 10 k da 1 3 kda and 1 kda respectively this indicates that the mw plays more a significant role in active species of dop e g labile monoester p and diester p than that in the resistant ones phytate like p overall the contents of total dop from enzymatic hydrolysis show a decreasing trend with decreasing mw similar to the trend of labile monoester p and diester p in the sediments it is further revealed that the hydrolysable ratio of hmw dop is noticeably higher than that of lmw fig 3e f the relative percentages of labile monoester p diester p and phytate like p are 52 7 35 5 and 77 3 respectively in the 10 kda by contrast their relative percentages are only 3 3 1 7 and 13 1 in the 1 kda portion these results show that the lmw dop has a lower bioavailability than that of hmw portion the reasons might be two fold 1 lmw dop undergones a strong degradation process in natural conditions especially for active species e g labile monoester p and diester p leading to the decline of enzymatic hydrolysable dop content and 2 enzymatic hydrolysis might be inhibited by some materials in lmw dop although further evidences are needed 3 3 mw related drivers for the bioavailability and degradability of dop the composition and mineralization of om are the major processes determining the p bioavailability avnimelech et al 1984 zhu et al 2015 thus the influence of dom characteristics with different mw on the bioavailability of dop was analyzed to explore possible reasons 3 3 1 dom contents the mw distribution of doc in sediments is mainly concentrated in the lmw fraction with proportion of 44 7 94 9 81 8 on average in 1 kda portion fig 2 consistent with observations in other ecosystems such as lake water with 70 of doc in the 1 kda in lake michigan xu and guo 2017 sea water with almost 80 of doc in the 1 kda in northern gulf mexico xu and guo 2017 river water with 80 95 in the 1 kda in siberia rivers pokrovsky et al 2006 pore water from sediments with 60 90 in the 3 kda in chesapeake bay burdige and gardner 1998 the distributions of sediment doc in different mws are consistent with those of dop among the ten lakes fig 2 a statistically significant correlation can be confirmed among doc contents and labile monoester p diester p phytate like p as well as enzymatic hydrolysable dop in raw sediment samples see table 1 with the correlation coefficients being 0 468 0 564 0 654 and 0 721 p 0 05 respectively this suggests that the greater accumulation of dom in sediments the higher bioavailability of dop it would be for mw fraction contents of labile monoester p r 0 490 p 0 05 and enzymatic hydrolysable dop r 0 520 p 0 05 are significantly correlated with doc in the 1 kda portion though no significant relationship exists between diester p phytate like p and doc contents in the 1 kda portion the correlation coefficient is greater than that of other mw fractions this result suggests that the accumulation level of dom would positively impact the bioavailability of dop especially in lmw portion 3 3 2 eem spectroscopy the eem spectra changes of dom with different mws are shown in fig s3 and fig 4 the sediments dom in the samples mainly comprises fulvic humic acid like substances region iii and ⅳ 75 9 5 0 and soluble microbial byproduct material region iv 14 6 2 8 with a few tryptophan and tyrosine like compounds regions i and i 9 5 3 6 the ri ii n ratio decreases significantly as decreased mw with ratio of 10 4 4 1 7 3 2 7 and 7 1 2 9 in 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda respectively fig 4a table s3 instead the riv n ratio increases significantly as decreased mw with ratio of 15 0 2 6 17 3 3 0 and 18 0 3 1 in 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda respectively fig 4b table s3 these results can also be confirmed by the different locations of peaks within regions i ii and iv of the visual eem spectra the peaks within regions i ii gradually weaken but rise again in regions iv with the increases of mw fig s3 these results suggested that lmw dom contains more microbial metabolites but less protein than that of hmw portion a phenomenon attributed to microbial utilization generally macromolecular materials are hardly used by microorganisms he et al 2011 hur et al 2011 leading to more microbial metabolites in the lmw portion tyrosine and tryptophan are preferentially used by microorganism hur et al 2011 lee et al 2018 thereby the proteinaceous fluorescence peak is flattened by biodegradation especially in the lmw portion the rⅲ ⅴ n value remains stable as mw changes fig 4c which is largely attributed to the high stability of humic fulvic acid substances li et al 2015 and the low accessibility to microorganisms he et al 2011 the above results suggest that the mw plays a key role in dom degradation through microbial utilization as the inherent part of dom the bioavailable dop in the lmw portion undergoes a stronger biodegradation this may partially explain why the contents of lmw dop are very high but it contains less bioavailable dop e g labile monoester p diester p since parts of bioavailable dop have already been consumed by microbial metabolism 3 3 3 uv vis spectroscopy the results of uv vis spectroscopy analysis are shown in fig s4 and fig 4 d f suva254 reflects the sources and hydrophilic properities of dom previous studies showed that the suva254 value ranging between 0 6 and 5 3 implies humic substances while a lower value indicates microbial sources weishaar et al 2003 a suva254 value less than 3 indicates that the dom contains a specific hydrophilic substance matilainen et al 2011 in this study the suva254 values for dom of different mws are all significantly lower than 0 2 indicating that the sediment dom is primarily derived from microbial sources and it mainly consists of hydrophilic substances this may explain why the sediment dom and dop mainly exist in lmw portion 1 kda since microbial dom is usually correspondent to lmw while terrigenous material can enhance the accumulation of hmw om shi et al 2013 xu et al 2019 suva254 value is related to humification and aromaticity of dom with large suva254 values indicating a strong degree of humification and aromaticity yeh et al 2014 the suva254 values increase with decreasing mw i e 0 091 0 031 0 096 0 032 0 107 0 039 and 0 110 0 041 for the mw in raw 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda fraction respectively fig 4d f indicating that the lower mw dom has stronger aromaticity and degree of humification this is consistent with the results of xu et al 2019 who conducted dom analysis in lake taihu and demonstrated that lmw dom has higher suva254 values than that of hmw dom the higher suva254 value in lmw dom is related to microbial biodegradation because non aromatic moieties are preferentially utilized by microorganisms or and labile compounds are transformed into aromatic carbon structures hur et al 2009 hur et al 2011 suva260 represents the proportion of hydrophobic substances in dom with a large value corresponding a high hydrophobicity jaffrain et al 2007 the suva260 value increases as the mw decreases with values of 0 086 0 029 0 091 0 030 0 102 0 037 and 0 105 0 039 from raw to 1 kda respectively indicating that the lmw dom contains more hydrophobic substances than that of hmw one this is because hydrophobic material is less accessible to microbial degradation than hydrophilic compounds thereby enhancing the hydrophobicity in lmw dom deng et al 2021 kalbitz et al 2003 the a253 a203 ratio can be used to infer the number of functional groups and substituents with a high ratio impling a high concentration of substitution groups li et al 2014 the a253 a203 ratio increases with decreasing mw i e 0 257 0 053 0 258 0 055 0 278 0 060 and 0 275 0 062 in raw 10 kda 3 kda and 1 kda fraction respectively this suggested that the lmw dom contains higher concentration of substitution groups than that of hmw dom regarding the correlation there is a negative relationship between suva254 suva260 values and enzymatic hydrolysable dop contents in the raw sediment samples r suva254 0 647 r suva260 0 651 p 0 01 table 2 similarly significant negative correlation exists between suva254 suva260 values and enzymatic hydrolysable dop in the mw 10 kda portion humic bound p is usually resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis brannon and sommers 1985 crecchio and stotzky 1998 zhu et al 2015 thus the higher degree of humification and hydrophobicity of dom in sediments the less enzymatic hydrolysable dop it will be there is no significant relationship between suva254 suva260 values and enzymatic hydrolysable dop contents in lmw fractions e g 3 kda and 1 kda which could be attributed to the high resistance of enzymatic hydrolysis by humus and hydrophobic material in lmw dom furthermore despite that the correlation were not strong the a253 a203 ratios all show negative correlation with enzymatic hydrolysable dop contents in different mw fractions suggesting that functional groups may increase adsorption of p and form more stable dop thereby resisting enzymatic hydrolysis therefore the degree of humification hydrophobicity and the number of functional groups may be another reason to explain the decreasing bioavailability of dop in lmw 3 4 environmental implications this study provides strong evidence that dop s bioavailability and degradability are directly linked to its mw environmental processes analysis shows that lmw dop especially bioavailable species such as labile monoester p and diester p can be more easily degraded and transformed by microorganism in natural conditions instead hmw bioavailable dop is not likely to be used and hence remains in sediments in other words under natural conditions labile monoester and diester p in lmw dop have a high tendency to degrade than those in hmw dop furthermore an increase of humic and fulvic like substances higher suva254 through microbial degradation would inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis of lmw dop crecchio and stotzky 1998 zhu et al 2015 these explain the decrease in the enzymatic hydrolysable dop contents with decreasing mw in sediments and might be an important mechanism in the dop degradation fig 5 zhu et al 2013 showed that the biogeochemical cycle of bioavailable op might play a key role in maintaining the eutrophic status of lakes figure 6 gives an overview of the changes of sediment dop and bioavailable dop with different mws from lakes of various trophic levels in general lake with high trophic levels is characterized by high dop contents and bioavailable dop in sediments this is mainly because the sedimentation of organic materials increases with lake eutrophication higher trophic level lakes usually feature high biodegradation as well due to abundant microorganisms and alkaline phosphatase wobus et al 2003 chen et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 adamovich et al 2019 as a result bioavailable dop presents as a potential threat to lake ecosystem due to the p release from sediments therefore bioavailable dop from sediments should be taken care of to reduce potential environmental hazards 4 conclusions this study examined the importance of dop in the internal p loading ultrafiltration enzymatic hydrolysis uv vis absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques were combined to explore the bioavailability and intrinsic degradability of dop in lake sediments the results show that dop is the dominant dissolved p in sediments 74 5 average with the correlation coefficents of 0 944 0 877 0 754 and 0 947 p 0 01 in mw 10 kda 3 10 kda 1 3 kda and 1 kda dop is mainly composed of lmw portion 63 8 and substances are primarily derived from microbial sources the massive storage of dop plays as a predominant role in the migration and transformation of dissolved p and has a great degradation potential bioavailable dop species are more closely related to mw fractions e g labile monoester p and diester p as the enzymatic hydrolysis decreases with decreasing mw phytate like p instead shows little dependence on mw the dual influences of microbial utilization capacity and characteristics of dom with different mws are dominant drivers in determining the bioavailability of dop microorganisms exhibit high dom utilization capacity in lmw portion which promotes the degradation and transformation of bioavailable dop species as a result the increased humic and fulvic like substances and functional groups by microbial degradation might inhibit the enzymatic hydrolysis of lmw dop this pattern might imply an important mechanism in the dop bioavailability and degradation by studying the bioavailability of sediment dops with different mws it is found that under natural conditions labile monoester and diester p in lmw dop have a high tendency to degrade than those in hmw dop therefore this work provides novel insights to understanding bioavailability and intrinsic degradability of dop from lake sediment appendix a supplementary

16338,governments have formulated stricter wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharge standards to address water pollution however with the cost of aggravating the refractory of the discharges these policies are not in line with the classic co metabolism theory thus we evaluated the effects of an easily biodegradable substrate on the removal efficiency of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args in the receiving water in this study reactor with 8 d of hydraulic retention time hrt was constructed to simulate a receiving river and several antibiotics 0 30 mg l each were continuously discharged to the reactor tetracycline ciprofloxacin amoxicillin chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole sodium acetate naac was used as a representative easily biodegradable substrate and treatment protocols with and without a co substrate were compared the attenuation of the antibiotics in the simulated river and the production and dissemination of args were analyzed the results showed that 50 mg l naac activated non specific enzymes a log2 fold change of 3 1 8 8 compared with 0 mg l naac the removal rate of the antibiotics was increased by 4 32 and the toxicity of the downstream water was reduced by 35 the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes caused the intracellular reactive oxygen species ross decreased by up to 47 inhibiting horizontal gene transfer and reducing mobile genetic element mediated args margs by 18 56 furthermore naac also increased the alpha diversity of the microbial community by 5 15 shannon wiener index and reduced the abundance of human bacterial pathogens by 22 36 in summary easily biodegradable substrates in the receiving water are crucial for reducing antibiotic risk graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords easily biodegradable substrates antibiotic antibiotic resistance genes transfer antioxidant enzymes human bacterial pathogens 1 introduction humanity is in a critical transition from industrial to ecological civilization gao 2019 and has to balance industrial pollution and environmental quality xiao and zhao 2017 antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args are two emerging pollutants attracting substantial attention kumar et al 2019 dozens of antibiotics have been detected in surface water groundwater sediments and soil at concentrations of ng μg l globally anh et al 2021 danner et al 2019 li et al 2018 liu et al 2018 eight antibiotics primarily tetracyclines and sulfonamides were detected in the yangtze river china s mother river guo et al 2019 effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps are significant sources of antibiotics and args in surface water zhang et al 2020b trace antibiotics and args have also been detected frequently in the drinking water of different countries due to the water cycle e g usa china france and south korea charuaud et al 2019 hanna et al 2018 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 xu et al 2021 although these low concentration antibiotics are unlikely to pose a threat to human health in the short term the resulting args that have caused tens of thousands of deaths in different countries every year should not to be underestimated cassini et al 2019 cdc 2019 wwtps usually achieve moderate removal rates 48 77 for antibiotics the rate depends significantly on the antibiotic structure michael et al 2013 oberoi et al 2019 due to the high microbial density of the activated sludge or biofilms in wwtps they have become petri dishes for the production and transmission of args pazda et al 2019 in spite of this biological processes are currently the most popular wastewater treatment process zhang et al 2016 in the last decade governments endeavored to formulate stricter wastewater discharge standards of wwtps to solve water pollution issues mee 2002 logar et al 2014 for example chinese government has implemented successively stricter discharge standards from class ii to class i a and even stricter district standards as shown in table 1 however the upgradation of wwtps typically resulted in dropping the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand bod cod in the effluents so that the remaining cod concentration was quiet refractory even though it did not exceed the limit verlicchi et al 2011 specifically wwtps upgrades reduced the proportion of easily biodegradable substrates but increased the proportion of refractory organic pollutants in the effluent resulting in difficulties to reduce the pollutant concentration in the receiving water it has been debated whether stricter sewage discharge standards result in positive environmental benefits smith et al 2019 wang et al 2015 as mentioned above the impact of fewer easily biodegradable substrates in the effluent on the natural attenuation of refractory organic pollutants should be investigated interestingly co metabolism plays a crucial role in improving refractory organic degradation bai et al 2015 tran et al 2018 xiong et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a and easily biodegradable substrates are essential in the co metabolism strategy they serve as electron donors hou et al 2019 and upregulate non specific enzymes yin et al 2020 zumstein and helbling 2019 in this context we hypothesized that the presence of easily biodegradable substrates in water could reduce refractory organic pollutants they could potentially remove intracellular reactive oxygen species ross by upregulating antioxidant enzymes vo et al 2020 thereby preventing the horizontal gene transfer hgt of args wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b 2017 based on the co metabolism theory we deduce that appropriate amounts of easily biodegradable substrates in the wwtp effluents may reduce antibiotic concentration and prevent the production and transmission of args in the receiving water to test this hypothesis we used sodium acetate naac as a model easily biodegradable substrate and tetracycline tch ciprofloxacin cip amoxicillin amo chloramphenicol chl and sulfamethoxazole smx as typical antibiotics the effects of naac on total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn antibiotic concentration water toxicity and intracellular ros abundance in the receiving water were evaluated metagenomic sequencing was used to characterize the args human bacterial pathogens hbps and microbial community and metatranscriptome sequencing was used to specify the mechanism after the easily biodegradable

of nan3 in another channel was used to remove the influence of abiotic factors such as hydrolysis photolysis and adsorption on the antibiotics abiotic protocol the reactors with the different

have a strong and significant correlation when the pearson s r 0 8 and p 0 01 the results were visualized in gephi v0 9 2 bastian et al 2009a 3 results and discussion 3 1 pollutant attenuation 3 1 1 organic carbon the effects of the easily biodegradable substrate represented by naac on the attenuation of organics in the simulated river reactor are shown in fig 2 a the fluctuation in the water quality before day 20 was likely due to microbial community succession although the addition of naac caused the influent toc content to increase by almost 300 ac 50 vs ac 0 the residual toc content was 25 lower than that of ac 0 in the steady stage the detected toc was only 5 mg l after 8 d of attenuation this result may be attributed to background that consisted by humus bhattacharya and osburn 2020 chen and hur 2015 and other soluble microbial products smps wu et al 2019 released from the sediments in sum the addition of up to 50 mg l naac did not cause toc accumulation in the reactors due to the influence of hydrolysis photolysis and adsorption guo et al 2016 oberoi et al 2019 the abiotic protocol was used to evaluate the contributions of all factors except biodegradation abiotic caused substantial antibiotic removal however ac 50 resulted in the largest antibiotic removal rate for all 5 antibiotics the degradation efficiencies of the antibiotics increased with an increase in the easily biodegradable substrate concentrations for example the degradation efficiency of smx by ac 50 was 11 4 and 29 5 higher than that of ac 25 and ac 0 respectively these results indicated that the easily biodegradable substrate did not increase the toc content in the receiving water but promoted the biological attenuation of antibiotics 3 1 2 antibiotic degradation profiles as shown in fig 3 a the antibiotic biodegradation rate was determined by the addition of the easily biodegradable substrate when naac was not consumed upstream before day 3 2 the antibiotic degradation rates showed a significant difference p 0 05 between the protocols the antibiotic degradation rate of ac 50 was 385 μg l d which was 171 and 81 higher than abiotic and ac 0 respectively after naac was consumed after day 3 2 the degradation rates of the protocols did not show a significant difference p 0 05 as shown in fig s2 the removal rates of the five antibiotics were all significantly positively correlated with the concentrations of naac p 0 001 notably the correlation levels of chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole r2 0 791 0 796 were significantly higher than ciprofloxacin tetracycline and amoxicillin r2 0 555 0 593 consistently chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole achieved greater removals than the others as shown in fig 2b as a result the antibiotic removal rate in the ac 50 effluent reached 75 which was 27 and 14 higher than abiotic and ac 0 respectively according to the linear regression results in fig s2 to completely remove 1500 μg l antibiotics naac applying should be above 110 4 mg l in influent although previous studies showed 100 mg l naac continues to increase the removal rates of antibiotics in the systems of pure microbial culture zhang et al 2020a and activated sludge process zhang et al 2021b however excessive co substrate would definitely lead to competitive inhibition lv et al 2016 the promotion of the biological attenuation of the antibiotics induced by the easily biodegradable substrate was attributed to the upregulation of non specific enzymes including lyases hydrolases transferase and oxidoreductases see fig 3c these enzymes were significantly upregulated a log2 fold change of 3 1 8 8 for ac 50 vs ac 0 in the upstream region whereas the regulation was moderate in the downstream region because the naac had been consumed upregulation of these enzymes caused an increase in the antibiotic removal rates fig 3a and the first order rate constants of toc insert graph of fig 3b hydrolase destroys the active groups of antibiotics i e it opens the beta lactam ring of amo to generate low toxic transformation products tps crofts et al 2018 zumstein and helbling 2019 transferase and lyase are involved in molecule cleavage to produce biodegradable tps decarboxylase removes the carboxyl of cip akhova and tkachenko 2009 and glutathione s transferase combined with nontoxic tps that are removed from the cell or further degrade park and choung 2007 oxidoreductase accelerates the mineralization of tps yin et al 2020 these non specific enzymes induced by the easily biodegradable substrate also enhance the removal of other refractory organic pollutants arp et al 2001 field and sierra alvarez 2008 shi et al 2021 suggesting the potential of using co metabolism to treat emerging pollutants 3 1 3 total nitrogen tn in addition to toc and antibiotic attenuation the easily biodegradable substrate naac also promoted tn removal the tn removal rate for ac 50 stabilized at 92 on day 20 and the residual tn was only 2 mg l however the tn removal was generally not higher than 64 for ac 0 see fig 3a the results showed that the tn removal efficiencies were positively related to the amount of easily biodegradable substrate according to the profiles of the tn removal rate versus hrt fig s3 as an electron donor naac played an essential role in denitrification kraft et al 2014 and the denitrifying rates were much lower when the antibiotics were the only electron donors ac 0 it is worth noting that the addition of naac enriched denitrifying bacteria such as acidovorax hyphomicrobium thiobacillus and arenimonas their relative abundances for ac 50 in the upstream regions increased by 110 119 162 and 27 respectively vs ac 0 overall the effect of the easily biodegradable substrate on the removal efficiency of tn resulted in a healthier water environment 3 2 water toxicity assessment the water toxicity was assessed using the luminescent bacterium vibrio qinghaiensis q 67 wang et al 2020a the results are shown in fig 4 a the inhibition rate for ac 50 was only 15 downstream which was 29 and 35 lower than that of ac 25 and ac 0 respectively it is worth noting that the toxicity was significantly reduced after day 3 2 which agreed with the degradation rate of the antibiotics fig 3a indicating that the reduction in toxicity could be attributed to the attenuation of the antibiotics linear regression analysis showed a significantly positively correlation r2 0 710 p 0 001 between the inhibition rate and the antibiotic concentration in summary the easily biodegradable substrate promoted the degradation of antibiotics and significantly reduced water toxicity 3 3 arg production and characteristics 3 3 1 arg abundance and classification in total 378 arg subtypes belonging to 21 arg types were detected the addition of the easily biodegradable substrate reduced the abundance of args by 17 43 as shown in fig 5 a the args were divided into margs and cargs according to their medium zhao et al 2020 cargs are produced by bacterial binary fission which is also called vertical gene transfer vgt therefore cargs have a strict one to one correspondence with species chen et al 2019 in contrast margs can be transmitted between different species through mges this process is called hgt therefore margs do not have a strict one to one correspondence with species alekshun and levy 2007 soucy et al 2015 interestingly the addition of naac only significantly reduced the relative abundance of margs in ac 50 by 56 upstream and 18 downstream but had almost no effect on cargs see fig 5a this trend was more pronounced upstream where the naac was not consumed the venn diagram shows the shared and unique margs and cargs subtypes affected by the naac co substrate see fig 5b c generally no unique marg subtype were produced but the carg subtypes were diverse 34 unique carg subtypes were verified in the ac 50 protocol in the downstream region where no naac was present to verify the origin of the args we quantified the correlations between margs cargs and the communities using procrustes analysis and the mantel test as shown in fig 5d and 5e clearly cargs had a strong correlation with communities procrustes analysis m2 0 049 mantel test r 0 901 whereas the correlation between margs and the communities was relatively weak procrustes analysis m2 0 410 mantel test r 0 482 the co substrate significantly reduced the args horizontal transfer risk but resulted in high diversity of the cargs 3 3 2 effect of the easily biodegradable substrate on arg production to verify the role of the easily biodegradable substrate in reducing the arg production we compared the influence of the antibiotics on the microbes with and without the naac the fluorescence intensity see fig s5 was used to determine the abundance of ross as shown in fig 6 a the ross was positively correlated with the relative abundance of the margs r2 0 831 p 0 001 whereas the correlation between ross and cargs was not statistically significant r2 0 234 p 0 111 these results agreed well with other studies on the relationship between ross and the horizontal transfer of args wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 it is not surprising that the ros abundance was positively correlated with the antibiotic concentration because the generated intracellular ross protect the organelles from antibiotics interestingly the ros abundance was significantly affected by the co substrate naac see fig 6b the slope of the fitted curves of the ros abundance and antibiotic concentration k0 k25 k50 decreased as the naac concentration increased indicating that the naac reduced the oxidative stress induced by the antibiotics this result was attributed to the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes expression see fig s1 the sod2 and cat of ac 50 were significantly upregulated vs ac 0 when a large concentration of naac existed in the upstream area these enzymes favored to remove the ross in turn when naac was completely consumed in the downstream area the expression of the antioxidant enzymes of ac 0 became more stronger because the residual antibiotics generated more ross vpa was performed to clarify the contribution of the easily biodegradable substrate and antibiotics to changes in the abundance of ross since antibiotics accounted for a negligible proportion of toc 2 8 we assumed that toc minus the constant background value 5 mg l as mentioned above reflected the naac amount in bulk water denoted as tocnaac as shown in fig 6c the naac and antibiotics contributed to changes in the abundance of ross and only 6 1 of the changes were unexplained furthermore the contribution rate of tocnaac antibiotics was 34 4 indicating collinearity between the naac and antibiotics which agreed with the co metabolism mechanism wackett 1996 overall the easily biodegradable substrate inhibited the production of ross by upregulating antioxidant enzymes and promoting the removal of antibiotics thereby reducing margs 3 4 arg transfer pathways 3 4 1 arg transferring media we analyzed the marg encoding plasmids and the microbial community the media of margs and cargs to clarify the effects of the easily biodegradable substrate on the arg transfer pathways we detected 78 marg encoding plasmids the top 20 accounting for 85 of the total abundance are shown in fig 7 a similar to above the naac resulted in a reduction in the relative abundance of marg encoding plasmids and the difference was most significant up to 57 in the upstream area where the concentration of naac was high as expected the abundance of 41 margs were reduced in the ac 50 protocol in the upstream area and 38 of them could be attributed to a decrease in the margs encoding plasmids see table s1 it is noteworthy that some marg encoding plasmids e g nc 022344 1 nc 19 906 1 and nz alal01000013 1 etc were still reduced when naac was consumed in ac 50 which may be attributed to the reduction of antibiotics moreover naac also reduced the relative abundance of hbps as shown in fig 7b the relative abundance of hbps upstream and downstream decreased by 36 and 22 ac 50 vs ac 0 respectively the reduction of hbps was attributed to the more diverse and stable microbial community induced by naac decreasing the competitiveness of hbps van elsas et al 2012 it is worth noting that either excessive or insufficient easily biodegradable substrate concentration may reduce the α diversity of microbial community zhang et al 2020c but increase the abundance of hbps then the community structure altered significantly and the ecosystem function was disrupted tanentzap et al 2019 the decreased abundance of hbps not only reduced the opportunity of hbps to transfer cargs directly but also reduce the opportunity of margs transferring to hbps these results were consistent with those in section 3 3 1 the naac improved the diversity shannon wiener index and inverse simpson index and uniformity pielou index of the community indicating a healthy micro ecological environment cardinale et al 2012 delgado baquerizo et al 2016 as shown in fig 7c the network analysis results showed the connections of the host with the cargs for example dechloromonas agitata which belongs to non pathogenic bacteria npb contained cargs the hbps delftia acidovorans escherichia coli and comamonas testosterone were key species causing carg transfer generally hbps had fewer connections with cargs than npb 3 4 2 mechanisms as indicated above the easily biodegradable substrate inhibited the ross by upregulating antioxidant enzymes and promoting the removal of antibiotics the reduction in ross downregulated global regulatory genes i e kora korb followed by upregulation of type iv secretion system t4ss genes virb1 virb3 and virb4 etc as a result the bridge for plasmid delivery among bacterial species was blocked cascales and christie 2003 guglielmini et al 2014 wang et al 2020b see figs 8 and s1 the downregulated stress corresponding sigma factor gene rpos caused downregulation of the sos response genes uvrd ssb reca and recb etc the sos response is a key mechanism for hgt beaber et al 2004 cen et al 2020 moreover the down regulation of the outer membrane protein gene ompr reduced the hgt rates wang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 these transcriptome results revealed the mechanism of the easily biodegradable substrate inhibiting marg transfer 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the effects of an easily biodegradable substrate in wwtp discharge on the reduction of antibiotics and args in the receiving water the easily biodegradable substrate naac upregulated the non specific enzymes and antioxidant enzymes to reduce antibiotics and intracellular ross resulting in the suppression of arg dissemination in addition the easily biodegradable substrate also improved the stability of the microbial community decreasing the abundance of hbps these results revealed that easily biodegradable substrates are crucial for antibiotic risk reduction in the last decades wwtps have been upgraded under the guidance of current discharge standards to ensure that cod meets the limits but at the expense of consuming easily biodegradable substrates our results suggest reconsidering these conventional practices declaration of competing interest the authors declared that we have no conflicts of interest to this work we

16338,governments have formulated stricter wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharge standards to address water pollution however with the cost of aggravating the refractory of the discharges these policies are not in line with the classic co metabolism theory thus we evaluated the effects of an easily biodegradable substrate on the removal efficiency of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args in the receiving water in this study reactor with 8 d of hydraulic retention time hrt was constructed to simulate a receiving river and several antibiotics 0 30 mg l each were continuously discharged to the reactor tetracycline ciprofloxacin amoxicillin chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole sodium acetate naac was used as a representative easily biodegradable substrate and treatment protocols with and without a co substrate were compared the attenuation of the antibiotics in the simulated river and the production and dissemination of args were analyzed the results showed that 50 mg l naac activated non specific enzymes a log2 fold change of 3 1 8 8 compared with 0 mg l naac the removal rate of the antibiotics was increased by 4 32 and the toxicity of the downstream water was reduced by 35 the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes caused the intracellular reactive oxygen species ross decreased by up to 47 inhibiting horizontal gene transfer and reducing mobile genetic element mediated args margs by 18 56 furthermore naac also increased the alpha diversity of the microbial community by 5 15 shannon wiener index and reduced the abundance of human bacterial pathogens by 22 36 in summary easily biodegradable substrates in the receiving water are crucial for reducing antibiotic risk graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords easily biodegradable substrates antibiotic antibiotic resistance genes transfer antioxidant enzymes human bacterial pathogens 1 introduction humanity is in a critical transition from industrial to ecological civilization gao 2019 and has to balance industrial pollution and environmental quality xiao and zhao 2017 antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args are two emerging pollutants attracting substantial attention kumar et al 2019 dozens of antibiotics have been detected in surface water groundwater sediments and soil at concentrations of ng μg l globally anh et al 2021 danner et al 2019 li et al 2018 liu et al 2018 eight antibiotics primarily tetracyclines and sulfonamides were detected in the yangtze river china s mother river guo et al 2019 effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps are significant sources of antibiotics and args in surface water zhang et al 2020b trace antibiotics and args have also been detected frequently in the drinking water of different countries due to the water cycle e g usa china france and south korea charuaud et al 2019 hanna et al 2018 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 xu et al 2021 although these low concentration antibiotics are unlikely to pose a threat to human health in the short term the resulting args that have caused tens of thousands of deaths in different countries every year should not to be underestimated cassini et al 2019 cdc 2019 wwtps usually achieve moderate removal rates 48 77 for antibiotics the rate depends significantly on the antibiotic structure michael et al 2013 oberoi et al 2019 due to the high microbial density of the activated sludge or biofilms in wwtps they have become petri dishes for the production and transmission of args pazda et al 2019 in spite of this biological processes are currently the most popular wastewater treatment process zhang et al 2016 in the last decade governments endeavored to formulate stricter wastewater discharge standards of wwtps to solve water pollution issues mee 2002 logar et al 2014 for example chinese government has implemented successively stricter discharge standards from class ii to class i a and even stricter district standards as shown in table 1 however the upgradation of wwtps typically resulted in dropping the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand bod cod in the effluents so that the remaining cod concentration was quiet refractory even though it did not exceed the limit verlicchi et al 2011 specifically wwtps upgrades reduced the proportion of easily biodegradable substrates but increased the proportion of refractory organic pollutants in the effluent resulting in difficulties to reduce the pollutant concentration in the receiving water it has been debated whether stricter sewage discharge standards result in positive environmental benefits smith et al 2019 wang et al 2015 as mentioned above the impact of fewer easily biodegradable substrates in the effluent on the natural attenuation of refractory organic pollutants should be investigated interestingly co metabolism plays a crucial role in improving refractory organic degradation bai et al 2015 tran et al 2018 xiong et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a and easily biodegradable substrates are essential in the co metabolism strategy they serve as electron donors hou et al 2019 and upregulate non specific enzymes yin et al 2020 zumstein and helbling 2019 in this context we hypothesized that the presence of easily biodegradable substrates in water could reduce refractory organic pollutants they could potentially remove intracellular reactive oxygen species ross by upregulating antioxidant enzymes vo et al 2020 thereby preventing the horizontal gene transfer hgt of args wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b 2017 based on the co metabolism theory we deduce that appropriate amounts of easily biodegradable substrates in the wwtp effluents may reduce antibiotic concentration and prevent the production and transmission of args in the receiving water to test this hypothesis we used sodium acetate naac as a model easily biodegradable substrate and tetracycline tch ciprofloxacin cip amoxicillin amo chloramphenicol chl and sulfamethoxazole smx as typical antibiotics the effects of naac on total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn antibiotic concentration water toxicity and intracellular ros abundance in the receiving water were evaluated metagenomic sequencing was used to characterize the args human bacterial pathogens hbps and microbial community and metatranscriptome sequencing was used to specify the mechanism after the easily biodegradable substrate was consumed antibiotics remained and the pollution level and risk of the receiving water increased 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors and operations the simulated river reactor was made of polymethyl methacrylate and was divided into 4 independent channels according to the composition of the influent each channel 980 210 250 mm contained an effective volume of 36 l consisting of 8 8

explore the impact of easily biodegradable substrates on antibiotics and args in the river 0 25 and 50 mg l naac were added to the influent of the reactors ac 0 ac 25 and ac 50 protocols the addition of nan3 in another channel was used to remove the influence of abiotic factors such as hydrolysis photolysis and adsorption on the antibiotics abiotic protocol the reactors with the different protocols were in continuous operation for 60 d 2 2 measurements of toc tn and antibiotics the toc and tn contents of the water samples were obtained using a simultaneous toc tn analyzer multi n c

with an accession number of prjna778461 the details of the bioinformatics workflow of the metagenomic analysis are described in text s1 briefly after preprocessing the raw data scaftigs were obtained by megahit we then used metagenemark and bowtie2 to predict the open reading frames orf on the scaftigs and obtain the unigenes used for the subsequent analysis card the ncbi plasmid database integrall and isfinder were used to align the unigenes with the args and mobile genetic elements mges plasmid integron and insertion if the mges sequence was identified on the scaftigs with the args

have a strong and significant correlation when the pearson s r 0 8 and p 0 01 the results were visualized in gephi v0 9 2 bastian et al 2009a 3 results and discussion 3 1 pollutant attenuation 3 1 1 organic carbon the effects of the easily biodegradable substrate represented by naac on the attenuation of organics in the simulated river reactor are shown in fig 2 a the fluctuation in the water quality before day 20 was likely due to microbial community succession although the addition of naac caused the influent toc content to increase by almost 300 ac 50 vs ac 0 the residual toc content was 25 lower than that of ac 0 in the steady stage the detected toc was only 5 mg l after 8 d of attenuation this result may be attributed to background that consisted by humus bhattacharya and osburn 2020 chen and hur 2015 and other soluble microbial products smps wu et al 2019 released from the sediments in sum the addition of up to 50 mg l naac did not cause toc accumulation in the reactors due to the influence of hydrolysis photolysis and adsorption guo et al 2016 oberoi et al 2019 the abiotic protocol was used to evaluate the contributions of all factors except biodegradation abiotic caused substantial antibiotic removal however ac 50 resulted in the largest antibiotic removal rate for all 5 antibiotics the degradation efficiencies of the antibiotics increased with an increase in the easily biodegradable substrate concentrations for example the degradation efficiency of smx by ac 50 was 11 4 and 29 5 higher than that of ac 25 and ac 0 respectively these results indicated that the easily biodegradable substrate did not increase the toc content in the receiving water but promoted the biological attenuation of antibiotics 3 1 2 antibiotic degradation profiles as shown in fig 3 a the antibiotic biodegradation rate was determined by the addition of the easily biodegradable substrate when naac was not consumed upstream before day 3 2 the antibiotic degradation rates showed a significant difference p 0 05 between the protocols the antibiotic degradation rate of ac 50 was 385 μg l d which was 171 and 81 higher than abiotic and ac 0 respectively after naac was consumed after day 3 2 the degradation rates of the protocols did not show a significant difference p 0 05 as shown in fig s2 the removal rates of the five antibiotics were all significantly positively correlated with the concentrations of naac p 0 001 notably the correlation levels of chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole r2 0 791 0 796 were significantly higher than ciprofloxacin tetracycline and amoxicillin r2 0 555 0 593 consistently chloramphenicol and sulfamethoxazole achieved greater removals than the others as shown in fig 2b as a result the antibiotic removal rate in the ac 50 effluent reached 75 which was 27 and 14 higher than abiotic and ac 0 respectively according to the linear regression results in fig s2 to completely remove 1500 μg l antibiotics naac applying should be above 110 4 mg l in influent although previous studies showed 100 mg l naac continues to increase the removal rates of antibiotics in the systems of pure microbial culture zhang et al 2020a and activated sludge process zhang et al 2021b however excessive co substrate would definitely lead to competitive inhibition lv et al 2016 the promotion of the biological attenuation of the antibiotics induced by the easily biodegradable substrate was attributed to the upregulation of non specific enzymes including lyases hydrolases transferase and oxidoreductases see fig 3c these enzymes were significantly upregulated a log2 fold change of 3 1 8 8 for ac 50 vs ac 0 in the upstream region whereas the regulation was moderate in the downstream region because the naac had been consumed upregulation of these enzymes caused an increase in the antibiotic removal rates fig 3a and the first order rate constants of toc insert graph of fig 3b hydrolase destroys the active groups of antibiotics i e it opens the beta lactam ring of amo to generate low toxic transformation products tps crofts et al 2018 zumstein and helbling 2019 transferase and lyase are involved in molecule cleavage to produce biodegradable tps decarboxylase removes the carboxyl of cip akhova and tkachenko 2009 and glutathione s transferase combined with nontoxic tps that are removed from the cell or further degrade park and choung 2007 oxidoreductase accelerates the mineralization of tps yin et al 2020 these non specific enzymes induced by the easily biodegradable substrate also enhance the removal of other refractory organic pollutants arp et al 2001 field and sierra alvarez 2008 shi et al 2021 suggesting the potential of using co metabolism to treat emerging pollutants 3 1 3 total nitrogen tn in addition to toc and antibiotic attenuation the easily biodegradable substrate naac also promoted tn removal the tn removal rate for ac 50 stabilized at 92 on day 20 and the residual tn was only 2 mg l however the tn removal was generally not higher than 64 for ac 0 see fig 3a the results showed that the tn removal efficiencies were positively related to the amount of easily biodegradable substrate according to the profiles of the tn removal rate versus hrt fig s3 as an electron donor naac played an essential role in denitrification kraft et al 2014 and the denitrifying rates were much lower when the antibiotics were the only electron donors ac 0 it is worth noting that the addition of naac enriched denitrifying bacteria such as acidovorax hyphomicrobium thiobacillus and arenimonas their relative abundances for ac 50 in the upstream regions increased by 110 119 162 and 27 respectively vs ac 0 overall the effect of the easily biodegradable substrate on the removal efficiency of tn resulted in a healthier water environment 3 2 water toxicity assessment the water toxicity was assessed using the luminescent bacterium vibrio qinghaiensis q 67 wang et al 2020a the results are shown in fig 4 a the inhibition rate for ac 50 was only 15 downstream which was 29 and 35 lower than that of ac 25 and ac 0 respectively it is worth noting that the toxicity was significantly reduced after day 3 2 which agreed with the degradation rate of the antibiotics fig 3a indicating that the reduction in toxicity could be attributed to the attenuation of the antibiotics linear regression analysis showed a significantly positively correlation r2 0 710 p 0 001 between the inhibition rate and the antibiotic concentration in summary the easily biodegradable substrate promoted the degradation of antibiotics and significantly reduced water toxicity 3 3 arg production and characteristics 3 3 1 arg abundance and classification in total 378 arg subtypes belonging to 21 arg types were detected the addition of the easily biodegradable substrate reduced the abundance of args by 17 43 as shown in fig 5 a the args were divided into margs and cargs according to their medium zhao et al 2020 cargs are produced by bacterial binary fission which is also called vertical gene transfer vgt therefore cargs have a strict one to one correspondence with species chen et al 2019 in contrast margs can be transmitted between different species through mges this process is called hgt therefore margs do not have a strict one to one correspondence with species alekshun and levy 2007 soucy et al 2015 interestingly the addition of naac only significantly reduced the relative abundance of margs in ac 50 by 56 upstream and 18 downstream but had almost no effect on cargs see fig 5a this trend was more pronounced upstream where the naac was not consumed the venn diagram shows the shared and unique margs and cargs subtypes affected by the naac co substrate see fig 5b c generally no unique marg subtype were produced but the carg subtypes were diverse 34 unique carg subtypes were verified in the ac 50 protocol in the downstream region where no naac was present to verify the origin of the args we quantified the correlations between margs cargs and the communities using procrustes analysis and the mantel test as shown in fig 5d and 5e clearly cargs had a strong correlation with communities procrustes analysis m2 0 049 mantel test r 0 901 whereas the correlation between margs and the communities was relatively weak procrustes analysis m2 0 410 mantel test r 0 482 the co substrate significantly reduced the args horizontal transfer risk but resulted in high diversity of the cargs 3 3 2 effect of the easily biodegradable substrate on arg production to verify the role of the easily biodegradable substrate in reducing the arg production we compared the influence of the antibiotics on the microbes with and without the naac the fluorescence intensity see fig s5 was used to determine the abundance of ross as shown in fig 6 a the ross was positively correlated with the relative abundance of the margs r2 0 831 p 0 001 whereas the correlation between ross and cargs was not statistically significant r2 0 234 p 0 111 these results agreed well with other studies on the relationship between ross and the horizontal transfer of args wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 it is not surprising that the ros abundance was positively correlated with the antibiotic concentration because the generated intracellular ross protect the organelles from antibiotics interestingly the ros abundance was significantly affected by the co substrate naac see fig 6b the slope of the fitted curves of the ros abundance and antibiotic concentration k0 k25 k50 decreased as the naac concentration increased indicating that the naac reduced the oxidative stress induced by the antibiotics this result was attributed to the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes expression see fig s1 the sod2 and cat of ac 50 were significantly upregulated vs ac 0 when a large concentration of naac existed in the upstream area these enzymes favored to remove the ross in turn when naac was completely consumed in the downstream area the expression of the antioxidant enzymes of ac 0 became more stronger because the residual antibiotics generated more ross vpa was performed to clarify the contribution of the easily biodegradable substrate and antibiotics to changes in the abundance of ross since antibiotics accounted for a negligible proportion of toc 2 8 we assumed that toc minus the constant background value 5 mg l as mentioned above reflected the naac amount in bulk water denoted as tocnaac as shown in fig 6c the naac and antibiotics contributed to changes in the abundance of ross and only 6 1 of the changes were unexplained furthermore the contribution rate of tocnaac antibiotics was 34 4 indicating collinearity between the naac and antibiotics which agreed with the co metabolism mechanism wackett 1996 overall the easily biodegradable substrate inhibited the production of ross by upregulating antioxidant enzymes and promoting the removal of antibiotics thereby reducing margs 3 4 arg transfer pathways 3 4 1 arg transferring media we analyzed the marg encoding plasmids and the microbial community the media of margs and cargs to clarify the effects of the easily biodegradable substrate on the arg transfer pathways we detected 78 marg encoding plasmids the top 20 accounting for 85 of the total abundance are shown in fig 7 a similar to above the naac resulted in a reduction in the relative abundance of marg encoding plasmids and the difference was most significant up to 57 in the upstream area where the concentration of naac was high as expected the abundance of 41 margs were reduced in the ac 50 protocol in the upstream area and 38 of them could be attributed to a decrease in the margs encoding plasmids see table s1 it is noteworthy that some marg encoding plasmids e g nc 022344 1 nc 19 906 1 and nz alal01000013 1 etc were still reduced when naac was consumed in ac 50 which may be attributed to the reduction of antibiotics moreover naac also reduced the relative abundance of hbps as shown in fig 7b the relative abundance of hbps upstream and downstream decreased by 36 and 22 ac 50 vs ac 0 respectively the reduction of hbps was attributed to the more diverse and stable microbial community induced by naac decreasing the competitiveness of hbps van elsas et al 2012 it is worth noting that either excessive or insufficient easily biodegradable substrate concentration may reduce the α diversity of microbial community zhang et al 2020c but increase the abundance of hbps then the community structure altered significantly and the ecosystem function was disrupted tanentzap et al 2019 the decreased abundance of hbps not only reduced the opportunity of hbps to transfer cargs directly but also reduce the opportunity of margs transferring to hbps these results were consistent with those in section 3 3 1 the naac improved the diversity shannon wiener index and inverse simpson index and uniformity pielou index of the community indicating a healthy micro ecological environment cardinale et al 2012 delgado baquerizo et al 2016 as shown in fig 7c the network analysis results showed the connections of the host with the cargs for example dechloromonas agitata which belongs to non pathogenic bacteria npb contained cargs the hbps delftia acidovorans escherichia coli and comamonas testosterone were key species causing carg transfer generally hbps had fewer connections with cargs than npb 3 4 2 mechanisms as indicated above the easily biodegradable substrate inhibited the ross by upregulating antioxidant enzymes and promoting the removal of antibiotics the reduction in ross downregulated global regulatory genes i e kora korb followed by upregulation of type iv secretion system t4ss genes virb1 virb3 and virb4 etc as a result the bridge for plasmid delivery among bacterial species was blocked cascales and christie 2003 guglielmini et al 2014 wang et al 2020b see figs 8 and s1 the downregulated stress corresponding sigma factor gene rpos caused downregulation of the sos response genes uvrd ssb reca and recb etc the sos response is a key mechanism for hgt beaber et al 2004 cen et al 2020 moreover the down regulation of the outer membrane protein gene ompr reduced the hgt rates wang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 these transcriptome results revealed the mechanism of the easily biodegradable substrate inhibiting marg transfer 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the effects of an easily biodegradable substrate in wwtp discharge on the reduction of antibiotics and args in the receiving water the easily biodegradable substrate naac upregulated the non specific enzymes and antioxidant enzymes to reduce antibiotics and intracellular ross resulting in the suppression of arg dissemination in addition the easily biodegradable substrate also improved the stability of the microbial community decreasing the abundance of hbps these results revealed that easily biodegradable substrates are crucial for antibiotic risk reduction in the last decades wwtps have been upgraded under the guidance of current discharge standards to ensure that cod meets the limits but at the expense of consuming easily biodegradable substrates our results suggest reconsidering these conventional practices declaration of competing interest the authors declared that we have no conflicts of interest to this work we

16339,monitoring the changes that occur to water during distribution is vital to ensure water safety in this study the biological stability of reverse osmosis ro produced drinking water characterized by low cell concentration and low assimilable organic carbon in combination with chlorine disinfection was investigated water quality at several locations throughout the existing distribution network was monitored to investigate whether microbial water quality changes can be identified results revealed that the water leaving the plant had an average bacterial cell concentration of 103 cells ml a 0 5 1 5 log increase in bacterial cell concentration was observed at locations in the network the residual disinfectant was largely dissipated in the network from 0 5 mg l at the treatment plant to less than 0 1 mg l in the network locations the simulative study involving miniature distribution networks mimicking the dynamics of a distribution network fed with the ro produced chlorinated and non chlorinated drinking water revealed that distributing ro produced water without residual disinfection especially at high water temperatures 25 30 c poses a higher chance for water quality change within six months of operation of the miniature network fed with unchlorinated ro produced water the adenosine triphosphate atp and total cell concentration tcc in the pipe biofilm were 4 102 pg atp cm2 and 1 107 cells cm2 the low bacterial cell concentration and organic carbon concentration in the ro produced water did not prevent biofilm development inside the network with and without residual chlorine the bacterial community analysis using 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene sequencing revealed that mesophilic bacteria with higher temperature tolerance and bacteria associated with oligotrophic nutrient poor conditions dominated the biofilm with no indication of the existence of opportunistic pathogenic species however chlorination selected against most bacterial groups and the bacterial community that remained was mainly the bacteria capable of surviving disinfection regimes biofilms that developed in the presence of chlorine contained species classified as opportunistic pathogens these biofilms have an impact on shaping the water quality received at the consumer tap the presence of these bacteria on its own is not a health risk indicator viability assessment and qpcrs targeting genes specific to the opportunistic pathogens as well as quantitative microbiological risk assessment qmra should be included to assess the risk the results from this study highlight the importance of implementing multiple barriers to ensure water safety changes in water quality detected even when high quality disinfected ro produced water is distributed highlight microbiological challenges that chlorinated systems endure especially at high water temperatures keywords distribution network bacterial regrowth opportunistic pathogens reverse osmosis produced water disinfection 1 introduction the health and well being of humans strongly depend on adequate access to microbiologically safe drinking water szewzyk et al 2000 shannon et al 2008 considerable time and money is invested in treating available water resources to remove undesirable microorganisms in drinking water systems plappally and lienhard 2012 depending on the water source water goes through various treatment steps until it becomes adequate for human consumption after the treated water leaves the treatment plant it has to flow through the drinking water distribution system dwds and network of pipes before reaching the consumer taps the dwds with its unique environment can lead to deterioration of the microbial water quality if the appropriate environment for bacterial regrowth is created lechevallier et al 1996 miettinen et al 1997 liu et al 2002 schurer et al 2019 two primary approaches are often pursued to prevent bacterial regrowth in dwds i limiting the nutrients available for bacterial growth or ii the use of disinfection residuals in the first approach water utilities emphasize the removal of readily biodegradable low molecular weight compounds that are considered as food for bacteria to grow volk and lechevallier 2000 water utilities put additional efforts to optimize treatment schemes to enable better removal of slowly biodegradable high molecular weight compounds as these compounds degrade at a slower rate leading to bacterial regrowth at farther locations in the distribution network hijnen et al 2018 schurer et al 2019 disinfection is another common approach to prevent bacterial regrowth by using disinfectants such as chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine before distributing the water and maintaining a disinfectant residual in dwds propato and uber 2004 liu et al 2016 farhat et al 2018b water utilities globally preclude distribution without a disinfectant residual and disinfection is implemented in most countries and usually allows the distribution of biologically stable water however one cannot ignore the carcinogenic disinfection by products that form when disinfectants react with organic compounds present in the water garcia villanova et al 1997 mercier shanks et al 2013 many groups of disinfection by products are regulated in drinking water guidelines and water utilities have to limit the production of these by products monitor and measure their concentration to make sure they abide by the guidelines guilherme and rodriguez 2014 zeng and mitch 2016 the dynamics of nutrient availability in dwds together with various other aspects such as pipe material hydrodynamic conditions water temperature and presence absence of disinfection residual create complex environments in dwdss that can be hard to predict prest et al 2016 in specific environments and despite all efforts to control bacterial regrowth bacteria can still grow in dwds even in distribution systems with low nutrient conditions and with the presence of residual disinfectant potgieter et al 2018 the water utilities effort to produce high quality water cannot be complete without expanding these efforts to involve other entities that maintain the dwds vreeburg and boxall 2007 monitoring the microbial quality in the dwds is essential farhat et al 2020 most of the existing methods to monitor drinking water depend on the detection of microorganisms in bulk water samples from consumer taps and using cultivation dependent methods douterelo et al 2018b since mostly all legislation around the world still consider the cultivation dependent quantification methods as the principal applied compliance parameters chowdhury 2012 using these methods underestimates the actual diversity and abundance of microorganisms in the environment moreover attached bacteria inside the distribution pipes are often overlooked although biofilms can constitute over 95 of the biomass in dwds flemming et al 2002 biofilms on the inside of the distribution network pipes have been associated with a higher risk of occurrence of opportunistic pathogens compromising the safety and quality of drinking water lehtola et al 2007 van der kooij et al 2017 investigating the biofilms developing on pipes is important and this is mostly excluded in many studies as accessing the surface of pipes within operative networks is difficult douterelo et al 2016 however it is worth to mention that recently many research groups acknowledged the importance of studying biofilms in dwds despite the complexity and major efforts to understand biofilms has been reported gomez smith et al 2015 douterelo et al 2018a waak et al 2018 2019a 2019b van der kooij et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021 calero preciado et al 2021 in this study a combination of approaches to achieve biologically stable water during distribution was investigated seawater was desalinated using reverse osmosis ro membranes and the produced water was chlorinated prior to distribution to the dwds under investigation the ro produced water is characterized by low bacterial cell concentration and low assimilable organic carbon concentration the distribution network is unique as all the pipes are of the same age 10 years and of the same material pvc and feeding a confined area 45 km2 from one source only first water quality at several locations throughout the existing distribution network fed with chlorinated ro produced drinking water was monitored to investigate whether microbial water quality changes can be identified then a simulative study involving miniature distribution networks mimicking the dynamics of a dwds was conducted this study investigated the effect of chlorine presence and absence on biological stability of ro produced water using miniature networks to assess whether chlorination was necessary to distribute biostable water this study uniquely analyzed a combination of bulk water samples feeding and leaving the miniature networks under both chlorinated and non chlorinated conditions as well as biofilm samples from the miniature network pipes over six months 2 materials and methods 2 1 analysis of water samples from the plant and distribution network 2 1 1 site description the ro membrane desalination plant at king abdullah university of science and technology thuwal saudi arabia produces drinking water through the desalination of seawater from the red sea the plant capacity is 40 000 m3 d and the treatment process schematic can be found in farhat et al 2020 and fig s1 in supplementary material in short seawater is pretreated through spruce and cartridge filters before reaching the ro modules the plant has two stages of ro the permeate water from the first stage is stored in a break tank only 20 percent of the first stage ro is treated with a second stage ro the final drinking water is a blend of first and second stage ro permeate subsequently dosed with chlorine co2 and lime and stored in a storage tank for this study we had access to the produced water before dosing chlorine blended first stage and second stage ro permeate with co2 and lime and after chlorine addition water quality parameters leaving the treatment plant are shown in table s1 in supplementary material 2 1 2 sampling scheme five sampling locations were investigated to analyze the water quality through time two locations were examined at the treatment plant 1 produced water without chlorine and 2 produced water with chlorine three locations were selected at the distribution network with varying proximities from the treatment plant fig 1 network l1 l2 l3 were 2 4 2 0 and 1 8 km away from the treatment plant the average estimated hydraulic residence times are between 3 and 5 h 2 1 3 microbial analysis flow cytometry analysis flow cytometry fcm was used to determine the total bacterial cell concentration tcc as described previously farhat et al 2018a in short 2 µl aliquot of sybr green i 10 000 concentrate molecular probes switzerland diluted 100 times with deionized water was added to 200 µl of each water sample and incubated for 10 min at 37 c in the dark before analysis the tcc of water samples was measured using an accuri c6 plus fcm bd biosciences usa online measurements of total cell numbers were done using an automated online monitoring system oncyt robot oncyt switzerland coupled to an fcm bd biosciences usa as described by besmer et al 2014 every 10 min the water sample was taken and stained with sybr green i final concentration 1 and subsequently incubated for 10 min at 37 c inside the online robot cleaning procedures with hypochlorite 1 active chlorine sigma aldrich usa sodium thiosulfate solution 100 mm sigma aldrich usa and ultrapure water were automatically conducted after every measurement the total cell numbers and the ratio between high nucleic acid hna bacteria and low nucleic acid lna bacteria was analyzed at the same time every 10 min the measurements were conducted for a whole week at the various locations the flow cytometric data were analyzed using manufacturer provided software cyplot software oncyt switzerland the hna and the lna bacteria were separated based on green fluorescence intensity fl1 channel the flowchic cytometric histogram image comparison koch et al 2013 koch et al 2014 tool analysis was performed using r packages flowchic54 55 the chic tool allows a comparison of cytometric datasets without gating decisions and any cytometric pre experience due to an automated image comparison procedure the flow cytometric measurements of each sample need to be visualized using forward scatter fsc against fluorescence the non metric multidimensional scale nmds plot was made using r software version 3 5 2 2 2 miniature distribution network study two miniature water distribution networks were placed at the ro desalination plant to study the effect of chlorine absence and presence on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the microbial community during distribution the first miniature distribution network was fed with non chlorinated drinking water and the second miniature distribution network was fed with chlorinated drinking water of the same quality as the water entering the real distribution network the miniature distribution networks consisted of nylon tubing 6 mm in diameter and 270 m length wrapped around a 1 m2 frame a water flow velocity similar to the actual distribution system was simulated the average flow rate inside the miniature networks was maintained at 23 l h resulting in a flow velocity of 0 2 m s and a residence time of 25 min this residence time was shorter that the residence time in the actual network of 3 5 h a picture of the miniature network system is shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material the water feeding and leaving the miniature distribution networks was analyzed after 3 and 6 6 months of operation in addition biofilm development inside the pipes of the miniature distribution network was investigated 2 2 1 adenosine triphosphate atp and total cell concentration tcc measurements the atp and tcc of the water entering and leaving the miniature network along with atp and tcc in the biofilm formed on the miniature network pipes were measured for the pipe biofilm samples a 4 cm tube length was cut wiped with 70 ethanol from outside to clean and disinfect the pipe and placed in a capped tube in 40 ml sterile tap water for atp analysis and milli q ultrapure water for tcc analysis the tubes with the pipe sections were mixed on a vortex few seconds and sonicated using a sonifier probe q700 qsonica sonicator usa for 1 2 min sample kept on ice until the liquid was homogenous atp was measured using a luminometer celsis advance charles river laboratories inc usa and tcc was measured according to the protocol explained earlier samples were measured in triplicates student s t test was used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means at the different conditions chlorine no chlorine inlet outlet 3months 6 months the difference was considered significant when the calculated p values were less than 0 05 2 2 2 microbial communities in water and pipe biofilm samples for the water samples 20 liters of water was collected and filtered on 0 22 µm mixed cellulose esters membrane gswp14250 millipore usa on the same day of sampling triplicate 20 l samples were taken after six months of operating the miniature network then average of triplicate samples was used to plot taxonomic distribution of bacterial community relative abundance for the pipe biofilm samples 4 pieces of 4 cm pipe section were cut from the miniature distribution network after six months of operating the miniature network then average of quadruple samples was used to plot taxonomic distribution of bacterial community relative abundance in the biofilm the filters and pipe sections were stored at 20 c until processing microbial genomic dna from the filtration membranes and the pipe sections was extracted using the dneasy powerwater kit purchased from qiagen usa per the manufacturer protocol the quantification of dna concentration was performed using qubit 4 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa and qubit dsdna high sensitivity hs assay kit detection range 0 01 100 ng µl thermo fisher scientific usa the total microbial communities in the extracted dna samples were determined at kaust bioscience core laboratory saudi arabia by performing 16s rrna gene based high throughput sequencing on the illumina miseq platform following the protocol by the manufacturer illumina usa the input dna was standardized prior to sequencing all pcr polymerase chain reaction details were according to the protocol illumina usa the forward 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and reverse 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc primers were selected to amplify the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene herlemann et al 2011 bacterial community analysis was performed using chunlab in house ezbiocloud 16s based microbiome taxonomic profiling mtp yoon et al 2017 the reference 16s rrna gene sequences were maintained as described in kim et al 2012 the quality of sequencing for pcr derived sequences was checked manually by secondary structure aware alignment using the ezeditor program jeon et al 2014 maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of each taxonomic group such as phyla classes orders or families were generated from computationally aligned 16s rrna gene sequences all 16s rrna gene sequences were assigned taxonomically operational taxonomic unit otu based assignment to the species level as a part of the complete taxonomic hierarchy which consisted of phylum class order family genus and species 97 16s similarity is used as the cutoff for species level identification the average number of valid reads obtained from all the samples was 68 000 22 100 details can be found in table s2 in supplementary material the bacterial alpha diversity was calculated using the shannon weaver diversity index h with the following equation h n 1 n p i in p i where p i is the proportion of each species in the sample the distribution free statistical similarity test applied was the wilcoxon rank sum test also referred to as the mann whitney u test a nonparametric test of the null hypothesis that for randomly selected values x and y from two populations the probability of x being greater than y is equal to the probability of y being greater than x yuan et al 2006 the significance value was set at p 0 05 the sequences were compared for their bray curtis similarities and represented graphically for spatial distribution in a multivariate statistics plot called principal coordinate analysis pcoa permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to measure effect size and significance on beta diversity for the different water and biofilm chlorinated unchlorinated sample groups beta diversity and phylogenetic diversity measures are included in the permanova analysis the significance is obtained by a permutation test the level of significance was set at p 0 05 submission of sequence reads for this study to ddbj ena genbank nucleotide database is in progress 3 results 3 1 microbial water quality monitoring from treatment to distribution microbial water quality was monitored using online fcm at five locations two at the treatment plant and three locations throughout the existing distribution network at the treatment plant produced water before chlorination had a higher bacterial cell concentration than after chlorination fig 2 fig 2a shows the flow cytometric fingerprint by plotting bacterial cell concentrations versus percentage of high nucleic acid hna bacteria as previous studies showed that the activity of hna bacteria is correlated to total cell activity the hna percentage together with the total cell concentration increased in the network locations before chlorination the average bacterial cell concentration was 3 5 103 cell ml while chlorination reduced the concentration to below 103 cell ml the limit of detection lod fig 2b moreover the box plot in fig 2b shows that the water bacterial cell concentration values leaving the treatment plant after chlorine were the most dispersed 25 75 range the widest 50 of the concentration values were below the fcm detection limit possibly resulting in the higher dispersion of values a 0 5 1 5 log increase in bacterial cell concentration was observed at the network locations compared to the plant location directly after chlorination reaching a concentration of 4 104 cells ml at network l3 the residual disinfectant was largely dissipated table s3 the nmds plot based on the flowchic analysis fig 3 shows the samples after chlorination clustered closely together signifying their similarity the samples before chlorination appear as a completely different and wider cluster with higher variability at the three network locations three bacterial clusters can be distinguished these clusters at the network locations appear closer to the after chlorination samples signaling the similarity however the samples from the three network locations are more scattered than the after chlorination samples at the treatment plant which indicates shifts in bacterial characteristics size dna content and occurrence of a much more diverse bacterial community wider clusters these data show that the presence of disinfectant residual did not prevent bacterial changes during distribution fig 3 and as seen in fig 2 bacterial regrowth occurred 3 2 miniature network studies using the fcm monitoring of water from treatment to distribution we could identify changes in the microbial water quality figs 2 and 3 however assessing the surface of pipes within the operative distribution network to investigate the existing biofilm was difficult raising the interest in conducting simulative network distribution studies moreover since we could only evaluate the microbial dynamics with the presence of chlorine the miniature distribution networks were initiated to understand what would be the impact of chlorine presence and absence on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the microbial water quality and community 3 2 1 microbial water quality monitoring for six months two miniature networks were fed with unchlorinated and chlorinated water produced by ro desalination water quality using atp and tcc was assessed at the miniature network inlet and outlet locations fig 4 the miniature network fed with unchlorinated water showed an increase in atp and tcc in the outlet water after three and six months of operation fig 4a b the tcc concentration in the outlet water after three months of operation was two times higher the concentration at the inlet 1 2 104 cells ml inlet and 2 5 104 cells ml in the outlet t test p 0 021 fig 4a a similar trend was observed for the atp concentration which was 2 3 times higher at the outlet 1 5 pg ml compared to the inlet 0 7 pg ml t test p 0 035 fig 4b at six months of operation the outlet cell concentration 4 5 104 cells ml was one log higher than that of the inlet 4 4 103 cells ml t test p 0 0002 however the atp increase observed at six months although significant t test p 0 006 was not in proportion to the increase in tcc the atp in the outlet water 0 8 pg ml was only 2 7 times higher than that of the inlet 0 3 pg ml this would signal increased biofilm growth inside the network with less active cells sloughing out of the biofilm and ending up in the outlet water the decline in tcc and atp concentration of the feed water observed at six months compared to three months is a seasonal variation fig 4a b the study was initiated in april and the three and six month sampling occurred in july and october respectively the miniature network fed with chlorinated water did not show any increasing trend t test all p 0 05 table s4 between inlet and outlet or any temporal increase in tcc or atp fig 4a b there was no difference in chlorine concentration between the inlet and outlet justifying the observed trend 3 2 2 biofilm characterization in addition to microbial water quality biofilm development in both miniature networks was investigated attached bacteria inside distribution pipes are momentous as biofilms on the inside of the distribution network pipes have been associated with a higher risk of opportunistic pathogens van der kooij et al 2017 biofilm development inside the pipes of the miniature network was characterized by tcc and atp concentration for the miniature network fed with produced water before chlorination a significant concentration of bacterial cells 2 3 106 cells cm2 was found in the biofilm developing at the inlet after three months of operation fig 5 a the biofilm developing at the outlet had less tcc 0 9 106 cells cm2 than the inlet but the difference was not significant t test p 0 085 the biofilm atp concentration showed a similar trend to the tcc between the inlet 135 pg cm2 and outlet 103 pg cm2 however the difference between the two concentrations was significant t test p 0 001 comparing the biofilm after 6 months to the biofilm after 3 months of operation almost 1 log increase in the biofilm tcc was observed at the inlet t test p 0 0096 with a significant atp concentration increase t test p 0 001 fig 5a b at the outlet only the biofilm tcc increased in time 6 months compared to 3 months but the increase was only double t test p 0 028 while atp concentration remained similar to what it was three months before t test p 0 257 the higher increase in tcc and atp at the inlet may be explained by higher availability of substrate in the water at the inlet compared to the outlet for the miniature network fed with chlorinated water an increasing tcc in the biofilm was observed in time at both the inlet and outlet of the network t test p 0 05 table s5 however the biofilm tcc was 2 3 logs lower than when chlorine was absent t test p 0 05 no distinction could be made between the biofilm at the inlet and outlet as the growth was suppressed by the chlorine presence the negligible atp concentration at both the inlet and outlet fig 5b indicates that the quantified tcc concentration is mainly composed of inactive or dead bacterial cells this was confirmed with intact cell concentration measurements of the chlorinated water that were all below the lod 103 cells ml of the fcm with an average of 100 40 cells ml 3 3 bacterial community composition analysis was performed on the dna extracted from 20 l water samples in triplicates at each location and biofilm samples water samples were taken at the actual distribution network location 3 and at the inlet and outlet of the two miniature networks fed with non chlorinated and chlorinated ro produced water dna was also extracted from the biofilm that developed in both miniature networks principal coordinate analysis pcoa for measuring beta diversity is an ordination method that aims to arrange ecological communities along gradients pcoa was performed on the biofilm and the unchlorinated and chlorinated water in and out of the miniature network and water samples at network location 3 the bacterial community in network l3 was closely clustered to the bacterial community found in the water leaving the miniature network permanova p 0 10 not significant n s fig 6 the chlorinated water feeding the miniature network and the biofilm community that developed inside the miniature network were clustered separately signifying their differences permanova p 0 033 the water bacterial community leaving the miniature network was clearly impacted by the biofilm developing inside the network this highlights the importance of the biofilm developing in the distribution network in shaping the water received at the tap as for the unchlorinated water feeding and leaving the miniature network the two clusters were quite undistinguishable very close and overlapping with each other permanova p 0 10 n s signaling their similarity while the biofilm was farther away thus quite different permanova p 0 026 the significance values between the different water and biofilm chlorinated unchlorinated sample groups based on the permanova analysis are shown in table s6 in supplementary material 3 3 1 chlorinated and non chlorinated ro produced drinking water the ro produced water feeding the actual distribution network was also used to feed the chlorinated miniature network the chlorinated ro produced water was dominated at the phylum level by proteobacteria 90 4 with the presence of firmicutes 2 8 and actinobacteria 2 5 fig 7 a at the class level the chlorinated water had a high abundance of alphaproteobacteria 76 3 gammaproteobacteria 11 9 betaproteobacteria 1 8 and the presence of bacilli 2 3 and actinobacteria c 2 4 classes blastomonas natatoria a mesophilic bacterium dominated the species present in the chlorinated water 65 1 fig s3 supplementary material the second two species in relative abundance were pseudomonas stutzeri group 9 5 and erythrobacter citreus sp 4 5 compared to the chlorinated ro produced water feeding the miniature network both the chlorinated water leaving the miniature network and the water at network location 3 had a lower abundance of proteobacteria 54 5 and 64 5 respectively and a higher abundance of firmicutes 39 5 and 29 5 respectively fig 7a at the class level gammaproteobacteria 47 5 abundance increased the most at network l3 pseudomonas aeruginosa 29 9 from the gammaproteobacteria class was found present in the network location 3 fig s3 comparing the water bacterial community before chlorination with the community after chlorination the water samples before chlorination had less proteobacteria 81 3 and more firmicutes 14 0 with a low relative abundance of actinobacteria 2 0 and acidobacteria 1 4 fig 7a at the class level the non chlorinated water had a lower abundance of alphaproteobacteria 34 1 compared to 76 2 in the chlorinated water while classes such as gammaproteobacteria 34 6 and betaproteobacteria 11 0 increased in abundance the most abundant species in the unchlorinated water were the sphingopyxis macrogoltabida group 29 2 an oligotrophic bacteria and reyranella uc 12 0 the following two most abundant species were pseudomonas aeruginosa group 7 1 and anaerobacillus ay642552 s 5 6 fig s4 bacterial community changes were seen in the unchlorinated water leaving the miniature network compared to that feeding the network at the phylum level the unchlorinated water leaving the miniature network had less proteobacteria 68 6 and more firmicutes 24 50 compared to the water feeding the network fig 7a at the class level a higher abundance of alphaproteobacteria 46 9 compared to 34 1 and bacilli 24 4 compared to 14 0 while classes such as gammaproteobacteria 14 2 and betaproteobacteria 7 3 decreased in abundance fig 7b although differences existed between the unchlorinated water feeding and leaving the miniature network the pcoa fig 6 showed the sample clusters close to each other signifying their similarities 3 3 2 biofilm bacterial community with and without chlorination the biofilm community was different from that in the water at the phylum level although proteobacteria dominated all samples compared to the unchlorinated water the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased in the biofilm developing in the miniature network fed with water before chlorination from 81 2 to 59 3 fig 7a phylum such as saccharibacteria 13 6 planctomycetes 11 9 and bacteroidetes 1 4 emerged in the biofilm community while phyla such as acidobacteria 5 0 and actinobacteria 4 6 increased in abundance the shannon phylogenetic alpha diversity index of the biofilm 3 90 was higher than that of the water 3 64 but the difference was not significant u test p 0 064 at the class level alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria increased in relative abundance in the biofilm 36 6 15 0 and 2 3 respectively in contrast the abundance of gammaproteobacteria decreased from 34 6 to 4 2 in the biofilm in comparison blastocatellia class had a higher relative abundance in the biofilm compared to the water blastocatellia was in a very low relative abundance in the feed water and rather emerged in the biofilm the biofilm that developed in the miniature network fed with chlorinated water was distinct in the high relative abundance of firmicutes 28 0 at the phylum level and bacilli 25 7 at the class level the shannon phylogenetic alpha diversity index of the biofilm 4 29 was significantly higher than that of the chlorinated water 1 87 u test p 0 034 biofilms that developed in the two miniature networks were clearly different more biofilm developed in the network fed with unchlorinated water 4 discussion 4 1 water quality changes for chlorinated ro produced drinking water during distribution the uniqueness of the water distributed in this network is the extremely low bacterial cell count and substrate concentration at the distribution point table s1 the average total bacterial cell concentration leaving the treatment plant was 1 103 cell ml and in many cases even lower fig 2 the detection limit for total cell concentration was 1 103 cells ml as determined in another study by us putri et al 2021 and ziemba et al 2019 while having a low bacterial cell concentration in the water is foreseen as positive for biological stability the consequence is that this creates a niche for microorganisms to occupy downstream of the treatment process nescerecka et al 2014 as seen in this distribution network figs 2 6 7 and s3 the particularly low cell concentration and chlorine residual 0 5 mg l did not prevent bacterial regrowth reaching 2 104 cells ml in some locations fig 2 quantifying the assimilable organic carbon concentration aoc from the growth potential of the produced water hammes and egli 2005 reveals an aoc concentration of 5 10 µg c l table s1 such an aoc concentration derived from a growth potential of 104 cells ml can cause this amount of biofilm regrowth once chlorine gets reduced or dissipated keeping in mind that the cell concentration does not directly link to human health prest et al 2016 and many regions receiving chlorinated water have cell concentrations feeding the network in the range of 105 cells ml nescerecka et al 2014 however more biofilm on the inside of the pipes is anticipated at higher cell concentrations leading to a higher risk for consumer complaints due to water aesthetics and higher risk of occurrence of opportunistic pathogens pavlov et al 2004 van der kooij et al 2017 kotlarz et al 2019 accessing the health risks of the water should be confirmed using the internationally accepted culture based approaches hpc and mpn and indeed the viability tests intact cell concentration q pcr however the limitations of hpc analysis including the long incubation time required variation in test results depending on experimental conditions and detection of only a minute fraction of the total number of viable bacteria have been stated in previous studies van nevel et al 2017 cheswick et al 2019 in a previous study at the same distribution network farhat et al 2020 we compared flow cytometry data with the conventional water quality detection methods hpc and total coliforms hpc and total coliforms were constantly below the detection limits while the fcm provided detectable total cell count data and enabled quantifying changes in the drinking water therefore the direct bacterial quantification method fcm has been applied in this study for the drinking water samples to overcome the limitations of conventional bacterial culture dependent methods van nevel et al 2013 the inclusion of atp concentration measurements gives an indication on the activity of the cells measured through fcm the variation in the increase in bacterial cell concentration seen in this network resulted from differences in the proximity of sampling locations to the treatment plant size and building use chlorine decay contributed to bacterial growth and the relatively high water temperature 30 c accelerated the chlorine decay hua et al 1999 and bacterial growth compared to dwds with chlorine at lower water temperature a decay from 0 5 mg l to less than 0 05 mg l was observed in locations over the network the significant role that temperature plays in these regions cannot be overlooked as higher temperatures facilitate biofilm development and select for certain microorganisms including pathogens delpla et al 2009 nescerecka et al 2014 bondank et al 2018 in addition to temperature building sizes premise piping lengths and water usage dictated the chlorine decay samples taken in large buildings with longer premise piping lengths and more stagnant segments show lower chlorine concentrations and higher cell concentrations bédard et al 2018 proctor et al 2020 4 2 chlorination selects against most bacterial groups and creates a niche for microorganisms to occupy downstream 16s rrna genes sequencing of water and biofilm samples before and after chlorination revealed taxonomically diverse bacterial communities the diversity of planktonic bacteria declined from 3 64 in the unchlorinated ro produced water to 1 87 after chlorination shannon phylogenetic alpha diversity index the shannon alpha diversity index for chlorinated water was lower than values reported in literature for chlorinated water produced by conventional treatment methods zhang et al 2021 and significantly lower than diversity indices reported for non chlorinated water ahmad et al 2020 this can be attributed to the water production process where belila et al 2016 reported that the diversity decreased during the seawater desalination process bacterial community analysis for unchlorinated water and biofilm revealed the abundance of mesophilic bacteria with higher temperature tolerance and bacteria associated with nutrient poor oligotrophic conditions fig 7 s4 s5 for example species of the family blastocatellaceae were found to tolerate temperature values of 8 45 c optimal growth at 33 40 c and exhibit a chemoorganotrophic growth on several substrates with species able to use nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen huber et al 2017 hu et al 2019 the relative abundance of blastocatellaceae was shown to be higher in substrate limited conditions where ivanova et al 2020 showed a negative correlation of relative abundance of blastocatellia with carbon and nitrogen availability most of the biofilm bacteria were characterized as non motile therefore their strong adherence to surfaces and biofilm forming ability the shannon phylogenetic alpha diversity index of the unchlorinated biofilm was higher than that of the water 3 9 but the difference was not significant p 0 064 no indication of the occurrence of opportunistic pathogens was observed at the species level fig s6 although the bacterial cell concentration increased and biofilm development inside the miniature network was high 107cells cm2 260 pg atp cm2 however opportunistic pathogen occurrence should be confirmed with qpcr targeting opportunistic pathogen specific genes or through culture based techniques van der kooij et al 2018 the chlorinated water leaving the treatment plant was dominated by alphaproteobacteria 76 5 fig 7b in agreement with previous findings showing alphaproteobacteria to be the dominant group in treated water samples due to their capacity to survive in low nutrient and chlorinated environments chao et al 2013 some members of alphaproteobacteria have been found to commonly contain glutathione biosynthesis genes chao et al 2013 glutathione has been proven to directly increase bacterial resistance to chlorine compounds chesney et al 1996 therefore possibly explaining the abundance in chlorinated water moreover it has been found that starvation noticeably stimulates glutathione synthesis and subsequently enhances bacterial chlorine resistance saby et al 1999 the ro treated water contains limited nutrient concentrations that might induce starvation conditions sousi et al 2020 2021 the alpha diversity of chlorinated water was the lowest 1 87 where a single species blastomonas natatoria a mesophilic bacterium known to survive disinfection regimes sylvie et al 2010 dominated the species present in the chlorinated water 65 1 fig s3 as for the water samples leaving the chlorinated miniature network and water samples at network l3 fig 7b the alphaproteobacteria abundance decreased drastically in favor of gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria this is consistent with studies showing that betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were observed more frequently in water with low disinfectant residuals el chakhtoura et al 2015 the class bacilli class from the phylum firmicutes also increased significantly at these two locations compared to original produced chlorinated water the pcoa plot fig 6 shows that the water at network l3 and water leaving the chlorinated miniature network is closely clustered and at a middle distance from the chlorinated produced water and from the biofilm we can see that the water leaving the chlorinated miniature network and at network l3 is impacted by the original bacterial community in the produced chlorinated water and the biofilm community that is developing in the pipes that is distinctly different and more diverse shannon phylogenetic alpha diversity index 4 29 p 0 034 the water flow in the network leads to the detachment of cells from biofilms hence their manifestation in the water phase in addition changes in conditions chlorine concentration temperature stagnation etc during distribution induce changes in the bacterial community the biofilm that developed in the chlorinated miniature network contained several species identified as opportunistic pathogens more than 21 of the relative abundance of the species present these species included streptococcus salivarius 7 8 staphylococcus aureus 4 2 pseudomonas synxantha 2 4 streptococcus pneumonia 2 4 pseudomonas veronii 2 6 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1 5 fig s3 the water bacterial community at network location 3 as well contained several species classified as opportunistic pathogens capable of infecting immunocompromised patients and in some cases the immunocompetent population these opportunistic pathogenic species included pseudomonas aeruginosa group 29 9 diggle and whiteley 2020 ralstonia insidiosa 3 4 ryan and adley 2013 delftia acidovorans 1 9 bilgin et al 2015 and herbaspirillum huttiense group 1 5 liu et al 2019 these results confirm that chlorination limits bacterial abundance in produced water lowering the bacterial cell count and activity chlorination selects against most groups of bacteria influences some more than others depending on concentration and contact time what remains are the chlorine resistant strains chlorination creates a niche for bacteria to occupy during distribution once the conditions vary however opportunistic pathogen occurrence or absence should be confirmed with qpcr targeting opportunistic pathogen specific genes or through culture based techniques van der kooij et al 2018 without such data no conclusive evidence of an actual risk can be justified 4 3 significance of results from simulative miniature distribution networks access to the water before chlorination enabled simulation and evaluation of the consequences of distributing high quality water without residual disinfection particularly in regions with elevated water temperatures the use of miniature network also enabled studying the biofilms developing on the inside of the miniature network pipes and comparing the bacterial community to that in the water samples investigating the biofilms developing on pipes is important and this is mostly excluded in many studies as accessing the surface of pipes within operative networks is difficult however it is worth to mention that recently many research groups acknowledged the importance of studying biofilms in dwds despite the complexity and major efforts to understand biofilms has been reported gomez smith et al 2015 douterelo et al 2018a waak et al 2018 2019a 2019b van der kooij et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021 calero preciado et al 2021 the use of a miniature network also enabled the comparison between the bacterial communities in the water leaving the miniature network with the water in the actual distribution network miniature pilot distribution networks have been applied in previous studies liu et al 2013 álvarez arroyo et al 2015 abokifa et al 2016 brester et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 liu et al 2013 for example evaluated the impact of various treatment schemes on water quality during distribution using miniature networks the miniature network fed with water before chlorination had more biofilm development 2 3 log higher tcc and atp after six months of operation the biofilm atp concentration was 4 102 pg cm2 fig 5 and would definitely increase in time van der kooij et al 2017 determined in their study a threshold concentration of approximately 50 pg atp cm2 for the growth of legionella pneumophila in biofilm nevertheless in this study the biofilm that developed in the miniature before chlorination although much more in amount did not show the presence of opportunistic pathogenic species absence of opportunistic pathogens shall be confirmed in future study with cultivation based methods or q pcr excessive bacterial and biofilm growth is not desirable as it can lead to deterioration of the esthetic water quality even if no pathogens exist to pose a human health risk results from this study showed that chlorine limited bacterial growth and biofilm development in the miniature network fed with chlorinated water minimizing the changes in water quality that could have been observed if unchlorinated water was distributed on the other hand chlorine selected against most bacterial groups and the remaining bacterial community were chlorine resistance and opportunistic pathogen species figs 6 and s3 this observation was also seen in the water samples post chlorination at the actual distribution network network l3 however the very low atp activity and intact bacterial cell concentration signals to no potential risk which can only be concretely eliminated through pathogen cultivation based methods or q pcr results from this study indicate that in such conditions water quality parameters such as e g total cell concentration hpc should not be the only risk eliminator and several checks and barriers such as direct quantification of pathogenic species should be employed to distribute safe water to the end users 5 conclusion this study evaluated the water quality in a full scale distribution network supplied with chlorinated ro produced drinking water in addition a simulative study involving miniature distribution networks was conducted to assess whether chlorination was necessary to distribute biostable water this study distinctively investigated a combination of bulk water samples feeding and leaving the miniature networks under both chlorinated and non chlorinated conditions as well as biofilm samples from the miniature network pipes over six months the main findings of the study can be summarized by the water leaving the plant had an average cell concentration of 103 cells ml a 0 5 1 5 log increase in bacterial cell concentration was observed at the network locations chlorine was largely dissipated in the full scale network from 0 5 mg l at the treatment plant to less than 0 1 mg l in the network the low bacterial cell concentration and organic carbon concentration in the ro produced water did not prevent biofilm development inside the miniature network fed with unchlorinated water the biofilm in the unchlorinated miniature network was dominated by mesophilic bacteria with higher temperature tolerance and bacteria associated nutrient poor conditions chlorination selected against most bacterial groups and the remaining bacterial community was the one capable of surviving disinfection regimes biofilms that developed in the presence of chlorine contained species classified as opportunistic pathogens affecting the water bacterial community the actual risk of this encounter can be only be eliminated through pathogen cultivation based methods or q pcr high quality water cannot be employed as the only barrier to ensure water safety especially in high temperature regions therefore chlorination remains necessary in

16339,monitoring the changes that occur to water during distribution is vital to ensure water safety in this study the biological stability of reverse osmosis ro produced drinking water characterized by low cell concentration and low assimilable organic carbon in combination with chlorine disinfection was investigated water quality at several locations throughout the existing distribution network was monitored to investigate whether microbial water quality changes can be identified results revealed that the water leaving the plant had an average bacterial cell concentration of 103 cells ml a 0 5 1 5 log increase in bacterial cell concentration was observed at locations in the network the residual disinfectant was largely dissipated in the network from 0 5 mg l at the treatment plant to less than 0 1 mg l in the network locations the simulative study involving miniature distribution networks mimicking the dynamics of a distribution network fed with the ro produced chlorinated and non chlorinated drinking water revealed that distributing ro produced water without residual disinfection especially at high water temperatures 25 30 c poses a higher chance for water quality change within six months of operation of the miniature network fed with unchlorinated ro produced water the adenosine triphosphate atp and total cell concentration tcc in the pipe biofilm were 4 102 pg atp cm2 and 1 107 cells cm2 the low bacterial cell concentration and organic carbon concentration in the ro produced water did not prevent biofilm development inside the network with and without residual chlorine the bacterial community analysis using 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene sequencing revealed that mesophilic bacteria with higher temperature tolerance and bacteria associated with oligotrophic nutrient poor conditions dominated the biofilm with no indication of the existence of opportunistic pathogenic species however chlorination selected against most bacterial groups and the bacterial community that remained was mainly the bacteria capable of surviving disinfection regimes biofilms that developed in the presence of chlorine contained species classified as opportunistic pathogens these biofilms have an impact on shaping the water quality received at the consumer tap the presence of these bacteria on its own is not a health risk indicator viability assessment and qpcrs targeting genes specific to the opportunistic pathogens as well as quantitative microbiological risk assessment qmra should be included to assess the risk the results from this study highlight the importance of implementing multiple barriers to ensure water safety changes in water quality detected even when high quality disinfected ro produced water is distributed highlight microbiological challenges that chlorinated systems endure especially at high water temperatures keywords distribution network bacterial regrowth opportunistic pathogens reverse osmosis produced water disinfection 1 introduction the health and well being of humans strongly depend on adequate access to microbiologically safe drinking water szewzyk et al 2000 shannon et al 2008 considerable time and money is invested in treating available water resources to remove undesirable microorganisms in drinking water systems plappally and lienhard 2012 depending on the water source water goes through various treatment steps until it becomes adequate for human consumption after the treated water leaves the treatment plant it has to flow through the drinking water distribution system dwds and network of pipes before reaching the consumer taps the dwds with its unique environment can lead to deterioration of the microbial water quality if the appropriate environment for bacterial regrowth is created lechevallier et al 1996 miettinen et al 1997 liu et al 2002 schurer et al 2019 two primary approaches are often pursued to prevent bacterial regrowth in dwds i limiting the nutrients available for bacterial growth or ii the use of disinfection residuals in the first approach water utilities emphasize the removal of readily biodegradable low molecular weight compounds that are considered as food for bacteria to grow volk and lechevallier 2000 water utilities put additional efforts to optimize treatment schemes to enable better removal of slowly biodegradable high molecular weight compounds as these compounds degrade at a slower rate leading to bacterial regrowth at farther locations in the distribution network hijnen et al 2018 schurer et al 2019 disinfection is another common approach to prevent bacterial regrowth by using disinfectants such as chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine before distributing the water and maintaining a disinfectant residual in dwds propato and uber 2004 liu et al 2016 farhat et al 2018b water utilities globally preclude distribution without a disinfectant residual and disinfection is implemented in most countries and usually allows the distribution of biologically stable water however one cannot ignore the carcinogenic disinfection by products that form when disinfectants react with organic compounds present in the water garcia villanova et al 1997 mercier shanks et al 2013 many groups of disinfection by products are regulated in drinking water guidelines and water utilities have to limit the production of these by products monitor and measure their concentration to make sure they abide by the guidelines guilherme and rodriguez 2014 zeng and mitch 2016 the dynamics of nutrient availability in dwds together with various other aspects such as pipe material hydrodynamic conditions water temperature and presence absence of disinfection residual create complex environments in dwdss that can be hard to predict prest et al 2016 in specific environments and despite all efforts to control bacterial regrowth bacteria can still grow in dwds even in distribution systems with low nutrient conditions and with the presence of residual disinfectant potgieter et al 2018 the water utilities effort to produce high quality water cannot be complete without expanding these efforts to involve other entities that maintain the dwds vreeburg and boxall 2007 monitoring the microbial quality in the dwds is essential farhat et al 2020 most of the existing methods to monitor drinking water depend on the detection of microorganisms in bulk water samples from consumer taps and using cultivation dependent methods douterelo et al 2018b since mostly all legislation around the world still consider the cultivation dependent quantification methods as the principal applied compliance parameters chowdhury 2012 using these methods underestimates the actual diversity and abundance of microorganisms in the environment moreover attached bacteria inside the distribution pipes are often overlooked although biofilms can constitute over 95 of the biomass in dwds flemming et al 2002 biofilms on the inside of the distribution network pipes have been associated with a higher risk of occurrence of opportunistic pathogens compromising the safety and quality of drinking water lehtola et al 2007 van der kooij et al 2017 investigating the biofilms developing on pipes is important and this is mostly excluded in many studies as accessing the surface of pipes within operative networks is difficult douterelo et al 2016 however it is worth to mention that recently many research groups acknowledged the importance of studying biofilms in dwds despite the complexity and major efforts to understand biofilms has been reported gomez smith et al 2015 douterelo et al 2018a waak et al 2018 2019a 2019b van der kooij et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021 calero preciado et al 2021 in this study a combination of approaches to achieve biologically stable water during distribution was investigated seawater was desalinated using reverse osmosis ro membranes and the produced water was chlorinated prior to distribution to the dwds under investigation the ro produced water is characterized by low bacterial cell concentration and low assimilable organic carbon concentration the distribution network is unique as all the pipes are of the same age 10 years and of the same material pvc and feeding a confined area 45 km2 from one source only first water quality at several locations throughout the existing distribution network fed with chlorinated ro produced drinking water was monitored to investigate whether microbial water quality changes can be identified then a simulative study involving miniature distribution networks mimicking the dynamics of a dwds was conducted this study investigated the effect of chlorine presence and absence on biological stability of ro produced water using miniature networks to assess whether chlorination was necessary to distribute biostable water this study uniquely analyzed a combination of bulk water samples feeding and leaving the miniature networks under both chlorinated and non chlorinated conditions as well as biofilm samples from the miniature network pipes over six months 2 materials and methods 2 1 analysis of water samples from the plant and distribution network 2 1 1 site description the ro membrane desalination plant at king abdullah university of science and technology thuwal saudi arabia produces drinking water through the desalination of seawater from the red sea the plant capacity is 40 000 m3 d and the treatment process schematic can be found in farhat et al 2020 and fig s1 in supplementary material in short seawater is pretreated through spruce and cartridge filters before reaching the ro modules the plant has two stages of ro the permeate water from the first stage is stored in a break tank only 20 percent of the first stage ro is treated with a second stage ro the final drinking water is a blend of first and second stage ro permeate subsequently dosed with chlorine co2 and lime and stored in a storage tank for this study we had access to the produced water before dosing chlorine blended first stage and second stage ro permeate with co2 and lime and after chlorine addition water quality parameters leaving the treatment plant are shown in table s1 in supplementary material 2 1 2 sampling scheme five sampling locations were investigated to analyze the water quality through time two locations were examined at the treatment plant 1 produced water without chlorine and 2 produced water with chlorine three locations were selected at the distribution network with varying proximities from the treatment plant fig 1 network l1 l2 l3 were 2 4 2 0 and 1 8 km away from the treatment plant the average estimated hydraulic residence times are between 3 and 5 h 2 1 3 microbial analysis flow cytometry analysis flow cytometry fcm was used to determine the total bacterial cell concentration tcc as described previously farhat et al 2018a in short 2 µl aliquot of sybr green i 10 000 concentrate molecular probes switzerland diluted 100 times with deionized water was added to 200 µl of each water sample and incubated for 10 min at 37 c in the dark before analysis the tcc of water samples was measured using an accuri c6 plus fcm bd biosciences usa online measurements of total cell numbers were done using an automated online monitoring system oncyt robot oncyt switzerland coupled to an fcm bd biosciences usa as described by besmer et al 2014 every 10 min the water sample was taken and stained with sybr green i final concentration 1 and subsequently incubated for 10 min at 37 c inside the online robot cleaning procedures with hypochlorite 1 active chlorine sigma aldrich usa sodium thiosulfate solution 100 mm sigma aldrich usa and ultrapure water were automatically conducted after every measurement the total cell numbers and the ratio between high nucleic acid hna bacteria and low nucleic acid lna bacteria was analyzed at the same time every 10 min the measurements were conducted for a whole week at the various locations the flow cytometric data were analyzed using manufacturer provided software cyplot software oncyt switzerland the hna and the lna bacteria were separated based on green fluorescence intensity fl1 channel the flowchic cytometric histogram image comparison koch et al 2013 koch et al 2014 tool analysis was performed using r packages flowchic54 55 the chic tool allows a comparison of cytometric datasets without gating decisions and any cytometric pre experience due to an automated image comparison procedure the flow cytometric measurements of each sample need to be visualized using forward scatter fsc against fluorescence the non metric multidimensional scale nmds plot was made using r software version 3 5 2 2 2 miniature distribution network study two miniature water distribution networks were placed at the ro desalination plant to study the effect of chlorine absence and presence on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the microbial community during distribution the first miniature distribution network was fed with non chlorinated drinking water and the second miniature distribution network was fed with chlorinated drinking water of the same quality as the water entering the real distribution network the miniature distribution networks consisted of nylon tubing 6 mm in diameter and 270 m length wrapped around a 1 m2 frame a water flow velocity similar to the actual distribution system was simulated the average flow rate inside the miniature networks was maintained at 23 l h resulting in a flow velocity of 0 2 m s and a residence time of 25 min this residence time was shorter that the residence time in the actual network of 3 5 h a picture of the miniature network system is shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material the water feeding and leaving the miniature distribution networks was analyzed after 3 and 6 6 months of operation in addition biofilm development inside the pipes of the miniature distribution network was investigated 2 2 1 adenosine triphosphate atp and total cell concentration tcc measurements the atp and tcc of the water entering and leaving the miniature network along with atp and tcc in the biofilm formed on the miniature network pipes were measured for the pipe biofilm samples a 4 cm tube length was cut wiped with 70 ethanol from outside to clean and disinfect the pipe and placed in a capped tube in 40 ml sterile tap water for atp analysis and milli q ultrapure water for tcc analysis the tubes with the pipe sections were mixed on a vortex few seconds and sonicated using a sonifier probe q700 qsonica sonicator usa for 1 2 min sample kept on ice until the liquid was homogenous atp was measured using a luminometer celsis advance charles river laboratories inc usa and tcc was measured according to the protocol explained earlier samples were measured in triplicates student s t test was used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means at the different conditions chlorine no chlorine inlet outlet 3months 6 months the difference was considered significant when the calculated p values were less than 0 05 2 2 2 microbial communities in water and pipe biofilm samples for the water samples 20 liters of water was collected and filtered on 0 22 µm mixed cellulose esters membrane gswp14250 millipore usa on the same day of sampling triplicate 20 l samples were taken after six months of operating the miniature network then average of triplicate samples was used to plot taxonomic distribution of bacterial community relative abundance for the pipe biofilm samples 4 pieces of 4 cm pipe section were cut from the miniature distribution network after six months of operating the miniature network then average of quadruple samples was used to plot taxonomic distribution of bacterial community relative abundance in the biofilm the filters and pipe sections were stored at 20 c until processing microbial genomic dna from the filtration membranes and the pipe sections was extracted using the dneasy powerwater kit purchased from qiagen usa per the manufacturer protocol the quantification of dna concentration was performed using qubit 4 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa and qubit dsdna high sensitivity hs assay kit detection range 0 01 100 ng µl thermo fisher scientific usa the total microbial communities in the extracted dna samples were determined at kaust bioscience core laboratory saudi arabia by performing 16s rrna gene based high throughput sequencing on the illumina miseq platform following the protocol by the manufacturer illumina usa the input dna was standardized prior to sequencing all pcr polymerase chain reaction details were according to the protocol illumina usa the forward 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and reverse 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc primers were selected to amplify the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene herlemann et al 2011 bacterial community analysis was performed using chunlab in house ezbiocloud 16s based microbiome taxonomic profiling mtp yoon et al 2017 the reference 16s rrna gene sequences were maintained as described in kim et al 2012 the quality of sequencing for pcr derived sequences was checked manually by secondary structure aware alignment using the ezeditor program jeon et al 2014 maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of each taxonomic group such as phyla classes orders or families were generated from computationally aligned 16s rrna gene sequences all 16s rrna gene sequences were assigned taxonomically operational taxonomic unit otu based assignment to the species level as a part of the complete taxonomic hierarchy which consisted of phylum class order family genus and species 97 16s similarity is used as the cutoff for species level identification the average number of valid reads obtained from all the samples was 68 000 22 100 details can be found in table s2 in supplementary material the bacterial alpha diversity was calculated using the shannon weaver diversity index h with the following equation h n 1 n p i in p i where p i is the proportion of each species in the sample the distribution free statistical similarity test applied was the wilcoxon rank sum test also referred to as the mann whitney u test a nonparametric test of the null hypothesis that for randomly selected values x and y from two populations the probability of x being greater than y is equal to the probability of y being greater than x yuan et al 2006 the significance value was set at p 0 05 the sequences were compared for their bray curtis similarities and represented graphically for spatial distribution in a multivariate statistics plot called principal coordinate analysis pcoa permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to measure effect size and significance on beta diversity for the different water and biofilm chlorinated unchlorinated sample groups beta diversity and phylogenetic diversity measures are included in the permanova analysis the significance is obtained by a permutation test the level of significance was set at p 0 05 submission of sequence reads for this study to ddbj ena genbank nucleotide database is in progress 3 results 3 1 microbial water quality monitoring from treatment to distribution microbial water quality was monitored using online fcm at five locations two at the treatment plant and three locations throughout the existing distribution network at the treatment plant produced water before chlorination had a higher bacterial cell concentration than after chlorination fig 2 fig 2a shows the flow cytometric fingerprint by plotting bacterial cell concentrations versus percentage of high nucleic acid hna bacteria as previous studies showed that the activity of hna bacteria is correlated to total cell activity the hna percentage together with the total cell concentration increased in the network locations before chlorination the average bacterial cell concentration was 3 5 103 cell ml while chlorination reduced the concentration to below 103 cell ml the limit of detection lod fig 2b moreover the box plot in fig 2b shows that the water bacterial cell concentration values leaving the treatment plant after chlorine were the most dispersed 25 75 range the widest 50 of the concentration values were below the fcm detection limit possibly resulting in the higher dispersion of values a 0 5 1 5 log increase in bacterial cell concentration was observed at the network locations compared to the plant location directly after chlorination reaching a concentration of 4 104 cells ml at network l3 the residual disinfectant was largely dissipated table s3 the nmds plot based on the flowchic analysis fig 3 shows the samples after chlorination clustered closely together signifying their similarity the samples before chlorination appear as a completely different and wider cluster with higher variability at the three network locations three bacterial clusters can be distinguished these clusters at the network locations appear closer to the after chlorination samples signaling the similarity however the samples from the three network locations are more scattered than the after chlorination samples at the treatment plant which indicates shifts in bacterial characteristics size dna content and occurrence of a much more diverse bacterial community wider clusters these data show that the presence of disinfectant residual did not prevent bacterial changes during distribution fig 3 and as seen in fig 2 bacterial regrowth occurred 3 2 miniature network studies using the fcm monitoring of water from treatment to distribution we could identify changes in the microbial water quality figs 2 and 3 however assessing the surface of pipes within the operative distribution network to investigate the existing biofilm was difficult raising the interest in conducting simulative network distribution studies moreover since we could only evaluate the microbial dynamics with the presence of chlorine the miniature distribution networks were initiated to understand what would be the impact of chlorine presence and absence on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the microbial water quality and community 3 2 1 microbial water quality monitoring for six months two miniature networks were fed with unchlorinated and chlorinated water produced by ro desalination water quality using atp and tcc was assessed at the miniature network inlet and outlet locations fig 4 the miniature network fed with unchlorinated water showed an increase in atp and tcc in the outlet water after three and six months of operation fig 4a b the tcc concentration in the outlet water after three months of operation was two times higher the concentration at the inlet 1 2 104 cells ml inlet and 2 5 104 cells ml in the outlet t test p 0 021 fig 4a a similar trend was observed for the atp concentration which was 2 3 times higher at the outlet 1 5 pg ml compared to the inlet 0 7 pg ml t test p 0 035 fig 4b at six months of operation the outlet cell concentration 4 5 104 cells ml was one log higher than that of the inlet 4 4 103 cells ml t test p 0 0002 however the atp increase observed at six months although significant t test p 0 006 was not in proportion to the increase in tcc the atp in the outlet water 0 8 pg ml was only 2 7 times higher than that of the inlet 0 3 pg ml this would signal increased biofilm growth inside the network with less active cells sloughing out of the biofilm and ending up in the outlet water the decline in tcc and atp concentration of the feed water observed at six months compared to three months is a seasonal variation fig 4a b the study was initiated in april and the three and six month sampling occurred in july and october respectively the miniature network fed with chlorinated water did not show any increasing trend t test all p 0 05 table s4 between inlet and outlet or any temporal increase in tcc or atp fig 4a b there was no difference in chlorine concentration between the inlet and outlet justifying the observed trend 3 2 2 biofilm characterization in addition to microbial water quality biofilm development in both miniature networks was investigated attached bacteria inside distribution pipes are momentous as biofilms on the inside of the distribution network pipes have been associated with a higher risk of opportunistic pathogens van der kooij et al 2017 biofilm development inside the pipes of the miniature network was characterized by tcc and atp concentration for the miniature network fed with produced water before chlorination a significant concentration of bacterial cells 2 3 106 cells cm2 was found in the biofilm developing at the inlet after three months of operation fig 5 a the biofilm developing at the outlet had less tcc 0 9 106 cells cm2 than the inlet but the difference was not significant t test p 0 085 the biofilm atp concentration showed a similar trend to the tcc between the inlet 135 pg cm2 and outlet 103 pg cm2 however the difference between the two concentrations was significant t test p 0 001 comparing the biofilm after 6 months to the biofilm after 3 months of operation almost 1 log increase in the biofilm tcc was observed at the inlet t test p 0 0096 with a significant atp concentration increase t test p 0 001 fig 5a b at the outlet only the biofilm tcc increased in time 6 months compared to 3 months but the increase was only double t test p 0 028 while atp concentration remained similar to what it was three months before t test p 0 257 the higher increase in tcc and atp at the inlet may be explained by higher availability of substrate in the water at the inlet compared to the outlet for the miniature network fed with chlorinated water an increasing tcc in the biofilm was observed in time at both the inlet and outlet of the network t test p 0 05 table s5 however the biofilm tcc was 2 3 logs lower than when chlorine was absent t test p 0 05 no distinction could be made between the biofilm at the inlet and outlet as the growth was suppressed by the chlorine presence the negligible atp concentration at both the inlet and outlet fig 5b indicates that the quantified tcc concentration is mainly composed of inactive or dead bacterial cells this was confirmed with intact cell concentration measurements of the chlorinated water that were all below the lod 103 cells ml of the fcm with an average of 100 40 cells ml 3 3 bacterial community composition analysis was performed on the dna extracted from 20 l water samples in triplicates at each location and biofilm samples water samples were taken at the actual distribution network location 3 and at the inlet and outlet of the two miniature networks fed with non chlorinated and chlorinated ro produced water dna was also extracted from the biofilm that developed in both miniature networks principal coordinate analysis pcoa for measuring beta diversity is an ordination method that aims to arrange ecological communities along gradients pcoa was performed on the biofilm and the unchlorinated and chlorinated water in and out of the miniature network and water samples at network location 3 the bacterial community in network l3 was closely clustered to the bacterial community found in the water leaving the miniature network permanova p 0 10 not significant n s fig 6 the chlorinated water feeding the miniature network and the biofilm community that developed inside the miniature network were clustered separately signifying their differences permanova p 0 033 the water bacterial community leaving the miniature network was clearly impacted by the biofilm developing inside the network this highlights the importance of the biofilm developing in the distribution network in shaping the water received at the tap as for the unchlorinated water feeding and leaving the miniature network the two clusters were quite undistinguishable very close and overlapping with each other permanova p 0 10 n s signaling their similarity while the biofilm was farther away thus quite different permanova p 0 026 the significance values between the different water and biofilm chlorinated unchlorinated sample groups based on the permanova analysis are shown in table s6 in supplementary material 3 3 1 chlorinated and non chlorinated ro produced drinking water the ro produced water feeding the actual distribution network was also used to feed the chlorinated miniature network the chlorinated ro produced water was dominated at the phylum level by proteobacteria 90 4 with the presence of firmicutes 2 8 and actinobacteria 2 5 fig 7 a at the class level the chlorinated water had a high abundance of alphaproteobacteria 76 3 gammaproteobacteria 11 9 betaproteobacteria 1 8 and the presence of bacilli 2 3 and actinobacteria c 2 4 classes blastomonas natatoria a mesophilic bacterium dominated the species present in the chlorinated water 65 1 fig s3 supplementary material the second two species in relative abundance were pseudomonas stutzeri group 9 5 and erythrobacter citreus sp 4 5 compared to the chlorinated ro produced water feeding the miniature network both the chlorinated water leaving the miniature network and the water at network location 3 had a lower abundance of proteobacteria 54 5 and 64 5 respectively and a higher abundance of firmicutes 39 5 and 29 5 respectively fig 7a at the class level gammaproteobacteria 47 5 abundance increased the most at network l3 pseudomonas aeruginosa 29 9 from the gammaproteobacteria class was found present in the network location 3 fig s3 comparing the water bacterial community before chlorination with the community after chlorination the water samples before chlorination had less proteobacteria 81 3 and more firmicutes 14 0 with a low relative abundance of actinobacteria 2 0 and acidobacteria 1 4 fig 7a at the class level the non chlorinated water had a lower abundance of alphaproteobacteria 34 1 compared to 76 2 in the chlorinated water while classes such as gammaproteobacteria 34 6 and betaproteobacteria 11 0 increased in abundance the most abundant species in the unchlorinated water were the sphingopyxis macrogoltabida group 29 2 an oligotrophic bacteria and reyranella uc 12 0 the following two most abundant species were pseudomonas aeruginosa group 7 1 and anaerobacillus ay642552 s 5 6 fig s4 bacterial community changes were seen in the unchlorinated water leaving the miniature network compared to that feeding the network at the phylum level the unchlorinated water leaving the miniature network had less proteobacteria 68 6 and more firmicutes 24 50 compared to the water feeding the network fig 7a at the class level a higher abundance of alphaproteobacteria 46 9 compared to 34 1 and bacilli 24 4 compared to 14 0 while classes such as gammaproteobacteria 14 2 and betaproteobacteria 7 3 decreased in abundance fig 7b although differences existed between the unchlorinated water feeding and leaving the miniature network the pcoa fig 6 showed the sample clusters close to each other signifying their similarities 3 3 2 biofilm bacterial community with and without chlorination the biofilm community was different from that in the water at the phylum level although proteobacteria dominated all samples compared to the unchlorinated water the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased in the biofilm developing in the miniature network fed with water before chlorination from 81 2 to 59 3 fig 7a phylum such as saccharibacteria 13 6 planctomycetes 11 9 and bacteroidetes 1 4 emerged in the biofilm community while phyla such as acidobacteria 5 0 and actinobacteria 4 6 increased in abundance the shannon phylogenetic alpha diversity index of the biofilm 3 90 was higher than that of the water 3 64 but the difference was not significant u test p 0 064 at the class level alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria increased in relative abundance in the biofilm 36 6 15 0 and 2 3 respectively in contrast the abundance of gammaproteobacteria decreased from 34 6 to 4 2 in the biofilm in comparison blastocatellia class had a higher relative abundance in the biofilm compared to the water blastocatellia was in a very low relative abundance in the feed water and rather emerged in the biofilm the biofilm that developed in the miniature network fed with chlorinated water was distinct in the high relative abundance of firmicutes 28 0 at the phylum level and bacilli 25 7 at the class level the shannon phylogenetic alpha diversity index of the biofilm 4 29 was significantly higher than that of the chlorinated water 1 87 u test p 0 034 biofilms that developed in the two miniature networks were clearly different more biofilm developed in the network fed with unchlorinated water 4 discussion 4 1 water quality changes for chlorinated ro produced drinking water during distribution the uniqueness of the water distributed in this network is the extremely low bacterial cell count and substrate concentration at the distribution point table s1 the average total bacterial cell concentration leaving the treatment plant was 1 103 cell ml and in many cases even lower fig 2 the detection limit for total cell concentration was 1 103 cells ml as determined in another study by us putri et al 2021 and ziemba et al 2019 while having a low bacterial cell concentration in the water is foreseen as positive for biological stability the consequence is that this creates a niche for microorganisms to occupy downstream of the treatment process nescerecka et al 2014 as seen in this distribution network figs 2 6 7 and s3 the particularly low cell concentration and chlorine residual 0 5 mg l did not prevent bacterial regrowth reaching 2 104 cells ml in some locations fig 2 quantifying the assimilable organic carbon concentration aoc from the growth potential of the produced water hammes and egli 2005 reveals an aoc concentration of 5 10 µg c l table s1 such an aoc concentration derived from a growth potential of 104 cells ml can cause this amount of biofilm regrowth once chlorine gets reduced or dissipated keeping in mind that the cell concentration does not directly link to human health prest et al 2016 and many regions receiving chlorinated water have cell concentrations feeding the network in the range of 105 cells ml nescerecka et al 2014 however more biofilm on the inside of the pipes is anticipated at higher cell concentrations leading to a higher risk for consumer complaints due to water aesthetics and higher risk of occurrence of opportunistic pathogens pavlov et al 2004 van der kooij et al 2017 kotlarz et al 2019 accessing the health risks of the water should be confirmed using the internationally accepted culture based approaches hpc and mpn and indeed the viability tests intact cell concentration q pcr however the limitations of hpc analysis including the long incubation time required variation in test results depending on experimental conditions and detection of only a minute fraction of the total number of viable bacteria have been stated in previous studies van nevel et al 2017 cheswick et al 2019 in a previous study at the same distribution network farhat et al 2020 we compared flow cytometry data with the conventional water quality detection methods hpc and total coliforms hpc and total coliforms were constantly below the detection limits while the fcm provided detectable total cell count data and enabled quantifying changes in the drinking water therefore the direct bacterial quantification method fcm has been applied in this study for the drinking water samples to overcome the limitations of conventional bacterial culture dependent methods van nevel et al 2013 the inclusion of atp concentration measurements gives an indication on the activity of the cells measured through fcm the variation in the increase in bacterial cell concentration seen in this network resulted from differences in the proximity of sampling locations to the treatment plant size and building use chlorine decay contributed to bacterial growth and the relatively high water temperature 30 c accelerated the chlorine decay hua et al 1999 and bacterial growth compared to dwds with chlorine at lower water temperature a decay from 0 5 mg l to less than 0 05 mg l was observed in locations over the network the significant role that temperature plays in these regions cannot be overlooked as higher temperatures facilitate biofilm development and select for certain microorganisms including pathogens delpla et al 2009 nescerecka et al 2014 bondank et al 2018 in addition to temperature building sizes premise piping lengths and water usage dictated the chlorine decay samples taken in large buildings with longer premise piping lengths and more stagnant segments show lower chlorine concentrations and higher cell concentrations bédard et al 2018 proctor et al 2020 4 2 chlorination selects against most bacterial groups and creates a niche for microorganisms to occupy downstream 16s rrna genes sequencing of water and biofilm samples before and after chlorination revealed taxonomically diverse bacterial communities the diversity of planktonic bacteria declined from 3 64 in the unchlorinated ro produced water to 1 87 after chlorination shannon phylogenetic alpha diversity index the shannon alpha diversity index for chlorinated water was lower than values reported in literature for chlorinated water produced by conventional treatment methods zhang et al 2021 and significantly lower than diversity indices reported for non chlorinated water ahmad et al 2020 this can be attributed to the water production process where belila et al 2016 reported that the diversity decreased during the seawater desalination process bacterial community analysis for unchlorinated water and biofilm revealed the abundance of mesophilic bacteria with higher temperature tolerance and bacteria associated with nutrient poor oligotrophic conditions fig 7 s4 s5 for example species of the family blastocatellaceae were found to tolerate temperature values of 8 45 c optimal growth at 33 40 c and exhibit a chemoorganotrophic growth on several substrates with species able to use nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen huber et al 2017 hu et al 2019 the relative abundance of blastocatellaceae was shown to be higher in substrate limited conditions where ivanova et al 2020 showed a negative correlation of relative abundance of blastocatellia with carbon and nitrogen availability most of the biofilm bacteria were characterized as non motile therefore their strong adherence to surfaces and biofilm forming ability the shannon phylogenetic alpha diversity index of the unchlorinated biofilm was higher than that of the water 3 9 but the difference was not significant p 0 064 no indication of the occurrence of opportunistic pathogens was observed at the species level fig s6 although the bacterial cell concentration increased and biofilm development inside the miniature network was high 107cells cm2 260 pg atp cm2 however opportunistic pathogen occurrence should be confirmed with qpcr targeting opportunistic pathogen specific genes or through culture based techniques van der kooij et al 2018 the chlorinated water leaving the treatment plant was dominated by alphaproteobacteria 76 5 fig 7b in agreement with previous findings showing alphaproteobacteria to be the dominant group in treated water samples due to their capacity to survive in low nutrient and chlorinated environments chao et al 2013 some members of alphaproteobacteria have been found to commonly contain glutathione biosynthesis genes chao et al 2013 glutathione has been proven to directly increase bacterial resistance to chlorine compounds chesney et al 1996 therefore possibly explaining the abundance in chlorinated water moreover it has been found that starvation noticeably stimulates glutathione synthesis and subsequently enhances bacterial chlorine resistance saby et al 1999 the ro treated water contains limited nutrient concentrations that might induce starvation conditions sousi et al 2020 2021 the alpha diversity of chlorinated water was the lowest 1 87 where a single species blastomonas natatoria a mesophilic bacterium known to survive disinfection regimes sylvie et al 2010 dominated the species present in the chlorinated water 65 1 fig s3 as for the water samples leaving the chlorinated miniature network and water samples at network l3 fig 7b the alphaproteobacteria abundance decreased drastically in favor of gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria this is consistent with studies showing that betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were observed more frequently in water with low disinfectant residuals el chakhtoura et al 2015 the class bacilli class from the phylum firmicutes also increased significantly at these two locations compared to original produced chlorinated water the pcoa plot fig 6 shows that the water at network l3 and water leaving the chlorinated miniature network is closely clustered and at a middle distance from the chlorinated produced water and from the biofilm we can see that the water leaving the chlorinated miniature network and at network l3 is impacted by the original bacterial community in the produced chlorinated water and the biofilm community that is developing in the pipes that is distinctly different and more diverse shannon phylogenetic alpha diversity index 4 29 p 0 034 the water flow in the network leads to the detachment of cells from biofilms hence their manifestation in the water phase in addition changes in conditions chlorine concentration temperature stagnation etc during distribution induce changes in the bacterial community the biofilm that developed in the chlorinated miniature network contained several species identified as opportunistic pathogens more than 21 of the relative abundance of the species present these species included streptococcus salivarius 7 8 staphylococcus aureus 4 2 pseudomonas synxantha 2 4 streptococcus pneumonia 2 4 pseudomonas veronii 2 6 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1 5 fig s3 the water bacterial community at network location 3 as well contained several species classified as opportunistic pathogens capable of infecting immunocompromised patients and in some cases the immunocompetent population these opportunistic pathogenic species included pseudomonas aeruginosa group 29 9 diggle and whiteley 2020 ralstonia insidiosa 3 4 ryan and adley 2013 delftia acidovorans 1 9 bilgin et al 2015 and herbaspirillum huttiense group 1 5 liu et al 2019 these results confirm that chlorination limits bacterial abundance in produced water lowering the bacterial cell count and activity chlorination selects against most groups of bacteria influences some more than others depending on concentration and contact time what remains are the chlorine resistant strains chlorination creates a niche for bacteria to occupy during distribution once the conditions vary however opportunistic pathogen occurrence or absence should be confirmed with qpcr targeting opportunistic pathogen specific genes or through culture based techniques van der kooij et al 2018 without such data no conclusive evidence of an actual risk can be justified 4 3 significance of results from simulative miniature distribution networks access to the water before chlorination enabled simulation and evaluation of the consequences of distributing high quality water without residual disinfection particularly in regions with elevated water temperatures the use of miniature network also enabled studying the biofilms developing on the inside of the miniature network pipes and comparing the bacterial community to that in the water samples investigating the biofilms developing on pipes is important and this is mostly excluded in many studies as accessing the surface of pipes within operative networks is difficult however it is worth to mention that recently many research groups acknowledged the importance of studying biofilms in dwds despite the complexity and major efforts to understand biofilms has been reported gomez smith et al 2015 douterelo et al 2018a waak et al 2018 2019a 2019b van der kooij et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021 calero preciado et al 2021 the use of a miniature network also enabled the comparison between the bacterial communities in the water leaving the miniature network with the water in the actual distribution network miniature pilot distribution networks have been applied in previous studies liu et al 2013 álvarez arroyo et al 2015 abokifa et al 2016 brester et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 liu et al 2013 for example evaluated the impact of various treatment schemes on water quality during distribution using miniature networks the miniature network fed with water before chlorination had more biofilm development 2 3 log higher tcc and atp after six months of operation the biofilm atp concentration was 4 102 pg cm2 fig 5 and would definitely increase in time van der kooij et al 2017 determined in their study a threshold concentration of approximately 50 pg atp cm2 for the growth of legionella pneumophila in biofilm nevertheless in this study the biofilm that developed in the miniature before chlorination although much more in amount did not show the presence of opportunistic pathogenic species absence of opportunistic pathogens shall be confirmed in future study with cultivation based methods or q pcr excessive bacterial and biofilm growth is not desirable as it can lead to deterioration of the esthetic water quality even if no pathogens exist to pose a human health risk results from this study showed that chlorine limited bacterial growth and biofilm development in the miniature network fed with chlorinated water minimizing the changes in water quality that could have been observed if unchlorinated water was distributed on the other hand chlorine selected against most bacterial groups and the remaining bacterial community were chlorine resistance and opportunistic pathogen species figs 6 and s3 this observation was also seen in the water samples post chlorination at the actual distribution network network l3 however the very low atp activity and intact bacterial cell concentration signals to no potential risk which can only be concretely eliminated through pathogen cultivation based methods or q pcr results from this study indicate that in such conditions water quality parameters such as e g total cell concentration hpc should not be the only risk eliminator and several checks and barriers such as direct quantification of pathogenic species should be employed to distribute safe water to the end users 5 conclusion this study evaluated the water quality in a full scale distribution network supplied with chlorinated ro produced drinking water in addition a simulative study involving miniature distribution networks was conducted to assess whether chlorination was necessary to distribute biostable water this study distinctively investigated a combination of bulk water samples feeding and leaving the miniature networks under both chlorinated and non chlorinated conditions as well as biofilm samples from the miniature network pipes over six months the main findings of the study can be summarized by the water leaving the plant had an average cell concentration of 103 cells ml a 0 5 1 5 log increase in bacterial cell concentration was observed at the network locations chlorine was largely dissipated in the full scale network from 0 5 mg l at the treatment plant to less than 0 1 mg l in the network the low bacterial cell concentration and organic carbon concentration in the ro produced water did not prevent biofilm development inside the miniature network fed with unchlorinated water the biofilm in the unchlorinated miniature network was dominated by mesophilic bacteria with higher temperature tolerance and bacteria associated nutrient poor conditions chlorination selected against most bacterial groups and the remaining bacterial community was the one capable of surviving disinfection regimes biofilms that developed in the presence of chlorine contained species classified as opportunistic pathogens affecting the water bacterial community the actual risk of this encounter can be only be eliminated through pathogen cultivation based methods or q pcr high quality water cannot be employed as the only barrier to ensure water safety especially in high temperature regions therefore chlorination remains necessary in
