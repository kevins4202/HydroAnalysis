9205,when crop roots are in a low oxygen environment for a long time it will lead to a series of problems to improve soil oxygen conditions a method of oxygenation irrigation is increasing the dissolved oxygen do concentration in irrigation water however its application effect in a mulched drip irrigation system is not clear in this study a field experiment was conducted in xinjiang to investigate the actual effect of oxygenation irrigation in field planting we set up mechanical oxygenation ao venturi oxygenation vo and four chemical oxygenations with different do concentrations co1 4 the results showed that physical oxygenation ao vo was limited by the saturated do of irrigation water compared with venturi oxygenation mechanical oxygenation could reach the saturated do faster and had higher stability of do concentration during single irrigation the chemical oxygenation was not limited by the saturated do the maximum do in irrigation water would also increase with the increase in the amount of oxygen enhancer but it needed more reaction time than the physical oxygen to reach a stable state the oxygenated water would be affected by water temperature and delivery distance in the mulched drip irrigation system resulting in the continuous decline of do during the irrigation process for those oxygenated water with saturated do under different oxygenation methods ao vo and co1 when they entered the soil there was no significant difference in the changing trend of do in an irrigation process with the increase of do the actual oxygenation efficiency in the soil also increased the do concentration of irrigation water was increased from 3 9 mg l 1 to 9 1 mg l 1 and 10 times of irrigation was carried out during the crop growth period then soil oxygen could be increased by an average of 6 72 6 89 by increasing the do of irrigation water the soil oxygen condition of mulched drip irrigation can be improved under the condition of saturated do each oxygenation irrigation had no significant impact on the soil physical and chemical properties after two years of irrigation the chemical oxygenation using sodium percarbonate had increased the soil ec ph and na content which means slightly intensified the soil salinization keywords oxygenation mulched drip irrigation dissolved oxygen xinjiang data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction xinjiang is the largest cotton production area in china which benefits from its rich radiation resources hu et al 2021 this region has an arid climate with low precipitation and high evaporation with scarce surface freshwater resources which brings great challenges to agricultural irrigation fu and li 2021 wei et al 2022 after decades of development and adjustment mulched drip irrigation has become the most widely used irrigation method in cotton planting in xinjiang wang et al 2021a the advantage of mulched drip irrigation is that it can reduce soil water evaporation and improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer che et al 2021 wang et al 2020 in xinjiang groundwater is an important supply of agricultural water li and chen 2020 in the exploitation of groundwater in xinjiang 84 26 is used for agricultural irrigation li 2019 when irrigation is carried out usually the groundwater is directly connected to the mulched drip irrigation system through the pump it should be noted that the dissolved oxygen do of this part of groundwater is usually low only 2 4 mg l 1 while that of surface water is usually 6 7 mg l 1 under ideal conditions the saturated do of the healthy water body can reach up to 8 9 mg l 1 therefore when groundwater is used for irrigation directly in xinjiang the do concentration of irrigation water is often too low on the other hand focusing on the future pipeline long distance water conveyance is a method that can effectively reduce water loss which is developing in many areas and is also popularizing in recent years gajghate and mirajkar 2020 kurtulmus et al 2018 zhao and li 2020 it is worth noting that long distance pipeline water conveyance makes the water isolated from the air for a long time which will also reduce the do in the water zhang et al 2014 the problems caused by using water with low do contents for agricultural irrigation have been gradually discovered in hydroponic culture the do in the culture medium is the main source of oxygen supply to crop roots ikeura et al 2017 lau and mattson 2021 for non hydroponic crops under the condition of flooding crop roots still can obtain oxygen from dissolved oxygen in the water for respiration drew 1983 jose chen lopez 2022 for traditional irrigation methods such as flood irrigation the irrigation frequency is usually low the soil is dry most of the time and the impact of do concentration of irrigation water is generally small in xinjiang mulched drip irrigation generally adopts the irrigation scheme of high frequency low per irrigation amount this makes the soil has a faster alternating frequency of dry and wet and increases the time of crop roots flooding liu et al 2011 under this condition irrigation with low dissolved oxygen water will cause cotton roots in a low oxygen environment for a long time when crop roots are under low oxygen stress it will have an adverse impact on crop growth in the stage of seed germination the concentration of dissolved oxygen in irrigation water is an important factor affecting seed germination zhu et al 2021 ayi et al 2019 indicated that oxygen stress would reduce root biomass distribution some studies have also shown that the low do concentration leads to the reduction of root water and nutrient absorption which inhibits the growth of plants hoang et al 2019 limami et al 2014 in order to improve soil oxygen conditions oxygenation irrigation was invented at present there are two main types of oxygenation one of them is independent oxygenation that is the oxygenation process is separated from the irrigation process after irrigation air or oxygen will be directly injected into the soil through the subsurface drip irrigation system or the pre buried gas pipeline with the air compressor li et al 2022 nascimento et al 2020 niu et al 2013 the advantage of this oxygenation type to soil is that it can rapidly improve aeration after irrigation niu et al 2012 but it is obvious that this type is only applicable to underground drip irrigation another type is to increase the do concentration of the irrigation water to achieve oxygenation while irrigation which can be further subdivided into physical oxygenation and chemical oxygenation for physical oxygenation common devices include air pump an et al 2022 ouyang et al 2019 yin et al 2021 micro nanobubbles generator dahrazma et al 2019 liu et al 2019 minamikawa and makino 2020 and venturi bagatur 2014 essah and holm 2020 wang et al 2022 for chemical oxygenation different chemical reagents are applied to irrigation water to generate oxygen by reacting with water its main components include hydrogen peroxide abd elhady et al 2021 sodium percarbonate zhang et al 2022 and calcium peroxide hu et al 2017 from the perspective of the planting environment oxygenation irrigation is mainly used in greenhouse agriculture or paddy field and it s mainly used in the subsurface drip irrigation system however there is little research on mulched drip irrigation under a field environment and the actual effect of oxygenation irrigation under this condition is still unclear analyzing the application results of oxygenation irrigation under field planting conditions will help us to explore the feasibility of applying oxygenation irrigation to a larger planting range in this context we set up different oxygenation irrigation methods and different oxygenation amount to monitor the effect under the condition of applying the oxygenation irrigation to the mulched drip irrigation system we monitored the change of do concentration in irrigation water and calculated the results of the oxygenation irrigation on the soil oxygen concentration and analyzed the effect of oxygenation irrigation on soil physical and chemical properties our research results will provide some reference for the application of oxygenation irrigation in field planting in similar area 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at the key laboratory of modern water saving irrigation of xinjiang production and construction crops 85 59 45 e 44 19 28 n 451 m a s l in 2019 and 2020 fig 1 there is a well in the experimental site that can pump groundwater for irrigation the salinity of the groundwater is less than 1 g l 1 and the dissolved oxygen concentration is about 3 9 mg l 1 the soil in the experimental site is mainly sandy loam with an average unit weight of 1 568 in the 0 100 cm soil layer the specific soil properties are shown in table 1 2 2 field layout the experimental planting mode was consistent with the local mechanical planting mode fig 2 that is the film covering width was 2 05 m 3 drip irrigation belts were set under each film covering 6 rows of cotton were planted and the spacing of cotton planting seeds was 10 cm the film was polyethylene ordinary plastic film the drip irrigation belt was a single wing labyrinth drip irrigation belt produced by xinjiang tianye co ltd the distance between drippers was 30 cm under the pressure of 60 kpa the actual flow of drippers was 1 6 l h 1 and the single irrigation time was 3 9 h the area of each experiment plot was 23 5 m2 4 7 m 5 m 2 3 irrigation and fertilization 2 3 1 irrigation and fertilization scheme irrigation and fertilization schemes were designed according to the local cotton irrigation and fertilization habits and relevant previous research he et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 the specific scheme is shown in table 2 irrigation amount in the whole growth period was 5250 m3 hm 2 nitrogen application rate was 300 kg n hm 2 urea ch4n2o n 46 4 phosphorus and potassium application rate were 150 kg hm 2 kh2po4 p k 51 5 2 3 2 oxygenation and irrigation after the groundwater was pumped out it was transported to a separate water storage bucket through the water transmission pipeline we used three oxygenation methods in the experiment air pump venturi device and chemical oxygenation mechanical oxygenation ao an air pump and bubble stone were used to directly oxygenate the water in the water storage bucket and the oxygenation was continuously maintained during each irrigation process venturi oxygenation vo a venturi device mazzei air injector 1078 mazzei corp corporation usa was installed on the irrigation system through which water and air were mixed under high pressure to oxygenate the water it should be pointed out that the venturi device would inject oxygen into the water and it would also form a water air mixture in the drip irrigation system however we used surface drip irrigation so during the irrigation process since the soil cracks were filled with irrigation water this part of the mixed gas would not enter the soil chemical oxygenation co oxygenation was done by adding sodium percarbonate to water sodium percarbonate would produce oxygen and sodium carbonate after dissolving in water the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water was further adjusted by setting different amounts we determined the relationship between the concentration of sodium percarbonate and the do concentration in the water through preliminary experiments fig 3 in this experiment four different gradients of chemical oxygenation co1 co4 9 13 13 21 17 2 and 25 34 mg l 1 were selected non oxygenation irrigation ck groundwater was directly used for irrigation and the do concentration of the groundwater was about 3 9 mg l 1 in summary 6 oxygenation irrigation treatments ao vo co1 co2 co3 and co4 and ck were set in the experiment fig 4 three repeated experiments were set for each treatment during each irrigation the irrigation water should be oxygenated first when the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water body reached a stable state it would start irrigating through the mulched drip irrigation system with the independent water pump in each water storage 2 4 measurement methods 2 4 1 oxygen concentration determination an oxygen meter oxy 1 st presens precision sensing gmbh germany was used to measure the do concentration in irrigation water and the environment it can monitor the oxygen content in liquid or gas during the measurement the sensor was placed in the water body or at different depths of the soil for continuous monitoring 2 4 2 soil physical and chemical properties after the whole irrigation growth period soil samples were collected in the field at the depth of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm to analyze the physical and chemical properties of the soil bulk density a ring knife 100 cm3 was used to sample took the samples back to the laboratory dried in an oven wgl 30b taistic tianjin at 105 to constant weight and measured the soil bulk density at the corresponding depth soil porosity a ring knife 100 cm3 was used to sample and used the volume replacement method to measure and calculate the soil porosity ma et al 2014 electrical conductivity ec soil samples were naturally dried after being collected then grinded and sieved with a 2 mm sieve to remove visible impurities 20 g of the dried soil sample was weighed and put into a triangular flask added 100 ml of ultra pure water vibrated at 25 c for 30 min and filtered to obtain the liquid to be measured a conductivity meter dds 11a shanghai instrument electric science instrument co ltd shanghai china was used to measure soil conductivity soil ph the method of sampling and extraction is the same as that of soil conductivity and the soil ph was determined by using a multi parameter electrochemical water quality detector hq30d hash hach usa soil na content the method of sampling and extraction is the same as that of soil conductivity and a flame atomic absorption spectrometers agilent 240 duo agilent us was used to determine the concentration of liquid then the average value of sodium ion content in each soil layer depth was taken 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 oxygenation stabilization time adding oxygen to groundwater usually takes a period before the do concentration in the water enters a relatively stable state for mechanical and venturi oxygenation they were physical means of oxygenation during oxygenation the do concentration in the irrigation water will rise first then decrease slightly and then reach a stable state to facilitate the comparison of results the daniel trend test was used to find the exact stability time s1 for chemical oxygenation the do concentration in the irrigation water would continue to increase during the reaction time after the oxygen enhancer was added to the water after all the oxygen enhancers were reacted the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water would gradually decrease over time therefore we took the time point when the dissolved oxygen in water reached the maximum level as the beginning of the stable state 2 5 2 stability of dissolved oxygen in the water after the irrigation water enters the stable state for ao and vo its do concentration remains basically unchanged the standard deviation of do concentration within 1000 s was calculated after the stable state as the index to evaluate its stability for the chemical oxygenation treatment of co1 4 the standard deviation was calculated from reaching the stable state to the end of the irrigation process as the index to evaluate its stable state 2 5 3 oxygenation proportion in soil the integral value of oxygen concentration of each treatment in the soil was calculated during a single irrigation process as its actual oxygenation amount fig 5 oxygenation proportion was calculated with the following formula 1 oxygenation proportion x i x ck x ck where xi is the oxygen concentration integral value of each treatment xck is the oxygen concentration integral value of ck 2 5 4 statistical analysis data was compiled using excel 2010 origin 2019b originlab northampton usa was used for mapping spss 26 0 spss inc chicago usa was used for the analysis of variance and principal component analysis and duncan s method was used to test the significance of differences α 0 05 3 results 3 1 oxygenation process of irrigation water the change of do in irrigation water under different oxygenation methods during single irrigation is shown in fig 6 ao and vo were physical oxygenations in essence they were limited by the saturated do concentration of the water itself at a specific temperature thus ao and vo had a similar change trend in the beginning the do increased rapidly and reached the maximum value then with the increase in water temperature the saturated do concentration decreased and finally reached a relatively stable state the maximum do concentrations of the ao and vo were 10 56 and 10 30 mg l 1 respectively and average do values were 9 13 and 9 12 mg l 1 respectively no significant difference was observed between ao and vo from the aspect of a stable state vo took about 1105 s to reach the stable state which was longer than that of ao 885 s after reaching the stable state the stability of ao was also significantly higher than that of vo chemical oxygenation was not limited by the saturated do of the water when sodium percarbonate is added to the water it will react quickly and release a large amount of oxygen which will rapidly increase the do concentration in the water different amounts will make the do concentration in water reach different maximum values the maximum do concentration of co1 4 was 11 12 16 96 24 95 and 30 21 mg l 1 respectively and the time when the do concentration of co1 to co4 reached the maximum value was 1750 1965 2135 and 2430 s respectively it took longer to reach a higher maximum the time was usually much longer than physical oxygenation when the do concentration reached the maximum value with the progress of irrigation the do concentration decreased slowly until the end of irrigation this was mainly caused by the rise in water temperature and irrigation disturbance in the whole irrigation process the average oxygen content of water from co1 to co4 was 9 13 13 21 17 20 and 25 34 mg l 1 respectively from the whole single irrigation process the average value of co1 was similar to that of ao and vo while co2 4 further increased with more amount of sodium percarbonate compared with the average do concentration of local groundwater of 3 9 mg l 1 the proportion of water oxygenation during irrigation of ao vo co1 4 was 134 134 134 239 341 and 550 respectively 3 2 decrease of dissolved oxygen concentration in mulched drip irrigation system in the mulched drip irrigation system the laying of per single drip irrigation belt was often long and long distance water delivery will cause disturbance to water so it is necessary to consider the do concentration of irrigation water decrease moreover the drip irrigation belt was black it absorbs heat under the sunlight heats the water and accelerates the do decrease the changes in do concentration at different time periods and different drip irrigation belt lengths are shown in fig 7 in all stages of irrigation the do concentration decreased with the increase of water delivery distance in the initial stage of irrigation the do concentration decreased with distance per 100 m of ao vo co1 co2 co3 and co4 were 0 31 0 19 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 3 mg l 1 respectively at the end of irrigation the decreased do concentration of ao vo co1 co2 co3 and co4 were 0 52 0 54 0 61 0 57 0 64 and 0 87 mg l 1 respectively with the progress of irrigation the attenuation degree of do concentration of irrigation water in a drip irrigation system was also increasing for ao and vo due to their continuous oxygenation during irrigation the dissolved oxygen of irrigation water would not decrease with the increase of irrigation time for chemical oxygenation treatment co1 co4 do concentration of irrigation decreased with the increase of irrigation time which further decreased do concentration in the irrigation system the decreasing concentration of do was related to conveyance distance and the temperature of water in mulched drip irrigation system table 3 the irrigation water will be heated continuously and slowly within the drip irrigation belt the farther the irrigation water was transported the more obvious the water temperature increased which would lead to the escape of dissolved oxygen in the water there was no significant difference between different oxygenation methods and oxygenation proportions during the whole irrigation process with the increase in irrigation time the negative correlation between do and water delivery distance or water temperature was increasing this means that in the fourth hour of irrigation water temperature and water delivery distance had a greater impact on the reduction of do 3 3 effect of irrigation on soil dissolved oxygen the do concentration in soil at different depths of the soil layer and under different treatments is shown in fig 8 from our results the trend of soil oxygen concentration in all treatments was basically the same that is when the irrigation water entered the soil the soil oxygen concentration decreased because the soil pores were occupied by the irrigation water after a period of time the soil oxygen concentration reached the minimum value and then began to rise gradually with the increasing soil depth the time for soil oxygen concentration to reach the minimum increased after experiencing a peak the soil oxygen concentration began to decrease gradually and dropped to the same oxygen concentration as before irrigation in 5700 6000 min different from ck the soil oxygen concentration of all oxygenation irrigation treatments was higher than ck at the rising stage after the soil oxygen concentration reached the minimum value under the same do concentration of irrigation water the changes in soil oxygen concentration of ao vo and co1 were basically similar for chemical oxygenation irrigation with the increase of do concentration in irrigation water the maximum value of soil oxygen concentration was also increasing through the calculation the actual oxygenation proportion of each treatment during a single irrigation process can be obtained as shown in table 4 with the increase of soil depth the actual oxygenation proportion increased first and then decreased all oxygenation treatments showed that the average actual oxygenation proportion of 20 cm was the highest and the average actual oxygenation proportion of 30 cm was the lowest from the average actual oxygenation proportion of 0 40 cm soil layer the actual oxygenation proportions of ao vo and co1 were basically the same these were reported as 6 86 7 08 and 7 23 respectively with the increase of do concentration in irrigation water the actual oxygenation proportion was also increased the actual oxygenation proportions of co2 co3 and co4 were 11 20 13 50 and 17 39 respectively by comparing the ratio between water oxygenation amount and actual oxygenation proportion with the increase of do concentration in irrigation water the actual oxygenation proportion was improved according to the results of 10 times of irrigation in the whole growth period of cotton table 5 the actual oxygen increasing effect of each oxygen increasing irrigation was basically the same the oxygenation effect of the 5th 8th time decreased slightly which may be related to the environment temperature and irrigation frequency from the whole growth period each oxygenation irrigation can improve the soil oxygen concentration 3 4 changes in soil sodium ion content after two years of oxygenation irrigation the physical and chemical properties of 0 40 cm soil are shown in table 6 compared with ck the bulk density of each oxygenation irrigation treatment had a slight downward trend and the porosity had a slight upward trend but there was no significant difference for soil electrical conductivity ec co4 was significantly higher than ck increased by 4 1 and other treatments had no significant difference with ck under the same chemical oxygenation conditions the oxygenation proportion had a significant impact on soil ec for soil ph ao vo and co1 had no significant difference from ck co2 co3 and co4 were significantly higher than ck increased by 3 4 4 2 and 5 0 under the same chemical oxygenation irrigation conditions there was no significant difference between co1 co2 co3 and co4 and the oxygenation proportion had no effect on soil ph 3 5 changes in soil sodium ion content after two years of experiments the change in average sodium ion content in 0 100 cm soil is shown in fig 9 after the whole growth period of two years the na content of ck had a downward trend and irrigation had a certain leaching effect on the salt in the soil the na content of ao and vo also decreased compared with the beginning of the experiment soil na content decreased by 0 02 and 0 04 g kg 1 respectively which didn t reach a significant level for chemical oxygenation irrigation treatments the product of sodium percarbonate was sodium carbonate which would enter the soil with the irrigation water and would improve the na content in the soil compared with the beginning of the experiment the soil na content of co1 had almost no change although co1 had the same actual oxygenation proportion as ao and vo the leaching effect of irrigation on salt was weakened the na content of co2 co3 and co4 in soil increased by 0 046 0 106 and 0 173 g kg 1 respectively compared with that before the experiment and co4 reached a significant level by comparing the na content in each treatment at the end of the experiment ao vo and co1 were basically the same with the increase in sodium percarbonate application amount the soil na content was also increased compared with ck the soil na content of co3 and co4 increased significantly the use of chemical oxygenation has the potential to increase the risk of soil pollution 4 discussion people have long realized that irrigation will cause water to invade the soil pores and reduce the oxygen content in the soil this effect will last for several days before the oxygen content in the soil returns to the normal level kozlowski 1985 van gundy et al 1968 people began to try to solve the problem of oxygen stress caused by irrigation increasing the do concentration of irrigation water gradually proved to be a feasible method irrigation by oxygenated water can effectively bring dissolved oxygen into the soil ben noah and friedman 2018 in the actual irrigation process the change of do concentration in water will be different with different methods of oxygenation when an air pump or venturi device is used for water oxygenation its oxygenation is usually limited by the water itself different water quality and water temperatures will affect the maximum dissolved oxygen content in the water zhu et al 2021 therefore under the condition of physical oxygenation the maximum oxygenation is affected by the saturated do concentration in recent years a new type of aeration device has been invented which can form nanobubbles with smaller diameters this kind of nanobubble can better combine with water to obtain higher dissolved oxygen concentration and prolong the duration of do in water lei et al 2020 this kind of device has been proven to be beneficial in agricultural irrigation by more and more studies minamikawa and makino 2020 ouyang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 however some studies show that during the generation of nanobubbles the temperature of the water body rises due to the bubble rupture and the water body is disturbed after stopping the oxygenation for 1 h the do concentration in water will fall back to the saturated dissolved oxygen state ouyang et al 2019 for drip irrigation with a single irrigation duration of more than 3 h the effect of short term supersaturated oxygenation was very limited in addition at present the cost of most nanobubble generating devices is too high usually more than 10 000 yuan considering the cost effectiveness of actual agricultural planting this technology is still difficult to be popularized as for the initial investment cost the three oxygenation methods selected in this experiment can be used in the existing mulched drip irrigation system so no additional cost for the transformation of the irrigation system was required the other cost composition of different oxygenation methods is different mechanical oxygenation ao not only requires the purchase of air pumps in the start stage but also generates power costs during operation although the venturi oxygenation vo doesn t require additional power cost the number of venturi devices to be purchased is not fixed it depends on the planting area in addition it should be pointed out that for the early investment of equipment the service life performance and price of different types of air pumps and venturi devices vary greatly and the power cost also varies according to different regions for chemical oxygenation co it is necessary to consider that different irrigation amounts and planting areas have different application rates and different kinds of oxygen enhancers have different prices therefore different oxygenation methods have different operating costs in terms of benefits brought by oxygenation oxygenation will lead to the improvement of crop quality and yield but the specific economic benefits will be affected by the purchase price of regional crops therefore it s a very complex problem to comprehensively analyze the economic benefits to choose the most economical oxygenation method this may require more detailed calculations according to the actual situation the increase of do by adding oxygenated chemical compounds will not be limited by the saturated do in the water itself it can reach a higher level to meet different oxygenation needs what we need to pay attention to is what kind of reasonable oxygen enhancer to choose for example adding hydrogen peroxide to water can alleviate salt stress on crops da silva et al 2019 however as a liquid hydrogen peroxide has an unstable structure and certain toxicity how to preserve and use it safely is a difficult problem to ignore many studies have used some solid oxygenated chemical compounds such as calcium peroxide bera et al 2020 sodium percarbonate zhang et al 2022 etc this kind of solid oxygenated chemical compound has a relatively stable structure and has been preserved in the laboratory after dissolving in water it can generate oxygen however after the reaction is completed they will form metal salt ions and remain in the soil with irrigation from our results the risk of metal ions remaining in the soil will increase if we want to achieve a higher oxygenation proportion taking sodium ion as an example its increase will lead to the aggravation of soil salinization jesus et al 2015 therefore when selecting oxygenated chemical compounds the relationship between the oxygenation effect and environmental risk needs to be further considered in the actual field planting the do concentration decreased in irrigation water is a problem that can t be ignored the most direct factor affecting the do concentration is temperature most drip irrigation systems in xinjiang are made of black polyethylene pe which absorbs a lot of heat under radiation increasing the temperature of water within the drip irrigation system considering the disturbance of water in the irrigation process the do concentration will continue to decline to avoid this situation continuous oxygenation can be carried out such as ao and vo the former continuously used an air pump to aerate the water source while the latter used a venturi device to ensure continuous oxygenation throughout the irrigation process without loss of additional power for chemical oxygenation it can simply increase the application amount of oxygenated chemical compounds soil bulk density and porosity are closely related to soil ventilation mentges et al 2016 if the soil bulk density increases and the porosity decreases it means that the soil is compacted and the soil aeration decreases in our experiment after oxygenation irrigation soil bulk density had a downward trend and porosity had an upward trend although it didn t reach a significant level it showed that oxygenation irrigation can improve soil aeration to a certain extent some studies had proved this result by increasing the do concentration in irrigation water the soil aeration has been increased and the soil hypoxia conditions have been effectively alleviated baram et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 the ec ph and na content reflect the salinization degree and acid alkali properties of the soil the irrigation water quality and the physical and chemical properties of the soil will affect the salt accumulation of the soil among which the content of na content in the water quality is the main factor affecting the soil salinization antisari et al 2020 in our experimental area the salinity of irrigation water used was less than 1 g l 1 while the soil was saline alkaline soil in addition the strong evaporation caused by the arid climate made the soil ec and ph increase after two years of irrigation the chemical oxygenation irrigation used sodium percarbonate as the oxygen enhancer and the product sodium carbonate entered the soil together with the irrigation water so the salt accumulation of the soil was higher than that of other treatments especially co4 if long term use of chemical oxygenation is to be considered the soil quality and water quality of the area should be carefully considered to avoid aggravating soil salinization the purpose of increasing do concentration in water is to improve the oxygen environment of the soil around the root zone yalin et al 2021 used oxygenated wastewater for irrigation and the oxygen concentration in the soil showed a change law of first decreasing and then increasing we also observed the same results baram et al 2021 injected oxygen into the irrigation water by using oxygen nanobubbles generating unit to increase the do concentration from 6 7 mg l 1 to 18 1 mg l 1 using surface drip irrigation with oxygenated water can increase the soil oxygen concentration by 4 1 absolute value under the condition of barrel planting our study also revealed a similar result that is irrigation with oxygenated water can improve soil oxygen concentration according to our experimental results the do can last for 2 4 days which can effectively alleviate the problem of soil oxygen decline caused by irrigation however it should be noted the oxygen increasing effect of each oxygenation irrigation will not be superimposed after each irrigation process the soil oxygen concentration of each treatment will return to the same level after 4 days about 6000 min even if the result of oxygenation cannot be superimposed increasing soil oxygen concentration still had a beneficial effect the significance of increasing soil oxygen concentration lies in promoting crop root respiration crop roots are very sensitive to the oxygen environment and the change in do concentration will affect the roots respiration boru et al 2003 dittert et al 2006 in some studies root respiration is one of the indicators for evaluating root and crop growth del saz et al 2017 fanello et al 2020 martinkova et al 2021 root respiration can affect the energy production of root cells thus affecting the absorption of water by crops furthermore the do concentration in irrigation water will also affect soil respiration bhanja and wang 2021 there is a certain correlation between soil respiration and water absorption of crop roots teodosio et al 2017 the improvement of soil oxygen conditions is not only conducive to soil respiration and root respiration but also conducive to root morphology development a negative example is that waterlogging will inhibit the growth of crop roots reduce the distribution of photosynthate to the root lead to the average diameter of the root decreased and affect the root activity liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 indicated that increasing the do concentration of irrigation water can promote the growth of crop roots and improve the absorption of water and nutrients in addition the change in do concentration will affect the microorganisms and soil enzymes related to the nitrification denitrification process patureau et al 2000 wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 it will also affect the absorption of nutrients by crops the absorption of water and nutrients by crops will further affect the growth of crops including agronomic traits wang et al 2021b photosynthetic characteristics ouyang et al 2020 yield and quality li et al 2016 therefore oxygenation irrigation has complex effects on crop growth and even the whole soil environment which may require more research for detailed discussion 5 conclusion we analyzed the oxygenation process of irrigation water under different conditions of oxygenation irrigation and calculated the actual oxygenation proportion in the soil during a single irrigation process the results showed that the physical oxygenation was limited by the saturated do in the water compared with venturi oxygenation mechanical oxygenation was a more stable and faster method to make water reach saturated do chemical oxygenation was not limited by saturated do according to the demand for oxygenation the do concentration can be improved by increasing the application amount of oxygenated chemical compounds however compared with physical oxygenation chemical oxygenation often takes a long process to complete the reaction in addition although chemical oxygenation adding a large amount of oxygenated chemical compounds can improve the do concentration significantly it will lead to the residual metal salt ions in the soil after the irrigation resulting in potential pollution risks to the soil environment the oxygenated irrigation water will be affected by the water temperature and delivery distance in the mulched drip irrigation system resulting in the continuous decrease of do concentration when the oxygenated water enters the soil it can increase the oxygen concentration of the soil in one irrigation process it does not matter whether mechanical venturi or chemical oxygenation there was no significant difference in the changing trend of irrigation water in the soil under saturated do concentration the actual oxygenation proportion reached the maximum at 20 cm in all oxygenation treatments increasing the do concentration in irrigation water can improve the substantial oxygenation proportion during a single irrigation process therefore increasing the do concentration in irrigation water can improve the soil oxygen condition with mulched drip irrigation system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9205,when crop roots are in a low oxygen environment for a long time it will lead to a series of problems to improve soil oxygen conditions a method of oxygenation irrigation is increasing the dissolved oxygen do concentration in irrigation water however its application effect in a mulched drip irrigation system is not clear in this study a field experiment was conducted in xinjiang to investigate the actual effect of oxygenation irrigation in field planting we set up mechanical oxygenation ao venturi oxygenation vo and four chemical oxygenations with different do concentrations co1 4 the results showed that physical oxygenation ao vo was limited by the saturated do of irrigation water compared with venturi oxygenation mechanical oxygenation could reach the saturated do faster and had higher stability of do concentration during single irrigation the chemical oxygenation was not limited by the saturated do the maximum do in irrigation water would also increase with the increase in the amount of oxygen enhancer but it needed more reaction time than the physical oxygen to reach a stable state the oxygenated water would be affected by water temperature and delivery distance in the mulched drip irrigation system resulting in the continuous decline of do during the irrigation process for those oxygenated water with saturated do under different oxygenation methods ao vo and co1 when they entered the soil there was no significant difference in the changing trend of do in an irrigation process with the increase of do the actual oxygenation efficiency in the soil also increased the do concentration of irrigation water was increased from 3 9 mg l 1 to 9 1 mg l 1 and 10 times of irrigation was carried out during the crop growth period then soil oxygen could be increased by an average of 6 72 6 89 by increasing the do of irrigation water the soil oxygen condition of mulched drip irrigation can be improved under the condition of saturated do each oxygenation irrigation had no significant impact on the soil physical and chemical properties after two years of irrigation the chemical oxygenation using sodium percarbonate had increased the soil ec ph and na content which means slightly intensified the soil salinization keywords oxygenation mulched drip irrigation dissolved oxygen xinjiang data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction xinjiang is the largest cotton production area in china which benefits from its rich radiation resources hu et al 2021 this region has an arid climate with low precipitation and high evaporation with scarce surface freshwater resources which brings great challenges to agricultural irrigation fu and li 2021 wei et al 2022 after decades of development and adjustment mulched drip irrigation has become the most widely used irrigation method in cotton planting in xinjiang wang et al 2021a the advantage of mulched drip irrigation is that it can reduce soil water evaporation and improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer che et al 2021 wang et al 2020 in xinjiang groundwater is an important supply of agricultural water li and chen 2020 in the exploitation of groundwater in xinjiang 84 26 is used for agricultural irrigation li 2019 when irrigation is carried out usually the groundwater is directly connected to the mulched drip irrigation system through the pump it should be noted that the dissolved oxygen do of this part of groundwater is usually low only 2 4 mg l 1 while that of surface water is usually 6 7 mg l 1 under ideal conditions the saturated do of the healthy water body can reach up to 8 9 mg l 1 therefore when groundwater is used for irrigation directly in xinjiang the do concentration of irrigation water is often too low on the other hand focusing on the future pipeline long distance water conveyance is a method that can effectively reduce water loss which is developing in many areas and is also popularizing in recent years gajghate and mirajkar 2020 kurtulmus et al 2018 zhao and li 2020 it is worth noting that long distance pipeline water conveyance makes the water isolated from the air for a long time which will also reduce the do in the water zhang et al 2014 the problems caused by using water with low do contents for agricultural irrigation have been gradually discovered in hydroponic culture the do in the culture medium is the main source of oxygen supply to crop roots ikeura et al 2017 lau and mattson 2021 for non hydroponic crops under the condition of flooding crop roots still can obtain oxygen from dissolved oxygen in the water for respiration drew 1983 jose chen lopez 2022 for traditional irrigation methods such as flood irrigation the irrigation frequency is usually low the soil is dry most of the time and the impact of do concentration of irrigation water is generally small in xinjiang mulched drip irrigation generally adopts the irrigation scheme of high frequency low per irrigation amount this makes the soil has a faster alternating frequency of dry and wet and increases the time of crop roots flooding liu et al 2011 under this condition irrigation with low dissolved oxygen water will cause cotton roots in a low oxygen environment for a long time when crop roots are under low oxygen stress it will have an adverse impact on crop growth in the stage of seed germination the concentration of dissolved oxygen in irrigation water is an important factor affecting seed germination zhu et al 2021 ayi et al 2019 indicated that oxygen stress would reduce root biomass distribution some studies have also shown that the low do concentration leads to the reduction of root water and nutrient absorption which inhibits the growth of plants hoang et al 2019 limami et al 2014 in order to improve soil oxygen conditions oxygenation irrigation was invented at present there are two main types of oxygenation one of them is independent oxygenation that is the oxygenation process is separated from the irrigation process after irrigation air or oxygen will be directly injected into the soil through the subsurface drip irrigation system or the pre buried gas pipeline with the air compressor li et al 2022 nascimento et al 2020 niu et al 2013 the advantage of this oxygenation type to soil is that it can rapidly improve aeration after irrigation niu et al 2012 but it is obvious that this type is only applicable to underground drip irrigation another type is to increase the do concentration of the irrigation water to achieve oxygenation while irrigation which can be further subdivided into physical oxygenation and chemical oxygenation for physical oxygenation common devices include air pump an et al 2022 ouyang et al 2019 yin et al 2021 micro nanobubbles generator dahrazma et al 2019 liu et al 2019 minamikawa and makino 2020 and venturi bagatur 2014 essah and holm 2020 wang et al 2022 for chemical oxygenation different chemical reagents are applied to irrigation water to generate oxygen by reacting with water its main components include hydrogen peroxide abd elhady et al 2021 sodium percarbonate zhang et al 2022 and calcium peroxide hu et al 2017 from the perspective of the planting environment oxygenation irrigation is mainly used in greenhouse agriculture or paddy field and it s mainly used in the subsurface drip irrigation system however there is little research on mulched drip irrigation under a field environment and the actual effect of oxygenation irrigation under this condition is still unclear analyzing the application results of oxygenation irrigation under field planting conditions will help us to explore the feasibility of applying oxygenation irrigation to a larger planting range in this context we set up different oxygenation irrigation methods and different oxygenation amount to monitor the effect under the condition of applying the oxygenation irrigation to the mulched drip irrigation system we monitored the change of do concentration in irrigation water and calculated the results of the oxygenation irrigation on the soil oxygen concentration and analyzed the effect of oxygenation irrigation on soil physical and chemical properties our research results will provide some reference for the application of oxygenation irrigation in field planting in similar area 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at the key laboratory of modern water saving irrigation of xinjiang production and construction crops 85 59 45 e 44 19 28 n 451 m a s l in 2019 and 2020 fig 1 there is a well in the experimental site that can pump groundwater for irrigation the salinity of the groundwater is less than 1 g l 1 and the dissolved oxygen concentration is about 3 9 mg l 1 the soil in the experimental site is mainly sandy loam with an average unit weight of 1 568 in the 0 100 cm soil layer the specific soil properties are shown in table 1 2 2 field layout the experimental planting mode was consistent with the local mechanical planting mode fig 2 that is the film covering width was 2 05 m 3 drip irrigation belts were set under each film covering 6 rows of cotton were planted and the spacing of cotton planting seeds was 10 cm the film was polyethylene ordinary plastic film the drip irrigation belt was a single wing labyrinth drip irrigation belt produced by xinjiang tianye co ltd the distance between drippers was 30 cm under the pressure of 60 kpa the actual flow of drippers was 1 6 l h 1 and the single irrigation time was 3 9 h the area of each experiment plot was 23 5 m2 4 7 m 5 m 2 3 irrigation and fertilization 2 3 1 irrigation and fertilization scheme irrigation and fertilization schemes were designed according to the local cotton irrigation and fertilization habits and relevant previous research he et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 the specific scheme is shown in table 2 irrigation amount in the whole growth period was 5250 m3 hm 2 nitrogen application rate was 300 kg n hm 2 urea ch4n2o n 46 4 phosphorus and potassium application rate were 150 kg hm 2 kh2po4 p k 51 5 2 3 2 oxygenation and irrigation after the groundwater was pumped out it was transported to a separate water storage bucket through the water transmission pipeline we used three oxygenation methods in the experiment air pump venturi device and chemical oxygenation mechanical oxygenation ao an air pump and bubble stone were used to directly oxygenate the water in the water storage bucket and the oxygenation was continuously maintained during each irrigation process venturi oxygenation vo a venturi device mazzei air injector 1078 mazzei corp corporation usa was installed on the irrigation system through which water and air were mixed under high pressure to oxygenate the water it should be pointed out that the venturi device would inject oxygen into the water and it would also form a water air mixture in the drip irrigation system however we used surface drip irrigation so during the irrigation process since the soil cracks were filled with irrigation water this part of the mixed gas would not enter the soil chemical oxygenation co oxygenation was done by adding sodium percarbonate to water sodium percarbonate would produce oxygen and sodium carbonate after dissolving in water the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water was further adjusted by setting different amounts we determined the relationship between the concentration of sodium percarbonate and the do concentration in the water through preliminary experiments fig 3 in this experiment four different gradients of chemical oxygenation co1 co4 9 13 13 21 17 2 and 25 34 mg l 1 were selected non oxygenation irrigation ck groundwater was directly used for irrigation and the do concentration of the groundwater was about 3 9 mg l 1 in summary 6 oxygenation irrigation treatments ao vo co1 co2 co3 and co4 and ck were set in the experiment fig 4 three repeated experiments were set for each treatment during each irrigation the irrigation water should be oxygenated first when the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water body reached a stable state it would start irrigating through the mulched drip irrigation system with the independent water pump in each water storage 2 4 measurement methods 2 4 1 oxygen concentration determination an oxygen meter oxy 1 st presens precision sensing gmbh germany was used to measure the do concentration in irrigation water and the environment it can monitor the oxygen content in liquid or gas during the measurement the sensor was placed in the water body or at different depths of the soil for continuous monitoring 2 4 2 soil physical and chemical properties after the whole irrigation growth period soil samples were collected in the field at the depth of 0 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm to analyze the physical and chemical properties of the soil bulk density a ring knife 100 cm3 was used to sample took the samples back to the laboratory dried in an oven wgl 30b taistic tianjin at 105 to constant weight and measured the soil bulk density at the corresponding depth soil porosity a ring knife 100 cm3 was used to sample and used the volume replacement method to measure and calculate the soil porosity ma et al 2014 electrical conductivity ec soil samples were naturally dried after being collected then grinded and sieved with a 2 mm sieve to remove visible impurities 20 g of the dried soil sample was weighed and put into a triangular flask added 100 ml of ultra pure water vibrated at 25 c for 30 min and filtered to obtain the liquid to be measured a conductivity meter dds 11a shanghai instrument electric science instrument co ltd shanghai china was used to measure soil conductivity soil ph the method of sampling and extraction is the same as that of soil conductivity and the soil ph was determined by using a multi parameter electrochemical water quality detector hq30d hash hach usa soil na content the method of sampling and extraction is the same as that of soil conductivity and a flame atomic absorption spectrometers agilent 240 duo agilent us was used to determine the concentration of liquid then the average value of sodium ion content in each soil layer depth was taken 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 oxygenation stabilization time adding oxygen to groundwater usually takes a period before the do concentration in the water enters a relatively stable state for mechanical and venturi oxygenation they were physical means of oxygenation during oxygenation the do concentration in the irrigation water will rise first then decrease slightly and then reach a stable state to facilitate the comparison of results the daniel trend test was used to find the exact stability time s1 for chemical oxygenation the do concentration in the irrigation water would continue to increase during the reaction time after the oxygen enhancer was added to the water after all the oxygen enhancers were reacted the dissolved oxygen concentration in the water would gradually decrease over time therefore we took the time point when the dissolved oxygen in water reached the maximum level as the beginning of the stable state 2 5 2 stability of dissolved oxygen in the water after the irrigation water enters the stable state for ao and vo its do concentration remains basically unchanged the standard deviation of do concentration within 1000 s was calculated after the stable state as the index to evaluate its stability for the chemical oxygenation treatment of co1 4 the standard deviation was calculated from reaching the stable state to the end of the irrigation process as the index to evaluate its stable state 2 5 3 oxygenation proportion in soil the integral value of oxygen concentration of each treatment in the soil was calculated during a single irrigation process as its actual oxygenation amount fig 5 oxygenation proportion was calculated with the following formula 1 oxygenation proportion x i x ck x ck where xi is the oxygen concentration integral value of each treatment xck is the oxygen concentration integral value of ck 2 5 4 statistical analysis data was compiled using excel 2010 origin 2019b originlab northampton usa was used for mapping spss 26 0 spss inc chicago usa was used for the analysis of variance and principal component analysis and duncan s method was used to test the significance of differences α 0 05 3 results 3 1 oxygenation process of irrigation water the change of do in irrigation water under different oxygenation methods during single irrigation is shown in fig 6 ao and vo were physical oxygenations in essence they were limited by the saturated do concentration of the water itself at a specific temperature thus ao and vo had a similar change trend in the beginning the do increased rapidly and reached the maximum value then with the increase in water temperature the saturated do concentration decreased and finally reached a relatively stable state the maximum do concentrations of the ao and vo were 10 56 and 10 30 mg l 1 respectively and average do values were 9 13 and 9 12 mg l 1 respectively no significant difference was observed between ao and vo from the aspect of a stable state vo took about 1105 s to reach the stable state which was longer than that of ao 885 s after reaching the stable state the stability of ao was also significantly higher than that of vo chemical oxygenation was not limited by the saturated do of the water when sodium percarbonate is added to the water it will react quickly and release a large amount of oxygen which will rapidly increase the do concentration in the water different amounts will make the do concentration in water reach different maximum values the maximum do concentration of co1 4 was 11 12 16 96 24 95 and 30 21 mg l 1 respectively and the time when the do concentration of co1 to co4 reached the maximum value was 1750 1965 2135 and 2430 s respectively it took longer to reach a higher maximum the time was usually much longer than physical oxygenation when the do concentration reached the maximum value with the progress of irrigation the do concentration decreased slowly until the end of irrigation this was mainly caused by the rise in water temperature and irrigation disturbance in the whole irrigation process the average oxygen content of water from co1 to co4 was 9 13 13 21 17 20 and 25 34 mg l 1 respectively from the whole single irrigation process the average value of co1 was similar to that of ao and vo while co2 4 further increased with more amount of sodium percarbonate compared with the average do concentration of local groundwater of 3 9 mg l 1 the proportion of water oxygenation during irrigation of ao vo co1 4 was 134 134 134 239 341 and 550 respectively 3 2 decrease of dissolved oxygen concentration in mulched drip irrigation system in the mulched drip irrigation system the laying of per single drip irrigation belt was often long and long distance water delivery will cause disturbance to water so it is necessary to consider the do concentration of irrigation water decrease moreover the drip irrigation belt was black it absorbs heat under the sunlight heats the water and accelerates the do decrease the changes in do concentration at different time periods and different drip irrigation belt lengths are shown in fig 7 in all stages of irrigation the do concentration decreased with the increase of water delivery distance in the initial stage of irrigation the do concentration decreased with distance per 100 m of ao vo co1 co2 co3 and co4 were 0 31 0 19 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 3 mg l 1 respectively at the end of irrigation the decreased do concentration of ao vo co1 co2 co3 and co4 were 0 52 0 54 0 61 0 57 0 64 and 0 87 mg l 1 respectively with the progress of irrigation the attenuation degree of do concentration of irrigation water in a drip irrigation system was also increasing for ao and vo due to their continuous oxygenation during irrigation the dissolved oxygen of irrigation water would not decrease with the increase of irrigation time for chemical oxygenation treatment co1 co4 do concentration of irrigation decreased with the increase of irrigation time which further decreased do concentration in the irrigation system the decreasing concentration of do was related to conveyance distance and the temperature of water in mulched drip irrigation system table 3 the irrigation water will be heated continuously and slowly within the drip irrigation belt the farther the irrigation water was transported the more obvious the water temperature increased which would lead to the escape of dissolved oxygen in the water there was no significant difference between different oxygenation methods and oxygenation proportions during the whole irrigation process with the increase in irrigation time the negative correlation between do and water delivery distance or water temperature was increasing this means that in the fourth hour of irrigation water temperature and water delivery distance had a greater impact on the reduction of do 3 3 effect of irrigation on soil dissolved oxygen the do concentration in soil at different depths of the soil layer and under different treatments is shown in fig 8 from our results the trend of soil oxygen concentration in all treatments was basically the same that is when the irrigation water entered the soil the soil oxygen concentration decreased because the soil pores were occupied by the irrigation water after a period of time the soil oxygen concentration reached the minimum value and then began to rise gradually with the increasing soil depth the time for soil oxygen concentration to reach the minimum increased after experiencing a peak the soil oxygen concentration began to decrease gradually and dropped to the same oxygen concentration as before irrigation in 5700 6000 min different from ck the soil oxygen concentration of all oxygenation irrigation treatments was higher than ck at the rising stage after the soil oxygen concentration reached the minimum value under the same do concentration of irrigation water the changes in soil oxygen concentration of ao vo and co1 were basically similar for chemical oxygenation irrigation with the increase of do concentration in irrigation water the maximum value of soil oxygen concentration was also increasing through the calculation the actual oxygenation proportion of each treatment during a single irrigation process can be obtained as shown in table 4 with the increase of soil depth the actual oxygenation proportion increased first and then decreased all oxygenation treatments showed that the average actual oxygenation proportion of 20 cm was the highest and the average actual oxygenation proportion of 30 cm was the lowest from the average actual oxygenation proportion of 0 40 cm soil layer the actual oxygenation proportions of ao vo and co1 were basically the same these were reported as 6 86 7 08 and 7 23 respectively with the increase of do concentration in irrigation water the actual oxygenation proportion was also increased the actual oxygenation proportions of co2 co3 and co4 were 11 20 13 50 and 17 39 respectively by comparing the ratio between water oxygenation amount and actual oxygenation proportion with the increase of do concentration in irrigation water the actual oxygenation proportion was improved according to the results of 10 times of irrigation in the whole growth period of cotton table 5 the actual oxygen increasing effect of each oxygen increasing irrigation was basically the same the oxygenation effect of the 5th 8th time decreased slightly which may be related to the environment temperature and irrigation frequency from the whole growth period each oxygenation irrigation can improve the soil oxygen concentration 3 4 changes in soil sodium ion content after two years of oxygenation irrigation the physical and chemical properties of 0 40 cm soil are shown in table 6 compared with ck the bulk density of each oxygenation irrigation treatment had a slight downward trend and the porosity had a slight upward trend but there was no significant difference for soil electrical conductivity ec co4 was significantly higher than ck increased by 4 1 and other treatments had no significant difference with ck under the same chemical oxygenation conditions the oxygenation proportion had a significant impact on soil ec for soil ph ao vo and co1 had no significant difference from ck co2 co3 and co4 were significantly higher than ck increased by 3 4 4 2 and 5 0 under the same chemical oxygenation irrigation conditions there was no significant difference between co1 co2 co3 and co4 and the oxygenation proportion had no effect on soil ph 3 5 changes in soil sodium ion content after two years of experiments the change in average sodium ion content in 0 100 cm soil is shown in fig 9 after the whole growth period of two years the na content of ck had a downward trend and irrigation had a certain leaching effect on the salt in the soil the na content of ao and vo also decreased compared with the beginning of the experiment soil na content decreased by 0 02 and 0 04 g kg 1 respectively which didn t reach a significant level for chemical oxygenation irrigation treatments the product of sodium percarbonate was sodium carbonate which would enter the soil with the irrigation water and would improve the na content in the soil compared with the beginning of the experiment the soil na content of co1 had almost no change although co1 had the same actual oxygenation proportion as ao and vo the leaching effect of irrigation on salt was weakened the na content of co2 co3 and co4 in soil increased by 0 046 0 106 and 0 173 g kg 1 respectively compared with that before the experiment and co4 reached a significant level by comparing the na content in each treatment at the end of the experiment ao vo and co1 were basically the same with the increase in sodium percarbonate application amount the soil na content was also increased compared with ck the soil na content of co3 and co4 increased significantly the use of chemical oxygenation has the potential to increase the risk of soil pollution 4 discussion people have long realized that irrigation will cause water to invade the soil pores and reduce the oxygen content in the soil this effect will last for several days before the oxygen content in the soil returns to the normal level kozlowski 1985 van gundy et al 1968 people began to try to solve the problem of oxygen stress caused by irrigation increasing the do concentration of irrigation water gradually proved to be a feasible method irrigation by oxygenated water can effectively bring dissolved oxygen into the soil ben noah and friedman 2018 in the actual irrigation process the change of do concentration in water will be different with different methods of oxygenation when an air pump or venturi device is used for water oxygenation its oxygenation is usually limited by the water itself different water quality and water temperatures will affect the maximum dissolved oxygen content in the water zhu et al 2021 therefore under the condition of physical oxygenation the maximum oxygenation is affected by the saturated do concentration in recent years a new type of aeration device has been invented which can form nanobubbles with smaller diameters this kind of nanobubble can better combine with water to obtain higher dissolved oxygen concentration and prolong the duration of do in water lei et al 2020 this kind of device has been proven to be beneficial in agricultural irrigation by more and more studies minamikawa and makino 2020 ouyang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 however some studies show that during the generation of nanobubbles the temperature of the water body rises due to the bubble rupture and the water body is disturbed after stopping the oxygenation for 1 h the do concentration in water will fall back to the saturated dissolved oxygen state ouyang et al 2019 for drip irrigation with a single irrigation duration of more than 3 h the effect of short term supersaturated oxygenation was very limited in addition at present the cost of most nanobubble generating devices is too high usually more than 10 000 yuan considering the cost effectiveness of actual agricultural planting this technology is still difficult to be popularized as for the initial investment cost the three oxygenation methods selected in this experiment can be used in the existing mulched drip irrigation system so no additional cost for the transformation of the irrigation system was required the other cost composition of different oxygenation methods is different mechanical oxygenation ao not only requires the purchase of air pumps in the start stage but also generates power costs during operation although the venturi oxygenation vo doesn t require additional power cost the number of venturi devices to be purchased is not fixed it depends on the planting area in addition it should be pointed out that for the early investment of equipment the service life performance and price of different types of air pumps and venturi devices vary greatly and the power cost also varies according to different regions for chemical oxygenation co it is necessary to consider that different irrigation amounts and planting areas have different application rates and different kinds of oxygen enhancers have different prices therefore different oxygenation methods have different operating costs in terms of benefits brought by oxygenation oxygenation will lead to the improvement of crop quality and yield but the specific economic benefits will be affected by the purchase price of regional crops therefore it s a very complex problem to comprehensively analyze the economic benefits to choose the most economical oxygenation method this may require more detailed calculations according to the actual situation the increase of do by adding oxygenated chemical compounds will not be limited by the saturated do in the water itself it can reach a higher level to meet different oxygenation needs what we need to pay attention to is what kind of reasonable oxygen enhancer to choose for example adding hydrogen peroxide to water can alleviate salt stress on crops da silva et al 2019 however as a liquid hydrogen peroxide has an unstable structure and certain toxicity how to preserve and use it safely is a difficult problem to ignore many studies have used some solid oxygenated chemical compounds such as calcium peroxide bera et al 2020 sodium percarbonate zhang et al 2022 etc this kind of solid oxygenated chemical compound has a relatively stable structure and has been preserved in the laboratory after dissolving in water it can generate oxygen however after the reaction is completed they will form metal salt ions and remain in the soil with irrigation from our results the risk of metal ions remaining in the soil will increase if we want to achieve a higher oxygenation proportion taking sodium ion as an example its increase will lead to the aggravation of soil salinization jesus et al 2015 therefore when selecting oxygenated chemical compounds the relationship between the oxygenation effect and environmental risk needs to be further considered in the actual field planting the do concentration decreased in irrigation water is a problem that can t be ignored the most direct factor affecting the do concentration is temperature most drip irrigation systems in xinjiang are made of black polyethylene pe which absorbs a lot of heat under radiation increasing the temperature of water within the drip irrigation system considering the disturbance of water in the irrigation process the do concentration will continue to decline to avoid this situation continuous oxygenation can be carried out such as ao and vo the former continuously used an air pump to aerate the water source while the latter used a venturi device to ensure continuous oxygenation throughout the irrigation process without loss of additional power for chemical oxygenation it can simply increase the application amount of oxygenated chemical compounds soil bulk density and porosity are closely related to soil ventilation mentges et al 2016 if the soil bulk density increases and the porosity decreases it means that the soil is compacted and the soil aeration decreases in our experiment after oxygenation irrigation soil bulk density had a downward trend and porosity had an upward trend although it didn t reach a significant level it showed that oxygenation irrigation can improve soil aeration to a certain extent some studies had proved this result by increasing the do concentration in irrigation water the soil aeration has been increased and the soil hypoxia conditions have been effectively alleviated baram et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 the ec ph and na content reflect the salinization degree and acid alkali properties of the soil the irrigation water quality and the physical and chemical properties of the soil will affect the salt accumulation of the soil among which the content of na content in the water quality is the main factor affecting the soil salinization antisari et al 2020 in our experimental area the salinity of irrigation water used was less than 1 g l 1 while the soil was saline alkaline soil in addition the strong evaporation caused by the arid climate made the soil ec and ph increase after two years of irrigation the chemical oxygenation irrigation used sodium percarbonate as the oxygen enhancer and the product sodium carbonate entered the soil together with the irrigation water so the salt accumulation of the soil was higher than that of other treatments especially co4 if long term use of chemical oxygenation is to be considered the soil quality and water quality of the area should be carefully considered to avoid aggravating soil salinization the purpose of increasing do concentration in water is to improve the oxygen environment of the soil around the root zone yalin et al 2021 used oxygenated wastewater for irrigation and the oxygen concentration in the soil showed a change law of first decreasing and then increasing we also observed the same results baram et al 2021 injected oxygen into the irrigation water by using oxygen nanobubbles generating unit to increase the do concentration from 6 7 mg l 1 to 18 1 mg l 1 using surface drip irrigation with oxygenated water can increase the soil oxygen concentration by 4 1 absolute value under the condition of barrel planting our study also revealed a similar result that is irrigation with oxygenated water can improve soil oxygen concentration according to our experimental results the do can last for 2 4 days which can effectively alleviate the problem of soil oxygen decline caused by irrigation however it should be noted the oxygen increasing effect of each oxygenation irrigation will not be superimposed after each irrigation process the soil oxygen concentration of each treatment will return to the same level after 4 days about 6000 min even if the result of oxygenation cannot be superimposed increasing soil oxygen concentration still had a beneficial effect the significance of increasing soil oxygen concentration lies in promoting crop root respiration crop roots are very sensitive to the oxygen environment and the change in do concentration will affect the roots respiration boru et al 2003 dittert et al 2006 in some studies root respiration is one of the indicators for evaluating root and crop growth del saz et al 2017 fanello et al 2020 martinkova et al 2021 root respiration can affect the energy production of root cells thus affecting the absorption of water by crops furthermore the do concentration in irrigation water will also affect soil respiration bhanja and wang 2021 there is a certain correlation between soil respiration and water absorption of crop roots teodosio et al 2017 the improvement of soil oxygen conditions is not only conducive to soil respiration and root respiration but also conducive to root morphology development a negative example is that waterlogging will inhibit the growth of crop roots reduce the distribution of photosynthate to the root lead to the average diameter of the root decreased and affect the root activity liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 indicated that increasing the do concentration of irrigation water can promote the growth of crop roots and improve the absorption of water and nutrients in addition the change in do concentration will affect the microorganisms and soil enzymes related to the nitrification denitrification process patureau et al 2000 wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 it will also affect the absorption of nutrients by crops the absorption of water and nutrients by crops will further affect the growth of crops including agronomic traits wang et al 2021b photosynthetic characteristics ouyang et al 2020 yield and quality li et al 2016 therefore oxygenation irrigation has complex effects on crop growth and even the whole soil environment which may require more research for detailed discussion 5 conclusion we analyzed the oxygenation process of irrigation water under different conditions of oxygenation irrigation and calculated the actual oxygenation proportion in the soil during a single irrigation process the results showed that the physical oxygenation was limited by the saturated do in the water compared with venturi oxygenation mechanical oxygenation was a more stable and faster method to make water reach saturated do chemical oxygenation was not limited by saturated do according to the demand for oxygenation the do concentration can be improved by increasing the application amount of oxygenated chemical compounds however compared with physical oxygenation chemical oxygenation often takes a long process to complete the reaction in addition although chemical oxygenation adding a large amount of oxygenated chemical compounds can improve the do concentration significantly it will lead to the residual metal salt ions in the soil after the irrigation resulting in potential pollution risks to the soil environment the oxygenated irrigation water will be affected by the water temperature and delivery distance in the mulched drip irrigation system resulting in the continuous decrease of do concentration when the oxygenated water enters the soil it can increase the oxygen concentration of the soil in one irrigation process it does not matter whether mechanical

9206,the use of treated wastewater tww for irrigation is constantly on the rise while the long term impacts are not in consensus in this study we examined the impact of 9 years of municipal tww irrigation on sodium na and sodium adsorption ratio sar in a vineyard soil and consequently on table grapevines our objectives were to 1 quantify multiannual temporal trends of na and sar 2 construct a regression model to define the relative contribution of various factors on na and sar levels in the soil and 3 determine na and sar accumulation impact on the grapevines health state healthy damaged or dead our analyses indicated that long term irrigation with tww resulted in na accumulation in the soil with enhanced effects attributed to higher rainfall levels precipitation levels applying tww for irrigation was also found to affect vines as evident with observations of damaged and dead vines after 9 years ranging between 25 and 40 mortality rates depending on the treatment used these observations were found to be directly and significantly associated with higher na concentrations p values of 0 008 and 0 011 compared to damaged and healthy vines respectively our results although specific to the region raise a warning sign and merit further long term investigations of tww irrigation this is essential to guarantee that use of tww irrigation does not cause irreversible damage to farmlands potentially threatening soil health and food security graphical abstract ga1 keywords vineyard vitis vinifera na sar vine mortality machine learning data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction as water scarcity increases worldwide so does the use of treated wastewater tww utilization of tww is designed to offset the raising demand for freshwater mainly in agriculture with 70 tww used in arid and semi arid regions ganjegunte et al 2017 qadir et al 2007 ventura et al 2019 the united nations un is encouraging the use of tww in agriculture as one of the sustainable development goals sdgs in the 2030 agenda to end hunger and poverty protect the planetary ecosystem and ensure prosperity to all mankind un general assembly 2015 as part of this trend the use of tww in vineyards has also been increasing in various countries such as the u s a spain and france qadir et al 2020 however the total tww world usage for agriculture is currently only 10 and yet it is projected to reach 50 by 2050 weber et al 2014 etchebarne et al 2019 qadir et al 2020 in israel as of 2015 75 of tww 400 mcm were used in agriculture oecd 2015 with long term planning set to increase use to 85 iwa 2012 although there are positive aspects of tww use such as offset to fresh water and reduced use of fertilizers there are downsides as well these include elevated concentrations of nutrients heavy metals salts hormones and harmful chemicals such as traces of medication and pesticides petousi et al 2019 applying tww could change soil structure and raise salinity potentially damaging soils crops and groundwater wu et al 2009 pereira et al 2012 travis et al 2010 not much work has been carried out on the long term impact of tww irrigation on grapevines while most of the reported research was carried out for short terms with mixed results regarding tww irrigation for example mendoza espinoza et al 2008 reported that irrigating cabernet sauvignon and merlot vines using tww resulted in faster growth and a longer growing season than freshwater irrigation this effect could be linked to tww s increased levels of nitrogen n and phosphorus p measurements of grape sugar concentration ph and titratable particles revealed that tww irrigation had little effect on the quality of the products and no ill effects observed similarly tww irrigation of soultanina grapevines grown in a sandy loam soil met the vines needs for p potassium k magnesium mg and iron fe eliminating the need for fertilizers paranychianakis et al 2006 moreover the researchers found that zinc zn and copper cu levels were higher in the leaves of vines irrigated with tww although they were still within the normal range for grapevines in terms of n more fertilizer was required especially during the early stages of grapevine development where the water demand was insufficient to fulfill the n requirements contrastingly paranychianakis and angelakis 2008 found that salt levels in tww were high enough to harm irrigated crops another investigation on silt loam soil showed that winery wastewater can be used to hydrate syrah grapevines but reported soil sodium na concentrations increased as a result mosse et al 2013 however different rootstocks were found to have different salinity tolerance levels and use of saline resistant rootstocks can temporarily mitigate na effects nonetheless with continuous increase in na concentrations damage will eventually occur dag et al 2015 netzer et al 2014 examined superior seedless table grapes vines grafted on salt tolerant paulsen rootstock and reported trends of na accumulation in tww irrigated vine tissue and the soil stating that prolonged tww irrigation may pose a potential risk to the vines over time results of long term research did not reach a consensus on the long term impact of tww irrigation in 14 years long study on the impact of tww irrigation on grapes in algeria researchers reported no significant change in the soil constituents or ill effect on the vines cherfouh et al 2018 however the researchers also noted that the tww irrigation was not well regulated during the study period and this might have an impact on the results laurenson et al 2012 reviewed the use of tww for grapevine irrigation and warned about the long term impact of the high na concentration on the vines calling for more long term studies to be carried out yang et al 2022 warned that long term use of tww in grapevines irrigation may result in heavy metal accumulation and a possible increased risk of cancer from regularly consuming these grapes they called for continued monitoring and long term studies to assess the risk sodium can harm vines by creating osmotic stress in the short term or by causing direct toxicity in the long term as osmotic potential decreases in saline soils the plants turgor pressure is affected tissues dehydrate slowing photosynthesis thus causing inhibited growth biomass loss and eventually death shani and ben gal 2005 the specific toxicity mechanism is still unknown but theorized that accumulation in the cell walls result in cell damage by disrupting osmotic or ionic balance potentially impacting enzyme or hormone activity zhou tsang et al 2021 na accumulation can cause dispersion of soil particles through interaction with clay particles thus changing the soil physical properties reeve et al 1954 rengasamy 2002 laurenson et al 2012 dispersion when combined with swelling and slaking can harm plants by reducing water and air permeability causing waterlogging and inhibiting root penetration warrington et al 2007 if high soil concentrations of monovalent cations such as na and k are present divalent cations such as calcium ca and mg that are stabilizing factors in soil structure can be displaced from the surface of clay particles pils et al 2007 rengasamy and marchuk 2011 laurenson et al 2012 a study by netzer et al 2014 aimed to examine the effects of various irrigation types and quantities on table grapes and test the long term impact on the soil and vines e g soil chemistry mineral content in leaf and trunk and yield data collected in their experiment showed an increase in soil salinity over time and after the experiment had ended the health state of the vines was recorded see the materials and methods and results sections since long term tww irrigation studies are scarce the presented work is a step in the path to fill the gap to understanding the possible implications of this growing practice this study utilizes and extends the dataset collected during the research described by netzer et al 2014 to examine the impact of increased salinity via long term irrigation with tww on the soil and the potential vine damage it might generate using state of the art machine learning and statistical tools the aim of this study was to revisit the collected data and examine the relationship between the increase in na concentrations following long term tww irrigation the damage to the vines and to assess the possible mechanisms that led to the observed damage to reach that end the following steps were undertaken 1 quantify multiannual temporal trends of na and sar 2 construct a regression model to define the relative contribution of various factors on na and sar levels in the soil and 3 determine na and sar accumulation impact on the grapevines health state healthy damaged or dead 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a nine year field experiment 2002 2010 was conducted in a vineyard on a 1 ha plot of table grapes vitis vinifera cv superior seedless grapevine grafted onto 1103 paulsen rootstocks the vineyard 1430 vines per ha was planted in 1997 in the agricultural research and development station at the lachish region located in southern israel latitude 31 6 n longitude 34 8 e 2 2 abiotic conditions the region is characterized by a semiarid mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters average reference evapotranspiration for the experiment period was 1272 mm calculated by the penman monteith equation for the period of april to october average measured rainfall precipitation for the duration of the research was 358 mm for yearly averages see table 1 soil composition was 30 sand 28 silt and 42 clay characterizing it as a clay loam caco3 and organic matter content were 18 and 0 6 respectively with an average cation exchange capacity cec of 27 3 meq 100 g 1 2 3 experimental design two irrigation variables were tested in the current work water composition quality and irrigation amount high medium low the water composition contained three different treatments fresh water with fertilizer fw f treated wastewater tww and tww with fertilizer tww f since the tww used contained increased levels of n p and k it may have supplied these nutrients however traditionally farmers tend to add these nutrients via fertilizers due to relatively low cost vs increased yield therefore tww f was studied the combined treatments of water type and quantity totaled in nine treatments each treatment was replicated 4 times totaling in 36 treatment plots arranged randomly in a factorial block design fig 1 each plot had an area of 294 m2 and contained three vine rows with 14 vines per row with 2 m spacing between each vine and 3 5 m between rows vine placing row distribution and auxiliary systems were defined in accordance with research area accepted in commercial practices for table grape cultivation standard herbicide and insecticide practices were applied throughout the experiment a 50 cm spacing 2 4 l h 1 drip irrigation system with one line per row was used netafim ltd hatzerim israel the high medium and low irrigation amount treatments were calculated as a percentage of crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions etc as defined by allen et al 1998 the irrigation coefficients used were 0 8 0 6 and 0 4 of the etc for high medium and low irrigation respectively netzer et al 2014 utilized etc as representing maximum evapotranspiration of the vines however they report that actual water consumption was affected by various plant response mechanisms the annual irrigation water amounts for each of the treatments can be found in table 1 2 4 treated wastewater tww source was a reservoir in kibbutz gat located 2 km away from the site the reservoir contained secondary treated municipal wastewater which were treated using an activated sludge process the tww chemical properties were determined by filtration in a 0 2 µm filter then cations were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes spectro kleve germany and anions in an ion chromatograph ic dx 600 dionex usa and are presented in table 2 daily supply of fertilizer gofer 4 2 6 fertilizers and chemicals ltd israel was applied via the irrigation system to the six corresponding treatments nutrient concentrations of no3 nh4 k and p were 0 87 1 06 0 87 and 0 19 mm respectively the nutrient sources did not contain na and were composed of kno3 nh4 2so4 and h3po4 with a no3 n to nh4 n ratio of 45 55 2 5 soil sampling and analysis first soil sampling for physical and chemical analyses was carried out in march 2002 prior to initiating the experiment soil was sampled twice a year before and after the growing season spring and autumn soil was sampled via auger 40 cm from the dripper with in its impact zone between 2 vines at depths of 0 30 30 60 and 60 100 cm samples were oven dried at 65 c and preserved until processed and analyzed for na mg and ca first a saturated paste extract was made then sample was filtered using 0 2 µm filter and analyzed using icp aes spectro kleve germany the resulting data used to calculate sar descriptive statistics of na and sar can be found in table 3 2 6 vine health state evaluation sampling of health state during the final year of the experiment 2010 was conducted only on the 10 vines at the center of the middle row such that 360 vines were sampled in total the vines were checked and qualitatively categorized as healthy damaged and dead based on vine factors such as foliage emergence and signs of leaf narcosis for example dead vines had no leaves damaged vines had a visibly reduced number of leaves with clear signs of leaf narcosis 2 7 meteorological data all meteorological data was monitored by the automatic lachish regional meteorological station located close to the experimental plot 100 m the collected data were used for calculating reference crop evapotranspiration eto according to the penman monteith equation 2 8 modeling framework and statistical analysis data have been checked for normality and homogeneity of variance 2 8 1 multiannual trend analysis of na and sar the temporal trend of na and sar was examined throughout the timeframe of the experiment e g 9 years due to seasonal differences the multiannual long term dynamics were examined only for data collected during autumn for each sub plot fig 1 a mann kendall mk significance test was conducted on the na and sar series of temporally dynamic values mk is a non parametric trend test that accounts for the rank of the observed values along with their place along the time series kendall 1948 mann 1945 the resulting statistic z score follows a standard normal distribution enabling to obtain the significance of change its magnitude and direction the outcome of this analysis generated a value for each sub plot in each soil depth and for each variable na sar signifying the degree of change through time segmenting the z scores according to treatments e g irrigation types and amounts enabled to interpret the patterns of the temporal dynamics the mk test was conducted using the trend package pohlert 2020 and visualized using ggplot2 wickham 2016 in r 2 8 2 factors affecting na and sar the dataset of the experiment included multiple variables blocks repetition number for each treatment which was used to account for the spatial variability in the vineyard soil depth cm depth of the collected sample annual precipitation mm total precipitation amounts per year seasonal precipitation mm total precipitation amounts water type water type used for irrigation year year of experiment first year is labeled 0 season divided according to the two growing seasons of the vines and defined as spring march august and autumn september february the spring data were collected for five of the growing seasons 2002 2006 and was therefore used only for this analysis as input to the regression model each variable was presumed to account for some of the variability of na and sar to comply with the goal of estimating the relative contribution of each of these factors on na and sar accumulation a regression model was constructed each of the target variables na sar was analyzed separately first outliers of na and sar were detected using the inter quantile range iqr technique ohana levi et al 2021 iqr is defined as the difference between the first and third quantiles q1 and q3 respectively an outlier was defined as any value more than 1 5 iqr below q1 or above q3 sub plots consisting of na sar outliers were removed from their respective analysis outlier detection was conducted using the graphics package in r r core team 2021 the dataset was then divided to a training set and a test set with a ratio of 70 30 respectively using the catools package in r tuszynski 2020 the boosted regression trees brt algorithm generated the non linear regression model with multiple covariates this machine learning algorithm separates the data into groups using weights based on rules and similarities in the target variable friedman 2001 brt can handle categorical variables and covariates with missing values elith et al 2008 the predictive strength of brt made it a common choice in agricultural studies and soil science in recent years for both exploratory and predictive uses brillante et al 2016 jafari et al 2014 ohana levi et al 2022 2020 wang et al 2019 brt was applied via the dismo package in r elith et al 2008 the analysis included the ranked effects of the covariates on na sar presented as relative contributions additionally the partial dependence of each target variable on each covariate was derived partial dependence is quantified in the model by averaging out the effects of all other covariates cutler et al 2007 while all covariates except the one being examined are held constant it is commonly presented in partial dependence plots pdps which emphasize the direction of influence attributed to each covariate ohana levi et al 2022 the visualization of the brt results was implemented using ggplot2 package in r wickham 2016 to validate the model s performance several measures were calculated 1 the training correlation which provides an evaluation of the fit on the training data ranges between 0 and 1 with 1 describing a perfect fit 2 a cross validation correlation coefficient which tests the model on withheld portions of the data 3 a correlation coefficient between the fitted values of the test set and the measured values 4 a t test statistic of the test set against measured values to account for differences between their means α 0 05 5 the root mean square error rmse representing the error between the fitted and measured values 6 rmse normalized to the range rmserange of the test set and presented in percentage the rmse was computed using the metrics package in r hamner et al 2018 2 8 3 na and sar impact on the vines an analysis was conducted to determine the association between na and sar accumulation and the vines health state i e alive damaged and dead following outlier removal as specified in sub section 2 8 2 datasets na sar were checked for homogeneity of variance levene s test and normal distribution of the residuals wilk shapiro test the tests showed that the assumption of normal distribution was violated therefore the non parametric kruskal wallis test was applied this test was followed by the wilcoxon test to check for statistical differences of the target variables values among vine health state pairs at α 0 05 all tests were performed in r r core team 2021 3 results 3 1 na and sar z scores as can be seen in fig 2 the tww f treatments had less variability and a visible trend of na accumulation through time there were significant increases in na concentrations treated with low irrigation amounts while in the tww treatment with high irrigation volume a decreasing trend in na concentrations was observed fig 2a for sar 8 3 of the fw f samples showed significant increases in na accumulation through time while in tww it was 13 89 and in tww f it was 5 5 indicating a strong increasing trend in sar with very few samples showing reduction in the ratio fig 2b 3 2 relative influence for na the highest relative influence was found for seasonal precipitation 22 5 and irrigation amount 19 3 followed by experimental year water quality and soil depth 12 fig 3a for sar the highest ranked contributors were soil depth 21 39 experimental year 18 73 and irrigation amount 17 67 followed by block 13 16 and water quality 11 96 fig 3b annual precipitation and the season were found to be weak contributors for both target variables 3 3 partial dependences partial dependences for na illustrated an increase in concentrations with an increase in irrigation amount years and soil depth fig 4b c and e respectively whereas a reduction in na concentrations was apparent with increase in seasonal precipitation and higher levels of na were found during autumn rather than spring fig 4a f and h water quality treatments were found to positively affect na accumulation with tww irrigation while fw f was associated with the lowest concentration amounts strong differences were found among the different blocks for sar partial dependences showed an increase in sar with increasing soil depth experiment year and irrigation amount fig 5a b and c contrastingly a decrease in sar was evident with annual precipitation fig 5d and g furthermore sar values were higher during autumn than spring similar to findings from the na analysis tww was also linked to higher sar values and block effects were observed 3 4 model validation model validation showed strong model accuracy levels with a correlation of 0 8 for na and sar test set and a low rmserange of 14 table 4 there was no significant difference between the projected and measured values qq plots for na and sar showed that the model had an accurate fit for values up to 9 for na 77 of the test set and 6 for sar 82 of the test set but underestimated the concentration levels above those values fig 6 3 5 vine mortality vine mortality was found to be the lowest for the fw f quality treatment while12 of the vines were either damaged or dead compared to 25 among the vines that were treated with tww and 40 in those that were introduced with the tww f treatment table 5 the kruskal wallis analysis showed a significant difference between na concentrations of damaged vines to live and dead vines p value 0 008 and 0 011 respectively fig 7 there was no significant difference between na concentration levels in dead and damaged vines or between any groups of vine health state for sar fig 7 4 discussion assessing data collected for 9 years using statistical and machine learning tools we have explored the relationship between long term irrigation with tww na accumulation and damage to the vines the irrigation quantities used in the research are within the range used for commercial table grapes irrigation in the study area netzer et al 2009 few studies have been carried out on the long term impact of tww irrigation in grape vines and have reported contradicting conclusions regarding the safety of long term tww irrigation na increase was most pronounced in the tww f treatment where an increase in na concentrations corresponded to increased irrigation amounts fig 4b due to added mass of na as expected precipitation was directly linked to na concentrations where more precipitation meant reduced concentrations due to leaching fig 4a leaching is a major control on na concentrations and is the main practice for reducing field na concentrations lowell 1964 an increase in na concentrations was observed for the low irrigation volume in all types of water quality treatments fig 2a this can be partially explained by evaporative accumulation enhanced by insufficient leaching due to the low water volume evaporative accumulation is a mechanism by which solutes transport upward with the soil water and as the water evaporates the solutes remain in the soil and accumulate elrick et al 1994 moreover the similar concentrations of mg and ca in all water quality treatments table 2 suggest that the addition of na from the tww would be substantially contributing to this trend in tww f no reduction in na concentrations was measured whereas some reduction occurred in the tww treatment fig 2a this might be due to the addition of k in the fertilizer which would also compete on binding sites in the soil thus enhancing the displacement of ca and mg coleman et al 1959 the importance of the above mentioned factors for na dynamics can be seen in the relative influence analysis where top predictors for na concentrations were seasonal rain and irrigation amount fig 3a which facilitate leaching these factors were followed by year which accounts for temporal accumulation fig 3a this means that the added amount of na coupled with the leaching via rain controlled the accumulation rate and the overall na concentration increased which can be seen as time progress for sar soil depth year and irrigation amount were found to be the major contributors fig 3b indicating that the temporal accumulation and addition via irrigation and or leaching can account for over 50 of sar variability due to sar being a ratio of several ions some of which are being added as fertilizer it is not surprising that the ratio did not increase much although na accumulated fig 5a the boosted regression trees model estimators showed a good fit between the predicted results and the observations with 80 fit and underestimation of high values table 4 fig 6 this fit indicates that further work may lead to a strong forecasting model regarding irrigation it s chemical composition and na accumulation levels in recent years advanced methods are progressively applied in soil science padarian et al 2020 and agricultural works liakos et al 2018 thus widening the array of possibilities to extract knowledge and insights from data explore multivariate interactions and expand multidisciplinary opportunities the methodological framework used in this present study made use of classical statistical methods along with machine learning modeling to provide a comprehensive and integrated view of long term na causes and effects in a vineyard system the data show that both tww and tww f treatments resulted overtime in significantly higher na concentrations than irrigation using fw f which did not contain elevated na concentrations fig 4b c d additionally after 9 years of irrigation 40 of tww f irrigated vines were damaged or dead vs only 12 in fw f irrigated vines table 5 these findings illustrate the importance considering the water quality type in long term applications partial data collected not shown indicates a decrease in yield in the last 2 years of the experiment with a major drop in the following year 2010 supporting the conclusion that vine mortality is directly linked to na accumulation over time a possible solution might be diluting the tww with fw to a maximum ec value of 1 5 ds m however a few reservations are needed in this context since natural systems are complex there is rarely one factor that contributes to the die off of a plant population and usually there are primary factors and secondary ones krull 1969 netzer et al 2014 showed na concentrations in the petiole has increased in tww f irrigated vines and in our data the maximum sar value found was 5 5 fig 5a which is not indicative of sodicity however the mechanism by which na caused damage were not directly explored since na can also induce changes to soil structure resulting in less aeration and reduced water permeability reeve et al 1954 which could have been a contributing stress factor additionally partial irrigation regimes i e a fraction of the etc such as the ones used in our work contribute to na accumulation by reduced leaching whereas complete irrigation regimes enhance leaching alrajhi et al 2015 the presented work focused on na but there are many other factors that may play a part and need to be studied further irrigation with tww causes changes in the soil microbial population which may contribute to stress in plants mkhinini et al 2020 furthermore tww contains various metals and organic contaminants such as hormones and medications that might also act as a stress factor christou et al 2019 werfelli et al 2021 moreover different soil types with different clay contents in different climate regions may exhibit a different response both in na dynamics and vine response different rootstocks would also respond differently to na accumulation whereas this work exclusively examined vines grafted on relatively salt tolerant poulsen rootstock downton 1977 the presented study does not account for those and the possible role they play future studies are encouraged to examine these various factors and their interactions additionally since tww irrigation is only expected to increase in commercial vineyards studies on methods to mitigate the ill effects of long term tww irrigation are required such as mendoza espinosa et al 2019 work which introduced a water mixing model for irrigation designed to mitigate the potential long term impacts of tww irrigation on grapevines 5 conclusions this work set out to revisit the data collected during a 9 year irrigation experiment and explore the connection between tww irrigation na accumulation and the impact on the vines statistical analysis methods and models were used to gain insight on the influencing factors the partial dependencies and effects on vine mortality using machine learning tools na accumulation was found to be directly associated with the long term irrigation with tww our results indicated a significant connection between na concentrations and damage or death of vines long term irrigation with tww and tww f resulted in accumulation of na in the soil and affected the vines causing damage and death to vines as evident with up to 40 of observed vines damaged or dead after 9 years our results although specific to the region raise a warning sign and merit further long term investigations of tww irrigation with respect to different stressor factors and mitigation technics and practices to reduce the ill effects caused by long term use of tww as an irrigation source for the specific region the presented framework of the study may be suitable for other crops as the effects begin with na soil accumulation we call for more long term studies in different soils and crops under various conditions and with a wider range of factors that may have contributing impacts such as soil microbial community composition and soil respiration this is essential to guarantee that the increasing use of tww irrigation does not cause irreversible damage to farmlands potentially

the long term as osmotic potential decreases in saline soils the plants turgor pressure is affected tissues dehydrate slowing photosynthesis thus causing inhibited growth biomass loss and eventually death shani and ben gal 2005 the specific toxicity mechanism is still unknown but theorized that accumulation in the cell walls result in cell damage by disrupting osmotic or ionic balance potentially impacting enzyme or hormone activity zhou tsang et al 2021 na accumulation can cause dispersion of soil particles through interaction with clay particles thus changing the soil physical properties reeve et al 1954 rengasamy 2002 laurenson et al 2012 dispersion when combined with swelling and slaking can harm plants by reducing water and air permeability causing waterlogging and inhibiting root penetration warrington et al 2007 if high soil concentrations of monovalent cations such as na and k are present divalent cations such as calcium ca and mg that are stabilizing factors in soil structure can be displaced from the surface of clay particles pils et al 2007 rengasamy and marchuk 2011 laurenson et al 2012 a study by netzer et al 2014 aimed to examine the effects of various irrigation types and quantities on table grapes and test the long term impact on the soil and vines e g soil chemistry mineral content in leaf and trunk and yield data collected in their experiment showed an increase in soil salinity over time and after the experiment had ended the health state of the vines was recorded see the materials and methods and results sections since long term tww irrigation studies are scarce the presented work is a step in the path to fill the gap to understanding the possible implications of this growing practice this study utilizes and extends the dataset collected during the research described by netzer et al 2014 to examine the impact of increased salinity via long term irrigation with tww on the soil and the potential vine damage it might generate using state of the art machine learning and statistical tools the aim of this study was to revisit the collected data and examine the relationship between the increase in na concentrations following long term tww irrigation the damage to the vines and to assess the possible mechanisms that led to the observed damage to reach that end the following steps were undertaken 1 quantify multiannual temporal trends of na and sar 2 construct a regression model to define the relative contribution of various factors on na and sar levels in the soil and 3 determine na and sar accumulation impact on the grapevines health state healthy damaged or dead 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a nine year field experiment 2002 2010 was conducted in a vineyard on a 1 ha plot of table grapes vitis vinifera cv superior seedless grapevine grafted onto 1103 paulsen rootstocks the vineyard 1430 vines per ha was planted in 1997 in the agricultural research and development station at the lachish region located in southern israel latitude 31 6 n longitude 34 8 e 2 2 abiotic conditions the region is characterized by a semiarid mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters average reference evapotranspiration for the experiment period was 1272 mm calculated by the penman monteith equation for the period of april to october average measured rainfall precipitation for the duration of the research was 358 mm for yearly averages see table 1 soil composition was 30 sand 28 silt and 42 clay characterizing it as a clay loam caco3 and organic matter content were 18 and 0 6 respectively with an average cation exchange capacity cec of 27 3 meq 100 g 1 2 3 experimental design two irrigation variables were tested in the current work water composition quality and irrigation amount high medium low the water composition contained three different treatments fresh water with fertilizer fw f treated wastewater tww and tww with fertilizer tww f since the tww used contained increased levels of n p and k it may have supplied these nutrients however traditionally farmers tend to add these nutrients via fertilizers due to relatively low cost vs increased yield therefore tww f was studied the combined treatments of water type and quantity totaled in nine treatments each treatment was replicated 4 times totaling in 36 treatment plots arranged randomly in a factorial block design fig 1 each plot had an area of 294 m2 and contained three vine rows with 14 vines per row with 2 m spacing between each vine and 3 5 m between rows vine placing row distribution and auxiliary systems were defined in accordance with research area accepted in commercial practices for table grape cultivation standard herbicide and insecticide practices were applied throughout the experiment a 50 cm spacing 2 4 l h 1 drip irrigation system with one line per row was used netafim ltd hatzerim israel the high medium and low irrigation amount treatments were calculated as a percentage of crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions etc as defined by allen et al 1998 the irrigation coefficients used were 0 8 0 6 and 0 4 of the etc for high medium and low irrigation respectively netzer et al 2014 utilized etc as representing maximum evapotranspiration of the vines however they report that actual water consumption was affected by various plant response mechanisms the annual irrigation water amounts for each of the treatments can be found in table 1 2 4 treated wastewater tww source was a reservoir in kibbutz gat located 2 km away from the site the reservoir contained secondary treated municipal wastewater which were treated using an activated sludge process the tww chemical properties were determined by filtration in a 0 2 µm filter then cations were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes spectro kleve germany and anions in an ion chromatograph ic dx 600 dionex usa and are presented in table 2 daily supply of fertilizer gofer 4 2 6 fertilizers and chemicals ltd israel was applied via the irrigation system to the six corresponding treatments nutrient concentrations of no3 nh4 k and p were 0 87 1 06 0 87 and 0 19 mm respectively the nutrient sources did not contain na and were composed of kno3 nh4 2so4 and h3po4 with a no3 n to nh4 n ratio of 45 55 2 5 soil sampling and analysis first soil sampling for physical and chemical analyses was carried out in march 2002 prior to initiating the experiment soil was sampled twice a year before and after the growing season spring and autumn soil was sampled via auger 40 cm from the dripper with in its impact zone between 2 vines at depths of 0 30 30 60 and 60 100 cm samples were oven dried at 65 c and preserved until processed and analyzed for na mg and ca first a saturated paste extract was made then sample was filtered using 0 2 µm filter and analyzed using icp aes spectro kleve germany the resulting data used to calculate sar descriptive statistics of na and sar can be found in table 3 2 6 vine health state evaluation sampling of health state during the final year of the experiment 2010 was conducted only on the 10 vines at the center of the middle row such that 360 vines were sampled in total the vines were checked and qualitatively categorized as healthy damaged and dead based on vine factors such as foliage emergence and signs of leaf narcosis for example dead vines had no leaves damaged vines had a visibly reduced number of leaves with clear signs of leaf narcosis 2 7 meteorological data all meteorological data was monitored by the automatic lachish regional meteorological station located close to the experimental plot 100 m the collected data were used for calculating reference crop evapotranspiration eto according to the penman monteith equation 2 8 modeling framework and statistical analysis data have been checked for normality and homogeneity of variance 2 8 1 multiannual trend analysis of na and sar the temporal trend of na and sar was examined throughout the timeframe of the experiment e g 9 years due to seasonal differences the multiannual long term dynamics were examined only for data collected during autumn for each sub plot fig 1 a mann kendall mk significance test was conducted on the na and sar series of temporally dynamic values mk is a non parametric trend test that accounts for the rank of the observed values along with their place along the time series kendall 1948 mann 1945 the resulting statistic z score follows a standard normal distribution enabling to obtain the significance of change its magnitude and direction the outcome of this analysis generated a value for each sub plot in each soil depth and for each variable na sar signifying the degree of change through time segmenting the z scores according to treatments e g irrigation types and amounts enabled to interpret the patterns of the temporal dynamics the mk test was conducted using the trend package pohlert 2020 and visualized using ggplot2 wickham 2016 in r 2 8 2 factors affecting na and sar the dataset of the experiment included multiple variables blocks repetition number for each treatment which was used to account for the spatial variability in the vineyard soil depth cm depth of the collected sample annual precipitation mm total precipitation amounts per year seasonal precipitation mm total precipitation amounts water type water type used for irrigation year year of experiment first year is labeled 0 season divided according to the two growing seasons of the vines and defined as spring march august and autumn september february the spring data were collected for five of the growing seasons 2002 2006 and was therefore used only for this analysis as input to the regression model each variable was presumed to account for some of the variability of na and sar to comply with the goal of estimating the relative contribution of each of these factors on na and sar accumulation a regression model was constructed each of the target variables na sar was analyzed separately first outliers of na and sar were detected using the inter quantile range iqr technique ohana levi et al 2021 iqr is defined as the difference between the first and third quantiles q1 and q3 respectively an outlier was defined as any value more than 1 5 iqr below q1 or above q3 sub plots consisting of na sar outliers were removed from their respective analysis outlier detection was conducted using the graphics package in r r core team 2021 the dataset was then divided to a training set and a test set with a ratio of 70 30 respectively using the catools package in r tuszynski 2020 the boosted regression trees brt algorithm generated the non linear regression model with multiple covariates this machine learning algorithm separates the data into groups using weights based on rules and similarities in the target variable friedman 2001 brt can handle categorical variables and covariates with missing values elith et al 2008 the predictive strength of brt made it a common choice in agricultural studies and soil science in recent years for both exploratory and predictive uses brillante et al 2016 jafari et al 2014 ohana levi et al 2022 2020 wang et al 2019 brt was applied via the dismo package in r elith et al 2008 the analysis included the ranked effects of the covariates on na sar presented as relative contributions additionally the partial dependence of each target variable on each covariate was derived partial dependence is quantified in the model by averaging out the effects of all other covariates cutler et al 2007 while all covariates except the one being examined are held constant it is commonly presented in partial dependence plots pdps which emphasize the direction of influence attributed to each covariate ohana levi et al 2022 the visualization of the brt results was implemented using ggplot2 package in r wickham 2016 to validate the model s performance several measures were calculated 1 the training correlation which provides an evaluation of the fit on the training data ranges between 0 and 1 with 1 describing a perfect fit 2 a cross validation correlation coefficient which tests the model on withheld portions of the data 3 a correlation coefficient between the fitted values of the test set and the measured values 4 a t test statistic of the test set against measured values to account for differences between their means α 0 05 5 the root mean square error rmse representing the error between the fitted and measured values 6 rmse normalized to the range rmserange of the test set and presented in percentage the rmse was computed using the metrics package in r hamner et al 2018 2 8 3 na and sar impact on the vines an analysis was conducted to determine the association between na and sar accumulation and the vines health state i e alive damaged and dead following outlier removal as specified in sub section 2 8 2 datasets na sar were checked for homogeneity of variance levene s test and normal distribution of the residuals wilk shapiro test the tests showed that the assumption of normal distribution was violated therefore the non parametric kruskal wallis test was applied this test was followed by the wilcoxon test to check for statistical differences of the target variables values among vine health state pairs at α 0 05 all tests were performed in r r core team 2021 3 results 3 1 na and sar z scores as can be seen in fig 2 the tww f treatments had less variability and a visible trend of na accumulation through time there were significant increases in na concentrations treated with low irrigation amounts while in the tww treatment with high irrigation volume a decreasing trend in na concentrations was observed fig 2a for sar 8 3 of the fw f samples showed significant increases in na accumulation through time while in tww it was 13 89 and in tww f it was 5 5 indicating a strong increasing trend in sar with very few samples showing reduction in the ratio fig 2b 3 2 relative influence for na the highest relative influence was found for seasonal precipitation 22 5 and irrigation amount 19 3 followed by experimental year water quality and soil depth 12 fig 3a for sar the highest ranked contributors were soil depth 21 39 experimental year 18 73 and irrigation amount 17 67 followed by block 13 16 and water quality 11 96 fig 3b annual precipitation and the season were found to be weak contributors for both target variables 3 3 partial dependences partial dependences for na illustrated an increase in concentrations with an increase in irrigation amount years and soil depth fig 4b c and e respectively whereas a reduction in na concentrations was apparent with increase in seasonal precipitation and higher levels of na were found during autumn rather than spring fig 4a f and h water quality treatments were found to positively affect na accumulation with tww irrigation while fw f was associated with the lowest concentration amounts strong differences were found among the different blocks for sar partial dependences showed an increase in sar with increasing soil depth experiment year and irrigation amount fig 5a b and c contrastingly a decrease in sar was evident with annual precipitation fig 5d and g furthermore sar values were higher during autumn than spring similar to findings from the na analysis tww was also linked to higher sar values and block effects were observed 3 4 model validation model validation showed strong model accuracy levels with a correlation of 0 8 for na and sar test set and a low rmserange of 14 table 4 there was no significant difference between the projected and measured values qq plots for na and sar showed that the model had an accurate fit for values up to 9 for na 77 of the test set and 6 for sar 82 of the test set but underestimated the concentration levels above those values fig 6 3 5 vine mortality vine mortality was found to be the lowest for the fw f quality treatment while12 of the vines were either damaged or dead compared to 25 among the vines that were treated with tww and 40 in those that were introduced with the tww f treatment table 5 the kruskal wallis analysis showed a significant difference between na concentrations of damaged vines to live and dead vines p value 0 008 and 0 011 respectively fig 7 there was no significant difference between na concentration levels in dead and damaged vines or between any groups of vine health state for sar fig 7 4 discussion assessing data collected for 9 years using statistical and machine learning tools we have explored the relationship between long term irrigation with tww na accumulation and damage to the vines the irrigation quantities used in the research are within the range used for commercial table grapes irrigation in the study area netzer et al 2009 few studies have been carried out on the long term impact of tww irrigation in grape vines and have reported contradicting conclusions regarding the safety of long term tww irrigation na increase was most pronounced in the tww f treatment where an increase in na concentrations corresponded to increased irrigation amounts fig 4b due to added mass of na as expected precipitation was directly linked to na concentrations where more precipitation meant reduced concentrations due to leaching fig 4a leaching is a major control on na concentrations and is the main practice for reducing field na concentrations lowell 1964 an increase in na concentrations was observed for the low irrigation volume in all types of water quality treatments fig 2a this can be partially explained by evaporative accumulation enhanced by insufficient leaching due to the low water volume evaporative accumulation is a mechanism by which solutes transport upward with the soil water and as the water evaporates the solutes remain in the soil and accumulate elrick et al 1994 moreover the similar concentrations of mg and ca in all water quality treatments table 2 suggest that the addition of na from the tww would be substantially contributing to this trend in tww f no reduction in na concentrations was measured whereas some reduction occurred in the tww treatment fig 2a this might be due to the addition of k in the fertilizer which would also compete on binding sites in the soil thus enhancing the displacement of ca and mg coleman et al 1959 the importance of the above mentioned factors for na dynamics can be seen in the relative influence analysis where top predictors for na concentrations were seasonal rain and irrigation amount fig 3a which facilitate leaching these factors were followed by year which accounts for temporal accumulation fig 3a this means that the added amount of na coupled with the leaching via rain controlled the accumulation rate and the overall na concentration increased which can be seen as time progress for sar soil depth year and irrigation amount were found to be the major contributors fig 3b indicating that the temporal accumulation and addition via irrigation and or leaching can account for over 50 of sar variability due to sar being a ratio of several ions some of which are being added as fertilizer it is not surprising that the ratio did not increase much although na accumulated fig 5a the boosted regression trees model estimators showed a good fit between the predicted results and the observations with 80 fit and underestimation of high values table 4 fig 6 this fit indicates that further work may lead to a strong forecasting model regarding irrigation it s chemical composition and na accumulation levels in recent years advanced methods are progressively applied in soil science padarian et al 2020 and agricultural works liakos et al 2018 thus widening the array of possibilities to extract knowledge and insights from data explore multivariate interactions and expand multidisciplinary opportunities the methodological framework used in this present study made use of classical statistical methods along with machine learning modeling to provide a comprehensive and integrated view of long term na causes and effects in a vineyard system the data show that both tww and tww f treatments resulted overtime in significantly higher na concentrations than irrigation using fw f which did not contain elevated na concentrations fig 4b c d additionally after 9 years of irrigation 40 of tww f irrigated vines were damaged or dead vs only 12 in fw f irrigated vines table 5 these findings illustrate the importance considering the water quality type in long term applications partial data collected not shown indicates a decrease in yield in the last 2 years of the experiment with a major drop in the following year 2010 supporting the conclusion that vine mortality is directly linked to na accumulation over time a possible solution might be diluting the tww with fw to a maximum ec value of 1 5 ds m however a few reservations are needed in this context since natural systems are complex there is rarely one factor that contributes to the die off of a plant population and usually there are primary factors and secondary ones krull 1969 netzer et al 2014 showed na concentrations in the petiole has increased in tww f irrigated vines and in our data the maximum sar value found was 5 5 fig 5a which is not indicative of sodicity however the mechanism by which na caused damage were not directly explored since na can also induce changes to soil structure resulting in less aeration and reduced water permeability reeve et al 1954 which could have been a contributing stress factor additionally partial irrigation regimes i e a fraction of the etc such as the ones used in our work contribute to na accumulation by reduced leaching whereas complete irrigation regimes enhance leaching alrajhi et al 2015 the presented work focused on na but there are many other factors that may play a part and need to be studied further irrigation with tww causes changes in the soil microbial population which may contribute to stress in plants mkhinini et al 2020 furthermore tww contains various metals and organic contaminants such as hormones and medications that might also act as a stress factor christou et al 2019 werfelli et al 2021 moreover different soil types with different clay contents in different climate regions may exhibit a different response both in na dynamics and vine response different rootstocks would also respond differently to na accumulation whereas this work exclusively examined vines grafted on relatively salt tolerant poulsen rootstock downton 1977 the presented study does not account for those and the possible role they play future studies are encouraged to examine these various factors and their interactions additionally since tww irrigation is only expected to increase in commercial vineyards studies on methods to mitigate the ill effects of long term tww irrigation are required such as mendoza espinosa et al 2019 work which introduced a water mixing model for irrigation designed to mitigate the potential long term impacts of tww irrigation on grapevines 5 conclusions this work set out to revisit the data collected during a 9 year irrigation experiment and explore the connection between tww irrigation na accumulation and the impact on the vines statistical analysis methods and models were used to gain insight on the influencing factors the partial dependencies and effects on vine mortality using machine learning tools na accumulation was found to be directly associated with the long term irrigation with tww our results indicated a significant connection between na concentrations and damage or death of vines long term irrigation with tww and tww f resulted in accumulation of na in the soil and affected the vines causing damage and death to vines as evident with up to 40 of observed vines damaged or dead after 9 years our results although specific to the region raise a warning sign and merit further long term investigations of tww irrigation with respect to different stressor factors and mitigation technics and practices to reduce the ill effects caused by long term use of tww as an irrigation source for the specific region the presented framework of the study may be suitable for other crops as the effects begin with na soil accumulation we call for more long term studies in different soils and crops under various conditions and with a wider range of factors that may have contributing impacts such as soil microbial community composition and soil respiration this is essential to guarantee that the increasing use of tww irrigation does not cause irreversible damage to farmlands potentially

9207,global climate change associated with increasing temperature and unreliable rainfall events will have consequences for crop production therefore strategizing crop management gained the attention of crop scientists to curtail the adverse impacts of climate change on crop production however the projected effects of climate change on wheat may vary in different cropping systems as wheat production is reported to be significantly impacted by future climate change in major cropping systems worldwide in the present study ten experiments were conducted under irrigated 2007 2013 and

rcps co2 concentration and future periods a general reduction in wheat phenology grain yield etc and wue was anticipated however higher co2 concentration and early maturity improved the wue of wheat under irrigated and rainfed conditions nevertheless this gain in wue was at the cost of a relatively higher yield loss wheat yield is expected to decline by 2 19 and 9 30 under irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively by aggregating the simulated future climate change impacts across gcms and rcps adaptation strategies to mitigate the climate change impacts on wheat production in irrigated

introduction the ever growing global population and highly unpredictable climate are humanity s most significant challenges for food security in the 21st century climate change associated with extreme temperatures and increasingly unreliable rainfall events will affect wheat the second most widely consumed cereal crop worldwide asseng et al 2015 the increasing global affluence also challenges crop production by increasing the demand for high quality food feed and fiber although elevated co2 may benefit wheat growth and productivity in a few wheat producing countries in the future yet under an ample supply of nitrogen and water hernandez ochoa et al 2018 conversely wheat yields are projected to decline in most wheat growing countries asseng et al 2015 osman et al 2022 2022 the anticipated increase in global temperature by 1 4 by 2100 zhao et al 2017 ipcc 2018 leads to a further decline in wheat yields climate change affects wheat growth and productivity due to its adverse impacts on

patterns stocker 2014 the significant year to year variations in weather conditions driven by climate change negatively impact wheat growth and productivity osman et al 2021 the increased occurrence of prolonged droughts uneven monsoon rainfall and high temperature 40 and 45 has made rainfed cropping systems more vulnerable to climate change mainly due to anticipated combined drought and heat

experimental sites were 12 to 50 0 3 to 34 and from 3 to 47 and 6 to 38 respectively the long term weather data for tmax tmin rainfall and solar radiation were collected from the pakistan meteorological department 1974 2013 and the soil and water conservation research institute weather station 1984 2014 for irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively the mean cropping season tmax

third weeks of november under irrigated conditions and between the 1st and 3rd weeks of october and november under rainfed conditions the experiments were performed in a randomized complete block design the plot size both under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 0 54 ha growing conditions such as irrigated and rainfed as well as growing seasons were considered as treatments details of the experimental design for the irrigated and rainfed conditions can be found in ishaque et al 2020 and hafiza et al 2022 in all experiments fungicide treated seeds 125 kg ha 1 having 90 germination were planted at a depth of 4 5 cm in soil with a row row spacing of 15 cm and 25 cm with a tractor mounted seed drill under irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively nutrient requirements were measured based on soil analysis and were satisfactorily met with fertilizer applications for irrigated conditions sufficient nitrogen urea 150 kg ha 1 and phosphorous p2o5 100 kg ha 1 were applied evenly to the field and incorporated to a soil depth of 20 cm during seedbed preparation in the case of rainfed conditions p2o5 was applied at 70 kg ha 1 while urea was split into two equal portions 50 kg ha 1 was applied at sowing and 50 kg ha 1 was applied in january subsequently after rainfall water for irrigation was stored in a tank 4 m 4 m 2 m and pumped via a pipeline to ensure complete and uniform coverage distribution of water among the sub plots a flow meter was connected between the pump and the delivery pipeline to determine the amount of water applied pre sowing irrigation of 75 mm was applied uniformly to all plots about 10 15 days before seedbed preparation in irrigated areas irrigation was applied when 50 of the field capacity s moisture was depleted from 0 to 100 cm soil depth the soil moisture was monitored throughout the growing season using a neutron moisture meter irrigation was ceased by the second week of march to allow the soil to dry out to avoid delayed crop maturity 2 3 measurements and sampling the wheat phenology was observed using the zadoks scale crop growth and development stages were recorded with 50 of the plants exhibiting visual signs of the stage in question the phenological phases were recorded such as emergence onset and termination of anthesis senescence and maturity after emergence twenty plants were tagged in each of the three replications crop growth was measured by harvesting a randomly selected 1 m2 area from each replicate weekly or fortnightly following seedling emergence and drying to a constant weight at 70 for 48 h almost no pest and disease infestations were observed yet the application of herbicides effectively controlled weeds photographs were captured at 1 1 5 m over the canopy to cover a fair number of wheat plants to calculate in season canopy growth and development the photos were captured between 12 00 13 30 and digitized using image j image j https imagej nih gov ij for canopy cover measurements the model predicted leaf area index for wheat was transformed to canopy cover using empirical data and a similar regression relationship as by hsiao et al 2009 1 cc 94 1 exp 0 43 lai 0 52 total aboveground biomass and grain yield were calculated after harvesting at physiological maturity the etc was calculated as follows allen et al 1998 2 et c p r d s ini s end where p r and d represent rainfall runoff and drainage below the root zone while sini and send are the soil moisture storage at the start and end of the crop growing season respectively the runoff was prevented by making bunds around each replicate 30 m 30 m of the experimental field 0 54 ha d was calculated by measuring soil water content in different soil layers after rainfall and data on soil moisture indicated no deep drainage losses the wue was determined as follows 3 wue total grain yield crop evapotranspiration et c during the growing season 2 4 dssat ceres wheat the dssat ceres wheat hoogenboom et al 2019 is one of the world s most widely used crop models ceres wheat is a process based model which simulates crop development as a response to crop genetics environmental conditions atmospheric co2 soil and weather and management strategies it has been tested at several sites in the world hernandez ochoa et al 2018 osman et al 2020 most of the ceres wheat model evaluation studies focused on mean and extreme temperatures sowing dates cultivars water conditions planting densities and nitrogen application rates ahmed et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 osman et al 2020 2 5 model calculation of evapotranspiration dssat ceres wheat soil water balance is a function of soil water quantity resulting from the inputs of irrigation and precipitation the outputs of evaporation from plants and the soil runoff and drainage the soil water balance in the model is distributed in up to ten layers the water content of any particular soil layer can decrease as a consequence of soil evaporation root absorption or water flow to an adjacent layer various methods such as furrow drip trickle sprinkler and flood are available in dssat ceres wheat to simulate the irrigation the soil water balance subroutine requires calculating potential evaporation from the soil and plant surfaces dssat ceres wheat can employ the priestley taylor pt or penman monteith fao56 pm methods to calculate potential evapotranspiration and later method was employed in this study dssat ceres wheat measures albedo from growth stages leaf area index and temperature dependent constants to account for the effects of unsaturated air radiation and advection of potential evapotranspiration in the case of the pm equation however the model calculates reference evapotranspiration from the fao version of the penman equation which requires vapor pressure deficit and wind speed to calculate potential evapotranspiration from the pm equation 2 6 calibration and validation of the model model calibration and model evaluation were carried out using independent observed experimental datasets the model was calibrated by regulating only cultivar parameters using in season data samples from optimum irrigated treatments from three consecutive cropping seasons from 2007 to 2010 the model was calibrated following boote 1999 approach to calibration calibration started with the fundamental cultivar coefficient information provided by the dssat ceres wheat model hoogenboom et al 2013 sequential modifications initializing with phenology data viz anthesis and maturity dates followed by crop growth and development parameters accumulated aboveground biomass of each cropping season leaf area final aboveground biomass and grain yield at harvest were made the model parameters were fine tuned by reducing the percentage deviation root mean square error normalized root mean square error and increasing index of agreement between the model s observed and simulated data the calibrated model was then validated using independent datasets from the consecutive growing seasons from 2010 to 2013 for irrigated conditions and 2010 2014 for rainfed conditions the details of model calibration and validation for irrigated and rainfed areas are discussed elsewhere in the literature ishaque et al 2020 hafiza et al 2022 2 7 generating long term daily weather data crop growth models evaluate risk and decision making for risk management and thus require accurate reliable weather information for robust simulations van wart et al 2013 for the baseline period 2010 marksim generated the required weather data tmax tmin solar radiation and rainfall which was then validated by observed weather data gathered from synoptic weather stations generally the availability of the historical weather data in developing countries are limited which limits the options for the researchers to use specific weather generators for crop growth model execution despite being the most advanced available tool to projects into the future the gcms are never in a form that can be directly used to run the crop growth models jones and thornton 2013 these models have become an essential tool for understanding climate change processes despite their uncertainties terray and boé 2013 the output of the mean ensemble of gcms might be used to obtain reliable estimates ma et al 2021 it will annul the individual gcm biases resulting in decreased uncertainty however the multi model ensemble might not cover the whole uncertainty range and some biases may persist tebaldi and knutti 2007 nevertheless other studies suggested that a multi gcm mean is likely to produce improved results than a single model simulation hagedorn et al 2005 ma et al 2021 the current study used marksim to downscale and generate future weather data such as tmax tmin solar radiation and rainfall marksim is a weather generator widely used to generate daily weather data for crop yield simulations claessens et al 2012 marksim v 2 which included the data from 17 individual gcms provided by the agweathernet awn program of washington state university usa was used in this study version 2 of the marksim has a new feature to select any combination of the 17 gcms i e either one all or any desired combination selection can also be made for low moderate and high emission rcps jones 2013 in this study daily weather data for each rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 and for each study year 2030 2050 and 2090 was generated using all the gcms and their mean ensemble in 99 replicates for both the study locations under irrigated and rainfed conditions 2 8 seasonal analysis using dssat ceres wheat the quantitative measurement of crop performance under changing climatic conditions can only be estimated through controlled experiments it is rarely possible to perform such experiments particularly for the time and spatial scales of interest numeric or eco physiological models are a dominant alternative tool in which controlled experiments can be performed in isolation at any scale to estimate the variables which cannot be directly measured based on the recommendations on model selection for climate change impact assessment and adaptation research by white and hoogenboom 2010 and the statistics representing particular model s used by the researchers in different geographic regions dssat ceres wheat was selected for this study the environmental modifications options within the model allow simulation of future climate change scenarios by modifying up to eight environmental variables including day length h solar radiation mjm 2day 1 tmax tmin precipitation mm co2 ppm relative humidity and wind speed km day 1 however in the present study the data of tmax tmin solar radiation and rainfall for different rcps and simulation years was generated using the marksim weather generator while the co2 concentrations corresponding to the rcps and simulation years table 2 were obtained from international institute for applied system analysis and values were changed in the environmental modifications the flood irrigation mm approach was employed to simulate irrigation for baseline and future climate change scenarios under irrigated conditions the automatic irrigation method was used to trigger irrigation when 50 of moisture was depleted 3 results 3 1 maximum temperature the multi gcm ensemble mean tmax for the wheat growing season simulated by marksim under irrigated and rainfed conditions for the baseline year 2010 was 24 4 and 21 respectively while the mean long term growing season tmax was 25 and 21 for irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively relative to baseline mean ensemble tmax values for wheat growing seasons under irrigated fig 3a and rainfed fig 3b conditions were expected to rise by 1 4 1 6 1 3 and 1 7 c and 1 5 1 8 1 4 and 1 8 c under rcps of 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by 2030 for mid century 2050 the expected increase in mean ensemble tmax under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 1 8 2 5 2 0 and 2 5 and 1 9 2 6 2 1 and 3 1 for rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively at the end of the century 2090 a maximum increase in mean ensemble tmax for the wheat growing season is likely to occur the projected mean ensemble increase in tmax for 2090 under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 1 8 3 4 4 0 and 6 5 and 2 0 3 5 4 3 and 7 0 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively the minimum increase in mean ensemble tmax was shown by rcp 2 6 while the maximum increase in tmax was recorded for rcp 8 5 compared to the mean ensemble increase in tmax for the rcps by 2030 2050 and 2090 most of the gcms showed comparable projections table s2 however hadgem2 es showed a negative bias with no change in tmax by 2030 for the rcp 2 6 4 5 and 6 0 in contrast mirocc esm and miroc esm chem projects are comparatively higher than the mean ensemble increase for irrigated conditions the overall behavior of gcms to project tmax for rainfed conditions is similar to irrigated conditions 3 2 minimum temperature for irrigated and rainfed conditions the mean ensemble tmin values for the wheat growing season simulated by marksim were 11 and 7 respectively the long term mean tmin values were 12 and 8 for irrigated and rainfed conditions multi gcm ensemble mean showed tmin would increase for irrigated and rainfed conditions for all simulation years and rcps fig 3c and d the expected increase in tmin for 2030 under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 3 1 3 3 3 1 and 3 5 and 1 4 1 5 1 4 and 1 8 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively in 2050 the increase in mean ensemble tmin anticipated by rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 was 3 4 4 0 3 7 and 3 9 for irrigated conditions and 1 7 2 3 2 0 and 2 9 for rainfed conditions respectively similar to mean ensemble tmax a maximum increase in mean ensemble tmin was observed for 2090 for example the mean ensemble tmin for 2090 for irrigated and rainfed conditions was 3 4 4 8 5 5 and 7 9 and 1 6 3 1 3 9 and 6 3 for rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively in the case of rcps the overall minimum increase in tmin was projected for rcp 2 6 and the maximum increase in tmin was estimated for rcp 8 5 the projected tmin of individual gcms followed a similar trend for tmax the mirocc esm and miroc esm chem generally projected higher differences than the mean ensemble for the irrigated and rainfed sites table s3 3 3 average temperature the average temperature tavg for the wheat growing season for the baseline simulated by marksim for irrigated and rainfed conditions was 15 and 12 respectively the overall increase in tavg by various rcps and simulation years were similar for irrigated and rainfed conditions fig 3e and f the mean ensemble tavg for irrigated conditions predicted an increase by 1 1 1 3 1 0 and 1 4 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by 2030 while for rainfed conditions the projected increase rates were by 1 1 1 2 1 1 and 1 4 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by 2030 however the projected increase by 2050 in mean ensemble tavg under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 1 4 1 9 1 6 and 2 0 and 1 3 1 8 1 6 and 2 3 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively the maximum change in mean ensemble tavg was observed by 2090 where tavg increased by 1 4 2 6 3 1 and 5 1 under irrigated conditions and 1 3 2 5 3 2 and 5 3 under rainfed conditions for respective rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 among rcps the increase in tavg was higher under rcp 4 5 than rcp 6 0 for 2030 and 2050 while for 2090 rcp 6 0 showed a higher increase in tavg than rcp 4 5 the projected tavg of individual gcms rcps and simulation years are shown in table s4 3 4 rainfall marksim accurately simulates baseline year rainfall for irrigated and rainfed areas for instance marksim simulated 95 and 165 mm rainfall for irrigated and rainfed areas respectively compared to the long term average wheat growing season rainfall of 90 and 170 mm for irrigated and rainfed areas for irrigated and rainfed conditions the projected increase or decrease in wheat growing season rainfall estimated by different gcms rcps and the simulation years are presented in table s5 relative to baseline rcp 6 0 projected an increase in mean ensemble rainfall under irrigated conditions by 5 0 1 0 and 3 0 for 2030 2050 and 2090 respectively however under rainfed conditions an increase in mean ensemble rainfall for rcp 2 6 2 0 and 6 0 4 0 was observed by 2090 fig 3g and h in general the mean ensemble rainfall for irrigated conditions projected to decrease by 8 0 5 0 and 2 0 and 11 0 7 0 and 7 0 and 5 0 6 0 and 21 0 for 2030 2050 and 2090 under rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 respectively yet the predicted decrease in mean ensemble rainfall under rainfed conditions was 11 7 0 4 0 and 9 0 and 13 0 5 0 6 0 and 8 0 for 2030 and 2050 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by the end of the century the mean ensemble rainfall was expected to decline by 3 0 and 15 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 3 5 crop phenology the baseline median days from sowing to flowering and physiological maturity for irrigated and rainfed conditions were 107 94 days flowering 117 days 140 130 days maturity 147 days 115 98 days flowering 125 days and 150 days 141 days maturity 159 days respectively fig 4a d the findings suggest that future climate change will significantly impact wheat flowering and maturity days future days to flowering and maturity advanced across irrigated and rainfed conditions in 2030 2050 and 2090 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 for 2030 an overall decrease of 4 in days to flowering and maturity was prophesied which was consistent across all growing conditions and rcps in the case of 2050 the predicted decrease in days to flowering and maturity ranged from 4 to 8 across growing conditions and rcps maximum reduction in days to flowering and maturity was projected for 2090 particularly under rcp 8 5 18 for irrigated and rainfed conditions the decrease in flowering and maturity days simulated with the weather data generated through different gcms was closer to the mean ensemble decrease at both sites tables s6 and s7 nevertheless weather data generated through csiro mk3 6 0 ipsl cm5a lr ipsl cm5a mr miroc esm and miroc esm chem indicate a higher shift in flowering time for all the rcps the miroc esm and miroc esm chem showed higher reductions for all combinations of rcps and simulation years with the highest decrease of 23 and 25 for rcp 8 5 by 2090 3 6 grain yield the median wheat grain yield simulated by the dssat ceres wheat for the baseline year under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 4 0 and 3 4 t ha 1 this study s mean ensemble of 17 gcms shows a general trend of declining grain yield compared to baseline across growing conditions fig 5a and b compared to baseline increased grain yields were projected for irrigated conditions by 2050 under rcp 8 5 8 and by 2090 under rcp 6 0 5 in 2030 the yield will likely decrease 5 8 7 and 5 and 10 15 19 and 15 for irrigated and rainfed conditions under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by 2050 grain yields under irrigated conditions were projected to decline by 8 7 and 2 under rcp 2 6 4 5 and 6 0 respectively while grain yields under rainfed conditions were projected to decline by 27 18 16 and 17 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 for 2090 compared to baseline the simulated yield declined by 11 9 and 19 under irrigated conditions for rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 respectively while grain yield was reduced by 9 30 9 and 30 under rainfed conditions for rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by 2090 the predictions made by dssat ceres wheat vary considerably among the gcms for both areas table s8 compared to the mean ensemble projections for wheat yield for the irrigated conditions the deviations either positive or negative are generally higher for bcc csm 1 1 m fio esm gfdl esm2g gfdl esm2m ipsl cm5a lr ipsl cm5a mr miroc esm and noresm1 m however the projections vary among the simulation years and rcps depending on a gcm to predict daily rainfall patterns for different rcps and simulation years the simulated yield at the rainfed conditions was highly variable among the gcms generally higher deviations from the mean ensemble are projected for bcc csm 1 1 m fio esm gfdl esm2g gfdl esm2m miroc esm miroc esm chem and mri cgcm3 3 7 crop evapotranspiration the baseline median wheat crop etc for irrigated and rainfed conditions was 226 mm 194 mm etc 276 mm and 184 mm 112 mm etc 254 mm respectively considering the baseline wheat growing season etc simulated by dssat ceres wheat using mean ensemble weather data of 17 gcms for different rcps and simulated years also indicated a decreasing trend under irrigated fig 5c and rainfed conditions fig 5d however the likely decline in etc was higher for the rainfed conditions than irrigated conditions the projected reduction in etc by 2030 for irrigated and rainfed conditions was 3 5 6 and 4 and 15 10 9 and 15 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively similarly by 2050 the anticipated decrease in etc for irrigated and rainfed conditions under respective rcp of 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 was 5 7 3 and 3 and 15 17 13 and 15 the highest reduction in etc was forecasted by the end of the century where etc reduction under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 5 9 4 and 27 and 7 21 11 and 27 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively comparing the individual gcms csiro mk3 6 0 fio esm gfdl esm2g gfdl esm2m miroc esm miroc esm chem and miroc5 indicated much higher or lower than mean ensemble etc values for different combinations of rcps and simulation years for the irrigated

projected for bcc csm 1 1 m gfdl esm2g hadgem2 es miroc esm miroc esm chem miroc5 mri cgcm3 and noresm1 m table s9 3 8 water use efficiency the baseline median wue for irrigated and rainfed conditions was 18 kg ha 1mm 1 13 kg ha 1 mm 1 wue 22 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 11 kg ha 1 mm 1 wue 26 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively compared to the baseline the mean ensemble wue by the year 2030 would be similar to the baseline 1 to 2 for all the rcps for irrigated conditions fig 5e the mean ensemble wue relative to the baseline is likely to decrease for almost all rcps by 2030 under rainfed conditions fig 5f by 2050 irrigated conditions showed a projected increase in wue by 3 and 12 under rcp 6 0 and 8 5 while showing a decline in wue by 2 under rcp 2 6 the anticipated increase in wue under rcp 8 5 was about 4 for rainfed conditions whereas rcp 2 6 4 5 and 6 0 predicted a decline by 8 10 and 2 respectively by 2050 an increasing trend in wue by 2090 was estimated for irrigated conditions under rcp 4 5 2 6 0 13 and 8 5 7 but rcp 2 6 showed a likely decrease in wue by 5 for rainfed conditions only rcp 6 0 9 showed an increase in wue and a decline in wue was likely under rcp 2 6 7 4 5 3 and 8 5 2 at the end of the century percent change in the wue concerning baseline simulated by dssat ceres wheat for different gcms ipcc cmip5 rcps and simulation years under irrigated and rainfed conditions are shown in table s10 4 discussion generally the mean air temperatures will increase continually over the 21st century provided appropriate mitigation strategies to limit greenhouse gas emissions are devised and implemented ipcc 2018 the mean ensemble increase in tmax tmin and tavg for both study sites irrigated and rainfed under different rcps followed a similar trend as the projected atmospheric co2 concentration although the range of projected increase is relatively more extensive among the gcms there is a strong agreement across all the gcms regarding temperature increase at both the representative sites the projections for global mean surface temperature collins et al 2013 under the assumptions of the ipcc rcps show that compared to 1986 2005 global mean surface temperature by the mid century 2046 2065 is likely to increase by 0 4 1 6 with multi model mean 1 0 0 3 for the rcp 2 6 0 9 2 0 1 4 0 3 for the rcp 4 5 0 8 1 8 1 3 0 3 for the rcp 6 0 and 1 4 2 6 2 0 0 4 for the rcp 8 5 the results of tavg in the present study with 1 4 1 9 1 6 and 2 0 increase for irrigated conditions and 1 3 1 8 1 6 and 2 3 for rainfed conditions by the year 2050 in the respective rcps of 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 generally fall within limits mentioned above by 2090 the wheat growing season mean ensemble tavg is likely to be 1 4 2 6 3 1 and 5 1 for irrigated conditions and 1 3 2 5 3 2 and 5 3 for rainfed conditions respective rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 the projected values are within limits described by collins et al 2013 for the end century 2081 2100 projections of 0 3 1 7 1 0 0 4 1 1 2 6 c 1 8 0 5 1 4 3 1 2 2 0 5 and 2 6 4 8 3 7 0 7 increase for the rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively however the projected values in the present study for the rcp 8 5 by the year 2090 were slightly higher by 0 3 and 0 4 for irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively the apparent reason for such higher projections is associated with the biases of participating gcms in this study most of the gcms projected closer to the mean ensemble values of tmax tmin and tavg conversely irrespective of rcp and simulation year miroc esm miroc esm chem and gfdl cm3 generally project a higher increase in the temperature for both study sites these results are by the findings of mcsweeney et al 2015 mentioning implausible with significantly biased behavior of these gcms with the projections outside the range of the majority of the ensemble earlier studies gop 2010 salma et al 2012 indicated that precipitation is likely to increase in summer and decrease in winter in pakistan however there is a strong agreement across all the gcms regarding reducing rainfall trends at the study sites with a higher spread similar to the mean ensemble temperature conditions bcc csm 1 1 m gfdl cm3 hadgem2 es miroc esm miroc esm chem miroc5 and noresm1 m generally project higher differences relative to the mean ensemble rainfall for both the study site mcsweeney et al 2015 also indicated that for the southeast asian region miroc esm miroc esm chem noresm 1 m in particular hadgem2 es to a lesser extent have too strong easterly component rather than southern thus producing significant biases they also characterized the gcms to predict future climatologies and concluded that miroc esm miroc esm chem and ipsl cm5a lr have implausible whereas nor esm1 m ipsl cm5a mr and csiro mk3 6 0 have significant biases in their projections however the performance of different gcms may vary concerning study sites crop phenology is a crucial indicator for assessing the impact of climate change on crops hernandez ochoa et al 2018 increasing co2 levels in different rcps may advance or delay phenological developments through experimental evidence that shows no consistent dimensions asshoff et al 2006 however higher growing season temperature on phenology usually results in faster growth rates and shorter growing and reproductive seasons zhao et al 2017 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 the dssat ceres wheat simulated mean ensemble duration of the crop growing season of spring wheat in this study also showed a similar trend of shortening growing cycle ranging from 4 22 days for the irrigated conditions and 6 25 days for rainfed conditions in different rcps and simulation years the analysis of these scenarios also predicted that anthesis would occur earlier for both irrigated 4 20 days and rainfed conditions 5 23 days wheat fixes atmospheric co2 through the c3 photosynthetic pathway thus increased co2 concentrations promote rubisco activities however adverse effects may also be evident in some cases as the higher co2 concentrations may cause photosynthetic acclimation a phenomenon driven by the accumulation of non structural carbohydrates causing suppression of photosynthetic genes walters 2005 zhu et al 2012 the photosynthesis stimulation due to increased atmospheric co2 concentrations would be sufficient to enhance crop growth evident from higher vegetative and reproductive yield walters 2005 a higher temperature may affect crop growing season length and phenological developments which are critical factors for wheat yield zhao et al 2017 short heat stresses at post anthesis period may reduce wheat grain weight osman et al 2020 resulting in lower yield hernandez ochoa et al 2018 also indicated that a moderate rise in temperature conditions could offset the benefits imparted by higher co2 on wheat yield increased co2 levels on crop yield under un stressed water and nutrient supply near the current ambient temperature conditions are reported to increase crop growth and yield through increased co2 assimilation rate wang et al 2012 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 however the interactive impact of temperature and elevated co2 could affect multiple processes like photosynthesis respiration vegetative growth and yield morison and lawlor 1999 the growth rate and development may increase at higher temperatures and co2 concentration bunce 1998 yang et al 2014 in cooler environments and the temperature increase within the threshold limits of the crop in tropic and sub tropic regions crop production is carried out in an already stressed environment as higher increased temperature may contribute towards accelerated senescence shortening of grain filling duration early maturity and consequently decreased biomass production and yield hanson et al 2007 deryng et al 2014 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 in the present study the projected temperature increase is expected to negatively affect the wheat crop yield in pakistan which is already grown under an early and late season heat stressed environment comparatively rapid development exposes the crop to terminal heat stress resulting in reduced yield the wue is subjected to change by local weather conditions which vary spatially and temporally within the boundaries of a particular climatic zone therefore expected shifts within these boundaries during the next 100 years will affect the sustainability of current cropping systems the increase in temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration can affect plant water relationship generally referred to as etc in the present study a linear trend of higher reduction in etc at higher co2 levels was evident for irrigated conditions it is reported that increased atmospheric co2 concentrations may reduce stomatal conductance thereby reducing the transpiration component of total etc lammertsma et al 2011 wang et al 2012 a higher crop growth rate leads to early plant canopy development thus reducing soil evaporation in the early phases of crop growth the reduction in transpiration and evaporation is expected to lower crop water demand simulations made with dssat ceres wheat showed that increased atmospheric co2 concentration and temperature conditions lead to lower seasonal etc possibly due to shifts in crop phenology enhanced crop development and accelerated crop senescence such reduction in etc likely represents higher wue in future climate change scenarios however the gain in wue is associated with a higher reduction in wheat yield the multi crop model ensemble can be employed to attain accurate and consistent crop growth and yield dynamics martre et al 2015 a multi model ensemble simulation can be produced by averaging the simulations of all models weighted equally and to produce better estimates than an individual model recent studies by ding et al 2021 kheir et al 2021 2022 used three crop models ceres wheat n wheat and wheat crop sim to simulate wheat yield and water productivity however these studies did not consider the impact of future climate change the limitations of our study are that we used only one crop model dssat ceres wheat to simulate future weather data from cmip5 multi climate models using one genotype therefore future research should consider the multi genotype and crop climate models particularly future weather data from cmip6 to simulate the impact of future climate change on wheat productivity 5 conclusion the projected climatic conditions are expected to prevail under ipcc rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 by 2030 2050 and 2090 suggesting the warming trends at the study sites the mean ensemble of 17 gcms projects that the average wheat growing season temperature may increase from a lower value of 1 to the highest 5 depending on the rcp the rainfall from the western disturbance received during the wheat growing season also shows a decreasing tendency these projections negatively affected wheat yield through heat stress and reduced growing season length dssat ceres wheat projected a 2 19 yield decrease under irrigated conditions and 9 30 under rainfed conditions between 2030 and 2090 changes in rainfall and temperature will determine yield decline in the rainfed system however in the irrigated system only the temperature changes will determine the potential yield loss depending on the availability of irrigation water supplies reducing the overall crop growing cycle due to temperature increase and lower transpiration rate due to higher co2 levels may result in lower crop water demands and higher crop water productivity nevertheless such productivity gains are not economical due to the relatively higher yield decline foreseen under future climate change scenarios further studies using multi model ensemble simulation with different cultivars management practices and gcms from cmip6 are needed to determine the impact of future climate change on wheat growth and productivity declaration of

production is reported to be significantly impacted by future climate change in major cropping systems worldwide in the present study ten experiments were conducted under irrigated 2007 2013 and

rcps co2 concentration and future periods a general reduction in wheat phenology grain yield etc and wue was anticipated however higher co2 concentration and early maturity improved the wue of wheat under irrigated and rainfed conditions nevertheless this gain in wue was at the cost of a relatively higher yield loss wheat yield is expected to decline by 2 19 and 9 30 under irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively by aggregating the simulated future climate change impacts across gcms and rcps adaptation strategies to mitigate the climate change impacts on wheat production in irrigated and rainfed areas will be required our findings will serve as a foundation for designing future climate change adaptation strategies to sustain wheat production in pakistan s irrigated and rainfed

introduction the ever growing global population and highly unpredictable climate are humanity s most significant challenges for food security in the 21st century climate change associated with extreme temperatures and increasingly unreliable rainfall events will affect wheat the second most widely consumed cereal crop worldwide asseng et al 2015 the increasing global affluence also challenges crop production by increasing the demand for high quality food feed and fiber although elevated co2 may benefit wheat growth and productivity in a few wheat producing countries in the future yet under an ample supply of nitrogen and water hernandez ochoa et al 2018 conversely wheat yields are projected to decline in most wheat growing countries asseng et al 2015 osman et al 2022 2022 the anticipated increase in global temperature by 1 4 by 2100 zhao et al 2017 ipcc 2018 leads to a further decline in wheat yields climate change affects wheat growth and productivity due to its adverse impacts on plant physiological processes such as crop evapotranspiration etc and water use efficiency wue zhao et al 2017 paymard et al 2019 global wheat yields would decrease by 6 0 2 9 with a one degree rise in global temperature zhao et al 2017 a decrease in grain yield and wue accompanied by increased crop water requirement under future climate change has been reported in iran paymard et al 2019 a significant decline in simulated yield in irrigated wheat under various climate change scenarios has been reported due to increased etc under hot and dry conditions hussain et al 2020 one degree rise in temperature above the threshold 30 causes a 0 3 0 58 decrease in grain filling duration in irrigated wheat liu et al 2016 a decline in rainfed wheat grain yield by 60 due to a 0 5 rise in temperature has also been reported ahmed et al 2016 however most of the findings are based on short term experiments with little or no attempts to use crop models to simulate climate change impacts under irrigated and rainfed conditions crop models such as apsim wheat zheng et al 2014 cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 dssat ceres wheat hoogenboom et al 2019 dssat nwheat kassie et al 2016 stics brisson et al 2003 and wofost van diepen et al 1989 has been widely used as an informative tool for visualizing growth simulations under various climate change scenarios however dssat ceres wheat hoogenboom et al 2019 is the most widely used crop growth model to quantify the effects of genotype climate soil and management on the growth and development of wheat under rainfed and irrigated cropping systems worldwide basso et al 2016 apsim wheat and nwheat also employ the exact mechanism and algorithms of ceres wheat with few modifications similarly the future climatic conditions generated from globalgeneral ccirculation mmodels gcms of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 are incorporated into crop simulation models to investigate the impact of climate change on crop growth and productivity hussain et al 2020 osman et al 2022 the cmip5 provides the gcm outputs under four greenhouse gases ghg concentration pathways based on 2100 radiative forcing values the cmip6 has also been recently released to represent better physical processes at more minor scales riahi et al 2017 however cmip6 has not yet been incorporated in weather generators such as marksim and lars wg the gcms contain high uncertainties than representative concentration pathways rcps and crop models zhang et al 2018 a recent study using five gcms under rcp 8 5 showed a 19 8 and 24 9 decline in wheat yield under irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively hussain et al 2020 osman et al 2022 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 anticipated a 6 9 for rcp 4 5 and 7 9 for rcp 8 5 decline in wheat yield using five gcms for mexico however past studies employed few gcms or applied incremental change in co2 rainfall and temperature to quantify future climate change effects on wheat production ahmed et al 2016 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 hussain et al 2020 multi gcms and rcps can play a decisive role in minimizing the uncertainties associated with future climate change and its impacts on crop production and builds confidence in quantification results pakistan ranked 5th among the world s most vulnerable countries to climate change evidenced by warming trends and altered rainfall patterns stocker 2014 the significant year to year variations in weather conditions driven by climate change negatively impact wheat growth and productivity osman et al 2021 the increased occurrence of prolonged droughts uneven monsoon rainfall and high temperature 40 and 45 has made rainfed cropping systems more vulnerable to climate change mainly due to anticipated combined drought and heat stresses zahid and rasul 2012 abbas et al 2014 ahmed et al 2022 therefore it is imperative to quantify the effects of future climate change on wheat growth and productivity on spatial and temporal scales for a sustained national and global food supply in the present study we employed the rcps of 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 for early 2030s mid 2050s and late 2090s periods in 21st century to predict the impacts of increased atmospheric co2 and temperature on wheat phenology yield etc and wue under irrigated and rainfed cropping systems of pakistan compared with baseline the findings of this study will serve as a foundation for designing future climate change adaptation strategies to sustain wheat production in pakistan s irrigated and rainfed cropping systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites field experiments were conducted over 6 years 2007 2013 at the nuclear institute for agriculture and biology niab faisalabad pakistan 31 23 n 73 2 e under irrigated conditions and for 4 years 2010 2014 at the barani agricultural research institute bari chakwal 32 55 n 72 43 e pakistan under rainfed conditions fig 1 table 1 the experimental sites have a semi arid subtropical climate with an annual rainfall of 250 mm and 500 1000 mm in irrigated and rainfed areas respectively the range of daily maximum tmax and minimum tmin temperatures under irrigated and rainfed experimental sites were 12 to 50 0 3 to 34 and from 3 to 47 and 6 to 38 respectively the long term weather data for tmax tmin rainfall and solar radiation were collected from the pakistan meteorological department 1974 2013 and the soil and water conservation research institute weather station 1984 2014 for irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively the mean cropping season tmax tmin and rainfall for the irrigated and rainfed experimental sites were 26 11 92 mm and 22 9 250 mm respectively fig 2 the daily meteorological conditions were observed using davis instrument model vantage pro 2 installed at the experimental sites the soils in irrigated and rainfed areas were classified as luvisol and cambisols after the world reference base 2006 classification with loamy and sandy loam textures respectively details of physicochemical soil properties are presented in table s1 2 2 experimental design the most widely grown spring wheat cultivar sehar 2006 origin advanced line from cimmyt pedigree cmss95y00645 100y 200 m 17y 10 m 0y 0pak in the regions was used to conduct experiments under irrigated and rainfed conditions sowing was conducted between the second and third weeks of november under irrigated conditions and between the 1st and 3rd weeks of october and november under rainfed conditions the experiments were performed in a randomized complete block design the plot size both under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 0 54 ha growing conditions such as irrigated and rainfed as well as growing seasons were considered as treatments details of the experimental design for the irrigated and rainfed conditions can be found in ishaque et al 2020 and hafiza et al 2022 in all experiments fungicide treated seeds 125 kg ha 1 having 90 germination were planted at a depth of 4 5 cm in soil with a row row spacing of 15 cm and 25 cm with a tractor mounted seed drill under irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively nutrient requirements were measured based on soil analysis and were satisfactorily met with fertilizer applications for irrigated conditions sufficient nitrogen urea 150 kg ha 1 and phosphorous p2o5 100 kg ha 1 were applied evenly to the field and incorporated to a soil depth of 20 cm during seedbed preparation in the case of rainfed conditions p2o5 was applied at 70 kg ha 1 while urea was split into two equal portions 50 kg ha 1 was applied at sowing and 50 kg ha 1 was applied in january subsequently after rainfall water for irrigation was stored in a tank 4 m 4 m 2 m and pumped via a pipeline to ensure complete and uniform coverage distribution of water among the sub plots a flow meter was connected between the pump and the delivery pipeline to determine the amount of water applied pre sowing irrigation of 75 mm was applied uniformly to all plots about 10 15 days before seedbed preparation in irrigated areas irrigation was applied when 50 of the field capacity s moisture was depleted from 0 to 100 cm soil depth the soil moisture was monitored throughout the growing season using a neutron moisture meter irrigation was ceased by the second week of march to allow the soil to dry out to avoid delayed crop maturity 2 3 measurements and sampling the wheat phenology was observed using the zadoks scale crop growth and development stages were recorded with 50 of the plants exhibiting visual signs of the stage in question the phenological phases were recorded such as emergence onset and termination of anthesis senescence and maturity after emergence twenty plants were tagged in each of the three replications crop growth was measured by harvesting a randomly selected 1 m2 area from each replicate weekly or fortnightly following seedling emergence and drying to a constant weight at 70 for 48 h almost no pest and disease infestations were observed yet the application of herbicides effectively controlled weeds photographs were captured at 1 1 5 m over the canopy to cover a fair number of wheat plants to calculate in season canopy growth and development the photos were captured between 12 00 13 30 and digitized using image j image j https imagej nih gov ij for canopy cover measurements the model predicted leaf area index for wheat was transformed to canopy cover using empirical data and a similar regression relationship as by hsiao et al 2009 1 cc 94 1 exp 0 43 lai 0 52 total aboveground biomass and grain yield were calculated after harvesting at physiological maturity the etc was calculated as follows allen et al 1998 2 et c p r d s ini s end where p r and d represent rainfall runoff and drainage below the root zone while sini and send are the soil moisture storage at the start and end of the crop growing season respectively the runoff was prevented by making bunds around each replicate 30 m 30 m of the experimental field 0 54 ha d was calculated by measuring soil water content in different soil layers after rainfall and data on soil moisture indicated no deep drainage losses the wue was determined as follows 3 wue total grain yield crop evapotranspiration et c during the growing season 2 4 dssat ceres wheat the dssat ceres wheat hoogenboom et al 2019 is one of the world s most widely used crop models ceres wheat is a process based model which simulates crop development as a response to crop genetics environmental conditions atmospheric co2 soil and weather and management strategies it has been tested at several sites in the world hernandez ochoa et al 2018 osman et al 2020 most of the ceres wheat model evaluation studies focused on mean and extreme temperatures sowing dates cultivars water conditions planting densities and nitrogen application rates ahmed et al 2016 hussain et al 2018 osman et al 2020 2 5 model calculation of evapotranspiration dssat ceres wheat soil water balance is a function of soil water quantity resulting from the inputs of irrigation and precipitation the outputs of evaporation from plants and the soil runoff and drainage the soil water balance in the model is distributed in up to ten layers the water content of any particular soil layer can decrease as a consequence of soil evaporation root absorption or water flow to an adjacent layer various methods such as furrow drip trickle sprinkler and flood are available in dssat ceres wheat to simulate the irrigation the soil water balance subroutine requires calculating potential evaporation from the soil and plant surfaces dssat ceres wheat can employ the priestley taylor pt or penman monteith fao56 pm methods to calculate potential evapotranspiration and later method was employed in this study dssat ceres wheat measures albedo from growth stages leaf area index and temperature dependent constants to account for the effects of unsaturated air radiation and advection of potential evapotranspiration in the case of the pm equation however the model calculates reference evapotranspiration from the fao version of the penman equation which requires vapor pressure deficit and wind speed to calculate potential evapotranspiration from the pm equation 2 6 calibration and validation of the model model calibration and model evaluation were carried out using independent observed experimental datasets the model was calibrated by regulating only cultivar parameters using in season data samples from optimum irrigated treatments from three consecutive cropping seasons from 2007 to 2010 the model was calibrated following boote 1999 approach to calibration calibration started with the fundamental cultivar coefficient information provided by the dssat ceres wheat model hoogenboom et al 2013 sequential modifications initializing with phenology data viz anthesis and maturity dates followed by crop growth and development parameters accumulated aboveground biomass of each cropping season leaf area final aboveground biomass and grain yield at harvest were made the model parameters were fine tuned by reducing the percentage deviation root mean square error normalized root mean square error and increasing index of agreement between the model s observed and simulated data the calibrated model was then validated using independent datasets from the consecutive growing seasons from 2010 to 2013 for irrigated conditions and 2010 2014 for rainfed conditions the details of model calibration and validation for irrigated and rainfed areas are discussed elsewhere in the literature ishaque et al 2020 hafiza et al 2022 2 7 generating long term daily weather data crop growth models evaluate risk and decision making for risk management and thus require accurate reliable weather information for robust simulations van wart et al 2013 for the baseline period 2010 marksim generated the required weather data tmax tmin solar radiation and rainfall which was then validated by observed weather data gathered from synoptic weather stations generally the availability of the historical weather data in developing countries are limited which limits the options for the researchers to use specific weather generators for crop growth model execution despite being the most advanced available tool to projects into the future the gcms are never in a form that can be directly used to run the crop growth models jones and thornton 2013 these models have become an essential tool for understanding climate change processes despite their uncertainties terray and boé 2013 the output of the mean ensemble of gcms might be used to obtain reliable estimates ma et al 2021 it will annul the individual gcm biases resulting in decreased uncertainty however the multi model ensemble might not cover the whole uncertainty range and some biases may persist tebaldi and knutti 2007 nevertheless other studies suggested that a multi gcm mean is likely to produce improved results than a single model simulation hagedorn et al 2005 ma et al 2021 the current study used marksim to downscale and generate future weather data such as tmax tmin solar radiation and rainfall marksim is a weather generator widely used to generate daily weather data for crop yield simulations claessens et al 2012 marksim v 2 which included the data from 17 individual gcms provided by the agweathernet awn program of washington state university usa was used in this study version 2 of the marksim has a new feature to select any combination of the 17 gcms i e either one all or any desired combination selection can also be made for low moderate and high emission rcps jones 2013 in this study daily weather data for each rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 and for each study year 2030 2050 and 2090 was generated using all the gcms and their mean ensemble in 99 replicates for both the study locations under irrigated and rainfed conditions 2 8 seasonal analysis using dssat ceres wheat the quantitative measurement of crop performance under changing climatic conditions can only be estimated through controlled experiments it is rarely possible to perform such experiments particularly for the time and spatial scales of interest numeric or eco physiological models are a dominant alternative tool in which controlled experiments can be performed in isolation at any scale to estimate the variables which cannot be directly measured based on the recommendations on model selection for climate change impact assessment and adaptation research by white and hoogenboom 2010 and the statistics representing particular model s used by the researchers in different geographic regions dssat ceres wheat was selected for this study the environmental modifications options within the model allow simulation of future climate change scenarios by modifying up to eight environmental variables including day length h solar radiation mjm 2day 1 tmax tmin precipitation mm co2 ppm relative humidity and wind speed km day 1 however in the present study the data of tmax tmin solar radiation and rainfall for different rcps and simulation years was generated using the marksim weather generator while the co2 concentrations corresponding to the rcps and simulation years table 2 were obtained from international institute for applied system analysis and values were changed in the environmental modifications the flood irrigation mm approach was employed to simulate irrigation for baseline and future climate change scenarios under irrigated conditions the automatic irrigation method was used to trigger irrigation when 50 of moisture was depleted 3 results 3 1 maximum temperature the multi gcm ensemble mean tmax for the wheat growing season simulated by marksim under irrigated and rainfed conditions for the baseline year 2010 was 24 4 and 21 respectively while the mean long term growing season tmax was 25 and 21 for irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively relative to baseline mean ensemble tmax values for wheat growing seasons under irrigated fig 3a and rainfed fig 3b conditions were expected to rise by 1 4 1 6 1 3 and 1 7 c and 1 5 1 8 1 4 and 1 8 c under rcps of 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by 2030 for mid century 2050 the expected increase in mean ensemble tmax under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 1 8 2 5 2 0 and 2 5 and 1 9 2 6 2 1 and 3 1 for rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively at the end of the century 2090 a maximum increase in mean ensemble tmax for the wheat growing season is likely to occur the projected mean ensemble increase in tmax for 2090 under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 1 8 3 4 4 0 and 6 5 and 2 0 3 5 4 3 and 7 0 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively the minimum increase in mean ensemble tmax was shown by rcp 2 6 while the maximum increase in tmax was recorded for rcp 8 5 compared to the mean ensemble increase in tmax for the rcps by 2030 2050 and 2090 most of the gcms showed comparable projections table s2 however hadgem2 es showed a negative bias with no change in tmax by 2030 for the rcp 2 6 4 5 and 6 0 in contrast mirocc esm and miroc esm chem projects are comparatively higher than the mean ensemble increase for irrigated conditions the overall behavior of gcms to project tmax for rainfed conditions is similar to irrigated conditions 3 2 minimum temperature for irrigated and rainfed conditions the mean ensemble tmin values for the wheat growing season simulated by marksim were 11 and 7 respectively the long term mean tmin values were 12 and 8 for irrigated and rainfed conditions multi gcm ensemble mean showed tmin would increase for irrigated and rainfed conditions for all simulation years and rcps fig 3c and d the expected increase in tmin for 2030 under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 3 1 3 3 3 1 and 3 5 and 1 4 1 5 1 4 and 1 8 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively in 2050 the increase in mean ensemble tmin anticipated by rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 was 3 4 4 0 3 7 and 3 9 for irrigated conditions and 1 7 2 3 2 0 and 2 9 for rainfed conditions respectively similar to mean ensemble tmax a maximum increase in mean ensemble tmin was observed for 2090 for example the mean ensemble tmin for 2090 for irrigated and rainfed conditions was 3 4 4 8 5 5 and 7 9 and 1 6 3 1 3 9 and 6 3 for rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively in the case of rcps the overall minimum increase in tmin was projected for rcp 2 6 and the maximum increase in tmin was estimated for rcp 8 5 the projected tmin of individual gcms followed a similar trend for tmax the mirocc esm and miroc esm chem generally projected higher differences than the mean ensemble for the irrigated and rainfed sites table s3 3 3 average temperature the average temperature tavg for the wheat growing season for the baseline simulated by marksim for irrigated and rainfed conditions was 15 and 12 respectively the overall increase in tavg by various rcps and simulation years were similar for irrigated and rainfed conditions fig 3e and f the mean ensemble tavg for irrigated conditions predicted an increase by 1 1 1 3 1 0 and 1 4 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by 2030 while for rainfed conditions the projected increase rates were by 1 1 1 2 1 1 and 1 4 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by 2030 however the projected increase by 2050 in mean ensemble tavg under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 1 4 1 9 1 6 and 2 0 and 1 3 1 8 1 6 and 2 3 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively the maximum change in mean ensemble tavg was observed by 2090 where tavg increased by 1 4 2 6 3 1 and 5 1 under irrigated conditions and 1 3 2 5 3 2 and 5 3 under rainfed conditions for respective rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 among rcps the increase in tavg was higher under rcp 4 5 than rcp 6 0 for 2030 and 2050 while for 2090 rcp 6 0 showed a higher increase in tavg than rcp 4 5 the projected tavg of individual gcms rcps and simulation years are shown in table s4 3 4 rainfall marksim accurately simulates baseline year rainfall for irrigated and rainfed areas for instance marksim simulated 95 and 165 mm rainfall for irrigated and rainfed areas respectively compared to the long term average wheat growing season rainfall of 90 and 170 mm for irrigated and rainfed areas for irrigated and rainfed conditions the projected increase or decrease in wheat growing season rainfall estimated by different gcms rcps and the simulation years are presented in table s5 relative to baseline rcp 6 0 projected an increase in mean ensemble rainfall under irrigated conditions by 5 0 1 0 and 3 0 for 2030 2050 and 2090 respectively however under rainfed conditions an increase in mean ensemble rainfall for rcp 2 6 2 0 and 6 0 4 0 was observed by 2090 fig 3g and h in general the mean ensemble rainfall for irrigated conditions projected to decrease by 8 0 5 0 and 2 0 and 11 0 7 0 and 7 0 and 5 0 6 0 and 21 0 for 2030 2050 and 2090 under rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 respectively yet the predicted decrease in mean ensemble rainfall under rainfed conditions was 11 7 0 4 0 and 9 0 and 13 0 5 0 6 0 and 8 0 for 2030 and 2050 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by the end of the century the mean ensemble rainfall was expected to decline by 3 0 and 15 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 3 5 crop phenology the baseline median days from sowing to flowering and physiological maturity for irrigated and rainfed conditions were 107 94 days flowering 117 days 140 130 days maturity 147 days 115 98 days flowering 125 days and 150 days 141 days maturity 159 days respectively fig 4a d the findings suggest that future climate change will significantly impact wheat flowering and maturity days future days to flowering and maturity advanced across irrigated and rainfed conditions in 2030 2050 and 2090 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 for 2030 an overall decrease of 4 in days to flowering and maturity was prophesied which was consistent across all growing conditions and rcps in the case of 2050 the predicted decrease in days to flowering and maturity ranged from 4 to 8 across growing conditions and rcps maximum reduction in days to flowering and maturity was projected for 2090 particularly under rcp 8 5 18 for irrigated and rainfed conditions the decrease in flowering and maturity days simulated with the weather data generated through different gcms was closer to the mean ensemble decrease at both sites tables s6 and s7 nevertheless weather data generated through csiro mk3 6 0 ipsl cm5a lr ipsl cm5a mr miroc esm and miroc esm chem indicate a higher shift in flowering time for all the rcps the miroc esm and miroc esm chem showed higher reductions for all combinations of rcps and simulation years with the highest decrease of 23 and 25 for rcp 8 5 by 2090 3 6 grain yield the median wheat grain yield simulated by the dssat ceres wheat for the baseline year under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 4 0 and 3 4 t ha 1 this study s mean ensemble of 17 gcms shows a general trend of declining grain yield compared to baseline across growing conditions fig 5a and b compared to baseline increased grain yields were projected for irrigated conditions by 2050 under rcp 8 5 8 and by 2090 under rcp 6 0 5 in 2030 the yield will likely decrease 5 8 7 and 5 and 10 15 19 and 15 for irrigated and rainfed conditions under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by 2050 grain yields under irrigated conditions were projected to decline by 8 7 and 2 under rcp 2 6 4 5 and 6 0 respectively while grain yields under rainfed conditions were projected to decline by 27 18 16 and 17 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 for 2090 compared to baseline the simulated yield declined by 11 9 and 19 under irrigated conditions for rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 respectively while grain yield was reduced by 9 30 9 and 30 under rainfed conditions for rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively by 2090 the predictions made by dssat ceres wheat vary considerably among the gcms for both areas table s8 compared to the mean ensemble projections for wheat yield for the irrigated conditions the deviations either positive or negative are generally higher for bcc csm 1 1 m fio esm gfdl esm2g gfdl esm2m ipsl cm5a lr ipsl cm5a mr miroc esm and noresm1 m however the projections vary among the simulation years and rcps depending on a gcm to predict

different rcps and simulated years also indicated a decreasing trend under irrigated fig 5c and rainfed conditions fig 5d however the likely decline in etc was higher for the rainfed conditions than irrigated conditions the projected reduction in etc by 2030 for irrigated and rainfed conditions was 3 5 6 and 4 and 15 10 9 and 15 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively similarly by 2050 the anticipated decrease in etc for irrigated and rainfed conditions under respective rcp of 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 was 5 7 3 and 3 and 15 17 13 and 15 the highest reduction in etc was forecasted by the end of the century where etc reduction under irrigated and rainfed conditions was 5 9 4 and 27 and 7 21 11 and 27 under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively comparing the individual gcms csiro mk3 6 0 fio

conditions fig 5f by 2050 irrigated conditions showed a projected increase in wue by 3 and 12 under rcp 6 0 and 8 5 while showing a decline in wue by 2 under rcp 2 6 the anticipated increase in wue under rcp 8 5 was about 4 for rainfed conditions whereas rcp 2 6 4 5 and 6 0 predicted a decline by 8 10 and 2 respectively by 2050 an increasing trend in wue by 2090 was estimated for irrigated conditions under rcp 4 5 2 6 0 13 and 8 5 7 but rcp 2 6 showed a likely decrease in wue by 5 for rainfed conditions only rcp 6 0 9 showed an increase in wue and a decline in wue was likely under rcp 2 6 7 4 5 3 and 8 5 2 at the end of the century percent change in the wue concerning baseline simulated by dssat ceres wheat for different gcms ipcc cmip5 rcps and simulation years under irrigated and rainfed conditions are shown in table s10 4 discussion generally the mean air temperatures will increase continually over the 21st century provided appropriate mitigation strategies to limit greenhouse gas emissions are devised and implemented ipcc 2018 the mean ensemble increase in tmax tmin and tavg for both study sites irrigated and rainfed under different rcps followed a similar trend as the projected atmospheric co2 concentration although the range of projected increase is relatively more extensive among the gcms there is a strong agreement across all the gcms regarding temperature increase at both the representative sites the projections for global mean surface temperature collins et al 2013 under the assumptions of the ipcc rcps show that compared to 1986 2005 global mean surface temperature by the mid century 2046 2065 is likely to increase by 0 4 1 6 with multi model mean 1 0 0 3 for the rcp 2 6 0 9 2 0 1 4 0 3 for the rcp 4 5 0 8 1 8 1 3 0 3 for the rcp 6 0 and 1 4 2 6 2 0 0 4 for the rcp 8 5 the results of tavg in the present study with 1 4 1 9 1 6 and 2 0 increase for irrigated conditions and 1 3 1 8 1 6 and 2 3 for rainfed conditions by the year 2050 in the respective rcps of 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 generally fall within limits mentioned above by 2090 the wheat growing season mean ensemble tavg is likely to be 1 4 2 6 3 1 and 5 1 for irrigated conditions and 1 3 2 5 3 2 and 5 3 for rainfed conditions respective rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 the projected values are within limits described by collins et al 2013 for the end century 2081 2100 projections of 0 3 1 7 1 0 0 4 1 1 2 6 c 1 8 0 5 1 4 3 1 2 2 0 5 and 2 6 4 8 3 7 0 7 increase for the rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 respectively however the projected values in the present study for the rcp 8 5 by the year 2090 were slightly higher by 0 3 and 0 4 for irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively the apparent reason for such higher projections is associated with the biases of participating gcms in this study most of the gcms projected closer to the mean ensemble values of tmax tmin and tavg conversely irrespective of rcp and simulation year miroc esm miroc esm chem and gfdl cm3 generally project a higher increase in the temperature for both study sites these results are by the findings of mcsweeney et al 2015 mentioning implausible with significantly biased behavior of these gcms with the projections outside the range of the majority of the ensemble earlier studies gop 2010 salma et al 2012 indicated that precipitation is likely to increase in summer and decrease in winter in pakistan however there is a strong agreement across all the gcms regarding reducing rainfall trends at the study sites with a higher spread similar to the mean ensemble temperature conditions bcc csm 1 1 m gfdl cm3 hadgem2 es miroc esm miroc esm chem miroc5 and noresm1 m generally project higher differences relative to the mean ensemble rainfall for both the study site mcsweeney et al 2015 also indicated that for the southeast asian region miroc esm miroc esm chem noresm 1 m in particular hadgem2 es to a lesser extent have too strong easterly component rather than southern thus producing significant biases they also characterized the gcms to predict future climatologies and concluded that miroc esm miroc esm chem and ipsl cm5a lr have implausible whereas nor esm1 m ipsl cm5a mr and csiro mk3 6 0 have significant biases in their projections however the performance of different gcms may vary concerning study sites crop phenology is a crucial indicator for assessing the impact of climate change on crops hernandez ochoa et al 2018 increasing co2 levels in different rcps may advance or delay phenological developments through experimental evidence that shows no consistent dimensions asshoff et al 2006 however higher growing season temperature on phenology usually results in faster growth rates and shorter growing and reproductive seasons zhao et al 2017 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 the dssat ceres wheat simulated mean ensemble duration of the crop growing season of spring wheat in this study also showed a similar trend of shortening growing cycle ranging from 4 22 days for the irrigated conditions and 6 25 days for rainfed conditions in different rcps and simulation years the analysis of these scenarios also predicted that anthesis would occur earlier for both irrigated 4 20 days and rainfed conditions 5 23 days wheat fixes atmospheric co2 through the c3 photosynthetic pathway thus increased co2 concentrations promote rubisco activities however adverse effects may also be evident in some cases as the higher co2 concentrations may cause photosynthetic acclimation a phenomenon driven by the accumulation of non structural carbohydrates causing suppression of photosynthetic genes walters 2005 zhu et al 2012 the photosynthesis stimulation due to increased atmospheric co2 concentrations would be sufficient to enhance crop growth evident from higher vegetative and reproductive yield walters 2005 a higher temperature may affect crop growing season length and phenological developments which are critical factors for wheat yield zhao et al 2017 short heat stresses at post anthesis period may reduce wheat grain weight osman et al 2020 resulting in lower yield hernandez ochoa et al 2018 also indicated that a moderate rise in temperature conditions could offset the benefits imparted by higher co2 on wheat yield increased co2 levels on crop yield under un stressed water and nutrient supply near the current ambient temperature conditions are reported to increase crop growth and yield through increased co2 assimilation rate wang et al 2012 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 however the interactive impact of temperature and elevated co2 could affect multiple processes like photosynthesis respiration vegetative growth and yield morison and lawlor 1999 the growth rate and development may increase at higher temperatures and co2 concentration bunce 1998 yang et al 2014 in cooler environments and the temperature increase within the threshold limits of the crop in tropic and sub tropic regions crop production is carried out in an already stressed environment as higher increased temperature may contribute towards accelerated senescence shortening of grain filling duration early maturity and consequently decreased biomass production and yield hanson et al 2007 deryng et al 2014 hernandez ochoa et al 2018 in the present study the projected temperature increase is expected to negatively affect the wheat crop yield in pakistan which is already grown under an early and late season heat stressed environment comparatively rapid development exposes the crop to terminal heat stress resulting in reduced yield the wue is subjected to change by local weather conditions which vary spatially and temporally within the boundaries of a particular climatic zone therefore expected shifts within these boundaries during the next 100 years will affect the sustainability of current cropping systems the increase in temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration can affect plant water relationship generally referred to as etc in the present study a linear trend of higher reduction in etc at higher co2 levels was evident for irrigated conditions it is reported that increased atmospheric co2 concentrations may reduce stomatal conductance thereby reducing the transpiration component of total etc lammertsma et al 2011 wang et al 2012 a higher crop growth rate leads to early plant canopy development thus reducing soil evaporation in the early phases of crop growth the reduction in transpiration and evaporation is expected to lower crop water demand simulations made with dssat ceres wheat showed that increased atmospheric co2 concentration and temperature conditions lead to lower seasonal etc possibly due to shifts in crop phenology enhanced crop development and accelerated crop senescence such reduction in etc likely represents higher wue in future climate change scenarios however the gain in wue is associated with a higher reduction in wheat yield the multi crop model ensemble can be employed to attain accurate and consistent crop growth and yield dynamics martre et al 2015 a multi model ensemble simulation can be produced by averaging the simulations of all models weighted equally and to produce better estimates than an individual model recent studies by ding et al 2021 kheir et al 2021 2022 used three crop models ceres wheat n wheat and wheat crop sim to simulate wheat yield and water productivity however these studies did not consider the impact of future climate change the limitations of our study are that we used only one crop model dssat ceres wheat to simulate future weather data from cmip5 multi climate models using one genotype therefore future research should consider the multi genotype and crop climate models particularly future weather data from cmip6 to simulate the impact of future climate change on wheat productivity 5 conclusion the projected climatic conditions are expected to prevail under ipcc rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 by 2030 2050 and 2090 suggesting the warming trends at the study sites the mean ensemble of 17 gcms projects that the average wheat growing season temperature may increase from a lower value of 1 to the highest 5 depending on the rcp the rainfall from the western disturbance received during the wheat growing season also shows a decreasing tendency these projections negatively affected wheat yield through heat stress and reduced growing season length dssat ceres wheat projected a 2 19 yield decrease under irrigated conditions and 9 30 under rainfed conditions between 2030 and 2090 changes in rainfall and temperature will determine yield decline in the rainfed system however in the irrigated system only the temperature changes will determine the potential yield loss depending on the availability of irrigation water supplies reducing the overall crop growing cycle due to temperature increase and lower transpiration rate due to higher co2 levels may result in lower crop water demands and higher crop water productivity nevertheless such productivity gains are not economical due to the relatively higher yield decline foreseen under future climate change scenarios further studies using multi model ensemble simulation with different cultivars management practices and gcms from cmip6 are needed to determine the impact of future climate change on wheat growth and productivity declaration of

on soil water regime and nitrate dynamics at an agricultural experimental site on fine textured soils and to better understand the implications of n management in relation to groundwater pollution the field site is located in the biđ field eastern croatia in the proximity of the sava river zero tension lysimeters were installed at six selected locations lysimeters were used to monitor the water regime i e outflows in which nitrate concentration was measured while additional soil water samples were collected via 4 and 15 meter deep monitoring wells soil hydraulic parameters were estimated by combining the laboratory measurements and estimation in retc software water regime and nitrate leaching in lysimeters were simulated using hydrus 1d for each year to allow crop rotation and to evaluate their effects individually the hydrus 1d model successfully reproduced lysimeter outflows and nitrate dynamics which was confirmed with high r2 values water 93 above 0 7 and nitrate 73 above 0 7 indicating the good performance of the model simulating nitrification chain reactions principal component analysis pca was performed to identify the relationships among all soil properties and environmental characteristics the results showed the complex interaction of soil hydraulic properties precipitation patterns plant uptake and n application all locations have a decreasing trend of nitrate leaching over the investigation period most of the lysimeter outflows and elevated nitrate concentrations were connected to the wet period of the year when the soil was saturated and evapotranspiration was low the results of this study show that it is important to optimize n fertilizer applications for each particular environmental condition to reduce nitrate loss the study

rates of n in such agricultural area cannot be neglected miller et al 2020 high annual precipitation increases plants n uptake and the dilution effect reducing nitrate concentration as well as higher annual temperatures can as evapotranspiration rates increase wick et al 2012 however nitrate is one of the first nutrients to be washed from the soil profile due to its high mobility colombani et al 2020 the rhizosphere dynamics of nutrients is multifactorial as it depends on plant characteristics and water demands while several factors cannot be accurately quantified due to spatio temporal variability nitrate does bind onto clay or organic compounds increasing the losses by leaching or overland flow and surface water and groundwater pollution ravikumar et al 2011 n management in several

plates capillary wicks and lysimeters are widely used groh et al 2018 schmidt and lin 2008 shen and hoffland 2007 one of the lysimeter techniques used due to its practical and inexpensive nature is the zero tension plate lysimeter method they can generate valuable data by simulating actual field conditions groffman et al 2009 filipović et al 2013a 2013b tiefenbacher et al 2020 the information obtained by the zero tension plate lysimeters which varies depending on the field situation and local expresses the leaching depth and exhibits more solute spreading than suction plates thus reflecting suitably for ecosystem input output budgets marques et al 1996 kasteel et al 2007 also previous works captured the rainfall intensity impacts on organic solute leachate into subsoil using this technique kaiser and guggenberger 2005 however there are several limitations since they have only the capability of collecting water when the soil is in a positive pressure state or the water may diverge from the instrument towards the dryer surrounding soil zhu et al 2009 this can result in low leachate catchment efficiency jemison and fox 1992 however zero tension plate lysimeters work efficiently in soil conditions near the saturation point peters and durner 2009 hence an adequate evaluation requires field data collection for data generation nevertheless in nitrate transport and leaching assessment often multiyear data collected systematically at an investigated site is lacking thus preventing researchers from having decisive conclusions that have merit multiyear data is often crucial for agricultural research due the fields nature of spatial and temporal variability blasch et al 2020 dang et al 2011 the presented study combines long term field data collection with including real agricultural field conditions allowing multi crop rotation and combining it with extensive water and n transformation modeling tools therefore the aims of this study were i to evaluate

tillage and the average depth of the main root mass in the crop rotation a round lysimeter plate filled with disturbed soil material horizon of installation was inserted into the slot to retain the soil above the lysimeter undisturbed a pvc net was applied on the lysimeter plate surface for filtering purposes to prevent small particles from being washed out with the leachate outflow pipes were installed and connected to soil water containers placed at the edge of the field to allow unobstructed access for sample collection leachate was collected according to significant precipitation events

to first order degradation reactions nitrogen species the first order decay chain of urea tillotson et al 1980 consists of a reaction pathway that involves the hydrolysis of urea by heterotrophic

simulations of the nitrification chain reactions in soil parameters for all investigated locations were set as follows the first order reaction term representing nitrification of urea or kan

of the species 0 018 for nh4 and 0 062 for no3 unlimited passive uptake of nh4 and no3 in the liquid phase was considered li et al 2015 the effect of denitrification was neglected due to the presence of high unsaturated conditions in the first 50 cm where the modeling was performed to solve the transport of each separate chemical partial urea ammonium and nitrate the following equations were used

crop rotation the maize and cereal groups were selected due to the largest occurrence in crop rotation during the 12 years the logarithmically transformed data were used for the pca since it was the closest to normality the pca analyses were performed using statistica 12 0 for windows statsoft tulsa usa 3 results discussion 3 1 model validation results of the model validation are presented in table 4 using the goodness of fit coefficient of determination r2 analysis r2 for water flow simulations range from 0 58 to 0 97 table 4 while r2 values of nitrate simulations were 0 12 0 97 table 4 93 of r2 values for water flow simulations exceeded the value of 0 7 whereas nitrate simulations had lower values being 73 above 0 7 and can be perceived as a satisfactory outcome for the described modeling moriasi et al 2015 while also indicating the occurrence of greater uncertainty in nitrate modeling as expected due to the larger parameter input one of the lowest values of r2 for water flow simulations occurred in 2011 l1 0 64 l2 0 62 and can be linked to a low number of observations n 5 caused by drought during this dry year 393 6 mm consequently nitrate outflow simulations at the same locations resulted in lower r2 as well l1 0 54 l2 0 53 water flow and nitrates simulations were more precise in wet years due to more observation points the lowest value of r2 for nitrate simulations occurred in 2019 at location l3 0 12 where no nitrogen fertilizer was applied and very low nitrate values were measured rmse ranged from 0 7 to 15 8 for water flow while mae showed similar range as well 0 59 14 5 nitrate outflow rmse and mae averaged 0 008 and 0 007 respectively it should be noted that zero tension lysimeters also have some limitations in the precise quantification of soil water fluxes zhu et al 2009 thus additionally supporting the field derived data with numerical modeling is needed especially in agricultural soils where nonlinear processes are present guo and lin 2018 altogether these data deviations can be partially explained by soil heterogeneity neglected the effect of soil structure in heavily managed agro eco systems nonuniform rainfall and fertilizer distribution and over or under estimation of crop uptake or n transformation parameters brunetti et al 2021 performed a global sensitivity analysis after hydrus 1d model calibration on important factors driving the leaching of nitrate from green roofs it was found that the first order degradation coefficients had an appreciable impact on nitrate leaching together with organic n production rate and feddes parameter p0 the study focused on organic n transformations from wastewater application in the current study we only focused on inorganic n from application from fertilizers which have more consistent n transformation rates as their content is precisely controlled in depth analyses and focused experiments are recommended concerning rainfed open field agriculture in which precipitation can affect n turnover by increasing the nitrate leaching potential and soil moisture this influences microbial degradation processes e g maenhout et al 2018 such as nitrification and denitrification due to aerobic anaerobic cycles i e local soil moisture dynamics becker et al 2007 linquist et al 2011 qiu et al 2020 or due to effect of dissolved organic carbon from plant residues surey et al 2020 3 2 simulation and monitoring results water flow and nitrogen dynamics in the years with higher than average precipitation 685 mm nitrate concentrations in lysimeters increased pointing to a nitrate flushing from the soil fig 3 as an input supplying the groundwater recharge the precipitation initiates the water flow processes causing water to flow either laterally to an adjacent area or vertically through the soil profile into groundwater consequently repositioning the applied fertilizers the other impact of precipitation on soil hydrology indicated that bulk precipitation can contribute significantly to macropore flow thus leading to the increased n losses furthermore as sigler et al 2020 demonstrated in their simulations that over half of the nitrate leaching in a 14 year model was triggered in only two years by high intensity precipitation events in that period similarly zheng et al 2020 identified that land use and extreme precipitations were the main factors that controlled nitrate accumulation leaching and concentration in groundwater in an intensively used agricultural area however this feedback mechanism in the vadose zone is complicated and requires models or multiple methods to assess and confirm firstly the different rainfall intensities e g rain splash will alter the soil structure by influencing its vertical heterogeneity leading to the inadequate dynamic simulation without some simple representation of soil vertical variability turkeltaub et al 2021 secondly groundwater depth fluctuation caused by precipitation will also play an important role in n transportation bian et al 2021 beyond that at higher clay content a higher water outflow fig 3 and nitrate concentration fig 4 were generally observed this could be connected to preferential flow due to a higher likelihood of crack formation vertic properties in soils with higher clay content oostindie and bronswijk 1995 and conditioned by the rate and timing of the fertilizer application amanullah 2016 the average evapotranspiration et for all locations in the investigated period was 930 7 mm the highest et 1557 mm was calculated for maize in 2017 fig 5 evapotranspiration impacted the measured water and nitrate outflow with a general relation of high outflow and nitrate concentrations in years of low annual et and vice versa the soil hydrology may respond more sensitively to discharge than to increased et related to warm temperature livneh et al 2015 however et plays an important role in the n plant uptake rate average total n leaching on all investigated locations was 14 fig s1 while the highest average in the year 2014 with 42 yan et al 2021 highlighted that different irrigation amounts based on et values in interaction with fertilization rates will significantly affect the n accumulation otherwise the increased et was expected to decline the n loading due to a low oxygen induced reduction of the nitrification jeppesen et al 2011 on average 54 of nitrate leaching occurred under some crop while the highest average nitrate leaching during the cropless season occurred at l5 60 fig s2 lacerda et al 2016 demonstrated that reducing n application based on the decrease in et is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate leaching as well as fertilization costs without causing n deficiency in maize plants moreover rudnick and irmak 2014 investigated the impact of the applied n rate on crop coefficients and its decrease under irrigated and rainfed conditions the variations in findings of outflow in the lysimeters fig s4 at the investigated site can be linked to plant available water and n uptake as water and n uptake increases with transpiration rates matsunami et al 2010 the diversification of planting crops presents different outcomes maize being the most frequent crop at the site had the highest average input and output of n in the investigated period a higher ratio of input and output n i e 16 6 for maize vs 11 6 for the cereal group implies a potential in adjusting the n management in the agricultural fields leading to economic and environmental benefits moreover higher annual precipitation resulted in higher n output fig s1 3 3 multivariate analysis in the pca carried out for the combined dataset factor 1 explained 33 5 of the variance while factors 2 and 3 explained 23 9 and 16 1 respectively factor 1 had high negative loadings in the sand bulk density and k s and high positive loadings in clay factor 2 had high negative loading in et and high positive loading in precipitation and water outflow finally factor 3 had high positive loading in nitrate outflow n in and n out table 5 all dataset analysis identified three groups while intersected factors 1 and 2 fig 6a included i bulk density sand fraction and k s ii water outflow nitrate outflow n out n in and clay fraction iii et groups i and ii were inversely related in the pca calculated for cereal cropping factor 1 explained 44 7 of the variance while factors 2 and 3 explained 18 4 and 11 9 factor 1 had high negative loadings in precipitation water outflow nitrate outflow and clay and high negative loadings in et sand and bulk density factor 2 had high positive loadings in k s while factor 3 had high negative loadings in n in and n out the intersection of the factors 1 and 2 fig 6b identified two main inversely related groups i et sand bulk density and k s ii precipitation water outflow nitrate outflow clay and n out in the pca calculated for maize cropping factor 1 explained 44 7 of the variance while factors 2 and 3 explained 18 4 and 11 9 respectively at maize cropping two main inversely related groups fig 6c i water outflow precipitation n out nitrate outflow and clay ii sand bulk density k s and et were identified moreover multivariate analysis for maize cropping table 5 revealed high positive loadings in precipitation water outflow nitrate outflow n out and clay and high negative loadings in et sand and bulk density at factor 1 factor 3 had high positive loading in n in and k s 3 4 nitrate concentration in relation to the depth the highest 108 5 mg l 1 concentration of nitrate was found at the shallowest depth 0 5 m at l4 while all locations except l6 lysimeters installed in 2015 showed higher than 50 mg l 1 as maximum values fig 7 from 2016 onward at the same depth concentrations did not exceed 30 mg l 1 moreover all locations had a decreasing trend of nitrate concentrations over the investigation period previous investigations at the site concluded that groundwater levels have a decreasing trend as well as this research shows fig s4 while irregular precipitation events are present during the year that influence crop production mustać et al 2020 which are likely linked to the nitrate concentrations at the site as well a decreasing trend of nitrate concentrations was present with the depth of observation the highest average concentrations 18 8 mg l 1 of nitrate at a depth of 0 5 m were found at l4 fig 7 along with the highest standard deviation 23 3 mg l 1 while notably the low mean concentration 6 7 mg l 1 was found at l6 regarding the nitrate concentrations observed in soil water at 4 m concentrations were largely uniform with higher average values 4 4 mg l 1 observed at l5 furthermore concentrations at 15 m are even lower with the highest mean of 2 4 mg l 1 at l6 the high n concentration mainly in nitrate and ammonium fig s3 was accounted mostly in the plowing layers in which sophisticated responses have been exhibited concerning uptake allocation assimilation and signaling hachiya and sakakibara 2017 it has to be pointed out that ammonium was also found in deeper monitoring wells fig s3 which can also probably be linked to slower transformation rates or preferential transport of ammonium applied with fertilizers it seems that nitrate decreased with depth faster than ammonium probably due to saturated conditions e g denitrification the reaction has acquired and transferred the n for growth and productivity of the crop possibly retarding its downward migration vidal et al 2020 besides the aquifer loaded with high compressing soil has low permeability resulting in less leaching of nitrate the compacted clayed soils are distributed dominantly with bimodal pore changing the fabric of the porous network and swelling the aggregate hence bringing about the water retention properties romero et al 2011 additionally due to the terminal steps of denitrification being distinct in diverse bacterial populations baker et al 2015 needing oxygen as an energy supply that the deep layer lacks the denitrification process mainly occurs in shallow water layers with less nitrate appearing in the deep layer 3 5 overall discussion and implications of nitrogen management in agricultural areas the pca analysis revealed different relations between soil properties and climate among three different procedures according to crops in rotation bulk density sand fraction and k s were inversely related to water outflow nitrate outflow n out n in and clay fraction for all dataset analyses this is very similar to pca analysis performed for cereal and maize cropping where both analysis groups consisting of bulk density sand k s and et were inversely related to a group consisting of water outflow precipitation and nitrate outflow n out and clay fraction other studies also found positive relationships between k s and sand content and negative between k s and clay content wesseling et al 2009 jarvis et al 2013 moreover present research confirms that soil texture dominantly determines the retention characteristics in most agricultural soils the bulk density increased with sand content mainly due to the lack of micropores expressed in sandy soils koolen and kuipers 1984 arvidsson 1998 in addition high compacted soils seem to mitigate leaching as is seen from negative interrelations between bulk density and water outflow n outflow and n out this process is visible under cereal maize and all other crops shown in fig 6 however the relationships seem to be the highest expressed under maize cropping table 4 also indicating a poor plant canopy impact under maize on elevated leaching and loss of n although investigated locations did not differ in tillage management and all farmers in study locations use conventional plowing tillage we believe that transition to non invertive or no tillage could help to reduce the n losses as is noted in other environments van den bossche et al 2009 xiao et al 2019 transition to conservation tillage improves the soil properties such as bulk density soil penetration resistance and soil particle size distribution wulanningtyas et al 2021 moreover non invertive tillage retains the residue on topsoil birkás et al 2008 contributing to n leaching preservation it is known that high density crops and cover crops positively impact leaching and n loss e g beaudoin et al 2005 abdalla et al 2019 and the long term study presented in this paper also confirms these findings cover crops and post harvest residues as sustainable agronomic practices can serve as means of reducing nitrate losses by taking up water and nitrate from the soil after the main crop is harvested and before the main crop begins to use significant amounts of water and n van den bossche et al 2009 shelton et al 2018 snapp and surapur 2018 overall the augmenting biomass of the covering crop can suppress the growth of weeds prevent nitrate leaching and aboveground biomass n and negatively affect the availability of inorganic n in the subsequent cropping season despite the increasingly important role the cover crops play the drawback can be identified with the reducing grain yield of the primary crop which can be avoided by choosing cover crops mixed with non legumes and legumes abdalla et al 2019 while the use of perennials in the cropping system helps in reducing nitrate leaching jungers et al 2019 and even though there still is a challenge in increasing their adoption due to the problems of identifying profitable and marketable crops faber et al 2012 there are promising perennial biomass crops that also hold multiple benefits for the agroecosystems and environment choi and entenmann 2019 in n management decision making understanding the relationship between n and crop rotation is of great importance due to several involvement points such as the rate of n mineralization osterholz et al 2017 or the possibility of improved soil physical properties tueche and hauser 2011 generally crop rotation strategies have high crop yields than mono cropping cultivation in addition the lesser n losses were discovered in a field planted with legumes miao et al 2011 it is also noted that n mineralization responding significantly to the n management is a crucial process promoting n uptake by crops and increasing n loss potential however the rate of n loss during the mineralization can be brought down by immobilizing mechanisms whose net n immobilization during immobilization mineralization and immobilization is reduced through the change of plowing time and fertilizer application chen et al 2014 crop rotations preserve the soil quality by improving carbon n and microbial biomass in soil mcdaniel et al 2014 and increasing crop rotational diversity also impacts positively the soil aggregation organic carbon total n alleviating the reducing agroecosystems services tiemann et al 2015 n fertilizer applications for rate timing and method should be explored in each particular environmental condition as their proper reduction and time of application could significantly reduce nitrate loss jeong and bhattarai 2018 management practices like the type of tillage and time number of fertilizer applications appear to be important factors for controlling the n uptake and losses it is well known that conservation or reduced tillage practice supports the slower n mineralization and lowers the potential risk of nitrate leaching van den bossche et al 2009 others also noted higher n efficiency in conservation compared to conventional tillage systems e g pandey et al 2010 watts et al 2010 xiao et al 2019 moreover the interactions between root soil microbial can stimulate soil n mineralization through rhizosphere priming effects raising the importance of fertilizing management affecting the crop s root functions zhu et al 2014 fertilizer management should be adjustable to environmental and plant conditions however it is a challenging task since fertilization usually increases gaseous n loss n leaching and plant yield shelton et al 2018 often a primary goal of farming 4 conclusions the simulated water flow and nitrate loss fitted well with the collected data the fitting was higher in years with higher precipitation which led to higher and more frequent lysimeter outflows thus resulting in more data points for model evaluation the r2 values for simulated water flow were 93 above 0 7 while r2 values for nitrate simulations had lower values being 73 above 0 7 the results of our research show that the use of the lysimeters data set in hydrus 1d can adequately address the water regime and nitrate dynamics in agricultural fields under long term cultivation with diverse crops the results of nitrate outflows in this study indicate that one dimensional modeling even though was found adequate could possibly produce better data in two or three dimensional simulations the leaching and accumulation of nitrate in the experimental site relating to water outflow were mainly affected by precipitation conditions soil properties and et for all locations the description of n was reflected well on the n uptake in an increasing trend in years with high transpiration rates however other main links in the field n cycle such as denitrification were underestimated and limitedly interpreted the pca capturing the connection of different soil parameters to n leaching characterized a negative correlation that combined 12 years dataset in exact cropping the pca highlighted other relationships between factor groups for long term planting of cereal and maize the outflow of nitrate and n out were inversely related to et sand bulk density and k s beyond that the three factors independently reacted distinctively with variables there is additional potential in adjusting the n management in agricultural fields to improve both economic and environmental outcomes e g a higher output of n was found for maize 16 6 than the cereal group 11 6 all locations l1 l6 had a decreasing trend of nitrate concentrations over the investigation period the research highlights the importance of exploring n fertilizer application in each particular environmental condition as proper reduction and time of application reduces nitrate loss the results indicate that using tools such as agro hydrological models may improve opportunities to ameliorate n management in agricultural fields in the future this information is critical to fine tuning n management in agricultural watersheds leading to improved n use efficiency lower n losses and protection of water quality in sensitive water bodies

on soil water regime and nitrate dynamics at an agricultural experimental site on fine textured soils and to better understand the implications of n management in relation to groundwater pollution the field site is located in the biđ field eastern croatia in the proximity of the sava river zero tension lysimeters were installed at six selected locations lysimeters were used to monitor the water regime i e outflows in which nitrate concentration was measured while additional soil water samples were collected via 4 and 15 meter deep monitoring wells soil hydraulic parameters were estimated by combining the laboratory measurements and estimation in retc software water regime and nitrate leaching in lysimeters were simulated using hydrus 1d for each year to allow crop rotation and to evaluate their effects individually the hydrus 1d model successfully reproduced lysimeter outflows and nitrate dynamics which was confirmed with high r2 values water 93 above 0 7 and nitrate 73 above 0 7 indicating the good performance of the model simulating nitrification chain reactions principal component analysis pca was performed to identify the relationships among all soil properties and environmental characteristics the results showed the complex interaction of soil hydraulic properties precipitation patterns plant uptake and n application all locations have a decreasing trend of nitrate leaching over the investigation period most of the lysimeter outflows and elevated nitrate concentrations were connected to the wet period of the year when the soil was saturated and evapotranspiration was low the results of this study show that it is important to optimize n fertilizer applications for each particular environmental condition to reduce nitrate loss the study

spalding and parrott 1994 and high soil water content abbasi and adams 2000 favor denitrification rates the consideration of n leaching harmful effects provoked by the uncertainty of the application rates of n in such agricultural area cannot be neglected miller et al 2020 high annual precipitation increases plants n uptake and the dilution effect reducing nitrate concentration as well as higher annual temperatures can as evapotranspiration rates increase wick et al 2012 however nitrate is one of the first nutrients to be washed from the soil profile due to its high mobility colombani et al 2020 the rhizosphere dynamics of nutrients is multifactorial as it depends on plant characteristics and water demands while several factors cannot be accurately quantified due to spatio temporal variability nitrate does bind onto clay or organic compounds increasing the losses by leaching or overland flow and surface water and groundwater pollution ravikumar et al 2011 n management in several parts of the world is still challenging and should be approached multi methodically to enhance n use efficiency and decrease losses sharma and bali 2017 snyder 2017 yang et al 2022 among all n

plates capillary wicks and lysimeters are widely used groh et al 2018 schmidt and lin 2008 shen and hoffland 2007 one of the lysimeter techniques used due to its practical and inexpensive nature is the zero tension plate lysimeter method they can generate valuable data by simulating actual field conditions groffman et al 2009 filipović et al 2013a 2013b tiefenbacher et al 2020 the information obtained by the zero tension plate lysimeters which varies depending on the field situation and local expresses the leaching depth and exhibits more solute spreading than suction plates thus reflecting suitably for ecosystem input output budgets marques et al 1996 kasteel et al 2007 also previous works captured the rainfall intensity impacts on organic solute leachate into subsoil using this technique kaiser and guggenberger 2005 however there are several limitations since they have only the capability of collecting water when the soil is in a positive pressure state or the water may diverge from the instrument towards the dryer surrounding soil zhu et al 2009 this can result in low leachate catchment efficiency jemison and fox 1992 however zero tension plate lysimeters work efficiently in soil conditions near the saturation point peters and durner 2009 hence an adequate evaluation requires field data collection for data generation nevertheless in nitrate transport and leaching assessment often multiyear data collected systematically at an investigated site is lacking thus preventing researchers from having decisive conclusions that have merit multiyear data is often crucial for agricultural research due the fields nature of spatial and temporal variability blasch et al 2020 dang et al 2011 the presented study combines long term field data collection with including real agricultural field conditions allowing multi crop rotation and combining it with extensive water and n transformation modeling tools therefore the aims of this study were i to evaluate long term 12 years 2009 2020 data on soil water regime and nitrate dynamics in the vadose zone of an intensive agricultural managed area at six locations located in eastern croatia ii to combine the numerical water flow and nitrification chain models with laboratory and field obtained data by considering farmers n management practices crop rotation soil and climate data into account and iii to

unearthed horizontal slot at a depth of 0 5 m the installation depth was selected using the following criteria varying local groundwater levels implementation of applied agro technical management e g tillage and the average depth of the main root mass in the crop rotation a round lysimeter plate filled with disturbed soil material horizon of installation was inserted into the slot to retain the soil above the lysimeter undisturbed a pvc net was applied on the lysimeter plate surface for filtering purposes to prevent small particles from being washed out with the leachate outflow pipes were installed and connected to soil water containers placed at the edge of the field to allow unobstructed access for sample collection leachate was collected according to significant precipitation events throughout the years for soil water sampling from deeper layers at each location 4 and 15 meter deep monitoring wells perforated at the bottom were installed nearby the zero tension lysimeters fig 2

table 4 using the goodness of fit coefficient of determination r2 analysis r2 for water flow simulations range from 0 58 to 0 97 table 4 while r2 values of nitrate simulations were 0 12 0 97 table 4 93 of r2 values for water flow simulations exceeded the value of 0 7 whereas nitrate simulations had lower values being 73 above 0 7 and can be perceived as a satisfactory outcome for the described modeling moriasi et al 2015 while also indicating the occurrence of greater uncertainty in nitrate modeling as expected due to the larger parameter input one of the lowest values of r2 for water flow simulations occurred in 2011 l1 0 64 l2 0 62 and can be linked to a low number of observations n 5 caused by drought during this dry year 393 6 mm consequently nitrate outflow simulations at the same locations resulted in lower r2 as well l1 0 54 l2 0 53 water flow and nitrates simulations were more precise in wet years due to more observation points the lowest value of r2 for nitrate simulations occurred in 2019 at location l3 0 12 where no nitrogen fertilizer was applied and very low nitrate values were measured rmse ranged from 0 7 to 15 8 for water flow while mae showed similar range as well 0 59 14 5 nitrate outflow rmse and mae averaged 0 008 and 0 007 respectively it should be noted that zero tension lysimeters also have some limitations in the precise quantification of soil water fluxes zhu et al 2009 thus additionally supporting the field derived data with numerical modeling is needed especially in agricultural soils where nonlinear processes are present guo and lin 2018 altogether these data deviations can be partially explained by soil heterogeneity neglected the effect of soil structure in heavily managed agro eco systems nonuniform rainfall and fertilizer distribution and over or under estimation of crop uptake or n transformation parameters brunetti et al 2021 performed a global sensitivity analysis after hydrus 1d model calibration on important factors driving the leaching of nitrate from green roofs it was found that the first order degradation coefficients had an appreciable impact on nitrate leaching together with organic n production rate and feddes parameter p0 the study focused on organic n transformations from wastewater application in the current study we only focused on inorganic n from application from fertilizers which have more consistent n transformation rates as their content is precisely controlled in depth analyses and focused experiments are recommended concerning rainfed open field agriculture in which precipitation can affect n turnover by increasing the nitrate leaching potential and soil moisture this influences microbial degradation processes e g maenhout et al 2018 such as nitrification and denitrification due to aerobic anaerobic cycles i e local soil moisture dynamics becker et al 2007 linquist et al 2011 qiu et al 2020 or due to effect of dissolved organic carbon from plant residues surey et al 2020 3 2 simulation and monitoring results water flow and nitrogen dynamics in the years with higher than average precipitation 685 mm nitrate concentrations in lysimeters increased pointing to a nitrate flushing from the soil fig 3 as an input supplying the groundwater recharge the precipitation initiates the water flow processes causing water to flow either laterally to an adjacent area or vertically through the soil profile into groundwater consequently repositioning the applied fertilizers the other impact of precipitation on soil hydrology indicated that bulk precipitation can contribute significantly to macropore flow thus leading to the increased n losses furthermore as sigler et al 2020 demonstrated in their simulations that over half of the nitrate leaching in a 14 year model was triggered in only two years by high intensity precipitation events in that period similarly zheng et al 2020 identified that land use and extreme precipitations were the main factors that controlled nitrate accumulation leaching and concentration in groundwater in an intensively used agricultural area however this feedback mechanism in the vadose zone is complicated and requires models or multiple methods to assess and confirm firstly the different rainfall intensities e g rain splash will alter the soil structure by influencing its vertical heterogeneity leading to the inadequate dynamic simulation without some simple representation of soil vertical variability turkeltaub et al 2021 secondly groundwater depth fluctuation caused by precipitation will also play an important role in n transportation bian et al 2021 beyond that at higher clay content a higher water outflow fig 3 and nitrate concentration fig 4 were generally observed this could be connected to preferential flow due to a higher likelihood of crack formation vertic properties in soils with higher clay content oostindie and bronswijk 1995 and conditioned by the rate and timing of the fertilizer application amanullah 2016 the average evapotranspiration et for all locations in the investigated period was 930 7 mm the highest et 1557 mm was calculated for maize in 2017 fig 5 evapotranspiration impacted the measured water and nitrate outflow with a general relation of high outflow and nitrate concentrations in years of low annual et and vice versa the soil hydrology may respond more sensitively to discharge than to increased et related to warm temperature livneh et al 2015 however et plays an important role in the n plant uptake rate average total n leaching on all investigated locations was 14 fig s1 while the highest average in the year 2014 with 42 yan et al 2021 highlighted that different irrigation amounts based on et values in interaction with fertilization rates will significantly affect the n accumulation otherwise the increased et was expected to decline the n loading due to a low oxygen induced reduction of the nitrification jeppesen et al 2011 on average 54 of nitrate leaching occurred under some crop while the highest average nitrate leaching during the cropless season occurred at l5 60 fig s2 lacerda et al 2016 demonstrated that reducing n application based on the decrease in et is an effective strategy to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate leaching as well as fertilization costs without causing n deficiency in maize plants moreover rudnick and irmak 2014 investigated the impact of the applied n rate on crop coefficients and its decrease under irrigated and rainfed conditions the variations in findings of outflow in the lysimeters fig s4 at the investigated site can be linked to plant available water and n uptake as water and n uptake increases with transpiration rates matsunami et al 2010 the diversification of planting crops presents different outcomes maize being the most frequent crop at the site had the highest average input and output of n in the investigated period a higher ratio of input and output n i e 16 6 for maize vs 11 6 for the cereal group implies a potential in adjusting the n management in the agricultural fields leading to economic and environmental benefits moreover higher annual precipitation resulted in higher n output fig s1 3 3 multivariate analysis in the pca carried out for the combined dataset factor 1 explained 33 5 of the variance while factors 2 and 3 explained 23 9 and 16 1 respectively factor 1 had high negative loadings in the sand bulk density and k s and high positive loadings in clay factor 2 had high negative loading in et and high positive loading in precipitation and water outflow finally factor 3 had high positive loading in nitrate outflow n in and n out table 5 all dataset analysis identified three groups while intersected factors 1 and 2 fig 6a included i bulk density sand fraction and k s ii water outflow nitrate outflow n out n in and clay fraction iii et groups i and ii were inversely related in the pca calculated for cereal cropping factor 1 explained 44 7 of the variance while factors 2 and 3 explained 18 4 and 11 9 factor 1 had high negative loadings in precipitation water outflow nitrate outflow and clay and high negative loadings in et sand and bulk density factor 2 had high positive loadings in k s while factor 3 had high negative loadings in n in and n out the intersection of the factors 1 and 2 fig 6b identified two main inversely related groups i et sand bulk density and k s ii precipitation water outflow nitrate outflow clay and n out in the pca calculated for maize cropping factor 1 explained 44 7 of the variance while factors 2 and 3 explained 18 4 and 11 9 respectively at maize cropping two main inversely related groups fig 6c i water outflow precipitation n out nitrate outflow and clay ii sand bulk density k s and et were identified moreover multivariate analysis for maize cropping table 5 revealed high positive loadings in precipitation water outflow nitrate outflow n out and clay and high negative loadings in et sand and bulk density at factor 1 factor 3 had high positive loading in n in and k s 3 4 nitrate concentration in relation to the depth the highest 108 5 mg l 1 concentration of nitrate was found at the shallowest depth 0 5 m at l4 while all locations except l6 lysimeters installed in 2015 showed higher than 50 mg l 1 as maximum values fig 7 from 2016 onward at the same depth concentrations did not exceed 30 mg l 1 moreover all locations had a decreasing trend of nitrate concentrations over the investigation period previous investigations at the site concluded that groundwater levels have a decreasing trend as well as this research shows fig s4 while irregular precipitation events are present during the year that influence crop production mustać et al 2020 which are likely linked to the nitrate concentrations at the site as well a decreasing trend of nitrate concentrations was present with the depth of observation the highest average concentrations 18 8 mg l 1 of nitrate at a depth of 0 5 m were found at l4 fig 7 along with the highest standard deviation 23 3 mg l 1 while notably the low mean concentration 6 7 mg l 1 was found at l6 regarding the nitrate concentrations observed in soil water at 4 m concentrations were largely uniform with higher average values 4 4 mg l 1 observed at l5 furthermore concentrations at 15 m are even lower with the highest mean of 2 4 mg l 1 at l6 the high n concentration mainly in nitrate and ammonium fig s3 was accounted mostly in the plowing layers in which sophisticated responses have been exhibited concerning uptake allocation assimilation and signaling hachiya and sakakibara 2017 it has to be pointed out that ammonium was also found in deeper monitoring wells fig s3 which can also probably be linked to slower transformation rates or preferential transport of ammonium applied with fertilizers it seems that nitrate decreased with depth faster than ammonium probably due to saturated conditions e g denitrification the reaction has acquired and transferred the n for growth and productivity of the crop possibly retarding its downward migration vidal et al 2020 besides the aquifer loaded with high compressing soil has low permeability resulting in less leaching of nitrate the compacted clayed soils are distributed dominantly with bimodal pore changing the fabric of the porous network and swelling the aggregate hence bringing about the water retention properties romero et al 2011 additionally due to the terminal steps of denitrification being distinct in diverse bacterial populations baker et al 2015 needing oxygen as an energy supply that the deep layer lacks the denitrification process mainly occurs in shallow water layers with less nitrate appearing in the deep layer 3 5 overall discussion and implications of nitrogen management in agricultural areas the pca analysis revealed different relations between soil properties and climate among three different procedures according to crops in rotation bulk density sand fraction and k s were inversely related to water outflow nitrate outflow n out n in and clay fraction for all dataset analyses this is very similar to pca analysis performed for cereal and maize cropping where both analysis groups consisting of bulk density sand k s and et were inversely related to a group consisting of water outflow precipitation and nitrate outflow n out and clay fraction other studies also found positive relationships between k s and sand content and negative between k s and clay content wesseling et al 2009 jarvis et al 2013 moreover present research confirms that soil texture dominantly determines the retention characteristics in most agricultural soils the bulk density increased with sand content mainly due to the lack of micropores expressed in sandy soils koolen and kuipers 1984 arvidsson 1998 in addition high compacted soils seem to mitigate leaching as is seen from negative interrelations between bulk density and water outflow n outflow and n out this process is visible under cereal maize and all other crops shown in fig 6 however the relationships seem to be the highest expressed under maize cropping table 4 also indicating a poor plant canopy impact under maize on elevated leaching and loss of n although investigated locations did not differ in tillage management and all farmers in study locations use conventional plowing tillage we believe that transition to non invertive or no tillage could help to reduce the n losses as is noted in other environments van den bossche et al 2009 xiao et al 2019 transition to conservation tillage improves the soil properties such as bulk density soil penetration resistance and soil particle size distribution wulanningtyas et al 2021 moreover non invertive tillage retains the residue on topsoil birkás et al 2008 contributing to n leaching preservation it is known that high density crops and cover crops positively impact leaching and n loss e g beaudoin et al 2005 abdalla et al 2019 and the long term study presented in this paper also confirms these findings cover crops and post harvest residues as sustainable agronomic practices can serve as means of reducing nitrate losses by taking up water and nitrate from the soil after the main crop is harvested and before the main crop begins to use significant amounts of water and n van den bossche et al 2009 shelton et al 2018 snapp and surapur 2018 overall the augmenting biomass of the covering crop can suppress the growth of weeds prevent nitrate leaching and aboveground biomass n and negatively affect the availability of inorganic n in the subsequent cropping season despite the increasingly important role the cover crops play the drawback can be identified with the reducing grain yield of the primary crop which can be avoided by choosing cover crops mixed with non legumes and legumes abdalla et al 2019 while the use of perennials in the cropping system helps in reducing nitrate leaching jungers et al 2019 and even though there still is a challenge in increasing their adoption due to the problems of identifying profitable and marketable crops faber et al 2012 there are promising perennial biomass crops that also hold multiple benefits for the agroecosystems and environment choi and entenmann 2019 in n management decision making understanding the relationship between n and crop rotation is of great importance due to several involvement points such as the rate of n mineralization osterholz et al 2017 or the possibility of improved soil physical properties tueche and hauser 2011 generally crop rotation strategies have high crop yields than mono cropping cultivation in addition the lesser n losses were discovered in a field planted with legumes miao et al 2011 it is also noted that n mineralization responding significantly to the n management is a crucial process promoting n uptake by crops and increasing n loss potential however the rate of n loss during the mineralization can be brought down by immobilizing mechanisms whose net n immobilization during immobilization mineralization and immobilization is reduced through the change of plowing time and fertilizer application chen et al 2014 crop rotations preserve the soil quality by improving carbon n and microbial biomass in soil mcdaniel et al 2014 and increasing crop rotational diversity also impacts positively the soil aggregation organic carbon total n alleviating the reducing agroecosystems services tiemann et al 2015 n fertilizer applications for rate timing and method should be explored in each particular environmental condition as their proper reduction and time of application could significantly reduce nitrate loss jeong and bhattarai 2018 management practices like the type of tillage and time number of fertilizer applications appear to be important factors for controlling the n uptake and losses it is well known that conservation or reduced tillage practice supports the slower n mineralization and lowers the potential risk of nitrate leaching van den bossche et al 2009 others also noted higher n efficiency in conservation compared to conventional tillage systems e g pandey et al 2010 watts et al 2010 xiao et al 2019 moreover the interactions between root soil microbial can stimulate soil n mineralization through rhizosphere priming effects raising the importance of fertilizing management affecting the crop s root functions zhu et al 2014 fertilizer management should be adjustable to environmental and plant conditions however it is a challenging task since fertilization usually increases gaseous n loss n leaching and plant yield shelton et al 2018 often a primary goal of farming 4 conclusions the simulated water flow and nitrate loss fitted well with the collected data the fitting was higher in years with higher precipitation which led to higher and more frequent lysimeter outflows thus resulting in more data points for model evaluation the r2 values for simulated water flow were 93 above 0 7 while r2 values for nitrate simulations had lower values being 73 above 0 7 the results of our research show that the use of the lysimeters data set in hydrus 1d can adequately address the water regime and nitrate dynamics in agricultural fields under long term cultivation with diverse crops the results of nitrate outflows in this study indicate that one dimensional modeling even though was found adequate could possibly produce better data in two or three dimensional simulations the leaching and accumulation of nitrate in the experimental site relating to water outflow were mainly affected by precipitation conditions soil properties and et for all locations the description of n was reflected well on the n uptake in an increasing trend in years with high transpiration rates however other main links in the field n cycle such as denitrification were underestimated and limitedly interpreted the pca capturing the connection of different soil parameters to n leaching characterized a negative correlation that combined 12 years dataset in exact cropping the pca highlighted other relationships between factor groups for long term planting of cereal and maize the outflow of nitrate and n out were inversely related to et sand bulk density and k s beyond that the three factors independently reacted distinctively with variables there is additional potential in adjusting the n management in agricultural fields to improve both economic and environmental outcomes e g a higher output of n was found for maize 16 6 than the cereal group 11 6 all locations l1 l6 had a decreasing trend of nitrate concentrations over the investigation period the research highlights the importance of exploring n fertilizer application in each particular environmental condition as proper reduction and time of application reduces nitrate loss the results indicate that using tools such as agro hydrological models may improve opportunities to ameliorate n management in agricultural fields in the future this information is critical to fine tuning n management in agricultural watersheds leading to improved n use efficiency lower n losses and protection of water quality in sensitive water bodies

9209,pressure compensating emitter pce is an important equipment to improve irrigation and fertigation uniformity of drip irrigation system due to multiple factors pce failure would lead to the whole drip irrigation system failure and consequently affect the crop growth however few studies reported the key reason and influential factors of pce failure yet therefore an in situ sampling study of pce which was collected from 16 different operating locations and all were operated for several years in the apple orchard was conducted in this paper the effects of water quality characteristics and climatic conditions on the fouling formation inside pce and the mechanical properties of the elastic diaphragm were analyzed the result indicated that the pce relative average discharge dra decreased by 4 65 33 19 after 3 9 years the phosphorus content average temperature suspended particles and ph showed significant impacts on fouling accumulation inside the pce flow channel particularly biofouling meanwhile the stretch rate elastic modulus tensile strength and the hardness of pce elastic diaphragm were mainly affected by humidity conditions longitude so4 2 content and ph both the fouling accumulation and elastic diaphragm variations synthetically decreased the dra of the drip irrigation system this study provides theoretical support to further improve the irrigation uniformity of drip irrigation systems keywords elastic diaphragm clogging water quality climatic conditions data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction high field irrigation uniformity is a prerequisite for high yielding and efficient agricultural production lópez mata et al 2010 pressure compensating emitters pce is one of the important equipment to improve irrigation uniformity and fertigation uniformity of drip irrigation system the main reason is the elastic diaphragm and other regulating media are the most critical and complex components inside the pressure compensating emitters pce a minimal deformation of the elastic diaphragm of pce under different working pressures regulate a relatively constant outflow sokol et al 2022 zeng et al 2018 however the incompatibility of applied fertilizers and their interaction with more substances included in low quality water sources further aggravate the pce clogging issue and even risks to the failure whole drip irrigation system bounoua et al 2016 niu et al 2013 numerous studies are currently being done to better understand why emitters clog in different irrigation water types and experimental settings these studies have shown that the characteristics of irrigation water quality were directly related to emitter clogging shen et al 2022 li et al 2019 2012 for instance the cations and anions commenly found in irrigation water would react with each other and lead to serious clogging issues muhammad et al 2021 according to umar and saaid 2013 the presence of carbonates provided nucleation sites for silicate growth and enhance the silicate scaling particularly microorganisms growth metabolism in the irrigation water could induce calcium carbonate to precipitate shen et al 2022 and meanwhile continuously adsorbed the suspended particles zhou et al 2016 considering the weather factors the higher temperature would reduce the calcium solubility and result in calcium carbonate precipitation el bouhali et al 2020 hou et al 2020 generally current research focused mostly on non pce having simpler geometrical structures of the internal flow channel the mechanism of pce with complex structures and tiny critical components remains unknown to a large extent few studies on pce failure and mainly analyzed the clogging parameters including the relative average discharge dra christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu el bouhali et al 2020 oliver et al 2016 looked into how inline type pce performance was impacted by changes in the air and water temperatures and chen et al 2021 evaluated the effects of pce elastic diaphragm deformation on internal flow field characteristics the majority of these studies were short term laboratory experiments based on a self designed testing platform with accelerated operating mode which mainly focused on single factor clogging research based on the integrated impacts and the decoupling effect of multiple factors under actual operating conditions were lacking especially the dynamic interactions of the pce flow channel clogging fouling deposition on the elastic diaphragm and its aging process under multiple factors were rarely reported we hypothesized the pce failure is primarily caused by fouling deposition in emitter flow channel and performance variations of the elastic diaphragm induced by the aging process fig 1 therefore in this paper pce was considered as an example and conducted an in situ sampling survey study from 16 different field locations the aims of this study are to 1 elucidate the accumulation of composite fouling and properties of pce elastic diaphragm under long term operating conditions 2 determine the impacts of multiple factors including water quality characteristics and weather conditions on composite fouling and elastic diaphragm properties 3 clarify the dynamic feedbacks between flow channel clogging and elastic diaphragm fouling accumulation and aging as well as their interactive influential pathway for pce failure 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and sample collection 16 pce drip irrigation systems in apple orchard fields at different latitudes and longitudes were selected to collect pce samples fig 2 the drip irrigation emitter samples were collected during the same pattern while irrigation fertilization and filtration mode standards are all consistent specific information is shown in supplementary materials table 1 illustrates the filed locations water sources applied operating mode and total operating time of drip irrigation systems while the inlet working pressures of drip laterals remains same 0 1 mpa water quality parameters are shown in fig s1 no significant differences were found between different water quality factors drip lateral was taken from the middle of the orchard in april 2021 each drip lateral was 100 m in length pce was installed evenly along the drip laterals with 0 3 m intervals and about 300 emitters were taken from each orchard the basic geometrical characteristics of pce are illustrated in table s2 2 2 evaluation of drip irrigation pce performance pce emitter performance was assessed using the average discharge variation rate dra dra was tested in april 2021 the following formula of dra ghaemi 1998 is shown in supplementary materials corresponding to a comprehensive description of pei et al 2014 the pces clogging rate distribution is categorized in supplementary materials 2 3 extraction and analysis of pce fouling substances 2 3 1 fouling substances dry weight the pce fouling substance s dry weight dw were tested by adopting the method of xiao et al 2021 dw was measured from 15 pce which were selected randomly at the inlet middle and outlet sections of each drip lateral the pce and their elastic diaphragm were dried at 60 c ovens for 20 h the dried pce and elastic diaphragm samples with fouling substances w1 were weighed using an electronic weight balance accuracy 10 4 g hereafter weighed the cleaned pce and elastic diaphragm samples again w2 the differences between w1 and w2 were calculated as the total content of dw mg cm2 2 3 2 mineral components in pce fouling substances the mineral components were characterized with the following method used by muhammad et al 2021 2 3 3 microbial biomass and extracellular polymeric substance eps total microbial biomass in freshly collected fouling substances was assessed using the quantitative real time pcr qpcr abi geneamp 9700 u s eps test referred to the method used by song et al 2021 phenol sulfuric acid methods were applied to detect the contents of extracellular polysaccharides in fouling substances dubois et al 1956 and the extracellular protein was tested by the lowry method lowry et al 1951 the confocal laser scanning microscope clsm nikon a1r si japan was used to detect the distributions of microbial biomass and eps firstly the fouling substances was stained by syto 63 which targeted the microbial cells then the sodium bicarbonate buffer was used to rinse the samples 3 times followed by adding the fluoresceinsothiocyanate 10 g l which was used to stain the proteins in the samples hereafter coneanavalina 0 25 g l and calconuorwhite 0 30 g l were used to stain the α and β extracellular polysaccharides each staining process lasted for 30 min in the dark phosphate buffer saline was used to rinse the samples between each process 2 3 4 microbial community analysis referring to the microbial community analysis method used by song et al 2021 the specific test method is shown in the supplementary material 2 4 mechanical properties of pce elastic diaphragm the shore hardness tester type a was used to assess the hardness of the pce elastic diaphragm and the universal testing machine type wdw 2a was used to quantify the elastic modulus tensile strength and stretch rate following the standard gb t 528 2009 tensile strength ts can be expressed by formula 1 1 ts f m w t where f m is the maximum force measured n w is the width of the cutter narrow section mm t is the thickness of the test length part measured mm stretch rate can be expressed by formula 2

linear discriminant analysis effect size lda effect size lefse was chosen to assess and identify species biomarkers that varied significantly between treatments structural equation modeling sem analysis was applied to describe the pathway regularity of water quality drip irrigation system operating time and weather condition effects on the pc emitter s multiple fouling and diaphragms

results and analysis 3 1 variation of pce clogging dw and elastic diaphragms mechanical properties pce dra fouling substances dw inside the flow channel and elastic diaphragms properties at different locations are shown in fig 3 after an accumulated operation pce dra decreased to 0 67 t7 0 92 t6 compared with t6 dra variation ratios of the emitter showed at the identical operating time were differ by 34 71 78 06 overall the dw of the elastic diaphragms and the flow channels ranged from 0 94 t6 3 64 t7 mg cm2 and 22 63 t6 87 12 t13 mg cm2 respectively compared with t6 the total dw of the elastic diaphragms and the flow channels showed at the identical operating time were differ by 28 75 45 17 18 77 124 14 respectively meanwhile the elastic diaphragm stretch rate elastic modulus tensile strength and diaphragm hardness were 22 24 24 04 1 21 1 73 mpa 7 23 7 67 mpa and 63 20 68 00ha respectively compared with t6 the variation ratios throughout the time were 50 28 117 07 24 54 112 62 51 96 117 82 62 82 123 51 respectively 3 2 variation of pce mineral components the primary mineral components in pce flow channels were characterized by xrd diffraction their variations collected at each location are depicted in fig 4 among the components muscovite quartz and calcite were predominant accounting for 13 6 39 9 13 1 61 1 and 0 3 66 3 respectively and these three mineral components maintained 70 of the total minerals altogether after classifying precipitate fouling mainly including feldspar calcite aragonite and goethite and particulate fouling mainly including quartz dolomite muscovite and chlorite occupied 32 6 97 9 2 1 67 4 respectively 3 3 microbial community characteristics and diversities of biofouling the bacterial community in pce biofouling sampling was collected from 16 different locations yielding a total of 2147678 sequences significant differences were found in bacterial richness index among different treatments where the t15 treatment was the highest and t5 treatment acquired the lowest values the shannon diversity index ranged between 2 11 and 5 42 fig 5a t15 treatment also obtained the highest value while t6 treatment was the lowest a total of 72 otus were found in all samples according to the venn diagram fig 5b and confirmed the homology of these samples tested meanwhile the unique otu in t15 treatment was 311 with the largest proportion and 4 otus found in t5 treatment was the lowest obviously the bacterial community of t15 treatment was significantly different from the other treatments using the bray curtis dissimilarity the first two principal components explained 43 35 of the bacterial community variance fig 5c and the treatments were significantly different p 0 001 r2 0 83 among them the t5 treatment was the furthest away from the t8 and t5 treatments indicating that the bacterial communities of these three were significantly different the dominant bacterial phyla fig 5d were proteobacteria 39 4 on average actinobacteriota 24 7 firmicutes 15 3 on average bacteroidota 7 03 on average chloroflexi 6 05 in average respectively while the other species accounted for a minor fraction of the bacterial community composition as for the genus level the dominant bacteria was acinetobacter with the highest relative abundance 13 20 followed by exiguobacterium 11 90 arthrobacter 8 69 bacteroidota 5 02 and chryseobacterium 4 25 lefse analysis was conducted to identify and compare unique bacterial taxa significantly related to each treatment the biomarkers bacterial groups were depicted in cladograms fig 5e and bacterial lda analysis detected 51 biomarkers the largest number of biomarkers belonging to phyla firmicutes were enriched in t2 treatment on the other hand the t15 treatment was significantly different from other treatments which showed the relative abundance advantages in two biomarkers o rhizobiales and c acidimicrobiia 3 4 influence of environmental factors on pce fouling substances multi level statistical method was applied to expound the impacts of environmental factors on the accumulation of pce fouling substances including the mineral components microbial community indexes dominant bacteria along with the elastic diaphragm properties fig 6 in addition the correlations among different bacteria water quality parameters and environmental factors are depicted in fig s3 for flow channel fouling dw the factors including the operating time phosphorus content suspended solids ph so4 2 average windspeed and average temperature were significantly correlated p 0 05 significant correlations were also found between mineral components with codcr ph latitude average wind speed average light duration average temperature etc p 0 05 among them the main factors affecting quartz were ph and latitude meanwhile the variation in mg2 and ca2 contents bod5 hardness and average light time presented a significant positive correlation with the microbial community diversity parameters ace and chao1 while the so4 2 content was negatively correlated p 0 05 as for the dominant bacteria the highest relative abundances were acquired at the phylum level in proteobacteria 39 4 and actinobacteriota 24 7 both of which were significantly correlated with temperature light time and humidity variations p 0 05 the correlations between environmental factors and elastic diaphragm properties dw and dra are also shown in fig 6 so4 2 content ph humidity and longitude were significantly related to the mechanical properties of the elastic diaphragms p 0 05 on their surfaces fouling substances dw was significantly affected by the operating time average temperature and average light time p 0 05 besides operating time suspended solids so4 2 content average wind speed and temperature showed significant impacts on the fouling substances dw inside the flow channel as well as the dra p 0 05 3 5 interactions among pce multiple fouling the elastic diaphragm and the clogging parameter structural equation model analysis sema was conducted to further characterize the direct and indirect impacts of pce multiple fouling on the performance of drip irrigation system fig 7 the variations of elastic diaphragm properties mineral components precipitates and particulates fouling and the biofouling directly affected the drip irrigation system dra reduction the effects of mineral components were relatively weaker β 0 24 than the effects of the elastic diaphragm properties variation and biofouling β 0 94 0 78 both environmental factors and operating time had significant impacts on the elastic diaphragm properties variation their absolute normalized path coefficients were 0 68 and 0 78 respectively the key influential factors of precipitate and particulate fouling were water quality characteristics β 0 55 and operating time β 0 57 consistent with biofouling β 0 58 0 65 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 influence of environmental factors on the elastic diaphragms our results indicated that the properties of the pce elastic diaphragm were primarily affected by so4 2 ph humidity change and longitude etc it was mainly due to the changes in the swelling of network structure and the rearrangement of rubber chains caused by environmental factors lou et al 2018 among the aforementioned factors ph and so4 2 were the crucial ones their variations would cause cross linking reactions and polymer chain breakage reducing the entanglement density in the amorphous phase and increasing defects in the crystalline area which in turn slowed down polymerization the properties of the elastic diaphragm were reduced as the result of its crystallinity liu et al 2020 in addition humidity temperature and irrigation frequency also significantly damaged elastic diaphragm properties at low temperatures the compression stress accelerated the loss of mechanical properties but it was constrained at higher temperatures liu et al 2020 lou et al 2018 rubber will break down more quickly when exposed to water and air alternately lou et al 2018 as its water soluble components and hydrophilic groups could be extracted broken down hydrolyzed or absorbed by water alexandre franco et al 2010 however the working pressure 0 1 mpa and temperature 5 35 c of all the sampling locations involved in this study were not significantly different under this condition the amount of fouling substances attached on the elastic diaphragm resulted in relatively less deformation which restricted its normal working ability this was due to the decreased sensitivity of working pressure variations which was caused by the adhesion of fouling substances induced by the water quality factors 4 2 influence of environmental factors on fouling substance in pce the drip irrigation system operating time phosphorus content suspended particles ph so4 2 content and average temperature was considered the key influential factors on the fouling substances inside pce flow channel among them suspended solids and so4 2 content showed direct impacts on fouling substance components bucks et al 1979 while the accumulated operating time directly determined the total fouling substance dw ph and other indicators presented significant impacts on the content of quartz 13 1 56 3 in the mineral components this could be attributed to the variation of irrigation water ph it not only affected the precipitation of fe2 and ca2 bucks et al 1979 but also influenced microbial activity katz et al 2014 the accumulation of fouling substances and microbial activities both were influenced by the environmental factors such as average temperature schwantes cezario et al 2017 the microbial community diversity parameters ace and chao1 were highly correlated with ca2 phosphorus and so4 2 contents while the mineral components were significantly correlated with codcr and bod5 this implied that different ions had obvious beneficial effects certain irrigation water microorganisms could lower ph and thus accumulate the precipitation of calcium carbonate schwantes cezario et al 2017 in addition being able to continuously adsorb suspended particulate matters wang et al 2021 pasquale et al 2019 song et al 2019 4 3 engineering applications the present study demonstrated the synergistic effects of the elastic diaphragm properties and composite fouling substances resulting in the failure of pce among them the changes in the elastic diaphragm properties β 0 94 and biofouling β 0 78 significantly decreased the pce dra with relatively weaker influences from the effect of the mineral components β 0 24 therefore for the drip irrigation system using the pce the influential factors on the elastic diaphragm deserved more attention than the deposition of fouling substances for instance ph had a considerable impact on the elastic diaphragm yet the constant addition of strong acids and chlorine in drip irrigation systems was considered the most common and critical technology to prevent the biofouling and chemical fouling de kreij et al 2003 zhao et al 2015 stated injecting strong acids and chlorine significantly affected the elastic diaphragm polymer chain therefore appropriate lateral flushing on a regular basis and adjusting working pressure were recommended in the pc drip irrigation system to maintain the performance at the same time lowering the irrigation frequency appropriately slow down the aging process of the elastic diaphragm rubber seals with little to no protection during oxidation may experience an acceleration of the degrading process due to oxygen liu et al 2018 haseeb et al 2010 however in order to control the precipitation and particulate fouling more effectively microorganisms should be preferentially removed as their accelerators biofouling and mineral components should be considered simultaneously to control the fouling substances deposition in pce flow channel pressman et al 2012 5 conclusions the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 significant differences were obtained in fouling substances dw on the elastic diaphragm surface and inside the pce flow channels as well as the elastic diaphragm properties among the samples collected from different locations p 0 05 their dra decreased by 4 65 33 14 meanwhile the accumulation rates of dw on the elastic diaphragm and inside flow channels varied by 43 62 110 50 42 12 125 07 respectively 2 the decreased dra was directly influenced by the variation of the elastic diaphragm properties biofouling and mineral components particulate and precipitate fouling among them the former two factors showed relatively stronger influences β 0 94 0 78 while the latter factor presented a comparatively weaker impact β 0 24 3 particulate and precipitate fouling biofouling and the elastic diaphragm properties were significantly different in pce p 0 05 fouling substances in pce were significantly influenced by operating time phosphorus contents suspended solids ph and normal temperature and the three main factors that affect elastic diaphragm properties were ph humidity variations and longitude despite the fact that the current study yielded several important findings there are some problems that require further research 1 the samples collected in this study at different locations contained environmental factors that were significantly different and maybe interacted characterizing the effects of each environmental factor requires indoor controllable experiments 2 for the prevention of pce failure more economical cost effective and efficient cleaning

9209,pressure compensating emitter pce is an important equipment to improve irrigation and fertigation uniformity of drip irrigation system due to multiple factors pce failure would lead to the whole drip irrigation system failure and consequently affect the crop growth however few studies reported the key reason and influential factors of pce failure yet therefore an in situ sampling study of pce which was collected from 16 different operating locations and all were operated for several years in the apple orchard was conducted in this paper the effects of water quality characteristics and climatic conditions on the fouling formation inside pce and the mechanical properties of the elastic diaphragm were analyzed the result indicated that the pce relative average discharge dra decreased by 4 65 33 19 after 3 9 years the phosphorus content average temperature suspended particles and ph showed significant impacts on fouling accumulation inside the pce flow channel particularly biofouling meanwhile the stretch rate elastic modulus tensile strength and the hardness of pce elastic diaphragm were mainly affected by humidity conditions longitude so4 2 content and ph both the fouling accumulation and elastic diaphragm variations synthetically decreased the dra of the drip irrigation system this study provides theoretical support to further improve the irrigation uniformity of drip irrigation systems keywords elastic diaphragm clogging water quality climatic conditions data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction high field irrigation uniformity is a prerequisite for high yielding and efficient agricultural production lópez mata et al 2010 pressure compensating emitters pce is one of the important equipment to improve irrigation uniformity and fertigation uniformity of drip irrigation system the main reason is the elastic diaphragm and other regulating media are the most critical and complex components inside the pressure compensating emitters pce a minimal deformation of the elastic diaphragm of pce under different working pressures regulate a relatively constant outflow sokol et al 2022 zeng et al 2018 however the incompatibility of applied fertilizers and their interaction with more substances included in low quality water sources further aggravate the pce clogging issue and even risks to the failure whole drip irrigation system bounoua et al 2016 niu et al 2013 numerous studies are currently being done to better understand why emitters clog in different irrigation water types and experimental settings these studies have shown that the characteristics of irrigation water quality were directly related to emitter clogging shen et al 2022 li et al 2019 2012 for instance the cations and anions commenly found in irrigation water would react with each other and lead to serious clogging issues muhammad et al 2021 according to umar and saaid 2013 the presence of carbonates provided nucleation sites for silicate growth and enhance the silicate scaling particularly microorganisms growth metabolism in the irrigation water could induce calcium carbonate to precipitate shen et al 2022 and meanwhile continuously adsorbed the suspended particles zhou et al 2016 considering the weather factors the higher temperature would reduce the calcium solubility and result in calcium carbonate precipitation el bouhali et al 2020 hou et al 2020 generally current research focused mostly on non pce having simpler geometrical structures of the internal flow channel the mechanism of pce with complex structures and tiny critical components remains unknown to a large extent few studies on pce failure and mainly analyzed the clogging parameters including the relative average discharge dra christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu el bouhali et al 2020 oliver et al 2016 looked into how inline type pce performance was impacted by changes in the air and water temperatures and chen et al 2021 evaluated the effects of pce elastic diaphragm deformation on internal flow field characteristics the majority of these studies were short term laboratory experiments based on a self designed testing platform with accelerated operating mode which mainly focused on single factor clogging research based on the integrated impacts and the decoupling effect of multiple factors under actual operating conditions were lacking especially the dynamic interactions of the pce flow channel clogging fouling deposition on the elastic diaphragm and its aging process under multiple factors were rarely reported we hypothesized the pce failure is primarily caused by fouling deposition in emitter flow channel and performance variations of the elastic diaphragm induced by the aging process fig 1 therefore in this paper pce was considered as an example and conducted an in situ sampling survey study from 16 different field locations the aims of this study are to 1 elucidate the accumulation of composite fouling and properties of pce elastic diaphragm under long term operating conditions 2 determine the impacts of multiple factors including water quality characteristics and weather conditions on composite fouling and elastic diaphragm properties 3 clarify the dynamic feedbacks between flow channel clogging and elastic diaphragm fouling accumulation and aging as well as their interactive influential pathway for pce failure 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and sample collection 16 pce drip irrigation systems in apple orchard fields at different latitudes and longitudes were selected to collect pce samples fig 2 the drip irrigation emitter samples were collected during the same pattern while irrigation fertilization and filtration mode standards are all consistent specific information is shown in supplementary materials table 1 illustrates the filed locations water sources applied operating mode and total operating time of drip irrigation systems while the inlet working pressures of drip laterals remains same 0 1 mpa water quality parameters are shown in fig s1 no significant differences were found between different water quality factors drip lateral was taken from the middle of the orchard in april 2021 each drip lateral was 100 m in length pce was installed evenly along the drip laterals with 0 3 m intervals and about 300 emitters were taken from each orchard the basic geometrical characteristics of pce are illustrated in table s2 2 2 evaluation of drip irrigation pce performance pce emitter performance was assessed using the average discharge variation rate dra dra was tested in april 2021 the following formula of dra ghaemi 1998 is shown in supplementary materials corresponding to a comprehensive description of pei et al 2014 the pces clogging rate distribution is categorized in supplementary materials 2 3 extraction and analysis of pce fouling substances 2 3 1 fouling substances dry weight the pce fouling substance s dry weight dw were tested by adopting the method of xiao et al 2021 dw was measured from 15 pce which were selected randomly at the inlet middle and outlet sections of each drip lateral the pce and their elastic diaphragm were dried at 60 c ovens for 20 h the dried pce and elastic diaphragm samples with fouling substances w1 were weighed using an electronic weight balance accuracy 10 4 g hereafter weighed the cleaned pce and elastic diaphragm samples again w2 the differences between w1 and w2 were calculated as the total content of dw mg cm2 2 3 2 mineral components in pce fouling substances the mineral components were characterized with the following method used by muhammad et al 2021 2 3 3 microbial biomass and extracellular polymeric substance eps total microbial biomass in freshly collected fouling substances was assessed using the quantitative real time pcr qpcr abi geneamp 9700 u s eps test referred to the method used by song et al 2021 phenol sulfuric acid methods were applied to detect the contents of extracellular polysaccharides in fouling substances dubois et al 1956 and the extracellular protein was tested by the lowry method lowry et al 1951 the confocal laser scanning microscope clsm nikon a1r si japan was used to detect the distributions of microbial biomass and eps firstly the fouling substances was stained by syto 63 which targeted the microbial cells then the sodium bicarbonate buffer was used to rinse the samples 3 times followed by adding the fluoresceinsothiocyanate 10 g l which was used to stain the proteins in the samples hereafter coneanavalina 0 25 g l and calconuorwhite 0 30 g l were used to stain the α and β extracellular polysaccharides each staining process lasted for 30 min in the dark phosphate buffer saline was used to rinse the samples between each process 2 3 4 microbial community analysis referring to the microbial community analysis method used by song et al 2021 the specific test method is shown in the supplementary material 2 4 mechanical properties of pce elastic diaphragm the shore hardness tester type a was used to assess the hardness of the pce elastic diaphragm and the universal testing machine type wdw 2a was used to quantify the elastic modulus tensile strength and stretch rate following the standard gb t 528 2009 tensile strength ts can be expressed by formula 1 1 ts f m w t where f m is the maximum force measured n w is the width of the cutter narrow section mm t is the thickness of the test length part measured mm stretch rate can be expressed by formula 2 2 e s 100 l s l 0 l 0 where l s is the stretched length mm l 0 is the initial length mm 2 5 statistical analysis by using the paired t test in spss ver 20 0 ibm usa the significant differences between

results and analysis 3 1 variation of pce clogging dw and elastic diaphragms mechanical properties pce dra fouling substances dw inside the flow channel and elastic diaphragms properties at different locations are shown in fig 3 after an accumulated operation pce dra decreased to 0 67 t7 0 92 t6 compared with t6 dra variation ratios of the emitter showed at the identical operating time were differ by 34 71 78 06 overall the dw of the elastic diaphragms and the flow channels ranged from 0 94 t6 3 64 t7 mg cm2 and 22 63 t6 87 12 t13 mg cm2 respectively compared with t6 the total dw of the elastic diaphragms and the flow channels showed at the identical operating time were differ by 28 75 45 17 18 77 124 14 respectively meanwhile the elastic diaphragm stretch rate elastic modulus tensile strength and diaphragm hardness were 22 24 24 04 1 21 1 73 mpa 7 23 7 67 mpa and 63 20 68 00ha respectively compared with t6 the variation ratios throughout the time were 50 28 117 07 24 54 112 62 51 96 117 82 62 82 123 51 respectively 3 2 variation of pce mineral components the primary mineral components in pce flow channels were characterized by xrd diffraction their variations collected at each location are depicted in fig 4 among the components muscovite quartz and calcite were predominant accounting for 13 6 39 9 13 1 61 1 and 0 3 66 3 respectively and these three mineral components maintained 70 of the total minerals altogether after classifying precipitate fouling mainly including feldspar calcite aragonite and goethite and particulate fouling mainly including quartz dolomite muscovite and chlorite occupied 32 6 97 9 2 1 67 4 respectively 3 3 microbial community characteristics and diversities of biofouling the bacterial community in pce biofouling sampling was collected from 16 different locations yielding a total of 2147678 sequences significant differences were found in bacterial richness index among different treatments where the t15 treatment was the highest and t5 treatment acquired the lowest values the shannon diversity index ranged between 2 11 and 5 42 fig 5a t15 treatment also obtained the highest value while t6 treatment was the lowest a total of 72 otus were found in all samples according to the venn diagram fig 5b and confirmed the homology of these samples tested meanwhile the unique otu in t15 treatment was 311 with the largest proportion and 4 otus found in t5 treatment was the lowest obviously the bacterial community of t15 treatment was significantly different from the other treatments using the bray curtis dissimilarity the first two principal components explained 43 35 of the bacterial community variance fig 5c and the treatments were significantly different p 0 001 r2 0 83 among them the t5 treatment was the furthest away from the t8 and t5 treatments indicating that the bacterial communities of these three were significantly different the dominant bacterial phyla fig 5d were proteobacteria 39 4 on average actinobacteriota 24 7 firmicutes 15 3 on average bacteroidota 7 03 on average chloroflexi 6 05 in average respectively while the other species accounted for a minor fraction of the bacterial community composition as for the genus level the dominant bacteria was acinetobacter with the highest relative abundance 13 20 followed by exiguobacterium 11 90 arthrobacter 8 69 bacteroidota 5 02 and chryseobacterium 4 25 lefse analysis was conducted to identify and compare unique bacterial taxa significantly related to each treatment the biomarkers bacterial groups were depicted in cladograms fig 5e and bacterial lda analysis detected 51 biomarkers the largest number of biomarkers belonging to phyla firmicutes were enriched in t2 treatment on the other hand the t15 treatment was significantly different from other treatments which showed the relative abundance advantages in two biomarkers o rhizobiales and c acidimicrobiia 3 4 influence of environmental factors on pce fouling substances multi level statistical method was applied to expound the impacts of environmental factors on the accumulation of pce fouling substances including the mineral components microbial community indexes dominant bacteria along with the elastic diaphragm properties fig 6 in addition the correlations among different bacteria water quality parameters and environmental factors are depicted in fig s3 for flow channel fouling dw the factors including the operating time phosphorus content suspended solids ph so4 2 average windspeed and average temperature were significantly correlated p 0 05 significant correlations were also found between mineral components with codcr ph latitude average wind speed average light duration average temperature etc p 0 05 among them the main factors affecting quartz were ph and latitude meanwhile the variation in mg2 and ca2 contents bod5 hardness and average light time presented a significant positive correlation with the microbial community diversity parameters ace and chao1 while the so4 2 content was negatively correlated p 0 05 as for the dominant bacteria the highest relative abundances were acquired at the phylum level in proteobacteria 39 4 and actinobacteriota 24 7 both of which were significantly correlated with temperature light time and humidity variations p 0 05 the correlations between environmental factors and elastic diaphragm properties dw and dra are also shown in fig 6 so4 2 content ph humidity and longitude were significantly related to the mechanical properties of the elastic diaphragms p 0 05 on their surfaces fouling substances dw was significantly affected by the operating time average temperature and average light time p 0 05 besides operating time suspended solids so4 2 content average wind speed and temperature showed significant impacts on the fouling substances dw inside the flow channel as well as the dra p 0 05 3 5 interactions among pce multiple fouling the elastic diaphragm and the clogging parameter structural equation model analysis sema was conducted to further characterize the direct and indirect impacts of pce multiple fouling on the performance of drip irrigation system fig 7 the variations of elastic diaphragm properties mineral components precipitates and particulates fouling and the biofouling directly affected the drip irrigation system dra reduction the effects of mineral components were relatively weaker β 0 24 than the effects of the elastic diaphragm properties variation and biofouling β 0 94 0 78 both environmental factors and operating time had significant impacts on the elastic diaphragm properties variation their absolute normalized path coefficients were 0 68 and 0 78 respectively the key influential factors of precipitate and particulate fouling were water quality characteristics β 0 55 and operating time β 0 57 consistent with biofouling β 0 58 0 65 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 influence of environmental factors on the elastic diaphragms our results indicated that the properties of the pce elastic diaphragm were primarily affected by so4 2 ph humidity change and longitude etc it was mainly due to the changes in the swelling of network structure and the rearrangement of rubber chains caused by environmental factors lou et al 2018 among the aforementioned factors ph and so4 2 were the crucial ones their variations would cause cross linking reactions and polymer chain breakage reducing the entanglement density in the amorphous phase and increasing defects in the crystalline area which in turn slowed down polymerization the properties of the elastic diaphragm were reduced as the result of its crystallinity liu et al 2020 in addition humidity temperature and irrigation frequency also significantly damaged elastic diaphragm properties at low temperatures the compression stress accelerated the loss of mechanical properties but it was constrained at higher temperatures liu et al 2020 lou et al 2018 rubber will break down more quickly when exposed to water and air alternately lou et al 2018 as its water soluble components and hydrophilic groups could be extracted broken down hydrolyzed or absorbed by water alexandre franco et al 2010 however the working pressure 0 1 mpa and temperature 5 35 c of all the sampling locations involved in this study were not significantly different under this condition the amount of fouling substances attached on the elastic diaphragm resulted in relatively less deformation which restricted its normal working ability this was due to the decreased sensitivity of working pressure variations which was caused by the adhesion of fouling substances induced by the water quality factors 4 2 influence of environmental factors on fouling substance in pce the drip irrigation system operating time phosphorus content suspended particles ph so4 2 content and average temperature was considered the key influential factors on the fouling substances inside pce flow channel among them suspended solids and so4 2 content showed direct impacts on fouling substance components bucks et al 1979 while the accumulated operating time directly determined the total fouling substance dw ph and other indicators presented significant impacts on the content of quartz 13 1 56 3 in the mineral components this could be attributed to the variation of irrigation water ph it not only affected the precipitation of fe2 and ca2 bucks et al 1979 but also influenced microbial activity katz et al 2014 the accumulation of fouling substances and microbial activities both were influenced by the environmental factors such as average temperature schwantes cezario et al 2017 the microbial community diversity parameters ace and chao1 were highly correlated with ca2 phosphorus and so4 2 contents while the mineral components were significantly correlated with codcr and bod5 this implied that different ions had obvious beneficial effects certain irrigation water microorganisms could lower ph and thus accumulate the precipitation of calcium carbonate schwantes cezario et al 2017 in addition being able to continuously adsorb suspended particulate matters wang et al 2021 pasquale et al 2019 song et al 2019 4 3 engineering applications the present study demonstrated the synergistic effects of the elastic diaphragm properties and composite fouling substances resulting in the failure of pce among them the changes in the elastic diaphragm properties β 0 94 and biofouling β 0 78 significantly decreased the pce dra with relatively weaker influences from the effect of the mineral components β 0 24 therefore for the drip irrigation system using the pce the influential factors on the elastic diaphragm deserved more attention than the deposition of fouling substances for instance ph had a considerable impact on the elastic diaphragm yet the constant addition of strong acids and chlorine in drip irrigation systems was considered the most common and critical technology to prevent the biofouling and chemical fouling de kreij et al 2003 zhao et al 2015 stated injecting strong acids and chlorine significantly affected the elastic diaphragm polymer chain therefore appropriate lateral flushing on a regular basis and adjusting working pressure were recommended in the pc drip irrigation system to maintain the performance at the same time lowering the irrigation frequency appropriately slow down the aging process of the elastic diaphragm rubber seals with little to no protection during oxidation may experience an acceleration of the degrading process due to oxygen liu et al 2018 haseeb et al 2010 however in order to control the precipitation and particulate fouling more effectively microorganisms should be preferentially removed as their accelerators biofouling and mineral components should be considered simultaneously to control the fouling substances deposition in pce flow channel pressman et al 2012 5 conclusions the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 significant differences were obtained in fouling substances dw on the elastic diaphragm surface and inside the pce flow channels as well as the elastic diaphragm properties among the samples collected from different locations p 0 05 their dra decreased by 4 65 33 14 meanwhile the accumulation rates of dw on the elastic diaphragm and inside flow channels varied by 43 62 110 50 42 12 125 07 respectively 2 the decreased dra was directly influenced by the variation of the elastic diaphragm properties biofouling and mineral components particulate and precipitate fouling among them the former two factors showed relatively stronger influences β 0 94 0 78 while the latter factor presented a comparatively weaker impact β 0 24 3 particulate and precipitate fouling biofouling and the elastic diaphragm properties were significantly different in pce p 0 05 fouling substances in pce were significantly influenced by operating time phosphorus contents suspended solids ph and normal

there are some problems that require further research 1 the samples collected in this study at different locations contained environmental factors that were significantly different and maybe
