15425,the triplet states of dissolved organic matter 3dom have been well known to oxidize various organic contaminants but evidence of their reducing properties are largely scarce in this work chlorine dioxide clo2 as a single electron oxidant was used as a probe to evaluate the reduction property of 3dom the reduction of clo2 to chlorite was observed in the solutions of model photosensitizers i e 4 carboxybenzophenone benzophenone acetophenone 3 methoxyacetophenone naphthalene and xanthone during uv irradiation with the presence of clo2 though they are resistant to clo2 oxidation in the dark the reducing property of the triplet states of photosensitizers was verified and their second order reaction rate constants with clo2 were determined to be in the range of 1 45 0 03 109 2 18 0 06 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 the quenching tests excluded the role of other reactive species e g ho o 3p cl clo and hocl ocl o2 and eaq in clo2 reduction to chlorite when using model photosensitizers and dom isolates chlorite formation was 48 1 90 4 and 4812 8 7721 8 higher during uv irradiation with the presence of clo2 and dom than those without uv irradiation or without dom present respectively the enhancement was attributed to the enhanced electron donating capacity chlorite precursors of dom upon uv irradiation and also to 3dom acting as an electron donor reducing clo2 to chlorite this study highlighted the important role of 3dom as a reductant graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter dom triplet state chlorine dioxide chlorite uv irradiation water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a complex mixture of organic molecules and is ubiquitously present in aquatic environments the photochemical properties of dom are of interest due to its important role in controlling the fate and transport of contaminants and driving biogeochemical element cycling mcneill and canonica 2016 parker and mitch 2016 zhang et al 2020 upon light absorption the chromophores within dom are excited to a singlet excited state 1dom which quickly evolves to the triplet state 3dom through intersystem crossing mcneill and canonica 2016 nie et al 2022 3dom is known to be a precursor of other reactive species e g dom 1o2 etc and has been reported to be involved in phototransformation of a variety groups of contaminants in water chen et al 2018a grandbois et al 2008 huang et al 2022 zhang et al 2014 3dom mainly reacts with organic contaminants through energy transfer or electron transfer reaction pathways pan et al 2020 porras et al 2014 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 3dom can transfer energy to o2 to form 1o2 and to dienes to cause isomerization grebel et al 2011 mcneill and canonica 2016 ossola et al 2021 sharpless and blough 2014 3dom could be a good oxidant as incoming electrons can occupy its lower energy singly occupied molecular orbital somo mcneill and canonica 2016 nie et al 2022 the oxidative reactivity of 3dom has been widely studied and the reduction potential versus normal hydrogen electrode of 3dom e0 3dom dom was estimated at 1 6 to 1 8 vnhe parker and mitch 2016 amine and phenolic containing contaminants are susceptible to be oxidized by 3dom via donating an electron pan et al 2020 3dom could also be a strong reductant since it requires less energy to promote one electron to a higher somo compared to the ground state dom mcneill and canonica 2016 nie et al 2022 the oxidation potential of 3dom e0 3dom dom was estimated at 0 18 vnhe to 0 6 vnhe while direct evidence of 3dom sensitized photoreduction is scant mcneill and canonica 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 photosensitized dehalogenation of chlorine containing compounds such as chlorothalonil and mirex has been reported porras et al 2014 susan et al 1996 1997 hydrated electrons eaq in homogenous solutions or in intra humic environment or energy transfer was found to attribute to their degradation the reductive decomposition of bromate by 3dom in ice has been proposed min and choi 2017 though the reduction was apparent only at high bromate concentrations 0 1 0 2 m and at ph 3 based on the fluorescence quenching results recently the transformation of peroxymonosulfate to sulfate radical so4 by 3dom under sunlight was confirmed through the detection of generated radicals i e so4 1o2 and ho nie et al 2022 so far the reduction directly from 3dom still needs further identification experimental results with the triplet states of model photosentisizers indicate that they have good reducing capacity erickson et al 2015 lambert and kochevar 1997 romero and nicewicz 2016 for example the oxidation potential versus standard carbon electrode of rose bengal dianion rb2 e0 rb rb2 decreased from 1 09 vsce to 0 68 vsce after excitation to its triplet state 3rb2 lambert and kochevar 1997 other model photosentisizers such as benzophenone bp erythrosine er2 eosin y ey2 have been reported to reduce onium compounds e g methyl viologen and paraquat due to their low triplet state oxidation potentials e0 3bp bp 0 61 vsce e0 3er2 er 1 0 vsce e0 3ey2 ey 1 58 vsce romero and nicewicz 2016 the lack of evidence of 3dom as a reductant may in part arise from the fact that after transferring an electron from 3dom to a target compound tc tc is formed eq 1 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 dissolved o2 in the water may quickly re oxidize tc back to its parent compound tc making the reduction transformation invisible eq 2 zhou et al 2017 also the capture of transient spectra of tc is difficult and transient resolved spectroscopy is often needed 1 3 dom tc do m t c 2 o 2 t c o 2 tc here we propose to use clo2 to evaluate the reducing properties of 3dom due to following reasons firstly clo2 is an oxidant with unpaired electrons and the formation of chlorite can only proceed via electron transfer pathways from precursors e g phenolic compounds to clo2 gan et al 2020 thus the generation of chlorite is an indicator of the reductivity of the precursors eq 3 secondly the reduction potential of clo2 e0 clo2 clo2 0 95 vnhe is higher than that of o2 e0 o2 o2 0 18 vnhe sheng et al 2014 thus the oxidation of clo2 by o2 is impossible which bars the reverse pathway of eq 2 finally chlorite is much more stable than the transient species and can be easily tracked by ion chromatograph our previous study found the significant increases in chlorite formation in the simultaneous uv irradiation and clo2 oxidation of dom compared to clo2 alone kong et al 2021 this also suggested the involvement of photosensitized dom in chlorite formation 3 3 do m cl o 2 do m clo 2 this study aims to investigate the reducing properties of photosensitized dom by tracking the reduction of clo2 to chlorite the experiments provided the evidence of single electron transfer reduction reactions proceeding from 3dom and the triplet states of model photosensitizers both steady state photolysis experiments and transient resolved spectroscopy were applied to assess the reduction reactions of 3dom and the triplet states of model photosensitizers the results have important implications for understanding the aquatic photochemistry of 3dom and further understanding the role of dom in natural waters and engineered water treatment processes 2 materials and methods

sulfuric acid according to the standard method the concentrations of the clo2 stock solution were analyzed using the n n diethyl p phenylene diamine colorimetric method and confirmed to be free of chlorine apha 1998 2 2 experimental procedures uv irradiation at 254 nm was provided by a low pressure mercury lamp 8 w and the setup is shown in fig s1 the uv light irradiates vertically on a cylindrical quartz reactor 7 5 cm in diameter 0 5 cm in height volume 22 ml which contained a sampling port 1 5 cm in diameter fitted with a ground quartz stopper to prevent evaporation the uv lamp was warmed up at least 30 min before experiments the incident uv flux e in this work was determined to be 1 7 w m 2 by using iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2006 uv irradiation at 254 nm was chosen due to the higher formation yields of 3dom than at longer wavelengths and its popular uses in water treatment works lester et al 2013 the dom or model compounds were diluted to 2 mgc l 1 at ph 7 0 with 5 mm phosphate buffer for the tests with simultaneous uv irradiation and clo2 addition 50 μm clo2 was spiked into the solution at the start of the uv irradiation at pre determined time intervals 5 ml samples were collected and purged with nitrogen to remove residual clo2 ethylenediamine 50 mg l 1 was added to remove any free chlorine according to usepa method 300 1 usepa 1997 the

before starting the reactions the concentrations of residual clo2 in the experiments were analyzed in parallel tests using the colorimetric method control tests were conducted of clo2 oxidation without uv irradiation for some tests the samples were uv pre irradiated for 1 20 min before the clo2 was added for further reaction in the dark that was denoted as pre uv clo2 treatment three replicates were undertaken for each experiment and the error bars in the corresponding figures represent the standard error 2 3 determination of the quenching rate constants of the triplet states of photosensitizers by clo2 the second order quenching rate constants for the triplet states of photosensitizers 3ps by clo2 k 3 p s clo 2 eq 4 were obtained through transient resolved spectroscopy tests at room temperature 25 2 c briefly a lks80 laser flash photolysis system applied photophysics ltd uk was employed using the fourth harmonic mode of a nd yag laser 266 nm the solution ph was buffered to 7 0 with 5 mm phosphate buffer six photosensitizers i e 4 carboxybenzophenone benzophenone acetophenone naphthalene xanthone and 3 methoxyacetophenone were chosen in this work based on the following criteria 1 they can be excited to the triplet states upon uv irradiation 2 their ground states do not react with clo2 to form chlorite 3 the transient absorbance signals of their triplet states are able to be observed by using laser flash photolysis the decay traces of the transient absorption spectra of the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone benzophenone acetophenone naphthalene xanthone and 3 methoxyacetophenone peaking at 415 525 450 400 590 and 395 nm respectively jammoul et al 2009 merkel and dinnocenzo 2008 timepe and kronfeld 1989 wenk et al 2013b were tracked in solutions containing different concentrations of clo2 the absorption of clo2 itself was automatically deducted by the instrument for each sample the photosensitizer concentration was set at 0 25 mm except for benzophenone and xanthone which was dosed at 0 1 mm and 0 05 mm respectively the kinetics signals were averaged from 6 replicate laser shots the second order quenching rate constants were obtained by linearly fitting the pseudo first order decay rates of the triplet states of photosensitizers to the concentration of spiked clo2 4 3 ps clo 2 ps clo 2 2 4 analytical methods chlorite and chlorate were analyzed using a dionex ics 600 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific usa equipped with a dionex ionpac as19 anionic column 4 µm 4 250 mm clo2 concentrations were determined on a hachdr2800 residual chlorine analyzer using the n n diethyl p phenylene diamine colorimetric method the dissolved organic carbon concentrations of the dom stock solutions were analyzed using a toc lcph total organic carbon analyzer from shimadzu the electron donating capacity edc of srdom before and after uv irradiation was determined using a dionex ultimate 3000 size exclusion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific usa followed by a post column reaction with an abts solution for edc monitored at 405 nm see the details in text s1 of the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorite formation from the reduction of clo2 by the triplet states of photosensitizers due to the complexity of dom the triplet states of photosensitizers were firstly applied by using 4 carboxybenzophenone an aromatic ketone compound as an example in preparatory experiments pan et al 2020 wenk et al 2013b fig 1a shows that 4 carboxybenzophenone 12 µm did not react with clo2 to form chlorite in the dark after the 4 carboxybenzophenone solution was pre irradiated at uv dose of 204 mj cm 2 corresponding to 20 min irradiation in this work the subsequent addition of clo2 50 µm in dark still did not result in chlorite formation during uv irradiation with clo2 present however chlorite acted as the major reduction product from clo2 fig s2 whose formation increased linearly with reaction time and reached 15 09 0 31 µm after 20 min fig 1a while in ultrapure water without 4 carboxybenzophenone present 0 35 0 01 μm chlorite could be formed after 20 min of uv irradiation with the presence of 50 µm clo2 fig 1a the much greater chlorite formation with 4 carboxybenzophenone present indicates synergy between uv irradiation and clo2 oxidation other photosensitizers including aromatic ketone model compounds i e benzophenone acetophenone xanthone and 3 methoxyacetophenone and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon i e naphthalene were also tested chlorite formation from benzophenone 12 8 µm acetophenone 20 8 µm naphthalene 16 7 µm 3 methoxyacetophenone 18 5 µm and xanthone 12 8 µm during uv irradiation with the presence of clo2 all showed linear increases with reaction time though no chlorite formation was detectable during clo2 treatment after uv pre irradiation or clo2 oxidation alone fig 1b to explore the reactive species involved in chlorite formation quenching tests were conducted using 4 carboxybenzophenone as a representative compound with results shown in fig 1c excess tba 100 mm did not affect chlorite formation excluding the involvement of reactive species such as ho cl o 3p and clo cheng et al 2019 wu et al 2017 ccl4 addition 0 1 mm showed no effects on chlorite formation either excluding the role of eaq meisel et al 1977 the addition of glycine 0 5 mm and sod 50 u ml 1 showed their predominant role in quenching hocl ocl or o2 gan et al 2019 sheng et al 2014 respectively but they did not affect chlorite formation suggesting negligible roles for both hocl ocl and o2 enhanced chlorite formation was observed after purging the solution with ar whereas a significant reduction in chlorite formation was observed when purging with o2 this is because that o2 is a quencher of the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone latch and mcneill 2006 and ar purging could prolong the lifetime of triplet states purging with n2o an eaq captor showed similar enhanced chlorite formation as ar purging and the results also excluded the role of eaq zhang et al 2021 transient resolved spectroscopy was used to provide the direct evidence of interaction between the triplet states of photosensitizers and clo2 eq 3 as fig 1d shows the transient adsorption at 415 nm a characteristic signal of the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone wenk et al 2013b decays faster with increasing clo2 concentrations confirming the direct quenching of the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone by clo2 by fitting the pseudo first order decay rates of the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone to the concentration of spiked clo2 the second order reaction rate constant for the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone with clo2 k 3 cbb p cl o 2 was calculated to be 1 48 0 05 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 the analogous k 3 p s cl o 2 values for the triplet states of other photosensitizers tested at ph 7 0 fell in the range 1 45 0 03 to 2 18 0 06 109 m 1 s 1 fig s3 notably the k 3 p s cl o 2 values showed no relationship with the reduction potentials of the triplet states of these photosensitizers table s2 the oxidation potentials were only available for the triplet states of benzophenone 0 61 vsce and xanthone 1 42 vsce table s2 their k 3 p s cl o 2 values were determined to be 2 18 0 06 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 61 0 22 109 m 1 s 1 respectively fig s3 the chlorite formation rate rchlorite in treating 4 carboxybenzophenone by the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 can be obtained b fitting the experimentally determined chlorite concentration chlorite at every reaction time t as in eq 5 here the rchlorite is all attributable to the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone according to the above results 5 r chlorite d chlorite dt the rchlorite was computed in reactions with irradiated 4 carboxybenzophenone with different clo2 additions the oxygenation conditions were oxic saturated with normal air with the initial dissolved o2 concentration at 250 µm and also anoxic realized by ar purging and keeping the dissolved o2 concentration below 6 25 µm fig s4 presents results showing that rchlorite increased non linearly with increasing clo2 from 0 to 150 µm and rchlorite in anoxic conditions was always higher than in oxic conditions due to the elimination of triplet states quenching by dissolved o2 these results suggest that the formation of the triplet states of photosensitizers can be attributed to photoexcitation by uv light the triplet states of photosensitizers decay during the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 would be due at least in part to quenching by dissolved o2 and clo2 as shown in fig 2 3 2 enhanced chlorite formation in dom photosensitized reduction of clo2 3 2 1 enhanced chlorite formation in simultaneous uv irradiation and clo2 oxidation of dom in ultrapure water with no dom present no chlorite was formed in clo2 oxidation alone in the dark during uv irradiation with the presence of clo2 0 35 0 01 μm chlorite was formed with clo2 dosing at 50 μm and uv fluence of 204 mj cm 2 20 min irradiation fig 3a the reactive species generated during clo2 photolysis such as o 3p ocl ho and clo may contribute to chlorite formation eqs 6 and 7 buxton and subhani 1972 klaning 1985 6 o 3 p ocl clo 2 k 9 4 10 9 m 1 s 1 7 h o clo clo 2 h k 1 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 in the presence of different dom isolates each at 2 mgc l 1 the concentrations of chlorite generated from clo2 oxidation alone varied from 9 62 0 05 to 17 66 0 84 µm after 20 min fig 3a reactive phenols amines and other aromatic compounds found in dom are known to reduce clo2 to form chlorite gan et al 2020 2019 in the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 the formation of chlorite was enhanced by 7 57 10 82 µm after 20 min with different dom isolates present that amounts to a 48 1 to 90 4 increase compared to clo2 oxidation in the dark fig 3a for example chlorite formation was 12 97 0 03 µm after 20 min of dark clo2 oxidation of srdom but it increased by 66 to 21 53 0 01 µm after 20 min of uv irradiation with the co presence of clo2 that far exceeded the formation in the absence of dom 0 35 0 01 μm note that the clo2 consumption showed good mass balance with the sum concentrations of chlorite chloride and chlorate fig s5 fig 3b displays the evolution of chlorite formation in the presence of srdom from clo2 dark oxidation and co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 the difference in chlorite formation between the two processes increases linearly r2 0 986 with the reaction time the formation of chlorite with other dom isolates also showed a similar trend fig s6 these results indicate the synergy between uv and clo2 in chlorite formation when dom is present and additional chlorite formation pathway involving dom may exist chromophores in dom mainly including quinone like components aromatic ketones aldehydes etc are known to absorb uv photons and generate some reactive intermediates ma et al 2020 mcneill and canonica 2016 nie et al 2022 zhang and blough 2016 zhang et al 2012 therefore quenching tests were also conducted in srdom solutions to explore the reactive species involved in chlorite formation with results shown in fig s7 the addition of excessive tba 100 mm glycine 0 5 mm ccl4 0 1 mm and sod 50 u ml 1 did not influence the formation of chlorite when treating srdom by the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 10 difference with the control the results ruled out the roles of the oxidative reactive species e g ho cl o 3p clo and hocl ocl and reductive reactive species e g eaq and o2 in the enhanced chlorite formation in srdom solutions cheng et al 2019 gan et al 2019 meisel et al 1977 sheng et al 2014 wu et al 2017 thus the enhanced chlorite formation was attributed to other species from dom photosensitizing based on previous researches quinone like compounds in dom can be destroyed by light irradiation and transferred to phenols gorner 2003 gu et al 2017 pochon et al 2002 which can act as precursors of chlorite gan et al 2020 huang et al 2018 thus light induced decomposition of dom may lead to the changes in the redox active moieties in the dom and favor the formation of chlorite precursors as proposed in fig 4 gorner 2003 gu et al 2017 pochon et al 2002 meanwhile 3dom a reductant similar as the triplet states of model photosensitizers may directly reduce clo2 to chlorite as provided in fig 2 these two aspects were discussed below separately 3 2 2 the generation of chlorite precursors after uv pre irradiation of dom to probe the changes in chlorite precursors the srdom solution was pre irradiated under uv light for 10 2 204 mj cm 2 1 20 min irradiation after which clo2 50 µm was dosed to evaluate chlorite formation as fig 5a shows pre irradiated srdom generated more chlorite during clo2 oxidation one min of uv pre irradiation enhanced the formation of chlorite over 20 min by 8 1 after 5 10 and 20 min of pre irradiation the enhancements were 20 18 23 12 and 24 96 respectively the antioxidant moieties in dom have been reported to correlate with chlorite formation gan et al 2019 the edc of the un irradiated and irradiated srdom were therefore compared interestingly the edc of srdom increased from 2 39 0 11 µ m e mg c 1 to 2 43 0 15 µ m e mg c 1 after 1 min of uv pre irradiation and to 2 71 0 11 µ m e mg c 1 after 5 min fig 5b prolonging uv pre irradiation time from 10 min to 20 min did not further change the edc values significantly it should be noted that the edc values may decrease when the irradiation time is prolonged to days due to photooxidation and photobleaching sharpless et al 2014 additionally the enhancement in edc correlated well with the enhancement in chlorite formation r2 0 971 fig s8 phenolic compounds are known to be dominant moieties contributing to dom s edc wenk et al 2013a and they can quickly react with clo2 k in the range of 101 to 108 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 to form chlorite gan et al 2020 as quinones can be transformed to phenolic compounds under uv irradiation chen et al 2018b gorner 2003 wan et al 2020 the enhanced phenolic content may also contribute to enhancing chlorite formation model quinone compounds were further used to test for the hypothesized precursor generation as shown in fig 5c 1 4 benzoquinone generated hardly any chlorite after reaction with clo2 however after 1 min of uv pre irradiation 22 66 2 66 μm chlorite was formed in 20 min after 5 min of uv pre irradiation 33 67 0 83 µm chlorite was formed further increasing the uv pre irradiation time from 5 to 20 min resulted in less than a 13 further increase in chlorite formation the products from uv irradiation of 1 4 benzoquinone were found to include hydroquinone and 2 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone with details in text s2 and fig s9 of the si hydroquinone can generate chlorite rapidly upon reacting with clo2 kapp 9 108 m 1 s 1 ph 7 0 gan et al 2020 the other model quinone compounds methyl 1 4 benzoquinone 2 chloro 1 4 benzoquinone and 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone also all showed enhanced chlorite formation after uv pre irradiation fig 5d the chlorite yields reached a maximum value after 1 and 5 min of uv pre irradiation and then increased 5 at times beyond 5 min these results are consistent with those observed with srdom fig 5a as proposed in fig 4 1 4 benzoquinone moieties in dom absorb uv light and get excited to singlet state which quickly evolve to triplet state gorner 2003 gu et al 2017 pochon et al 2002 further hydrolysis of the triplet states of 1 4 benzoquinone forms 2 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone and or hydroquinone gorner 2003 gu et al 2017 pochon et al 2002 which can reduce clo2 to chlorite rapidly gan et al 2020 3 2 3 the formation of chlorite from 3dom reduction of clo2 according to the results shown in fig 5a 20 min of uv pre irradiation of srdom followed by clo2 oxidation resulted in the formation of chlorite at 16 97 0 49 µm which was 3 56 µm lower than that in the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 i e 21 53 0 1 µm thus the formation of chlorite precursors upon uv pre irradiation cannot fully account for the enhanced chlorite formation in the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 there must be other factors as triplets are good reductants mcneill and canonica 2016 nie et al 2022 romero and nicewicz 2016 at least some of the additional chlorite may have been formed through the reduction of clo2 by 3dom aromatic ketones aldehydes are known as important chromophores inducing the generation of 3dom whereas borohydride can reduce the aromatic ketones aldehydes to alcohols thereby reducing the generation of 3dom del vecchio et al 2017 golanoski et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 therefore srdom was treated by sodium borohydride nabh4 first before exposure to uv irradiation and clo2 details in text s3 difference of chlorite formation between uv irradiation with the presence of clo2 and clo2 oxidation alone 20 min reaction time when treating the nabh4 treated srdom was reduced by 37 4 compared to that without nabh4 treatment fig 6 above evidences confirmed the role of 3dom in reducing clo2 to chlorite besides 3dom dom can be produced from 3dom oxidation of phenols phohs eq 8 or from 1dom through intramolecular charge transfer from a donor to an acceptor eq 9 ma et al 2020 nie et al 2022 dom is also a reductant with oxidation potential e0 dom dom less than 0 18 vnhe ma et al 2020 nie et al 2022 however the role of dom is hard to be recognized in srdom system because 1 no method is available to directly detect the reactivity of dom with clo2 at present 2 addition of phenol compounds to highlight the role of dom eq 8 can also lead to additional chlorite due to the reaction between clo2 and phenols 8 3 do m phoh do m p ho h 9 1 do m do m do m as such 4 carboxybenzophenone as a simple model photosensitizer was used instead of srdom two phenol compounds phenol and 4 cyanophenol were added into 4 carboxybenzophenone solutions to produce the anion radical of 4 carboxybenzophenone investigating their effects on chlorite formation the rchlorite for the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone decreased by 24 51 and 14 46 with the presence of 2 5 5 0 µm phenol and 4 cyanophenol respectively as shown in fig s10 chlorite formation in treating the two phenol compounds alone by the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 were deducted with details in text s4 this indicates that the contribution from the anion radical of 4 carboxybenzophenone to chlorite formation was minor dom is known to bear diverse functional groups and is reactive toward many oxidants this study has shown that the reactivity of 3dom with oxidants deserves further attention though the moieties in dom may themselves be inert to oxidants their triplet states excited by uv irradiation may become very reactive and cause depletion of oxidants e g clo2 and persulfate as uv and uv based advanced oxidation processes are increasingly investigated or applied in water treatment chen et al 2021 guo et al 2022 li et al 2019 peng et al 2022 the role of 3dom in affecting the oxidants and the products seems innegligible and future works are demanded 4 conclusions this study provided direct evidence about 3dom as a reductant through evaluating clo2 reduction to chlorite by using model photosensitizers and dom with transient resolved spectroscopy tests the quenching rate constants for the triplet states of model photosensitizers by clo2 were detected in the range of 1 45 0 03 to 2 18 0 06 109 m 1 s 1 which could enhance chlorite formation by 24 3 42 1 times with clo2 dosing at 50 µm and uv fluence of 204 mj cm 2 compared to that without photosensitizers present 0 35 0 01 µm at the same clo2 dose and uv fluence 17 19 0 51 27 38 0 32 µm chlorite could be generated when treating dom at 2 mgc l 1 with the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 this was 7 22 10 47 µm higher than that without dom or oxidizing dom by clo2 in the dark the enhanced chlorite formation was attributed to the enhanced electron donating capacity chlorite precursors of dom upon uv irradiation and also to 3dom acting as an electron donor reducing clo2 to chlorite this

15425,the triplet states of dissolved organic matter 3dom have been well known to oxidize various organic contaminants but evidence of their reducing properties are largely scarce in this work chlorine dioxide clo2 as a single electron oxidant was used as a probe to evaluate the reduction property of 3dom the reduction of clo2 to chlorite was observed in the solutions of model photosensitizers i e 4 carboxybenzophenone benzophenone acetophenone 3 methoxyacetophenone naphthalene and xanthone during uv irradiation with the presence of clo2 though they are resistant to clo2 oxidation in the dark the reducing property of the triplet states of photosensitizers was verified and their second order reaction rate constants with clo2 were determined to be in the range of 1 45 0 03 109 2 18 0 06 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 the quenching tests excluded the role of other reactive species e g ho o 3p cl clo and hocl ocl o2 and eaq in clo2 reduction to chlorite when using model photosensitizers and dom isolates chlorite formation was 48 1 90 4 and 4812 8 7721 8 higher during uv irradiation with the presence of clo2 and dom than those without uv irradiation or without dom present respectively the enhancement was attributed to the enhanced electron donating capacity chlorite precursors of dom upon uv irradiation and also to 3dom acting as an electron donor reducing clo2 to chlorite this study highlighted the important role of 3dom as a reductant graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter dom triplet state chlorine dioxide chlorite uv irradiation water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a complex mixture of organic molecules and is ubiquitously present in aquatic environments the photochemical properties of dom are of interest due to its important role in controlling the fate and transport of contaminants and driving biogeochemical element cycling mcneill and canonica 2016 parker and mitch 2016 zhang et al 2020 upon light absorption the chromophores within dom are excited to a singlet excited state 1dom which quickly evolves to the triplet state 3dom through intersystem crossing mcneill and canonica 2016 nie et al 2022 3dom is known to be a precursor of other reactive species e g dom 1o2 etc and has been reported to be involved in phototransformation of a variety groups of contaminants in water chen et al 2018a grandbois et al 2008 huang et al 2022 zhang et al 2014 3dom mainly reacts with organic contaminants through energy transfer or electron transfer reaction pathways pan et al 2020 porras et al 2014 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 3dom can transfer energy to o2 to form 1o2 and to dienes to cause isomerization grebel et al 2011 mcneill and canonica 2016 ossola et al 2021 sharpless and blough 2014 3dom could be a good oxidant as incoming electrons can occupy its lower energy singly occupied molecular orbital somo mcneill and canonica 2016 nie et al 2022 the oxidative reactivity of 3dom has been widely studied and the reduction potential versus normal hydrogen electrode of 3dom e0 3dom dom was estimated at 1 6 to 1 8 vnhe parker and mitch 2016 amine and phenolic containing contaminants are susceptible to be oxidized by 3dom via donating an electron pan et al 2020 3dom could also be a strong reductant since it requires less energy to promote one electron to a higher somo compared to the ground state dom mcneill and canonica 2016 nie et al 2022 the oxidation potential of 3dom e0 3dom dom was estimated at 0 18 vnhe to 0 6 vnhe while direct evidence of 3dom sensitized photoreduction is scant mcneill and canonica 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 photosensitized dehalogenation of chlorine containing compounds such as chlorothalonil and mirex has been reported porras et al 2014 susan et al 1996 1997 hydrated electrons eaq in homogenous solutions or in intra humic environment or energy transfer was found to attribute to their degradation the reductive decomposition of bromate by 3dom in ice has been proposed min and choi 2017 though the reduction was apparent only at high bromate concentrations 0 1 0 2 m and at ph 3 based on the fluorescence quenching results recently the transformation of peroxymonosulfate to sulfate radical so4 by 3dom under sunlight was confirmed through the detection of generated radicals i e so4 1o2 and ho nie et al 2022 so far the reduction directly from 3dom still needs further identification experimental results with the triplet states of model photosentisizers indicate that they have good reducing capacity erickson et al 2015 lambert and kochevar 1997 romero and nicewicz 2016 for example the oxidation potential versus standard carbon electrode of rose bengal dianion rb2 e0 rb rb2 decreased from 1 09 vsce to 0 68 vsce after excitation to its triplet state 3rb2 lambert and kochevar 1997 other model photosentisizers such as benzophenone bp erythrosine er2 eosin y ey2 have been reported to reduce onium compounds e g methyl viologen and paraquat due to their low triplet state oxidation potentials e0 3bp bp 0 61 vsce e0 3er2 er 1 0 vsce e0 3ey2 ey 1 58 vsce romero and nicewicz 2016 the lack of evidence of 3dom as a reductant may in part arise from the fact that after transferring an electron from 3dom to a target compound tc tc is formed eq 1 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 dissolved o2 in the water may quickly re oxidize tc back to its parent compound tc making the reduction transformation invisible eq 2 zhou et al 2017 also the capture of transient spectra of tc is difficult and transient resolved spectroscopy is often needed 1 3 dom tc do m t c 2 o 2 t c o 2 tc here we propose to use clo2 to evaluate the reducing properties of 3dom due to following reasons firstly clo2 is an oxidant with unpaired electrons and the formation of chlorite can only proceed via electron transfer pathways from precursors e g phenolic compounds to clo2 gan et al 2020 thus the generation of chlorite is an indicator of the reductivity of the precursors eq 3 secondly the reduction potential of clo2 e0 clo2 clo2 0 95 vnhe is higher than that of o2 e0 o2 o2 0 18 vnhe sheng et al 2014 thus the oxidation of clo2 by o2 is impossible which bars the reverse pathway of eq 2 finally chlorite is much more stable than the transient species and can be easily tracked by ion chromatograph our previous study found the significant increases in chlorite formation in the simultaneous uv irradiation and clo2 oxidation of dom compared to clo2 alone kong et al 2021 this also suggested the involvement of photosensitized dom in chlorite formation 3 3 do m cl o 2 do m clo 2 this study aims to investigate the reducing properties of photosensitized dom by tracking the reduction of clo2 to chlorite the experiments provided the evidence of single electron transfer reduction reactions proceeding from 3dom and the triplet states of model photosensitizers both steady state photolysis experiments and transient resolved spectroscopy were applied to assess the reduction reactions of 3dom and the triplet states of model photosensitizers the results have important implications for understanding the aquatic photochemistry of 3dom and further understanding the role of dom in natural waters and engineered water treatment processes 2 materials and methods

chlorine apha 1998 2 2 experimental procedures uv irradiation at 254 nm was provided by a low pressure mercury lamp 8 w and the setup is shown in fig s1 the uv light irradiates vertically on a cylindrical quartz reactor 7 5 cm in diameter 0 5 cm in height volume 22 ml which contained a sampling port 1 5 cm in diameter fitted with a ground quartz stopper to prevent evaporation the uv lamp was warmed up at least 30 min before experiments the incident uv flux e in this work was determined to be 1 7 w m 2 by using iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2006 uv irradiation at 254 nm was chosen due to the higher formation yields of 3dom than at longer wavelengths and its popular uses in water treatment works lester et al 2013 the dom or model compounds were diluted to 2 mgc l 1 at ph 7 0 with 5 mm phosphate buffer for the tests with simultaneous uv irradiation and clo2 addition 50 μm clo2 was spiked into the solution at the start of the uv irradiation at pre determined time intervals 5 ml samples were collected and purged with nitrogen to remove residual clo2 ethylenediamine 50 mg l 1 was added to remove any free chlorine according to usepa method 300 1 usepa 1997 the

before starting the reactions the concentrations of residual clo2 in the experiments were analyzed in parallel tests using the colorimetric method control tests were conducted of clo2 oxidation without uv irradiation for some tests the samples were uv pre irradiated for 1 20 min before the clo2 was added for further reaction in the dark that was denoted as pre uv clo2 treatment three replicates were undertaken for each experiment and the error bars in the corresponding figures represent the standard error 2 3 determination of the quenching rate constants of the triplet states of photosensitizers by clo2 the second order quenching rate constants for the triplet states of photosensitizers 3ps by clo2 k 3 p s clo 2 eq 4 were obtained through transient resolved spectroscopy tests at room temperature 25 2 c briefly a lks80 laser flash photolysis system applied photophysics ltd uk was employed using the fourth harmonic mode of a nd yag laser 266 nm the solution ph was buffered to 7 0 with 5 mm phosphate buffer six photosensitizers i e 4 carboxybenzophenone benzophenone acetophenone naphthalene xanthone and 3 methoxyacetophenone were chosen in this work based on the following criteria 1 they can be excited to the triplet states upon uv irradiation 2 their ground states do not react with clo2 to form chlorite 3 the transient absorbance signals of their triplet states are able to be observed by using laser flash photolysis the decay traces of the transient absorption spectra of the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone benzophenone acetophenone naphthalene xanthone and 3 methoxyacetophenone peaking at 415 525 450 400 590 and 395 nm respectively jammoul et al 2009 merkel and dinnocenzo 2008 timepe and kronfeld 1989 wenk et al 2013b were tracked in solutions containing different concentrations of clo2 the absorption of clo2 itself was automatically deducted by the instrument for each sample the photosensitizer concentration was set at 0 25 mm except for benzophenone and xanthone which was dosed at 0 1 mm and 0 05 mm respectively the kinetics signals were averaged from 6 replicate laser shots the second order quenching rate constants were obtained by linearly fitting the pseudo first order decay rates of the triplet states of photosensitizers to the concentration of spiked clo2 4 3 ps clo 2 ps clo 2 2 4 analytical methods chlorite and chlorate were analyzed using a dionex ics 600 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific usa equipped with a dionex ionpac as19 anionic column 4 µm 4 250 mm clo2 concentrations were determined on a hachdr2800 residual chlorine analyzer using the n n diethyl p phenylene diamine colorimetric method the dissolved organic carbon concentrations of the dom stock solutions were analyzed using a toc lcph total organic carbon analyzer from shimadzu the electron donating capacity edc of srdom before and after uv irradiation was determined using a dionex ultimate 3000 size exclusion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific usa followed by a post column reaction with an abts solution for edc monitored at 405 nm see the details in text s1 of the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorite formation from the reduction of clo2 by the triplet states of photosensitizers due to the complexity of dom the triplet states of photosensitizers were firstly applied by using 4 carboxybenzophenone an aromatic ketone compound as an example in preparatory experiments pan et al 2020 wenk et al 2013b fig 1a shows that 4 carboxybenzophenone 12 µm did not react with clo2 to form chlorite in the dark after the 4 carboxybenzophenone solution was pre irradiated at uv dose of 204 mj cm 2 corresponding to 20 min irradiation in this work the subsequent addition of clo2 50 µm in dark still did not result in chlorite formation during uv irradiation with clo2 present however chlorite acted as the major reduction product from clo2 fig s2 whose formation increased linearly with reaction time and reached 15 09 0 31 µm after 20 min fig 1a while in ultrapure water without 4 carboxybenzophenone present 0 35 0 01 μm chlorite could be formed after 20 min of uv irradiation with the presence of 50 µm clo2 fig 1a the much greater chlorite formation with 4 carboxybenzophenone present indicates synergy between uv irradiation and clo2 oxidation other photosensitizers including aromatic ketone model compounds i e benzophenone acetophenone xanthone and 3 methoxyacetophenone and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon i e naphthalene were also tested chlorite formation from benzophenone 12 8 µm acetophenone 20 8 µm naphthalene 16 7 µm 3 methoxyacetophenone 18 5 µm and xanthone 12 8 µm during uv irradiation with the presence of clo2 all showed linear increases with reaction time though no chlorite formation was detectable during clo2 treatment after uv pre irradiation or clo2 oxidation alone fig 1b to explore the reactive species involved in chlorite formation quenching tests were conducted using 4 carboxybenzophenone as a representative compound with results shown in fig 1c excess tba 100 mm did not affect chlorite formation excluding the involvement of reactive species such as ho cl o 3p and clo cheng et al 2019 wu et al 2017 ccl4 addition 0 1 mm showed no effects on chlorite formation either excluding the role of eaq meisel et al 1977 the addition of glycine 0 5 mm and sod 50 u ml 1 showed their predominant role in quenching hocl ocl or o2 gan et al 2019 sheng et al 2014 respectively but they did not affect chlorite formation suggesting negligible roles for both hocl ocl and o2 enhanced chlorite formation was observed after purging the solution with ar whereas a significant reduction in chlorite formation was observed when purging with o2 this is because that o2 is a quencher of the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone latch and mcneill 2006 and ar purging could prolong the lifetime of triplet states purging with n2o an eaq captor showed similar enhanced chlorite formation as ar purging and the results also excluded the role of eaq zhang et al 2021 transient resolved spectroscopy was used to provide the direct evidence of interaction between the triplet states of photosensitizers and clo2 eq 3 as fig 1d shows the transient adsorption at 415 nm a characteristic signal of the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone wenk et al 2013b decays faster with increasing clo2 concentrations confirming the direct quenching of the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone by clo2 by fitting the pseudo first order decay rates of the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone to the concentration of spiked clo2 the second order reaction rate constant for the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone with clo2 k 3 cbb p cl o 2 was calculated to be 1 48 0 05 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 the analogous k 3 p s cl o 2 values for the triplet states of other photosensitizers tested at ph 7 0 fell in the range 1 45 0 03 to 2 18 0 06 109 m 1 s 1 fig s3 notably the k 3 p s cl o 2 values showed no relationship with the reduction potentials of the triplet states of these photosensitizers table s2 the oxidation potentials were only available for the triplet states of benzophenone 0 61 vsce and xanthone 1 42 vsce table s2 their k 3 p s cl o 2 values were determined to be 2 18 0 06 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 61 0 22 109 m 1 s 1 respectively fig s3 the chlorite formation rate rchlorite in treating 4 carboxybenzophenone by the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 can be obtained b fitting the experimentally determined chlorite concentration chlorite at every reaction time t as in eq 5 here the rchlorite is all attributable to the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone according to the above results 5 r chlorite d chlorite dt the rchlorite was computed in reactions with irradiated 4 carboxybenzophenone with different clo2 additions the oxygenation conditions were oxic saturated with normal air with the initial dissolved o2 concentration at 250 µm and also anoxic realized by ar purging and keeping the dissolved o2 concentration below 6 25 µm fig s4 presents results showing that rchlorite increased non linearly with increasing clo2 from 0 to 150 µm and rchlorite in anoxic conditions was always higher than in oxic conditions due to the elimination of triplet states quenching by dissolved o2 these results suggest that the formation of the triplet states of photosensitizers can be attributed to photoexcitation by uv light the triplet states of photosensitizers decay during the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 would be due at least in part to quenching by dissolved o2 and clo2 as shown in fig 2 3 2 enhanced chlorite formation in dom photosensitized reduction of clo2 3 2 1 enhanced chlorite formation in simultaneous uv irradiation and clo2 oxidation of dom in ultrapure water with no dom present no chlorite was formed in clo2 oxidation alone in the dark during uv irradiation with the presence of clo2 0 35 0 01 μm chlorite was formed with clo2 dosing at 50 μm and uv fluence of 204 mj cm 2 20 min irradiation fig 3a the reactive species generated during clo2 photolysis such as o 3p ocl ho and clo may contribute to chlorite formation eqs 6 and 7 buxton and subhani 1972 klaning 1985 6 o 3 p ocl clo 2 k 9 4 10 9 m 1 s 1 7 h o clo clo 2 h k 1 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 in the presence of different dom isolates each at 2 mgc l 1 the concentrations of chlorite generated from clo2 oxidation alone varied from 9 62 0 05 to 17 66 0 84 µm after 20 min fig 3a reactive phenols amines and other aromatic compounds found in dom are known to reduce clo2 to form chlorite gan et al 2020 2019 in the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 the formation of chlorite was enhanced by 7 57 10 82 µm after 20 min with different dom isolates present that amounts to a 48 1 to 90 4 increase compared to clo2 oxidation in the dark fig 3a for example chlorite formation was 12 97 0 03 µm after 20 min of dark clo2 oxidation of srdom but it increased by 66 to 21 53 0 01 µm after 20 min of uv irradiation with the co presence of clo2 that far exceeded the formation in the absence of dom 0 35 0 01 μm note that the clo2 consumption showed good mass balance with the sum concentrations of chlorite chloride and chlorate fig s5 fig 3b displays the evolution of chlorite formation in the presence of srdom from clo2 dark oxidation and co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 the difference in chlorite formation between the two processes increases linearly r2 0 986 with the reaction time the formation of chlorite with other dom isolates also showed a similar trend fig s6 these results indicate the synergy between uv and clo2 in chlorite formation when dom is present and additional chlorite formation pathway involving dom may exist chromophores in dom mainly including quinone like components aromatic ketones aldehydes etc are known to absorb uv photons and generate some reactive intermediates ma et al 2020 mcneill and canonica 2016 nie et al 2022 zhang and blough 2016 zhang et al 2012 therefore quenching tests were also conducted in srdom solutions to explore the reactive species involved in chlorite formation with results shown in fig s7 the addition of excessive tba 100 mm glycine 0 5 mm ccl4 0 1 mm and sod 50 u ml 1 did not influence the formation of chlorite when treating srdom by the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 10 difference with the control the results ruled out the roles of the oxidative reactive species e g ho cl o 3p clo and hocl ocl and reductive reactive species e g eaq and o2 in the enhanced chlorite formation in srdom solutions cheng et al 2019 gan et al 2019 meisel et al 1977 sheng et al 2014 wu et al 2017 thus the enhanced chlorite formation was attributed to other species from dom photosensitizing based on previous researches quinone like compounds in dom can be destroyed by light irradiation and transferred to phenols gorner 2003 gu et al 2017 pochon et al 2002 which can act as precursors of chlorite gan et al 2020 huang et al 2018 thus light induced decomposition of dom may lead to the changes in the redox active moieties in the dom and favor the formation of chlorite precursors as proposed in fig 4 gorner 2003 gu et al 2017 pochon et al 2002 meanwhile 3dom a reductant similar as the triplet states of model photosensitizers may directly reduce clo2 to chlorite as provided in fig 2 these two aspects were discussed below separately 3 2 2 the generation of chlorite precursors after uv pre irradiation of dom to probe the changes in chlorite precursors the srdom solution was pre irradiated under uv light for 10 2 204 mj cm 2 1 20 min irradiation after which clo2 50 µm was dosed to evaluate chlorite formation as fig 5a shows pre irradiated srdom generated more chlorite during clo2 oxidation one min of uv pre irradiation enhanced the formation of chlorite over 20 min by 8 1 after 5 10 and 20 min of pre irradiation the enhancements were 20 18 23 12 and 24 96 respectively the antioxidant moieties in dom have been reported to correlate with chlorite formation gan et al 2019 the edc of the un irradiated and irradiated srdom were therefore compared interestingly the edc of srdom increased from 2 39 0 11 µ m e mg c 1 to 2 43 0 15 µ m e mg c 1 after 1 min of uv pre irradiation and to 2 71 0 11 µ m e mg c 1 after 5 min fig 5b prolonging uv pre irradiation time from 10 min to 20 min did not further change the edc values significantly it should be noted that the edc values may decrease when the irradiation time is prolonged to days due to photooxidation and photobleaching sharpless et al 2014 additionally the enhancement in edc correlated well with the enhancement in chlorite formation r2 0 971 fig s8 phenolic compounds are known to be dominant moieties contributing to dom s edc wenk et al 2013a and they can quickly react with clo2 k in the range of 101 to 108 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 to form chlorite gan et al 2020 as quinones can be transformed to phenolic compounds under uv irradiation chen et al 2018b gorner 2003 wan et al 2020 the enhanced phenolic content may also contribute to enhancing chlorite formation model quinone compounds were further used to test for the hypothesized precursor generation as shown in fig 5c 1 4 benzoquinone generated hardly any chlorite after reaction with clo2 however after 1 min of uv pre irradiation 22 66 2 66 μm chlorite was formed in 20 min after 5 min of uv pre irradiation 33 67 0 83 µm chlorite was formed further increasing the uv pre irradiation time from 5 to 20 min resulted in less than a 13 further increase in chlorite formation the products from uv irradiation of 1 4 benzoquinone were found to include hydroquinone and 2 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone with details in text s2 and fig s9 of the si hydroquinone can generate chlorite rapidly upon reacting with clo2 kapp 9 108 m 1 s 1 ph 7 0 gan et al 2020 the other model quinone compounds methyl 1 4 benzoquinone 2 chloro 1 4 benzoquinone and 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone also all showed enhanced chlorite formation after uv pre irradiation fig 5d the chlorite yields reached a maximum value after 1 and 5 min of uv pre irradiation and then increased 5 at times beyond 5 min these results are consistent with those observed with srdom fig 5a as proposed in fig 4 1 4 benzoquinone moieties in dom absorb uv light and get excited to singlet state which quickly evolve to triplet state gorner 2003 gu et al 2017 pochon et al 2002 further hydrolysis of the triplet states of 1 4 benzoquinone forms 2 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone and or hydroquinone gorner 2003 gu et al 2017 pochon et al 2002 which can reduce clo2 to chlorite rapidly gan et al 2020 3 2 3 the formation of chlorite from 3dom reduction of clo2 according to the results shown in fig 5a 20 min of uv pre irradiation of srdom followed by clo2 oxidation resulted in the formation of chlorite at 16 97 0 49 µm which was 3 56 µm lower than that in the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 i e 21 53 0 1 µm thus the formation of chlorite precursors upon uv pre irradiation cannot fully account for the enhanced chlorite formation in the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 there must be other factors as triplets are good reductants mcneill and canonica 2016 nie et al 2022 romero and nicewicz 2016 at least some of the additional chlorite may have been formed through the reduction of clo2 by 3dom aromatic ketones aldehydes are known as important chromophores inducing the generation of 3dom whereas borohydride can reduce the aromatic ketones aldehydes to alcohols thereby reducing the generation of 3dom del vecchio et al 2017 golanoski et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 therefore srdom was treated by sodium borohydride nabh4 first before exposure to uv irradiation and clo2 details in text s3 difference of chlorite formation between uv irradiation with the presence of clo2 and clo2 oxidation alone 20 min reaction time when treating the nabh4 treated srdom was reduced by 37 4 compared to that without nabh4 treatment fig 6 above evidences confirmed the role of 3dom in reducing clo2 to chlorite besides 3dom dom can be produced from 3dom oxidation of phenols phohs eq 8 or from 1dom through intramolecular charge transfer from a donor to an acceptor eq 9 ma et al 2020 nie et al 2022 dom is also a reductant with oxidation potential e0 dom dom less than 0 18 vnhe ma et al 2020 nie et al 2022 however the role of dom is hard to be recognized in srdom system because 1 no method is available to directly detect the reactivity of dom with clo2 at present 2 addition of phenol compounds to highlight the role of dom eq 8 can also lead to additional chlorite due to the reaction between clo2 and phenols 8 3 do m phoh do m p ho h 9 1 do m do m do m as such 4 carboxybenzophenone as a simple model photosensitizer was used instead of srdom two phenol compounds phenol and 4 cyanophenol were added into 4 carboxybenzophenone solutions to produce the anion radical of 4 carboxybenzophenone investigating their effects on chlorite formation the rchlorite for the triplet states of 4 carboxybenzophenone decreased by 24 51 and 14 46 with the presence of 2 5 5 0 µm phenol and 4 cyanophenol respectively as shown in fig s10 chlorite formation in treating the two phenol compounds alone by the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 were deducted with details in text s4 this indicates that the contribution from the anion radical of 4 carboxybenzophenone to chlorite formation was minor dom is known to bear diverse functional groups and is reactive toward many oxidants this study has shown that the reactivity of 3dom with oxidants deserves further attention though the moieties in dom may themselves be inert to oxidants their triplet states excited by uv irradiation may become very reactive and cause depletion of oxidants e g clo2 and persulfate as uv and uv based advanced oxidation processes are increasingly investigated or applied in water treatment chen et al 2021 guo et al 2022 li et al 2019 peng et al 2022 the role of 3dom in affecting the oxidants and the products seems innegligible and future works are demanded 4 conclusions this study provided direct evidence about 3dom as a reductant through evaluating clo2 reduction to chlorite by using model photosensitizers and dom with transient resolved spectroscopy tests the quenching rate constants for the triplet states of model photosensitizers by clo2 were detected in the range of 1 45 0 03 to 2 18 0 06 109 m 1 s 1 which could enhance chlorite formation by 24 3 42 1 times with clo2 dosing at 50 µm and uv fluence of 204 mj cm 2 compared to that without photosensitizers present 0 35 0 01 µm at the same clo2 dose and uv fluence 17 19 0 51 27 38 0 32 µm chlorite could be generated when treating dom at 2 mgc l 1 with the co exposure of uv irradiation and clo2 this was 7 22 10 47 µm higher than that without dom or oxidizing dom by clo2 in the dark the enhanced chlorite formation was attributed to the enhanced electron donating capacity chlorite precursors of dom upon uv irradiation and also to 3dom acting as an electron donor reducing clo2 to chlorite this study also highlighted the importance role of 3dom in oxidant consumption especially in uv based advanced oxidation processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15426,nutrient element cycling in the tibetan plateau the highest and largest plateau in the world is sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of reactive nitrogen n predominantly in the form of nitrate no3 in the plateau is crucial to understand the regional and global n cycles and their feedbacks with climate change we conducted the first weekly frequency hydro geochemical monitoring i e discharge water chemistry and multiple isotopes from the upper to the lower reaches of the yarlung tsangpo river the largest river in the plateau in pronounced wet dry cycles to reveal the biogeochemical transformations and fluvial fluxes of no3 response to hydrologic condition relative stable no3 concentration and significant linear correlations between the fluvial no3 fluxes and the discharge were observed suggesting that a significant potential no3 source counterbalanced the diluting effects during the rainy season the negative correlations between δ15n no3 and discharge no3 fluxes suggested that the increasing no3 flux respond to the increasing discharge was mainly from water leaching of 15n depleted soil sources rather than 15n enriched sewage the isotopic mixing model calculation showed that no3 fluxes were largely generated in the relatively densely populated middle reaches 56 of which 74 were from soil sources the fluxes of the soil sources showed large seasonal variation and peaked in august with hydrological condition as the primary driver based on the critical findings we put forward a no3 export conceptual model that integrated anthropogenic and climatic forcings and classified no3 export mechanisms in river basins into transport limited and generation limited regimes in a transport limited regime that characterized most river basins in the tibetan plateau fluvial no3 flux presented a linearly relationship in response to runoff variation in contrast in a generation limited regime the flux would be largely dependent on the thermodynamic of nitrification graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords time series river hydro geochemical monitoring hydrological domination nitrate flux the tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global nitrogen n export by rivers largely in the form of nitrate no3 has been deeply altered by disturbances by burgeoning human activities and climate change erisman et al 2013 xia et al 2018 in the past century the global fluvial n flux has increased more than 90 from 34 tg n yr 1 to 64 tg n yr 1 beusen et al 2016 causing eutrophication and episodic acidification problems in aquatic systems fennel and testa 2019 sinha et al 2017 yao et al 2020 suggested that annual global release of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o from rivers had increased fourfold from 70 gg n in 1900 to 291 gg n in 2016 the dynamics and fluxes of fluvial no3 is crucial in understanding regional and global n cycle and its interactions with the basin hydrological condition the no3 flux of a river depends on the generation e g atmospheric precipitation and nitrification and the removing e g retention versus leaching in soils biological removal via assimilation and denitrification of no3 in a river basin jiang et al 2021a 2021b randall and mulla 2001 yan et al 2022 quantifying the relative contribution of these variables in relation to no3 flux is challenging as n fate related processes are usually coupled and hard to be distinguished from each another jiang et al 2021a there have been many studies addressing the microbiology physiology and impacting environment factors of site specific patterns of no3 generation via in stream or in soil nitrification li et al 2020 ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 a limited number of studies examined the no3 flux and the controlling factors in river basins huang et al 2012 mueller et al 2016 however these studies mostly focused on no3 concentrations in small scale river basins yet could not realize the source apportionment or elucidation of transformation processes few studies have linked no3 generation to fluvial flux at large river basin scale especially for remote area such as the plateaus which are particularly sensitive to the climate change and human activity disturbance nanus et al 2008 hundey et al 2016 isotope signals of riverine no3 δ15n δ18o no3 are important supplements to conventional discharge and water chemistry monitoring because they are capable of tracing the sources and transformations of riverine no3 kendall et al 2007 liu et al 2013 matiatos et al 2021 wong et al 2018 xia et al 2017 dual isotopes of no3 have been applied to explore the sources and fates of no3 at large basin scales based on spatial samples in recent studies hu et al 2019 jiang et al 2022 however high frequency time series no3 isotopes monitoring in large rivers are scarce what has been in particularly lacking from previous studies is the quantitative exploration of the driving mechanisms of fluvial no3 flux in large river basins through a combined high frequency time series hydro chemical and isotopic monitoring especially for those poorly gauged and ecologically fragile basins in high altitude regions however these are exactly the areas with particular interests in the study of biogeochemistry cycling feedbacks to climate change the tibetan plateau is one of the most climate sensitive areas in the world and plays an important role in global n cycles chen et al 2013 as the water tower of asia it feeds ten great asian rivers immerzeel et al 2010 su et al 2016 the tibetan river basins are now facing intense environmental challenges with warming retreating glaciers thawing permafrost and increasing anthropogenic disturbance which potentially increase the fluvial no3 flux immerzeel et al 2010 qiu 2008 su et al 2016 many studies have documented increasing trends of atmospheric precipitation and glacial retreating in the plateau associated with warming climate 2 3 times the average global rate liu and chen 2000 ipcc 2007 xu et al 2008 wang et al 2021 enhancing the hydrologic connectivity and variability donner and scavia 2007 huang et al 2012 the enhanced hydrologic connectivity will facilitate the transport of no3 loads from soils in tibetan basins to the river channels which will increase the fluvial no3 flux jiang et al 2022 hydrological connectivity not only influences the soil no3 inputs into rivers but also regulates the biogeochemical behavior of no3 it is well documented that soil no3 content and the processes involved in no3 yield e g nitrification and denitrification are closely related to precipitation patterns li et al 2020 2022 widespread permafrost thawing may trigger considerable amounts of n release to the tibetan rivers salmon et al 2016 wang et al 2021 furthermore the expansion of anthropogenic activities on the plateau has increased the production of reactive n and its input to rivers chen et al 2013 wang et al 2017a the no3 dynamics and fluxes of large tibetan rivers could be disproportionately altered in the context of global change however the critical driving forces of the fluvial no3 fluxes there is still not well constrained limiting our understanding on the nutrients cycling and its feedbacks to climate change high spatiotemporal resolution studies on riverine hydro geochemistry under different environmental gradients would provide critical information on the dynamics of reactive n and its controlling mechanism in the plateau but these works are lacking to address the current gap we conducted the first weekly frequency time series hydro geochemical monitoring work from the upper to the lower reaches of the yarlung tsangpo river the largest river on the tibetan plateau and also the highest large river basin in the world we measured the spatiotemporal variations of water chemistry and multiple isotope composition δ15n δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o to look into the spatiotemporal patterns of no3 flux in response to the hydrologic condition in the tibetan river and the dynamics of biogeochemical transformations and hydrologic transport mechanisms of no3 under pronounced wet dry cycles and contrasting anthropogenic disturbances furthermore we proposed a conceptual model to depict a hydrologic domination on the fluvial no3 export regime for large river basins on the tibetan plateau which clarified the coupled processes of transport and generation of river basin no3 2 materials and methods 2 1 natural and anthropogenic settings the yarlung tsangpo river fig 1 a is the longest river on the tibetan plateau 2057 km and the highest large river in the world mean elevation 4621 m yu et al 2021 the river flows from west to east with an elevation gradient of more than 8000 m and a drainage area of 240 480 km2 fig 1 shi et al 2018 yao et al 2010 the yarlung tsangpo river basin are divided into four stretches by the lhaze lz nugesha ngs yancun yc and nuxia nx counties from the upper to the down reaches of river main channel fig 1 the river drains through different climatic zones along the longitudinal direction with the mean annual air temperature mat and mean annual precipitation map gradually increasing from the upper reaches i e above lz to the lower reaches i e yc to nx gao et al 2012 there is an obvious west east gradient in both climate and hydrology regime across the basin map decreases from 1000 mm near the eastern himalayan syntaxis to 200 mm in the headwaters the basin is dominated by westerlies from october to may and precipitation is relatively rare after mid june the warm moist air masses from the bay of bengal are blocked by the himalayas and move upward along the river valley bringing abundant precipitation to the southern part of the tibetan plateau hren et al 2009 ren et al 2017 with relatively small inter annual variation and significant seasonal variation precipitation condition can be divided into rainy season and dry season precipitation mainly happens in the period of june to september which accounts for about 65 80 of its annual total in the basin liu et al 2018 the land use types of different stretches were tabulated in table s1 the upper and lower reaches of the basin are sparsely populated shi et al 2018 in contrast large cities i e lhasa and shigatse are located in the middle reaches i e lz to yc fig 1 and these cities are the most important centers for human habitation in tibet such significant spatial heterogeneity in the natural and anthropogenic settings provides an ideal opportunity to study the n cycling and its driving mechanisms on the tibetan plateau at a large river basin scale 2 2 hydro geochemical monitoring in this study weekly monitoring and sampling campaigns were conducted at four sampling stations i e lz yc ngs and nx on the main channel of the yarlung tsangpo river from april to november 2019 fig 1 the time series sampling covered the major intra annual flow variations in weekly frequency and from the upper to the lower reaches of the river table s2 water samples were immediately filtered through gf f filter membrane 0 7 μm pore size after sampling and the filtrate were stored in high density polyethylene bottles the samples for δ15n δ18o no3 value analyzing were frozen immediately after filtering all water samples were measured for ph temperature and electrical conductivity using pre calibrated portable water quality probes hach usa in the field an aliquot of unfiltered sample was collected for δ18o h2o analyses and bottles were filled in full and immediately sealed with para film to avoid evaporation the samples were stored in the refrigerator pending analyses the instantaneous river discharge at the sampling time were recorded chloride cl and no3 concentrations were determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 900 with uncertainties of 5 the δ15n δ18o no3 compositions were measured with denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 weigand et al 2016 in brief the no3 was first reduced to nitrous oxide n2o and then its δ15n and δ18o compositions were measured with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms mat 253 thermo fisher scientific the isotope data were reported in parts per thousand relative to atmospheric air air and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow with uncertainties of c a 0 3 all the isotope measurements were conducted in triplicate the δ18o h2o compositions were determined using water isotope analyzer picarro l2140i after filtration through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filter membrane the data were reported in relative to vsmow with uncertainties of 0 1 2 3 statistical analyses the strength of the correlations between two parameters was determined using the pearson correlation test in spss 22 0 for windows analysis of variance anova was performed to analyze spatiotemporal differences in parameters 2 4 no3 source apportionment after considering the potential isotopic fractionations a markov chain monte carlo mcmc isotopic mixing model integrated in the r package siar parnell et al 2010 was applied to estimate the proportional contributions of the no3 sources to the yarlung tsangpo river at a monthly frequency detailed descriptions of the model can be found in previous work jiang et al 2022 korth et al 2014 2 5 no3 flux estimates the instantaneous nutrient fluxes of no3 in g n s 1 were estimated from the instantaneous no3 concentration and the corresponding river discharge the no3 flux generated in each stretch was calculated by the difference of fluxes between its downstream and upstream stations given the no3 source apportionment was conducted at a monthly frequency the instantaneous nutrient fluxes of no3 from the potential sources in each month were estimated by multiplying the average of the instantaneous flux in a month by the proportional contribution of each source 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of no3 concentrations the hydro geochemical monitoring data for the yarlung tsangpo river in this work were tabulated in table s2 spatially the mean instantaneous river discharge showed continuously increasing trend from the lz station to the nx station p 0 001 fig 2 a the mean cl concentration decreased downstream p 0 01 fig 2b as cl was biologically and chemically conservative this pattern might imply an increasing dilution effect by increasing river discharge the no3 concentrations were 16 27 μmol l 1 averaging at 20 μmol l 1 19 52 μmol l 1 averaging at 31 μmol l 1 23 46 μmol l 1 averaging at 31 μmol l 1 and 15 26 μmol l 1 averaging at 21 μmol l 1 at lz ngs yc and nx stations respectively fig 2c and table s2 the higher no3 concentrations were observed at the ngs and yc station in the middle stretches p 0 01 fig 2c with relatively higher population density a global comparison showed that the no3 concentrations in the yarlung tsangpo river were much lower than those of mostly disturbed rivers e g mississippi rhine yellow elbe and sava rivers but were comparable with other tibetan rivers such as the lancang nujiang and the upper reaches of the yellow and changjiang rivers table s3 suggesting a natural status of the river the intra annual variations of river discharge cl and no3 concentrations at the four stations were shown in fig 3 the river discharge showed similar intra annual patterns with the highest discharge in july to august consist with the monsoonal precipitation patterns in the basin the cl concentrations and discharge displayed clear inverse relationships at all stations p 0 01 reflecting dilution effects at all stations poor and mcdonnell 2007 however the relationship between no3 concentrations and discharge were not straightforward i e no3 concentrations were approximately stable despite of the large temporal variation in river discharge fig 3 suggesting the riverine no3 was not diluted or concentrated in terms of seasonal runoff variation previous studies revealed both positive tiemeyer et al 2006 tomer et al 2003 and inverse poor and mcdonnell 2007 rollinson et al 2021 relationships between no3 concentrations and river discharge which are referred to as dilution or concentration regimes davis et al 2014 while large spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the regimes may exist the temporally stable no3 concentrations at the four monitoring sites of the yarlung tsangpo river could be ascribed to the overall well counterbalanced dilution and concentration regimes at large basin scale 3 2 characteristics of no3 fluxes and their relationships with river discharge the variations of instantaneous no3 fluxes of the four stretches were shown in a staked plot fig 4 spatially most of the no3 fluxes were generated in the relatively densely populated middle stretches the no3 fluxes in the upper reaches only accounted for one half to one sixteenth of the fluxes generated in the middle stretches during the hydrologic year fig 4 temporally the no3 fluxes exhibited a sharp increase in the wet season i e july to august fig 4 implying a strong climatic control on the no3 fluxes the seasonal variations were mostly remarkable in the human activity disturbed middle stretches in contrast the no3 fluxes in the upper and lower stretches were not as variable as those in the middle stretches in terms of seasonality implying potentially coupled anthropogenic and climatic controls on the fluvial no3 fluxes as the no3 concentrations did not change prominently with the river discharge significant linear correlations between the instantaneous fluvial no3 fluxes and the discharge were expected p 0 01 fig 5 this finding clearly showed that the no3 flux of the largest tibetan river responded directly to changes in hydrological conditions and implied that the no3 storage or generation capability in the basin was potentially large enough to support leaching export and to maintain the relatively stable level of no3 in the river water fig 3 while several recent studies have insightfully discussed the direct effects of temperature on no3 generation by nitrification donhauser et al 2021 gao et al 2009 our study highlighted the roles of the river discharge in determining fluvial no3 flux at the integrated large basin scale on the tibetan plateau this argument was in consistent with the high resolution spatial isotopic study in the nujiang river basin a major river draining on the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau which concluded that temperature impact on the riverine no3 loads was limited compared with its effects on the hydrologic condition jiang et al 2022 the sensitivities of no3 flux to river discharge variation in the middle reaches ngs and yc as reflected in the slops of the regression lines in fig 5 were much higher than those in the upper lz and lower nx reaches considering the similarities in geographical and climatic background in the upper and the middle reaches shi et al 2018 we speculated that the difference in the sensitivities to runoff could to some extent be attributed to the stronger anthropogenic activities in the middle stretches to achieve a better understanding of the driving forces of no3 flux variations the inventory of the source and the fate of no3 in the river basin should be specified and multiple isotopic evidences could provide further information to addressing these issues see below 3 3 multiple isotope signals reveal a hydrology dominated control on fluvial no3 sources and fluxes the δ15n no3 at lz ngs yc and nx stations were 3 2 7 5 averaging at 5 2 1 2 7 9 averaging at 4 4 1 9 7 9 averaging at 4 5 and 2 2 6 6 averaging at 4 4 respectively fig 2d and table s2 the δ15n no3 values of the yarlung tsangpo river were much lower than those of the urban rivers such as the rhine and elbe rivers but were in the typical range of alpine or agricultural rivers such as nujiang songhua qi and sava rivers table s3 suggesting the dominant contribution from 15n depleted sources e g soil organic n chemical fertilizer and precipitation in the river basin xue et al 2009 overall no clear spatial patterns were observed for the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 fig 2d and e but the wide ranges of the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 at individual station suggested large intra annual variations in no3 sources or turnover processes altering the isotopic signals kendall et al 2007 there were strong negative correlations between δ15n no3 and river discharge fig 6 as well as no3 fluxes fig s1 at the four stations as no3 from soil sources and atmospheric precipitation are characterized by low δ15n no3 xue et al 2009 these observed correlations indicated that the increasing no3 flux respond to increasing river discharge was mainly from soil or precipitation rather than 15n enriched sewage a potentially important no3 source in a basin this trend was in consistent with the previous time series work by yue et al 2020 as the δ18o no3 values i e 10 8 to 3 4 table s2 were much lower than the typical endmember for precipitation 60 to 80 xue et al 2009 and were in the typical range for terrestrial nitrification 10 to 10 kendall et al 2007 the direct input from precipitation should be minor and a dominant role of soil sources nitrification in the fluvial no3 fluxes was more possible this speculation was also supported by the positive correlation between river discharge and no3 cl molar ratios because soil sources have been documented to have high no3 cl ratios than precipitation and sewage li et al 2019 the significant correlations between δ18o h2o and δ18o no3 at the four stations p 0 01 also verified the prevailing nitrification as o atom from h2o would be incorporated into no3 during nitrification kendall et al 2007 the time series isotopic signals suggested an intense hydrological control on basin no3 transportation dynamics hydrological conditions changed the permeability of basin soils and the transportation of materials from soil to river channel through hydrologic flow rate and path specifically in the wet season the basin was generally in a hydrologically connected state when soil leaching was more active in contrast in the dry season the basin was apt to be in a hydrologic disconnected state that inhibits materials leaching and transportation within the basin ali and roy 2010 donner and scavia 2007 huang et al 2012 previous studies showed that higher temperature and more waterlogged soils in the wet season would prompt denitrification causing increased δ15n no3 accompanied by decreasing no3 cl ratios gao et al 2009 mao et al 2020 however the wet season was characterized by the lowest δ15n no3 and the highest no3 cl ratios in this study fig 6 in addition biological no3 removal was also proposed as an important mechanism for n cycling which would result in a negative linear correlation between δ15n no3 and natural logarithm of its no3 concentrations jiang et al 2020a however no significant linear correlation was obtained at any of the four stations fig s2 rejecting no3 removal as a dominant no3 cycling process at the large basin scale in this study a recent study also suggested that no3 removal was insignificant relative to nitrification in the yarlung tsangpo river basin based on seasonal isotope networks liu et al 2022 thus the regulation of hydrologic condition on no3 flux in the yarlung tsangpo river was ascribed to be realized by altering the degrees of leaching of soils in different hydrology season 3 4 quantification of spatiotemporal no3 sources and fluxes considering the major anthropogenic activities of the river basin the endmembers included soil organic n and chemical fertilizer son cf animal manure am sewage sw and atmospheric precipitation ap the son and cf were combined in the model based on their similarities of isotopic composition and transport pathway and the isotopic endmembers for the potential no3 sources were adopted from well constrained values in previous studies table s4 and references therein the spatiotemporal sources and fluxes of no3 estimated by the mcmc isotopic mixing model were shown in fig 7 soil sources son cf and am were the dominated no3 sources in the four stretches of the river which jointly accounted up to 80 of the riverine no3 fig 7a d the fluxes of the soil sources showed large seasonal variations which were significantly higher in the wet season july to october and peaked in august fig 7a d this was attributed to the strong soil leaching associated with the higher precipitation in the rainy season the higher contributions of the soil sources observed in the wet season agreed well with the lower δ15n no3 of nitrate in river water in the high flow period fig 3 in contrast the variations of ap and sw derived fluvial no3 fluxes were not significant in terms of seasonality fig 7a d spatially the no3 fluxes in the upper reaches lz were very low fig 7e which should be attributed to the remote and pristine environment with limited anthropogenic activities in addition headwater regions constitute large portions of the available reactive surface area and are exposed to strong sunlight raymond et al 2012 zhong et al 2021 which could induce asymmetric water loss via evaporation that outpaces the stretches downstream allen et al 2018 the δ18o h2o determined at the lz station were elevated and did not follow the elevation effect fig 2f implicating strong evaporation effect the strong evaporation together with low precipitation frozen soils and flat topography could jointly limit the transportation of no3 from soil to river jiang et al 2021a the middle stretches between lz and yc station contributed 56 of the fluvial no3 fluxes fig 7f of which 74 were from soil sources son cf and am the middle stretches were the major agricultural regions in the plateau with stock and crop farming widely distributed at the river banks and valleys shi et al 2018 which generated large amount of no3 entering the river channel chen et al 2013 in the monitored hydrology period 32 5 32 5 13 3 and 21 6 of the fluvial no3 fluxes determined at nx station locating at the most downstream of the river channel among the monitored stretches were from son cf am ap and sw respectively fig 7e it was worth noting that the lowest stretch in this study between yc and nx station also contributed 34 6 of the no3 fluxes of which 24 3 26 3 22 1 and 27 3 were from son cf am ap and sw respectively fig 7f the notable increased contribution of ap has been observed in the lower reaches which was not unexpected as the precipitation there were documented significantly higher than those in the stretches upstream gao et al 2012 in addition the steeper topography at the downstream fig 1 limited the retention of ap no3 in the basin before it was transported into the river channel the no3 fluxes of soil sources son cf and am also increased with the high precipitation in the low reach fig 7e overall the sources apportionment results agreed well with the analyses of the water chemistry and multiple isotopic compositions and showed similar contribution portions with those of agricultural basins ji et al 2017 jiang et al 2020b 2021a yue et al 2017 3 5 a hypothetical model depicting fluvial no3 export regime at basin scale based on the above observations and discussion we proposed a conceptual model for fluvial no3 export flux in river basins considering both anthropogenic and climatic forcing fig 8 the two forcing effects were linked by the balance between the strength of water leaching which was reflected by runoff huang et al 2012 lin et al 2022 and the rate of net no3 generation which was a function of land use type anthropogenic activity temperature and precipitation donhauser et al 2021 li et al 2020 no3 flux was at a minimum when water leaching flux stayed at a low level range relative to that of the net no3 generation i e transport limited regime in this regime no3 flux could change linearly in response to runoff variation but the sensitivity of no3 flux to runoff was closely related to no3 accumulation storage in the basin in contrast the no3 flux should be maximized when no3 was able to be effectively transported as the runoff increasing resulting in a generation limited regime in the latter scenario fluvial no3 flux were largely dependent on the net no3 generation rate that was regulated by thermodynamic of biological production via nitrification removal via assimilation denitrification anammox and dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra and the rate of exogenic no3 inputs based on the hypothetical model the no3 dynamics in the yarlung tsangpo river basin was regarded overall transport limited although spatiotemporal heterogeneity in different sections might exist while the nitrification was documented to be limited by the low temperature on the plateau ma et al 2020 the no3 could still be excess and accumulated in the soils considering the low map and the increased intensity of anthropogenic activities e g grazing and urbanization especially for the middle reaches the higher no3 generation rate associated with anthropogenic activities could lead to no3 accumulation in soils chen et al 2013 resulting in higher no3 export per unit of runoff higher sensitivity to runoff huang et al 2012 as suggested by the higher slops of the regression line in the more intensely human activity disturbed middle stretches figs 5 and 8 while higher temperature would prompt nitrification the sensitivity of no3 flux to runoff variation in the warm lower reaches was relatively low fig 5 suggesting that the impact of anthropogenic activities on no3 accumulation storage and further hydrologic flow transportation might outcompete that of temperature on the plateau we speculated that the impact of temperature on nitrification so as to the fluvial no3 flux was likely inconclusive in the background of the plateau in all this proposed regime can integrate the coupled roles of hydrological condition temperature and anthropogenic activities in regulating the fluvial no3 flux in the large tibetan river the yarlung tsangpo river basin has strong environmental and anthropogenic gradients almost covering the coldest the warmest the driest the wettest the most pristine and the most disturbed settings in the tibetan plateau shi et al 2018 given the strong climatic and anthropogenic gradients in the river basin a uniform transport limited regime of no3 export was observed in different stretches from the upper to the lower reaches of the river implying that this regime was likely applicative in other large river basins on the tibetan plateau however in the context of global change and current limited dataset it is hard to quantitatively estimate how long the present transport limited regime will last the transition threshold between this regime and the generation limited regime theoretically would be dependent on the relative intensity of no3 leaching by runoff to net no3 generation in the basin the plateau mat was expected to increase by 0 3 0 5 c per decade in this century chen et al 2013 ipcc 2007 xu et al 2008 studies suggested that nitrification would increase by 25 when temperature increased by 5 10 c in the tibetan plateau wang et al 2017b yin et al 2012 considering the single factor variation of warming the nitrification in the plateau could increase by 7 22 by 2065 furthermore a global meta analysis compiling 3140 observations showed that total soil n content was the most important factors in determining soil nitrification rate li et al 2020 considering the expanding farming and grazing and increasing n precipitation associated with anthropogenic nitrogen oxides nox emissions that would input more n to the soil chen et al 2013 the nitrification in the tibetan plateau could increase even faster li et al 2020 previous hydrological model showed that the runoff of the yarlung tsangpo river would decrease by 19 by 2065 due to the decreased meltwater supply albeit the precipitation might increase by 25 immerzeel et al 2010 the runoff of other large rivers on the tibetan plateau e g upper indus ganges yangtze were also predicted to decrease by 5 20 by 2065 with an exception of the yellow river whose runoff would increase by 9 5 because this river relied only marginally on melt water recharging immerzeel et al 2010 given the potentially increasing nitrification decreasing runoff and water sources change the future patterns of the fluvial no3 fluxes of tibetan rivers remain in large uncertainty and more time series observation and modeling work on nutrient and water cycle in different basin background is in need noting the large environmental parameters and anthropogenic activity heterogeneity in the tibetan plateau the generation limited regime might most likely exist in the arid northern tibetan plateau river catchments where river runoff was increasing in recent decades in response to climate change but soil there was poorly developed yao et al 2007 however more observation and exploration there was in need to testify the inference the fluvial no3 flux in generation limited regime would be controlled largely by no3 generation via nitrification meta analysis revealed complicated controlling factors for the global variations of soil nitrification e g soil n content microbial biomass n temperature precipitation soil ph and soil c n ratio and the key controlling factors for nitrification at basin scale would vary from one basin to another in addition multiple no3 transformation processes e g nitrification denitrification assimilation dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium should be considered as they jointly regulate net no3 generation rate quantitative studies on the observation and simulation of no3 generation transportation and transformation processes in typical environment are in need to further clarify the conceptual model and develop it into a quantitative one to illustrate the coupled cycling of bio elements and water in a river basin 5 conclusion the high resolution spatiotemporal results indicated that hydrologic condition served as the first order control on fluvial no3 export fluxes in the yarlung tsangpo river the increased leaching of 15n depleted nitrate from the soil was capable of counterbalancing the water diluting effect of riverine no3 in the high flow season strong spatial heterogeneities for no3 contribution was observed in the basin with the middle stretches accounting for the highest portion 56 of which 74 were from soil sources we proposed a conceptual model to illustrate the fluvial no3 export fluxes in different anthropogenic and climatic forcing scenario which could be interpreted by transport limited and generation limited regimes depending on the coupled effects of hydrological condition temperature and anthropogenic activities fluvial no3 flux in the tibetan plateau is currently dominated by the transport limited regime which is characterized by a relatively stable no3 concentration level as runoff varies through a hydrological year and thus by a linearly response of the riverine no3 flux to runoff variation as the first systematic high frequency hydro chemical and multiple isotope index monitoring work in the world highest large river basin this work could shed lights into the coupled

15426,nutrient element cycling in the tibetan plateau the highest and largest plateau in the world is sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of reactive nitrogen n predominantly in the form of nitrate no3 in the plateau is crucial to understand the regional and global n cycles and their feedbacks with climate change we conducted the first weekly frequency hydro geochemical monitoring i e discharge water chemistry and multiple isotopes from the upper to the lower reaches of the yarlung tsangpo river the largest river in the plateau in pronounced wet dry cycles to reveal the biogeochemical transformations and fluvial fluxes of no3 response to hydrologic condition relative stable no3 concentration and significant linear correlations between the fluvial no3 fluxes and the discharge were observed suggesting that a significant potential no3 source counterbalanced the diluting effects during the rainy season the negative correlations between δ15n no3 and discharge no3 fluxes suggested that the increasing no3 flux respond to the increasing discharge was mainly from water leaching of 15n depleted soil sources rather than 15n enriched sewage the isotopic mixing model calculation showed that no3 fluxes were largely generated in the relatively densely populated middle reaches 56 of which 74 were from soil sources the fluxes of the soil sources showed large seasonal variation and peaked in august with hydrological condition as the primary driver based on the critical findings we put forward a no3 export conceptual model that integrated anthropogenic and climatic forcings and classified no3 export mechanisms in river basins into transport limited and generation limited regimes in a transport limited regime that characterized most river basins in the tibetan plateau fluvial no3 flux presented a linearly relationship in response to runoff variation in contrast in a generation limited regime the flux would be largely dependent on the thermodynamic of nitrification graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords time series river hydro geochemical monitoring hydrological domination nitrate flux the tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global nitrogen n export by rivers largely in the form of nitrate no3 has been deeply altered by disturbances by burgeoning human activities and climate change erisman et al 2013 xia et al 2018 in the past century the global fluvial n flux has increased more than 90 from 34 tg n yr 1 to 64 tg n yr 1 beusen et al 2016 causing eutrophication and episodic acidification problems in aquatic systems fennel and testa 2019 sinha et al 2017 yao et al 2020 suggested that annual global release of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o from rivers had increased fourfold from 70 gg n in 1900 to 291 gg n in 2016 the dynamics and fluxes of fluvial no3 is crucial in understanding regional and global n cycle and its interactions with the basin hydrological condition the no3 flux of a river depends on the generation e g atmospheric precipitation and nitrification and the removing e g retention versus leaching in soils biological removal via assimilation and denitrification of no3 in a river basin jiang et al 2021a 2021b randall and mulla 2001 yan et al 2022 quantifying the relative contribution of these variables in relation to no3 flux is challenging as n fate related processes are usually coupled and hard to be distinguished from each another jiang et al 2021a there have been many studies addressing the microbiology physiology and impacting environment factors of site specific patterns of no3 generation via in stream or in soil nitrification li et al 2020 ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 a limited number of studies examined the no3 flux and the controlling factors in river basins huang et al 2012 mueller et al 2016 however these studies mostly focused on no3 concentrations in small scale river basins yet could not realize the source apportionment or elucidation of transformation processes few studies have linked no3 generation to fluvial flux at large river basin scale especially for remote area such as the plateaus which are particularly sensitive to the climate change and human activity disturbance nanus et al 2008 hundey et al 2016 isotope signals of riverine no3 δ15n δ18o no3 are important supplements to conventional discharge and water chemistry monitoring because they are capable of tracing the sources and transformations of riverine no3 kendall et al 2007 liu et al 2013 matiatos et al 2021 wong et al 2018 xia et al 2017 dual isotopes of no3 have been applied to explore the sources and fates of no3 at large basin scales based on spatial samples in recent studies hu et al 2019 jiang et al 2022 however high frequency time series no3 isotopes monitoring in large rivers are scarce what has been in particularly lacking from previous studies is the quantitative exploration of the driving mechanisms of fluvial no3 flux in large river basins through a combined high frequency time series hydro chemical and isotopic monitoring especially for those poorly gauged and ecologically fragile basins in high altitude regions however these are exactly the areas with particular interests in the study of biogeochemistry cycling feedbacks to climate change the tibetan plateau is one of the most climate sensitive areas in the world and plays an important role in global n cycles chen et al 2013 as the water tower of asia it feeds ten great asian rivers immerzeel et al 2010 su et al 2016 the tibetan river basins are now facing intense environmental challenges with warming retreating glaciers thawing permafrost and increasing anthropogenic disturbance which potentially increase the fluvial no3 flux immerzeel et al 2010 qiu 2008 su et al 2016 many studies have documented increasing trends of atmospheric precipitation and glacial retreating in the plateau associated with warming climate 2 3 times the average global rate liu and chen 2000 ipcc 2007 xu et al 2008 wang et al 2021 enhancing the hydrologic connectivity and variability donner and scavia 2007 huang et al 2012 the enhanced hydrologic connectivity will facilitate the transport of no3 loads from soils in tibetan basins to the river channels which will increase the fluvial no3 flux jiang et al 2022 hydrological connectivity not only influences the soil no3 inputs into rivers but also regulates the biogeochemical behavior of no3 it is well documented that soil no3 content and the processes involved in no3 yield e g nitrification and denitrification are closely related to precipitation patterns li et al 2020 2022 widespread permafrost thawing may trigger considerable amounts of n release to the tibetan rivers salmon et al 2016 wang et al 2021 furthermore the expansion of anthropogenic activities on the plateau has increased the production of reactive n and its input to rivers chen et al 2013 wang et al 2017a the no3 dynamics and fluxes of large tibetan rivers could be disproportionately altered in the context of global change however the critical driving forces of the fluvial no3 fluxes there is still not well constrained limiting our understanding on the nutrients cycling and its feedbacks to climate change high spatiotemporal resolution studies on riverine hydro geochemistry under different environmental gradients would provide critical information on the dynamics of reactive n and its controlling mechanism in the plateau but these works are lacking to address the current gap we conducted the first weekly frequency time series hydro geochemical monitoring work from the upper to the lower reaches of the yarlung tsangpo river the largest river on the tibetan plateau and also the highest large river basin in the world we measured the spatiotemporal variations of water chemistry and multiple isotope composition δ15n δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o to look into the spatiotemporal patterns of no3 flux in response to the hydrologic condition in the tibetan river and the dynamics of biogeochemical transformations and hydrologic transport mechanisms of no3 under pronounced wet dry cycles and contrasting anthropogenic disturbances furthermore we proposed a conceptual model to depict a hydrologic domination on the fluvial no3 export regime for large river basins on the tibetan plateau which clarified the coupled processes of transport and generation of river basin no3 2 materials and methods 2 1 natural and anthropogenic settings the yarlung tsangpo river fig 1 a is the longest river on the tibetan plateau 2057 km and the highest large river in the world mean elevation 4621 m yu et al 2021 the river flows from west to east with an elevation gradient of more than 8000 m and a drainage area of 240 480 km2 fig 1 shi et al 2018 yao et al 2010 the yarlung tsangpo river basin are divided into four stretches by the lhaze lz nugesha ngs yancun yc and nuxia nx counties from the upper to the down reaches of river main channel fig 1 the river drains through different climatic zones along the longitudinal direction with the mean annual air temperature mat and mean annual precipitation map gradually increasing from the upper reaches i e above lz to the lower reaches i e yc to nx gao et al 2012 there is an obvious west east gradient in both climate and hydrology regime across the basin map decreases from 1000 mm near the eastern himalayan syntaxis to 200 mm in the headwaters the basin is dominated by westerlies from october to may and precipitation is relatively rare after mid june the warm moist air masses from the bay of bengal are blocked by the himalayas and move upward along the river valley bringing abundant precipitation to the southern part of the tibetan plateau hren et al 2009 ren et al 2017 with relatively small inter annual variation and significant seasonal variation precipitation condition can be divided into rainy season and dry season precipitation mainly happens in the period of june to september which accounts for about 65 80 of its annual total in the basin liu et al 2018 the land use types of different stretches were tabulated in table s1 the upper and lower reaches of the basin are sparsely populated shi et al 2018 in contrast large cities i e lhasa and shigatse are located in the middle reaches i e lz to yc fig 1 and these cities are the most important centers for human habitation in tibet such significant spatial heterogeneity in the natural and anthropogenic settings provides an ideal opportunity to study the n cycling and its driving mechanisms on the tibetan plateau at a large river basin scale 2 2 hydro geochemical monitoring in this study weekly monitoring and sampling campaigns were conducted at four sampling stations i e lz yc ngs and nx on the main channel of the yarlung tsangpo river from april to november 2019 fig 1 the time series sampling covered the major intra annual flow variations in weekly frequency and from the upper to the lower reaches of the river table s2 water samples were immediately filtered through gf f filter membrane 0 7 μm pore size after sampling and the filtrate were stored in high density polyethylene bottles the samples for δ15n δ18o no3 value analyzing were frozen immediately after filtering all water samples were measured for ph temperature and electrical conductivity using pre calibrated portable water quality probes hach usa in the field an aliquot of unfiltered sample was collected for δ18o h2o analyses and bottles were filled in full and immediately sealed with para film to avoid evaporation the samples were stored in the refrigerator pending analyses the instantaneous river discharge at the sampling time were recorded chloride cl and no3 concentrations were determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 900 with uncertainties of 5 the δ15n δ18o no3 compositions were measured with denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 weigand et al 2016 in brief the no3 was first reduced to nitrous oxide n2o and then its δ15n and δ18o compositions were measured with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms mat 253 thermo fisher scientific the isotope data were reported in parts per thousand relative to atmospheric air air and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow with uncertainties of c a 0 3 all the isotope measurements were conducted in triplicate the δ18o h2o compositions were determined using water isotope analyzer picarro l2140i after filtration through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filter membrane the data were reported in relative to vsmow with uncertainties of 0 1 2 3 statistical analyses the strength of the correlations between two parameters was determined using the pearson correlation test in spss 22 0 for windows analysis of variance anova was performed to analyze spatiotemporal differences in parameters 2 4 no3 source apportionment after considering the potential isotopic fractionations a markov chain monte carlo mcmc isotopic mixing model integrated in the r package siar parnell et al 2010 was applied to estimate the proportional contributions of the no3 sources to the yarlung tsangpo river at a monthly frequency detailed descriptions of the model can be found in previous work jiang et al 2022 korth et al 2014 2 5 no3 flux estimates the instantaneous nutrient fluxes of no3 in g n s 1 were estimated from the instantaneous no3 concentration and the corresponding river discharge the no3 flux generated in each stretch was calculated by the difference of fluxes between its downstream and upstream stations given the no3 source apportionment was conducted at a monthly frequency the instantaneous nutrient fluxes of no3 from the potential sources in each month were estimated by multiplying the average of the instantaneous flux in a month by the proportional contribution of each source 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of no3 concentrations the hydro geochemical monitoring data for the yarlung tsangpo river in this work were tabulated in table s2 spatially the mean instantaneous river discharge showed continuously increasing trend from the lz station to the nx station p 0 001 fig 2 a the mean cl concentration decreased downstream p 0 01 fig 2b as cl was biologically and chemically conservative this pattern might imply an increasing dilution effect by increasing river discharge the no3 concentrations were 16 27 μmol l 1 averaging at 20 μmol l 1 19 52 μmol l 1 averaging at 31 μmol l 1 23 46 μmol l 1 averaging at 31 μmol l 1 and 15 26 μmol l 1 averaging at 21 μmol l 1 at lz ngs yc and nx stations respectively fig 2c and table s2 the higher no3 concentrations were observed at the ngs and yc station in the middle stretches p 0 01 fig 2c with relatively higher population density a global comparison showed that the no3 concentrations in the yarlung tsangpo river were much lower than those of mostly disturbed rivers e g mississippi rhine yellow elbe and sava rivers but were comparable with other tibetan rivers such as the lancang nujiang and the upper reaches of the yellow and changjiang rivers table s3 suggesting a natural status of the river the intra annual variations of river discharge cl and no3 concentrations at the four stations were shown in fig 3 the river discharge showed similar intra annual patterns with the highest discharge in july to august consist with the monsoonal precipitation patterns in the basin the cl concentrations and discharge displayed clear inverse relationships at all stations p 0 01 reflecting dilution effects at all stations poor and mcdonnell 2007 however the relationship between no3 concentrations and discharge were not straightforward i e no3 concentrations were approximately stable despite of the large temporal variation in river discharge fig 3 suggesting the riverine no3 was not diluted or concentrated in terms of seasonal runoff variation previous studies revealed both positive tiemeyer et al 2006 tomer et al 2003 and inverse poor and mcdonnell 2007 rollinson et al 2021 relationships between no3 concentrations and river discharge which are referred to as dilution or concentration regimes davis et al 2014 while large spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the regimes may exist the temporally stable no3 concentrations at the four monitoring sites of the yarlung tsangpo river could be ascribed to the overall well counterbalanced dilution and concentration regimes at large basin scale 3 2 characteristics of no3 fluxes and their relationships with river discharge the variations of instantaneous no3 fluxes of the four stretches were shown in a staked plot fig 4 spatially most of the no3 fluxes were generated in the relatively densely populated middle stretches the no3 fluxes in the upper reaches only accounted for one half to one sixteenth of the fluxes generated in the middle stretches during the hydrologic year fig 4 temporally the no3 fluxes exhibited a sharp increase in the wet season i e july to august fig 4 implying a strong climatic control on the no3 fluxes the seasonal variations were mostly remarkable in the human activity disturbed middle stretches in contrast the no3 fluxes in the upper and lower stretches were not as variable as those in the middle stretches in terms of seasonality implying potentially coupled anthropogenic and climatic controls on the fluvial no3 fluxes as the no3 concentrations did not change prominently with the river discharge significant linear correlations between the instantaneous fluvial no3 fluxes and the discharge were expected p 0 01 fig 5 this finding clearly showed that the no3 flux of the largest tibetan river responded directly to changes in hydrological conditions and implied that the no3 storage or generation capability in the basin was potentially large enough to support leaching export and to maintain the relatively stable level of no3 in the river water fig 3 while several recent studies have insightfully discussed the direct effects of temperature on no3 generation by nitrification donhauser et al 2021 gao et al 2009 our study highlighted the roles of the river discharge in determining fluvial no3 flux at the integrated large basin scale on the tibetan plateau this argument was in consistent with the high resolution spatial isotopic study in the nujiang river basin a major river draining on the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau which concluded that temperature impact on the riverine no3 loads was limited compared with its effects on the hydrologic condition jiang et al 2022 the sensitivities of no3 flux to river discharge variation in the middle reaches ngs and yc as reflected in the slops of the regression lines in fig 5 were much higher than those in the upper lz and lower nx reaches considering the similarities in geographical and climatic background in the upper and the middle reaches shi et al 2018 we speculated that the difference in the sensitivities to runoff could to some extent be attributed to the stronger anthropogenic activities in the middle stretches to achieve a better understanding of the driving forces of no3 flux variations the inventory of the source and the fate of no3 in the river basin should be specified and multiple isotopic evidences could provide further information to addressing these issues see below 3 3 multiple isotope signals reveal a hydrology dominated control on fluvial no3 sources and fluxes the δ15n no3 at lz ngs yc and nx stations were 3 2 7 5 averaging at 5 2 1 2 7 9 averaging at 4 4 1 9 7 9 averaging at 4 5 and 2 2 6 6 averaging at 4 4 respectively fig 2d and table s2 the δ15n no3 values of the yarlung tsangpo river were much lower than those of the urban rivers such as the rhine and elbe rivers but were in the typical range of alpine or agricultural rivers such as nujiang songhua qi and sava rivers table s3 suggesting the dominant contribution from 15n depleted sources e g soil organic n chemical fertilizer and precipitation in the river basin xue et al 2009 overall no clear spatial patterns were observed for the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 fig 2d and e but the wide ranges of the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 at individual station suggested large intra annual variations in no3 sources or turnover processes altering the isotopic signals kendall et al 2007 there were strong negative correlations between δ15n no3 and river discharge fig 6 as well as no3 fluxes fig s1 at the four stations as no3 from soil sources and atmospheric precipitation are characterized by low δ15n no3 xue et al 2009 these observed correlations indicated that the increasing no3 flux respond to increasing river discharge was mainly from soil or precipitation rather than 15n enriched sewage a potentially important no3 source in a basin this trend was in consistent with the previous time series work by yue et al 2020 as the δ18o no3 values i e 10 8 to 3 4 table s2 were much lower than the typical endmember for precipitation 60 to 80 xue et al 2009 and were in the typical range for terrestrial nitrification 10 to 10 kendall et al 2007 the direct input from precipitation should be minor and a dominant role of soil sources nitrification in the fluvial no3 fluxes was more possible this speculation was also supported by the positive correlation between river discharge and no3 cl molar ratios because soil sources have been documented to have high no3 cl ratios than precipitation and sewage li et al 2019 the significant correlations between δ18o h2o and δ18o no3 at the four stations p 0 01 also verified the prevailing nitrification as o atom from h2o would be incorporated into no3 during nitrification kendall et al 2007 the time series isotopic signals suggested an intense hydrological control on basin no3 transportation dynamics hydrological conditions changed the permeability of basin soils and the transportation of materials from soil to river channel through hydrologic flow rate and path specifically in the wet season the basin was generally in a hydrologically connected state when soil leaching was more active in contrast in the dry season the basin was apt to be in a hydrologic disconnected state that inhibits materials leaching and transportation within the basin ali and roy 2010 donner and scavia 2007 huang et al 2012 previous studies showed that higher temperature and more waterlogged soils in the wet season would prompt denitrification causing increased δ15n no3 accompanied by decreasing no3 cl ratios gao et al 2009 mao et al 2020 however the wet season was characterized by the lowest δ15n no3 and the highest no3 cl ratios in this study fig 6 in addition biological no3 removal was also proposed as an important mechanism for n cycling which would result in a negative linear correlation between δ15n no3 and natural logarithm of its no3 concentrations jiang et al 2020a however no significant linear correlation was obtained at any of the four stations fig s2 rejecting no3 removal as a dominant no3 cycling process at the large basin scale in this study a recent study also suggested that no3 removal was insignificant relative to nitrification in the yarlung tsangpo river basin based on seasonal isotope networks liu et al 2022 thus the regulation of hydrologic condition on no3 flux in the yarlung tsangpo river was ascribed to be realized by altering the degrees of leaching of soils in different hydrology season 3 4 quantification of spatiotemporal no3 sources and fluxes considering the major anthropogenic activities of the river basin the endmembers included soil organic n and chemical fertilizer son cf animal manure am sewage sw and atmospheric precipitation ap the son and cf were combined in the model based on their similarities of isotopic composition and transport pathway and the isotopic endmembers for the potential no3 sources were adopted from well constrained values in previous studies table s4 and references therein the spatiotemporal sources and fluxes of no3 estimated by the mcmc isotopic mixing model were shown in fig 7 soil sources son cf and am were the dominated no3 sources in the four stretches of the river which jointly accounted up to 80 of the riverine no3 fig 7a d the fluxes of the soil sources showed large seasonal variations which were significantly higher in the wet season july to october and peaked in august fig 7a d this was attributed to the strong soil leaching associated with the higher precipitation in the rainy season the higher contributions of the soil sources observed in the wet season agreed well with the lower δ15n no3 of nitrate in river water in the high flow period fig 3 in contrast the variations of ap and sw derived fluvial no3 fluxes were not significant in terms of seasonality fig 7a d spatially the no3 fluxes in the upper reaches lz were very low fig 7e which should be attributed to the remote and pristine environment with limited anthropogenic activities in addition headwater regions constitute large portions of the available reactive surface area and are exposed to strong sunlight raymond et al 2012 zhong et al 2021 which could induce asymmetric water loss via evaporation that outpaces the stretches downstream allen et al 2018 the δ18o h2o determined at the lz station were elevated and did not follow the elevation effect fig 2f implicating strong evaporation effect the strong evaporation together with low precipitation frozen soils and flat topography could jointly limit the transportation of no3 from soil to river jiang et al 2021a the middle stretches between lz and yc station contributed 56 of the fluvial no3 fluxes fig 7f of which 74 were from soil sources son cf and am the middle stretches were the major agricultural regions in the plateau with stock and crop farming widely distributed at the river banks and valleys shi et al 2018 which generated large amount of no3 entering the river channel chen et al 2013 in the monitored hydrology period 32 5 32 5 13 3 and 21 6 of the fluvial no3 fluxes determined at nx station locating at the most downstream of the river channel among the monitored stretches were from son cf am ap and sw respectively fig 7e it was worth noting that the lowest stretch in this study between yc and nx station also contributed 34 6 of the no3 fluxes of which 24 3 26 3 22 1 and 27 3 were from son cf am ap and sw respectively fig 7f the notable increased contribution of ap has been observed in the lower reaches which was not unexpected as the precipitation there were documented significantly higher than those in the stretches upstream gao et al 2012 in addition the steeper topography at the downstream fig 1 limited the retention of ap no3 in the basin before it was transported into the river channel the no3 fluxes of soil sources son cf and am also increased with the high precipitation in the low reach fig 7e overall the sources apportionment results agreed well with the analyses of the water chemistry and multiple isotopic compositions and showed similar contribution portions with those of agricultural basins ji et al 2017 jiang et al 2020b 2021a yue et al 2017 3 5 a hypothetical model depicting fluvial no3 export regime at basin scale based on the above observations and discussion we proposed a conceptual model for fluvial no3 export flux in river basins considering both anthropogenic and climatic forcing fig 8 the two forcing effects were linked by the balance between the strength of water leaching which was reflected by runoff huang et al 2012 lin et al 2022 and the rate of net no3 generation which was a function of land use type anthropogenic activity temperature and precipitation donhauser et al 2021 li et al 2020 no3 flux was at a minimum when water leaching flux stayed at a low level range relative to that of the net no3 generation i e transport limited regime in this regime no3 flux could change linearly in response to runoff variation but the sensitivity of no3 flux to runoff was closely related to no3 accumulation storage in the basin in contrast the no3 flux should be maximized when no3 was able to be effectively transported as the runoff increasing resulting in a generation limited regime in the latter scenario fluvial no3 flux were largely dependent on the net no3 generation rate that was regulated by thermodynamic of biological production via nitrification removal via assimilation denitrification anammox and dissimilatory no3 reduction to ammonium dnra and the rate of exogenic no3 inputs based on the hypothetical model the no3 dynamics in the yarlung tsangpo river basin was regarded overall transport limited although spatiotemporal heterogeneity in different sections might exist while the nitrification was documented to be limited by the low temperature on the plateau ma et al 2020 the no3 could still be excess and accumulated in the soils considering the low map and the increased intensity of anthropogenic activities e g grazing and urbanization especially for the middle reaches the higher no3 generation rate associated with anthropogenic activities could lead to no3 accumulation in soils chen et al 2013 resulting in higher no3 export per unit of runoff higher sensitivity to runoff huang et al 2012 as suggested by the higher slops of the regression line in the more intensely human activity disturbed middle stretches figs 5 and 8 while higher temperature would prompt nitrification the sensitivity of no3 flux to runoff variation in the warm lower reaches was relatively low fig 5 suggesting that the impact of anthropogenic activities on no3 accumulation storage and further hydrologic flow transportation might outcompete that of temperature on the plateau we speculated that the impact of temperature on nitrification so as to the fluvial no3 flux was likely inconclusive in the background of the plateau in all this proposed regime can integrate the coupled roles of hydrological condition temperature and anthropogenic activities in regulating the fluvial no3 flux in the large tibetan river the yarlung tsangpo river basin has strong environmental and anthropogenic gradients almost covering the coldest the warmest the driest the wettest the most pristine and the most disturbed settings in the tibetan plateau shi et al 2018 given the strong climatic and anthropogenic gradients in the river basin a uniform transport limited regime of no3 export was observed in different stretches from the upper to the lower reaches of the river implying that this regime was likely applicative in other large river basins on the tibetan plateau however in the context of global change and current limited dataset it is hard to quantitatively estimate how long the present transport limited regime will last the transition threshold between this regime and the generation limited regime theoretically would be dependent on the relative intensity of no3 leaching by runoff to net no3 generation in the basin the plateau mat was expected to increase by 0 3 0 5 c per decade in this century chen et al 2013 ipcc 2007 xu et al 2008 studies suggested that nitrification would increase by 25 when temperature increased by 5 10 c in the tibetan plateau wang et al 2017b yin et al 2012 considering the single factor variation of warming the nitrification in the plateau could increase by 7 22 by 2065 furthermore a global meta analysis compiling 3140 observations showed that total soil n content was the most important factors in determining soil nitrification rate li et al 2020 considering the expanding farming and grazing and increasing n precipitation associated with anthropogenic nitrogen oxides nox emissions that would input more n to the soil chen et al 2013 the nitrification in the tibetan plateau could increase even faster li et al 2020 previous hydrological model showed that the runoff of the yarlung tsangpo river would decrease by 19 by 2065 due to the decreased meltwater supply albeit the precipitation might increase by 25 immerzeel et al 2010 the runoff of other large rivers on the tibetan plateau e g upper indus ganges yangtze were also predicted to decrease by 5 20 by 2065 with an exception of the yellow river whose runoff would increase by 9 5 because this river relied only marginally on melt water recharging immerzeel et al 2010 given the potentially increasing nitrification decreasing runoff and water sources change the future patterns of the fluvial no3 fluxes of tibetan rivers remain in large uncertainty and more time series observation and modeling work on nutrient and water cycle in different basin background is in need noting the large environmental parameters and anthropogenic activity heterogeneity in the tibetan plateau the generation limited regime might most likely exist in the arid northern tibetan plateau river catchments where river runoff was increasing in recent decades in response to climate change but soil there was poorly developed yao et al 2007 however more observation and exploration there was in need to testify the inference the fluvial no3 flux in generation limited regime would be controlled largely by no3 generation via nitrification meta analysis revealed complicated controlling factors for the global variations of soil nitrification e g soil n content microbial biomass n temperature precipitation soil ph and soil c n ratio and the key controlling factors for nitrification at basin scale would vary from one basin to another in addition multiple no3 transformation processes e g nitrification denitrification assimilation dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium should be considered as they jointly regulate net no3 generation rate quantitative studies on the observation and simulation of no3 generation transportation and transformation processes in typical environment are in need to further clarify the conceptual model and develop it into a quantitative one to illustrate the coupled cycling of bio elements and water in a river basin 5 conclusion the high resolution spatiotemporal results indicated that hydrologic condition served as the first order control on fluvial no3 export fluxes in the yarlung tsangpo river the increased leaching of 15n depleted nitrate from the soil was capable of counterbalancing the water diluting effect of riverine no3 in the high flow season strong spatial heterogeneities for no3 contribution was observed in the basin with the middle stretches accounting for the highest portion 56 of which 74 were from soil sources we proposed a conceptual model to illustrate the fluvial no3 export fluxes in different anthropogenic and climatic forcing scenario which could be interpreted by transport limited and generation limited regimes depending on the coupled effects of hydrological condition temperature and anthropogenic activities fluvial no3 flux in the tibetan plateau is currently dominated by the transport limited regime which is characterized by a relatively stable no3 concentration level as runoff varies through a hydrological year and thus by a linearly response of the riverine no3 flux to runoff variation as the first systematic high frequency hydro chemical and multiple isotope index monitoring work in the world highest large river basin this work could shed lights into the coupled cycling of bio elements and water in the tibetan plateau which would facilitate effective policies for water resource and land use management to maintain a sustainable healthy surface water

15427,microbial electrolysis cell mec is a promising technology for effective energy conversion of wastewater organics to biogas yet in swine wastewater treatment the complex contaminants including antibiotics may affect mec performance while the high ammonia concentration might increase this risk by increasing cell membrane permeability in this work the responses of mecs on tetracycline tc with low and high ammonia loadings 80 and 1000 mg l 1 were fully investigated the tc of 0 to 1 mg l 1 slightly improved mec performance in current production and electrochemical characteristics with low ammonia loading while tc 4 mg l 1 started to show negative effects generally the high ammonia loading sensitized mecs to tc concentration inducing the current and cod removal of mecs to sharply decline with tc 0 5 mg l 1 the positive effect of high ammonia loading on mec due to conductivity increase was counteracted with tc 1 mg l 1 the co contamination of tc and ammonia significantly decreased the bioactivity and biomass of anode biofilm although the high concentration of co existing tc and ammonia inhibited mec performance the reactors still obtained positive energy feedback the network analyses indicated that the effluent suspension contributed much to antibiotic resistance gene arg transmission while the microplastics mps in wastewater greatly raised the risks of args spreading this work systematically examined the synergetic effects of tc and ammonia and the transmission of args in mec operation which is conducive to expediting the application of mecs in swine wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrolysis cell co contamination effects tetracycline ammonia antibiotic resistance genes 1 introduction antibiotics refer to some natural or synthetic compounds that are widely used in medical agricultural and aquaculture industries to prevent or treat diseases for their bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the massive use of antibiotics in the breeding industry has now become an important source of antibiotic pollution in the natural environment wang et al 2017 among which pig farming industry was one of the most important breeding industries due to the huge breeding scale and wide distribution gao et al 2020 the animals use only a few amounts of antibiotics in feed while most of the residual antibiotics or their antibacterial metabolites were finally discharged into the environment through urine and feces ondon et al 2020 pei et al 2019 tetracycline tc is one of the most used antibiotics in intensive pig farms huang et al 2021 sui et al 2017 a large amount of tc residuals was discharged into swine wastewater with concentrations up to 388 7 μg l 1 liu et al 2021 causing serious contamination in receiving river sediment or soil zhou et al 2013 antibiotic resistance genes args are another hazardous derivative of antibiotic contamination long term exposure to antibiotics selects resistance microorganisms and induces them to produce resistance genes the horizontal gene transfer hgt even causes the wide propagation of args sun et al 2019 therefore the preventions of antibiotic pollution and arg propagation are essential in the treatment of swine wastewater microbial electrolysis cell mec is emerging as an attractive technology for various high strength wastewater treatments due to its advantages of in situ energy conversion and synchronously pollution removal yan et al 2019 compared with the traditional biological technologies mec shows great superiority in low sludge yield kim et al 2007 high electron utilization efficiency for biogas production liang et al 2020 and electron flow assisted organic degradation cao et al 2020 the bioelectrochemical reactions also assisted the rapid degradation of antibiotics in previous reports under an applied voltage of 0 8 v a three dimensional biofilm electrode reactor 3d ber could remove 89 3 95 6 of tc within 40 h zhang et al 2016 however as antibacterial substances and signaling molecules the impact of antibiotics on bio reactors often presents a dosage effect for instance a restricted tobramycin loading of 0 1 mg l 1 showed accelerating effects on bioelectrochemical reaction resulting in increased current biomass and geobacter abundance while the further increase of tobramycin loading to 0 3 mg l 1 would adversely affect the electrochemical activity of mfc zhou et al 2017 furthermore the high ammonia concentration in swine wastewater might pose a challenge to mec application the mecs could prevent the generation of high concentration free ammonia for their wide adaption range of ph value yet the accumulation of nh4 also influenced the performance of mecs wang et al 2022 in the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane the nh4 can combine with the phosphate radical resulting in the change of cell membrane permeability and the leakage of important cellular contents like phosphate nucleotides amino acids purine pyrimidine k etc przestalski et al 1991 zhong et al 2013 to some extent this change in the cell membrane may not adversely affect the performance of mec but stimulate the metabolism of microorganisms and thereby accelerate the electron transport process however considering most antibiotics have intracellular action sites the membrane permeabilization may increase the chance that tetracycline enters cells to hinder protein synthesis and dna replication liu et al 2021 the microplastic mp in swine wastewater was another factor that may show interaction effects with antibiotics on mecs in the breeding industry plastics are widely used in feedbags water faucets and feed bowls manure scrapers and plastic bottles for storing disinfectants or antibiotics wu et al 2021 and their degradation products would enter the digestive system of pigs and cause mp pollution arias andres et al 2018 the mps like polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polyethylene terephthalate pet were widely detected in large intestine specimens and feces of animals ramachandraiah et al 2022 plastic debris serves as an ideal interface for biofilm formation due to the high specific surface area thus acting as carriers of pathogenic microorganisms and args in wastewater treatment plants hu et al 2022 moreover the enhanced hgt among different species is considered to be a key contributor to arg propagation due to the increased abundance of mobile genetic elements mges such as inti1 on the mp surface shi et al 2020 whereas the role of microplastics in the dissemination of args in the microbial electrochemical system is still poorly understood in this study mecs fed by synthetic swine wastewater were operated to investigate the mec performances to tetracycline tc with high concentrated ammonia the mec performances including current generation chemical oxygen demand cod removal and energy recovery were systematically analyzed with different tc loadings the anodic electrochemical characteristics of mecs were analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv tests the response of anode biofilm to the increased tc concentration under different ammonia loadings was characterized by a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm while the anode biomass changes were tested using bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay the changes in biocommunities functional genes and the fate of tc resistance genes in anode biofilms effluent bacteria and microplastic biofilms were also investigated using high throughput sequencing of 16s rdna and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr these findings will offer a profound understanding of the co occurrence and the risk of antibiotics ammonia and mps in the microbial electrochemical system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction and operation single chamber mecs used in this study were assembled with an empty bed volume of 28 ml φ 3 0 cm l 4 cm and an effective working volume of 23 ml call and logan 2008 carbon brush φ 3 0 cm l 3 0 cm made by wringing graphite fiber into two twisted titanium wires and double layer stainless steel mesh φ 3 8 cm 60 mesh type 304 were equipped as anode and cathode with a gap of 0 5 cm the current was monitored by collecting the voltage v across the external resistor r 10 ω which was connected in series with mec the gas was collected by an aluminum foil bag 0 1 l haide china which was connected to mec by a polypropylene tube and silicone plug fig s1 twenty four mec reactors were inoculated with anaerobic sludge which was obtained from jinnan sludge treatment plant tianjin china the medium used for incubation contained 2 56 g l 1 ch3coona 5 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 nacl 0 31 g l 1 nh4cl and 1 ml l 1 trace elements solution qin and he 2014 before utilization the medium was purged with n2 for 15 min to remove the dissolved oxygen to investigate the influence of tc with ammonia on mecs two ammonia concentrations of 80 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 were chosen according to previous work wang et al 2022 all those reactors were started under ammonia of 80 mg l 1 labeled as l and then half of the mecs gradually adapted to high ammonia loading of 1000 mg l 1 labeled as h the mecs were operated under a continuous voltage of 0 9 v supplied by a direct current dc power hyk 60e12 hua yao china until the reproducible current curves were obtained for three continuous cycles the anode was considered to be fully developed the tested influent concentrations of tc in mecs were 0 0 5 1 2 4 and 6 mg l 1 from l0 or h0 to l6 or h6 the reactors were operated in batch mode under constant temperature at 30 1 c the medium was replaced until the current dropped below 1 ma the cathodes were replaced every time the electrolyte conditions were changed to avoid the uncontrolled interference from the cathodic biofilm all the experiments were performed with at least triplicate reactors the experiment lasted for more than 2500 h and the mecs were operated stably for at least three cycles under each treatment to make the anode biofilm adapt to the environmental changes fig s2 after the examination of contaminant effects of tc and ammonia 1 g l 1 of polymethyl methacrylate pmma mp φ 0 2 0 45 mm were added to mecs with 6 mg l 1 of tc and 1000 mg l 1 of ammonia loading after two months of culture the particles were cleaned with a sterile solution of 0 9 nacl and stored at 80 c for arg analysis 2 2 analytical methods mec performance was estimated in terms of current cod removal coulombic efficiency biogas production and energy recovery the detailed calculation formulas could refer to supplementary information section s1 effluent samples from mec reactors were collected in triplicate and then filtered through 0 22 μm fiber filters the concentrations of cod were determined by heating digestion methods using a cod reagent hach co co america and tested by the spectrophotometer dr3900 hach co co america exionlc ad uplc sciex us coupled to ab sciex qtrap4500 tandem mass spectrometer sciex us was used for the detection of tc concentration in water samples the uplc ms ms system was controlled by analyst 1 7 software supplementary information section s2 the gas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatograph sp 2100a beifen ruili china which was equipped with a packed column tdx 01 3 m 3 mm zhong ke hui jie china and a thermal conductivity detector tcd argon was used as the carrier gas the temperatures of the column oven injector and tcd were 130 c 60 c and 220 c all electrochemical tests were performed using an electrochemical workstation aut302n v metrohm switzerland in a standard three electrode system with a double layer stainless steel mesh as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode sce as the reference electrode the charge transfer resistance of mec anodes under different tc concentrations was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis tests with the frequency ranging from 100 khz to 0 01 hz the amplitude of the applied sinusoidal voltage signal was 0 014 v the potential applied was 0 4 v vs sce based on the normal anode potential in daily operation wang et al 2016 the cyclic voltammetry cv tests were conducted under turnover conditions with substrate and non turnover conditions no substrate in a scanning range of 0 7 v to 0 2 v vs sce at the scan rate of 1 mv s 1 all the electrode potential data reported in this study were calculated versus sce 2 3 biofilm characterization the confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm lsm800 carl zeiss germany was used for the analysis of biofilm activity under different tc concentrations the anode biofilm adhered to the surface of carbon brush fibers was stained with 2 μmol l 1 calcein am and 1 5 μmol l 1 pi then the samples were washed with 50 mmol l 1 pbs to eliminate the residual fluorescent agent the abundance of active cells was calculated based on the fluorescence intensities all those steps were carried out at 37 c under dark conditions finally the biofilm was observed through the clsm with the excitation emission wavelengths of calcein am and pi were 490 515 nm green and 535 615 nm red kong et al 2014 to detect the changes in biomass attached to the surface of carbon fibers the anodes were quantificationally cut to 0 04 g and incubated with naoh solution 0 2 mol l 1 2 ml 95 c 20 min to release the attached microorganisms after that the biomass of anode samples was measured using bicinchoninic acid protein assay kits bca02 ding guo prosperous china 2 4 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing the biological samples were collected in triplicate after steadily operating for at least three repeatable cycles under different tc concentrations the biofilm samples were cut off from three different points of carbon brush and then mixed in a sterile centrifuge tube the effluent of mecs was centrifuged at a rate of 8000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min and the precipitate was collected in a sterile centrifuge tube genomic dna was extracted using a soil genomic dna kit cw bio beijing china following the instructions all those dna samples were stored at 20 c for the quantification of args and the high throughput sequencing for bacteria the v3 v4 region of the 16s rdna gene was amplified using primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 tan et al 2016 the analyses of predicted functional genes of the anode biocommunities in the high ammonia group were conducted using the picrust2 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states program with kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database on the majorbio cloud platform majorbio technology co ltd shanghai china li et al 2022a the abundance of args was determined by real time quantitative pcr technology on the majorbio platform the target genes analyzed in this study include five tc resistance genes teta tetm teto tetq tetx and a mobile element class 1 integron inti1 li et al 2015 song et al 2021 primer sequences targeting these genes and qpcr protocol were listed in table s1 the correlation coefficient r 2 was higher than 0 99 the relative abundance of args was assessed by normalizing their copy numbers to 16s rrna genes su et al 2021 2 5 statistical analyses the standard deviation sd was calculated based on the average value of those reactors the statistical package of ibm spss statistics version 26 0 was used to perform a one way anova analysis to compare the differences in the means of the variables between different treatments to explore the co occurrence features between args anode biocommunity and effluent suspension network analysis based on a correlation matrix was performed with the thresholds significance p 0 05 and spearman s r 0 8 relative calculations were carried out through r 1 3 1093 with the psych package and the co occurrence networks were visualized using gephi 0 9 2 to reveal the potential host relations wang et al 2021 yang et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of mecs at different tc concentrations tc effects under low ammonia loading with ammonia of 80 mg l 1 mecs showed a stable performance in the current generation with tc concentrations ranging from 0 l0 to 4 mg l 1 l4 the average current was maintained at 4 6 0 3 ma in this range figs 1 a s3 table 1 then the current dropped from 5 6 0 3 to 4 3 0 6 ma with a significant decline in average current to 3 5 0 4 ma when the tc concentration further increased to 6 mg l 1 l6 p 1 08 10 6 0 05 the total electric charge declined with the decrease of cycle time when the tc concentration increased from 0 l0 to 2 mg l 1 l2 fig 1b however the tc loading greater than 2 mg l 1 l4 6 resulted in a re increase of cycle time and a stable quantity of electric charge increasing tc loading from 0 to 6 mg l 1 didn t show a significant influence on cod removal efficiency from 94 2 0 9 l0 to 89 3 l6 with the cod removal rate fluctuating between 1 28 and 1 56 kg m3 d 1 under relatively constant influent cod of 2100 100 mg l 1 fig 1c however the substrate metabolism rate of anode respiring bacteria arb decreased with tc concentration higher than 2 mg l 1 while that of non arbs was not inhibited fig s4 the gas that was collected from mec mainly consisted of hydrogen h2 methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 during the experiment a decrease in total gas volume from 58 3 to 31 5 ml was accompanied with a decrease in the proportions of h2 from 87 2 to 77 9 and co2 from 10 3 to 5 6 and the increase of ch4 proportion from 3 2 to 18 3 fig 1d increasing tc concentration from 0 l0 to 2 mg l 1 l2 the coulombic efficiency ce decreased from 107 3 to 88 6 which resulted from the decrease in electric charge quantity in one cycle fig 1e then the ce maintained at 88 7 despite the further increase in tc concentration from 2 l2 to 6 mg l 1 l6 indicating an effective energy extraction from organic matter to electrical energy with tc range from l0 to l2 the cathodic gas recovery r c a t significantly increased from 65 5 to 96 8 p 2 08 10 4 0 05 then the r c a t demonstrated a downward trend with the further increase of tc to 6 mg l 1 l6 due to the continuous decline in electrons recovered from the biogas h2 and ch4 fig s5a the energy recovery efficiency η e and η e s showed similar tendencies with r c a t while their peaks were obtained at 2 mg l 1 of tc it is worth noting that the η e based on the electricity input was higher than 100 indicating positive energy feedback could be achieved tc effects under high ammonia loading consistent with the previous study without tc the high ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 increased the mec current due to the improved electrolyte conductivity from 8 31 0 02 to 14 8 0 1 ms cm 1 figs 1a 2 a table s2 wang et al 2022 however for the high ammonia loading mecs with the increase of tc concentration the current continuously dropped with the peak current decreasing from 9 4 0 7 to 4 9 0 7 ma fig 2a the cycle time continuously raised at the same time fig 2b nevertheless the cyclic electric charge increased with tc content increasing from 0 h0 to 0 5 mg l 1 h0 5 and then declined with further increase of tc concentration to 6 mg l 1 h6 fig 2b under ammonia loading of 1000 mg l 1 the cod removal efficiency sharply decreased from 91 7 0 4 h0 to 54 9 h6 p 1 4 10 8 0 05 fig 2c correspondingly the ce increased from 102 4 to 140 20 indicating the hydrogen cycling process might increase during this process fonseca et al 2021 fig 2e the cod removal rate also rapidly decreased from 2 3 0 2 to 0 8 0 2 kg m3 d 1 p 2 23 10 9 0 05 suggesting that the metabolic capacity of functional microorganisms was seriously inhibited and the toxic effect of tc on substrate utilization was aggravated by the highly concentrated ammonia the total gas volume increased from h0 to h0 5 and declined from h0 5 to h6 fig 2d the proportions of h2 and co2 slightly decreased while that of ch4 increased from 2 1 to 6 2 the total quantity of electrons that were calculated from h2 and ch4 gas volume was relatively stable fig s5b in the tested range in the high ammonia loading mecs effective electron utilization r c a t and energy recovery η e and η e s were obtained which tended to raise with the increase of tc concentration fig 2e the high ammonia loading also adversely affected the tc removal efficiency by mecs figs 1f 2f in the low ammonia group the increase in the initial tc concentration from 0 5 l0 5 to 6 mg l 1 l6 didn t cause a severe reduction in tc removal efficiency the average removal efficiency for tc of 96 2 was obtained as the influent tc loading was 6 mg l 1 l6 fig 1f however in the high ammonia group when the initial tc concentration increased from 1 h1 to 6 mg l 1 h6 a significant decline in tc removal efficiency from 92 3 to 81 5 p 1 64 10 4 0 05 demonstrated that high ammonia loading adversely affected the antibiotic degradation capacity of mec fig 2f in summary tc loading of more than 2 mg l 1 adversely affected the current production and substrate metabolism of arb while the synergistic effect of tc and ammonia nitrogen aggravated the negative influence on mec with high ammonia nitrogen of 1000 mg l 1 both current production and cod removal were inhibited from h0 to h6 while the cycle time increased under both high and low ammonia loadings the h2 production showed a downward trend while ch4 production increased whereas the total electron recovered from biogas with highly concentrated ammonia was relatively stable than that of low ammonia mecs based on different calculation formulas the combined effects of those core parameters of mec operation caused changes in the recovery efficiencies of electrons and energy as discussed above 3 2 electrochemical characteristics of anode biofilm under different tc concentrations the internal resistances and electrochemical activities of anodes were measured by eis and cv tests fig 3 without tc ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 significantly reduced the ohmic resistance rs and charge transfer resistance rct1 and rct2 indicating the anodic activity was improved l0 vs h0 this phenomenon was consistent with the previous research that the electrochemical activity of the anode was improved as ammonia loading increased from 80 to 1000 mg l 1 wang et al 2022 the onset potential of cathodic reduction reaction in cv curves was also reduced from 1 024 0 004 v to 0 996 0 007 v due to the increased solution conductivity while the increase in tc concentration under the same ammonia loading didn t cause a significant difference in the cathodic activity fig s6 table s3 however in this study the highly concentrated ammonia adversely affected the responses of anodic electrochemical characteristics to tc in the eis curves the starting point represents the solution resistance rs the diameter of the semicircular arc in the high frequency range represents the charge transfer resistance rct1 affected by substrate diffusion wang et al 2022 while that of the large semicircle in the low frequency region was considered another charge transfer resistance rct2 related to the activation process on the anode surface owing to the dispersion effect the electric double layer deviates from the ideal electric double layer yin et al 2013 hence the rct1 and rct2 were in parallel with constant phase elements cpe and the impedance spectra of the mec anode were analyzed by fitting to the equivalent circuit r rc rc in the low ammonia group the rct2 initially presented a decreasing trend from 13 6 2 9 to 12 3 1 2 ω with tc concentration raising from 0 l0 to 1 mg l 1 l1 fig 3a table s4 simultaneously there was also a slight improvement in anodic catalytic activity under turnover conditions and the maximum catalytic current of 9 5 0 6 ma in the cv plot was obtained in l1 fig 3b the electrochemical performance of mec anodes was steady with tc concentration between 0 l0 and 4 mg l 1 l4 however the further increase in tc content didn t bring a correspondent improvement in electrochemical performance the rct2 then increased to 51 4 11 1 ω when tc concentration gradually raised to 6 mg l 1 l6 while the catalytic current reduced to 5 3 0 9 ma at the same time in the high ammonia group tc also demonstrated a significant enhancement of anode electrochemical performance fig 3c d however the peak anode electrochemical activity was obtained at a tc concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 h0 5 with a minimum charge transfer resistance of 15 2 3 7 ω and a maximum catalytic current of 11 2 ma then the electrochemical activity of anodes sharply declined it revealed that tc had a slight improvement in anodic electrochemical performance at low concentrations but the highly concentrated ammonia weakened that stimulating effect when further increased tc concentration to 1 mg l 1 the maximum current of cv curves began to be lower than that of low ammonia loading mecs with a rapid decline in the average current fig s7 the non turnover cv tests were performed to identify the changes in extracellular electron transfer features with tc concentration increasing fig 3e f without the interference of high ammonia two main redox peaks were detected in cv curves fig 3e the peak1 centered at 0 45 0 02 v which was linked to the mediated electron transfer met by endogenously secreted flavins xiao et al 2017 the peak2 centered at 0 19 0 01 v which may be related to the direct electron transfer det by outer membrane c type cytochrome a omca marsili et al 2008 these two peaks were not distinct and there was nearly no change in extracellular electron transfer as tc concentration increased from 0 l0 to 6 mg l 1 l6 however the electron transfer peaks in the biofilm which was cultured under ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 were more visible than that in the low ammonia group fig 3f one more redox peak appeared at 0 37 0 01 v which may be attributable to the direct electron transfer det by outer membrane c type cytochrome z omcz li et al 2020 that might be due to the decrease of biomass and extracellular polymeric substance eps secretion after long term exposure to high ammonia loading wang et al 2022 the activity of anode biofilm under different tc concentrations in two groups was characterized by clsm fig 4 in the low ammonia group increasing the initial tc concentration from 0 l0 to 2 mg l 1 l2 didn t significantly affect the biofilm activity carbon fibers were closely covered by a dense and active biofilm with an active cell proportion of 70 3 while it began to decrease with tc concentration further raising to higher than 2 mg l 1 fig 4a b at that moment the biomass showed a reduction from 16 2 0 6 to 14 8 0 6 mg g 1 fig s8 it was also demonstrated in sem that the biofilm was tightly attached to the graphic fibers during the whole experiment from l0 to l6 fig s9 however for the high ammonia group a serious inhibition of anode biofilm was caused by tc 1 mg l 1 fig 4a b when tc concentration gradually increased from 0 h0 to 6 mg l 1 h6 the percentage of active cells sharply decreased from 62 4 to 38 4 with a significant decline in biomass from 12 5 0 5 to 7 7 0 9 mg g 1 p 1 02 10 4 0 05 fig s8 initially in h0 parts of the graphite fibers were exposed to the medium while the biofilm was sparse in h6 fig s9 it is worth noticing in the high ammonia group that the biofilm demonstrated a distinct change from the surface to the interior layer when tc concentration was up to 4 mg l 1 h4 fig 4c as it manifested after being stained by pi and calcein am the green biofilm gradually changed to red from the surface to the inside which might be resulted from the increased hazard of tc with high ammonia the steady growth of biofilm helps the bacteria to enhance their ability to survive treatment with antimicrobial agents akinbobola et al 2017 the attenuation of anode biomass in the high ammonia group will inevitably weaken its tolerance to antibiotics moreover membrane permeabilization also aggravated the damage of biofilm by tc thus appearing as red in clsm images 3 3 changes in microbial community the high throughput sequencing was adopted to investigate the changes in anode communities caused by the co contamination of tc and ammonia fig 5 totally eight exoelectrogens genera with the abundance greater than 1 were found in the bacterial communities of two groups table s5 s6 in the low ammonia group increasing tc concentration from 0 l0 to 2 mg l 1 l2 significantly enhanced the enrichment of exoelectrogens as a typical exoelectrogen reguera et al 2005 adhikari et al 2016 the relative abundance of geobacter sp was greatly improved from 38 59 to 68 78 fig 5 table s5 at that point the substrate metabolic rate of exoelectrogens was steady for electric generation fig s4 the total relative abundance of all those exoelectrogen genera also raised from 60 24 to 74 89 from 0 l0 to 2 mg l 1 l2 however when tc concentration further increased to 4 mg l 1 l4 there was a sharp decline in the total abundance of exoelectrogens which might be resulted from the inhibition of tc on their metabolism capacity and biofilm activity figs 4 s4 for the high ammonia group different biocommunity changes were observed fig 5 table s6 with tc concentration gradually increasing from 0 h0 to 6 mg l 1 h6 the relative abundance of geobacter sp significantly increased from 3 05 to 68 12 while the total abundance of exoelectrogens also raised from 44 27 to 71 05 which might be attributed to the sharp decline of anode biomass fig s8 the increased tc loading had a certain screening effect on the anodic functional bacteria which made the exoelectrogens gradually dominate the community functional enzymes of microbial community predicted by picrust2 were further analyzed using the kegg database figs s10 s11 in high ammonia loading mecs the substrate utilization was seriously inhibited by tc while the total electron recovered from biogas showed a steady trend with an increasing ch4 proportion fig 2d the methanogenesis pathways that existed in acetate fed mecs mainly included the hydrogenotrophic pathway h2 and co2 to ch4 and the aceticlastic pathway acetate to ch4 xin et al 2019 yin et al 2018 fig s10 with tc loading increasing from 0 l0 to 6 mg l 1 l6 genes encoding hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis related enzymes sharply declined while the expressions of the genes encoding aceticlastic related enzymes were relatively stable which indicated that the enhanced electron recovery from ch4 in the high ammonia mecs may be caused by the gradual conversion from hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to aceticlastic methanogenesis fig s5b the inhibition effects of tc on acetate metabolism by arbs also created conditions for this methanogenesis pathway fig 2c there are also some enzymes in anaerobic microbes that catalyze redox reactions of hydrogen which mainly contain hydrogen dehydrogenase ec 1 12 1 2 and hydrogenase ec 1 12 99 6 etc popov et al 1985 from h0 to h6 the enhanced expressions of those h2 cycling related enzymes in the high ammonia mecs may result in the significant rise of ce figs 2e s11 3 4 co occurrence network analysis of args and their potential hosts after the long term treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics the biofilm of mec would develop antibiotic resistance which is bound to result in the release of args into the environment due to the senescence and shedding of the biofilm xu et al 2019 additionally the mp in bioreactors poses a risk for the spread of args due to the large specific surface area for the adsorption of antibiotics and the propagation of microorganisms therefore the relative abundances of args were quantified figs 6 a s12 and the co occurrence patterns of anode biofilm and effluent between args and microbial taxa were investigated using network inference fig 6b c su et al 2021 under tc of 6 mg l 1 the relative abundance of all those target args and inti1 gene in anode biofilm was ranging from 1 05 10 5 to 1 53 10 2 while that of effluent samples was ranging from 1 06 10 6 to 2 53 10 3 with their absolute concentrations varying from 102 20 to 105 18 copies ml 1 which was similar to that detected in the effluent of the traditional anaerobic bioreactor with the interference of trace tetracycline concentrations 50 500 μg l 1 gao et al 2018 however tc is an easily adsorbed antibiotic in conventional bioreactors e g anaerobic digestion wu et al 2016 activated sludge auerbach et al 2007 and sbr liu et al 2018 the adsorption of tcs by sludge plays an important role in the generation diffusion and persistence of resistant bacteria and resistant genes unlike the conventional bioreactors the extremely low excess biomass production of mes was helpful to reduce the risk of resistance gene release wen et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 compared with anode biofilm more positive correlations were observed 27 vs 32 in effluent samples implying the existence of closer relations between bacteria and args the effluent suspension might contribute much to arg transmission although the residual sludge of mes is less than that of traditional bioreactors the influence of mec effluent in the spread of args should not be ignored furthermore the mp increased the risk of args spreading arias andres et al 2018 the presence of mp had no significant influence on the current of mecs but became an important carrier of args fig s13 the tc resistance genes and inti1 gene on the surface of mp has a total abundance of 2 29 10 2 which were higher than that of both anode and effluent samples notably the mobility of mp and high cell densities of mp biofilm may make them the considerable potential for hgt with a relatively higher abundance of inti1 1 93 10 2 the perturbation of mp on the abundance of mges might be a critical mechanism of mp affecting the transmission of args in environmental media hu et al 2022 in the antibiotic resistance mechanism the bacteria can pump the antibiotics out of the cell through the efflux pump system thus reducing the content of toxic compounds inside and leading to antibiotic resistance li et al 2022b the teta is a typical efflux pump gene in the tc resistance system which was significantly related to inti1 in both anode and effluent samples with the abundance of 2 42 10 4 and 1 65 10 4 another way is to generate args tetm teto tetq encoding ribosomal protective proteins zhang et al 2019 among the three args tetm was the most abundant in both anode and effluent with the mutual potential host of treponema norank f paludibacteraceae and anaerocella in addition a significant host bacterium of tetq observed in the anode network was geobacter sp which presented a dominant role 68 12 in the bacterial community for electric generation however it didn t significantly affect the spread and release of args due to its small proportion 0 23 in the effluent community fig s14 the antibiotic resistance generated after long term operation might be an important reason for the high abundance of exoelectrogens under 6 mg l 1 tc the tetx is the only gene encoding the enzyme to inactivate tetracycline huang et al 2015 more correlations between tetx and microbial taxa were observed in the effluent network with a relatively higher abundance of 2 53 10 3 than that of the anode the integron integrase gene of inti1 also affected the transmission of args the potential host bacteria of inti1 accounted for 0 50 of the anode community but 47 3 of the effluent which resulted in the horizontal transmission of tc resistance genes between different species harb and hong 2017 since inti1 has a close linkage to args it is often considered the core factor in the spread of antibiotic resistance from the bioreactor to the environment yuan et al 2016 unlike the conventional bioreactors more specialized functional biofilm dominated by exoelectrogens could be screened and enriched on mec anodes in the electric field which reduced the risk of args transmission between different species the mec demonstrates superior potential in the treatment of high strength wastewater e g swine wastewater however the complex composition of raw swine wastewater might cause synergistic effects on biological treatment processes in which ammonia nitrogen and antibiotics were essential this study comprehensively investigated the responses of mec to the co existing condition of ammonia and antibiotics with different loadings which will help to promote microbial electrochemical technology in practical application 4 conclusions this study focused on the response of mec to the increased tc concentration under different ammonia loadings results showed that mec can be used for efficient energy extraction from antibiotic wastewater containing high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen however the highly concentrated ammonia nitrogen would aggravate the inhibitory influence of the increased tc loading on the performance of mecs under ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 the current continuously dropped with the peak decreasing from 9 4 0 7 to 4 9 0 7 ma when tc concentration increased from 0 to 6 mg l 1 meanwhile both the cod and tc removal efficiencies declined without tc the anode electrochemical performance was greatly enhanced by ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 while the anode catalytic activity with tc higher than 1 mg l 1 was relatively seriously inhibited than that of low ammonia loading mecs the anode activity gradually decreased accompanied by a significant loss in biomass which resulted in an abundance increase of exoelectrogens from 44 27 to 71 05 exposure to tc selects resistance bacteria and induces them to produce resistance genes the effluent suspension of mecs might contribute much to arg transmission the presence of mp in bioreactors would also increase the risk of arg spreading due to its high abundance of mge this article provided a comprehensive evaluation of the co contamination effects of tc and ammonia nitrogen on mecs and the fate of tc resistance genes for treating synthetic swine wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15427,microbial electrolysis cell mec is a promising technology for effective energy conversion of wastewater organics to biogas yet in swine wastewater treatment the complex contaminants including antibiotics may affect mec performance while the high ammonia concentration might increase this risk by increasing cell membrane permeability in this work the responses of mecs on tetracycline tc with low and high ammonia loadings 80 and 1000 mg l 1 were fully investigated the tc of 0 to 1 mg l 1 slightly improved mec performance in current production and electrochemical characteristics with low ammonia loading while tc 4 mg l 1 started to show negative effects generally the high ammonia loading sensitized mecs to tc concentration inducing the current and cod removal of mecs to sharply decline with tc 0 5 mg l 1 the positive effect of high ammonia loading on mec due to conductivity increase was counteracted with tc 1 mg l 1 the co contamination of tc and ammonia significantly decreased the bioactivity and biomass of anode biofilm although the high concentration of co existing tc and ammonia inhibited mec performance the reactors still obtained positive energy feedback the network analyses indicated that the effluent suspension contributed much to antibiotic resistance gene arg transmission while the microplastics mps in wastewater greatly raised the risks of args spreading this work systematically examined the synergetic effects of tc and ammonia and the transmission of args in mec operation which is conducive to expediting the application of mecs in swine wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrolysis cell co contamination effects tetracycline ammonia antibiotic resistance genes 1 introduction antibiotics refer to some natural or synthetic compounds that are widely used in medical agricultural and aquaculture industries to prevent or treat diseases for their bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the massive use of antibiotics in the breeding industry has now become an important source of antibiotic pollution in the natural environment wang et al 2017 among which pig farming industry was one of the most important breeding industries due to the huge breeding scale and wide distribution gao et al 2020 the animals use only a few amounts of antibiotics in feed while most of the residual antibiotics or their antibacterial metabolites were finally discharged into the environment through urine and feces ondon et al 2020 pei et al 2019 tetracycline tc is one of the most used antibiotics in intensive pig farms huang et al 2021 sui et al 2017 a large amount of tc residuals was discharged into swine wastewater with concentrations up to 388 7 μg l 1 liu et al 2021 causing serious contamination in receiving river sediment or soil zhou et al 2013 antibiotic resistance genes args are another hazardous derivative of antibiotic contamination long term exposure to antibiotics selects resistance microorganisms and induces them to produce resistance genes the horizontal gene transfer hgt even causes the wide propagation of args sun et al 2019 therefore the preventions of antibiotic pollution and arg propagation are essential in the treatment of swine wastewater microbial electrolysis cell mec is emerging as an attractive technology for various high strength wastewater treatments due to its advantages of in situ energy conversion and synchronously pollution removal yan et al 2019 compared with the traditional biological technologies mec shows great superiority in low sludge yield kim et al 2007 high electron utilization efficiency for biogas production liang et al 2020 and electron flow assisted organic degradation cao et al 2020 the bioelectrochemical reactions also assisted the rapid degradation of antibiotics in previous reports under an applied voltage of 0 8 v a three dimensional biofilm electrode reactor 3d ber could remove 89 3 95 6 of tc within 40 h zhang et al 2016 however as antibacterial substances and signaling molecules the impact of antibiotics on bio reactors often presents a dosage effect for instance a restricted tobramycin loading of 0 1 mg l 1 showed accelerating effects on bioelectrochemical reaction resulting in increased current biomass and geobacter abundance while the further increase of tobramycin loading to 0 3 mg l 1 would adversely affect the electrochemical activity of mfc zhou et al 2017 furthermore the high ammonia concentration in swine wastewater might pose a challenge to mec application the mecs could prevent the generation of high concentration free ammonia for their wide adaption range of ph value yet the accumulation of nh4 also influenced the performance of mecs wang et al 2022 in the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane the nh4 can combine with the phosphate radical resulting in the change of cell membrane permeability and the leakage of important cellular contents like phosphate nucleotides amino acids purine pyrimidine k etc przestalski et al 1991 zhong et al 2013 to some extent this change in the cell membrane may not adversely affect the performance of mec but stimulate the metabolism of microorganisms and thereby accelerate the electron transport process however considering most antibiotics have intracellular action sites the membrane permeabilization may increase the chance that tetracycline enters cells to hinder protein synthesis and dna replication liu et al 2021 the microplastic mp in swine wastewater was another factor that may show interaction effects with antibiotics on mecs in the breeding industry plastics are widely used in feedbags water faucets and feed bowls manure scrapers and plastic bottles for storing disinfectants or antibiotics wu et al 2021 and their degradation products would enter the digestive system of pigs and cause mp pollution arias andres et al 2018 the mps like polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polyethylene terephthalate pet were widely detected in large intestine specimens and feces of animals ramachandraiah et al 2022 plastic debris serves as an ideal interface for biofilm formation due to the high specific surface area thus acting as carriers of pathogenic microorganisms and args in wastewater treatment plants hu et al 2022 moreover the enhanced hgt among different species is considered to be a key contributor to arg propagation due to the increased abundance of mobile genetic elements mges such as inti1 on the mp surface shi et al 2020 whereas the role of microplastics in the dissemination of args in the microbial electrochemical system is still poorly understood in this study mecs fed by synthetic swine wastewater were operated to investigate the mec performances to tetracycline tc with high concentrated ammonia the mec performances including current generation chemical oxygen demand cod removal and energy recovery were systematically analyzed with different tc loadings the anodic electrochemical characteristics of mecs were analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv tests the response of anode biofilm to the increased tc concentration under different ammonia loadings was characterized by a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm while the anode biomass changes were tested using bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay the changes in biocommunities functional genes and the fate of tc resistance genes in anode biofilms effluent bacteria and microplastic biofilms were also investigated using high throughput sequencing of 16s rdna and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr these findings will offer a profound understanding of the co occurrence and the risk of antibiotics ammonia and mps in the microbial electrochemical system 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction and operation single chamber mecs used in this study were assembled with an empty bed volume of 28 ml φ 3 0 cm l 4 cm and an effective working volume of 23 ml call and logan 2008 carbon brush φ 3 0 cm l 3 0 cm made by wringing graphite fiber into two twisted titanium wires and double layer stainless steel mesh φ 3 8 cm 60 mesh type 304 were equipped as anode and cathode with a gap of 0 5 cm the current was monitored by collecting the voltage v across the external resistor r 10 ω which was connected in series with mec the gas was collected by an aluminum foil bag 0 1 l haide china which was connected to mec by a polypropylene tube and silicone plug fig s1 twenty four mec reactors were inoculated with anaerobic sludge which was obtained from jinnan sludge treatment plant tianjin china the medium used for incubation contained 2 56 g l 1 ch3coona 5 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 nacl 0 31 g l 1 nh4cl and 1 ml l 1 trace elements solution qin and he 2014 before utilization the medium was purged with n2 for 15 min to remove the dissolved oxygen to investigate the influence of tc with ammonia on mecs two ammonia concentrations of 80 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 were chosen according to previous work wang et al 2022 all those reactors were started under ammonia of 80 mg l 1 labeled as l and then half of the mecs gradually adapted to high ammonia loading of 1000 mg l 1 labeled as h the mecs were operated under a continuous voltage of 0 9 v supplied by a direct current dc power hyk 60e12 hua yao china until the reproducible current curves were obtained for three continuous cycles the anode was considered to be fully developed the tested influent concentrations of tc in mecs were 0 0 5 1 2 4 and 6 mg l 1 from l0 or h0 to l6 or h6 the reactors were operated in batch mode under constant temperature at 30 1 c the medium was replaced until the current dropped below 1 ma the cathodes were replaced every time the electrolyte conditions were changed to avoid the uncontrolled interference from the cathodic biofilm all the experiments were performed with at least triplicate reactors the experiment lasted for more than 2500 h and the mecs were operated stably for at least three cycles under each treatment to make the anode biofilm adapt to the environmental changes fig s2 after the examination of contaminant effects of tc and ammonia 1 g l 1 of polymethyl methacrylate pmma mp φ 0 2 0 45 mm were added to mecs with 6 mg l 1 of tc and 1000 mg l 1 of ammonia loading after two months of culture the particles were cleaned with a sterile solution of 0 9 nacl and stored at 80 c for arg analysis 2 2 analytical methods mec performance was estimated in terms of current cod removal coulombic efficiency biogas production and energy recovery the detailed calculation formulas could refer to supplementary information section s1 effluent samples from mec reactors were collected in triplicate and then filtered through 0 22 μm fiber filters the concentrations of cod were determined by heating digestion methods using a cod reagent hach co co america and tested by the spectrophotometer dr3900 hach co co america exionlc ad uplc sciex us coupled to ab sciex qtrap4500 tandem mass spectrometer sciex us was used for the detection of tc concentration in water samples the uplc ms ms system was controlled by analyst 1 7 software supplementary information section s2 the gas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatograph sp 2100a beifen ruili china which was equipped with a packed column tdx 01 3 m 3 mm zhong ke hui jie china and a thermal conductivity detector tcd argon was used as the carrier gas the temperatures of the column oven injector and tcd were 130 c 60 c and 220 c all electrochemical tests were performed using an electrochemical workstation aut302n v metrohm switzerland in a standard three electrode system with a double layer stainless steel mesh as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode sce as the reference electrode the charge transfer resistance of mec anodes under different tc concentrations was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis tests with the frequency ranging from 100 khz to 0 01 hz the amplitude of the applied sinusoidal voltage signal was 0 014 v the potential applied was 0 4 v vs sce based on the normal anode potential in daily operation wang et al 2016 the cyclic voltammetry cv tests were conducted under turnover conditions with substrate and non turnover conditions no substrate in a scanning range of 0 7 v to 0 2 v vs sce at the scan rate of 1 mv s 1 all the electrode potential data reported in this study were calculated versus sce 2 3 biofilm characterization the confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm lsm800 carl zeiss germany was used for the analysis of biofilm activity under different tc concentrations the anode biofilm adhered to the surface of carbon brush fibers was stained with 2 μmol l 1 calcein am and 1 5 μmol l 1 pi then the samples were washed with 50 mmol l 1 pbs to eliminate the residual fluorescent agent the abundance of active cells was calculated based on the fluorescence intensities all those steps were carried out at 37 c under dark conditions finally the biofilm was observed through the clsm with the excitation emission wavelengths of calcein am and pi were 490 515 nm green and 535 615 nm red kong et al 2014 to detect the changes in biomass attached to the surface of carbon fibers the anodes were quantificationally cut to 0 04 g and incubated with naoh solution 0 2 mol l 1 2 ml 95 c 20 min to release the attached microorganisms after that the biomass of anode samples was measured using bicinchoninic acid protein assay kits bca02 ding guo prosperous china 2 4 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing the biological samples were collected in triplicate after steadily operating for at least three repeatable cycles under different tc concentrations the biofilm samples were cut off from three different points of carbon brush and then mixed in a sterile centrifuge tube the effluent of mecs was centrifuged at a rate of 8000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min and the precipitate was collected in a sterile centrifuge tube genomic dna was extracted using a soil genomic dna kit cw bio beijing china following the instructions all those dna samples were stored at 20 c for the quantification of args and the high throughput sequencing for bacteria the v3 v4 region of the 16s rdna gene was amplified using primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 tan et al 2016 the analyses of predicted functional genes of the anode biocommunities in the high ammonia group were conducted using the picrust2 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states program with kegg kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database on the majorbio cloud platform majorbio technology co ltd shanghai china li et al 2022a the abundance of args was determined by real time quantitative pcr technology on the majorbio platform the target genes analyzed in this study include five tc resistance genes teta tetm teto tetq tetx and a mobile element class 1 integron inti1 li et al 2015 song et al 2021 primer sequences targeting these genes and qpcr protocol were listed in table s1 the correlation coefficient r 2 was higher than 0 99 the relative abundance of args was assessed by normalizing their copy numbers to 16s rrna genes su et al 2021 2 5 statistical analyses the standard deviation sd was calculated based on the average value of those reactors the statistical package of ibm spss statistics version 26 0 was used to perform a one way anova analysis to compare the differences in the means of the variables between different treatments to explore the co occurrence features between args anode biocommunity and effluent suspension network analysis based on a correlation matrix was performed with the thresholds significance p 0 05 and spearman s r 0 8 relative calculations were carried out through r 1 3 1093 with the psych package and the co occurrence networks were visualized using gephi 0 9 2 to reveal the potential host relations wang et al 2021 yang et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of mecs at different tc concentrations tc effects under low ammonia loading with ammonia of 80 mg l 1 mecs showed a stable performance in the current generation with tc concentrations ranging from 0 l0 to 4 mg l 1 l4 the average current was maintained at 4 6 0 3 ma in this range figs 1 a s3 table 1 then the current dropped from 5 6 0 3 to 4 3 0 6 ma with a significant decline in average current to 3 5 0 4 ma when the tc concentration further increased to 6 mg l 1 l6 p 1 08 10 6 0 05 the total electric charge declined with the decrease of cycle time when the tc concentration increased from 0 l0 to 2 mg l 1 l2 fig 1b however the tc loading greater than 2 mg l 1 l4 6 resulted in a re increase of cycle time and a stable quantity of electric charge increasing tc loading from 0 to 6 mg l 1 didn t show a significant influence on cod removal efficiency from 94 2 0 9 l0 to 89 3 l6 with the cod removal rate fluctuating between 1 28 and 1 56 kg m3 d 1 under relatively constant influent cod of 2100 100 mg l 1 fig 1c however the substrate metabolism rate of anode respiring bacteria arb decreased with tc concentration higher than 2 mg l 1 while that of non arbs was not inhibited fig s4 the gas that was collected from mec mainly consisted of hydrogen h2 methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 during the experiment a decrease in total gas volume from 58 3 to 31 5 ml was accompanied with a decrease in the proportions of h2 from 87 2 to 77 9 and co2 from 10 3 to 5 6 and the increase of ch4 proportion from 3 2 to 18 3 fig 1d increasing tc concentration from 0 l0 to 2 mg l 1 l2 the coulombic efficiency ce decreased from 107 3 to 88 6 which resulted from the decrease in electric charge quantity in one cycle fig 1e then the ce maintained at 88 7 despite the further increase in tc concentration from 2 l2 to 6 mg l 1 l6 indicating an effective energy extraction from organic matter to electrical energy with tc range from l0 to l2 the cathodic gas recovery r c a t significantly increased from 65 5 to 96 8 p 2 08 10 4 0 05 then the r c a t demonstrated a downward trend with the further increase of tc to 6 mg l 1 l6 due to the continuous decline in electrons recovered from the biogas h2 and ch4 fig s5a the energy recovery efficiency η e and η e s showed similar tendencies with r c a t while their peaks were obtained at 2 mg l 1 of tc it is worth noting that the η e based on the electricity input was higher than 100 indicating positive energy feedback could be achieved tc effects under high ammonia loading consistent with the previous study without tc the high ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 increased the mec current due to the improved electrolyte conductivity from 8 31 0 02 to 14 8 0 1 ms cm 1 figs 1a 2 a table s2 wang et al 2022 however for the high ammonia loading mecs with the increase of tc concentration the current continuously dropped with the peak current decreasing from 9 4 0 7 to 4 9 0 7 ma fig 2a the cycle time continuously raised at the same time fig 2b nevertheless the cyclic electric charge increased with tc content increasing from 0 h0 to 0 5 mg l 1 h0 5 and then declined with further increase of tc concentration to 6 mg l 1 h6 fig 2b under ammonia loading of 1000 mg l 1 the cod removal efficiency sharply decreased from 91 7 0 4 h0 to 54 9 h6 p 1 4 10 8 0 05 fig 2c correspondingly the ce increased from 102 4 to 140 20 indicating the hydrogen cycling process might increase during this process fonseca et al 2021 fig 2e the cod removal rate also rapidly decreased from 2 3 0 2 to 0 8 0 2 kg m3 d 1 p 2 23 10 9 0 05 suggesting that the metabolic capacity of functional microorganisms was seriously inhibited and the toxic effect of tc on substrate utilization was aggravated by the highly concentrated ammonia the total gas volume increased from h0 to h0 5 and declined from h0 5 to h6 fig 2d the proportions of h2 and co2 slightly decreased while that of ch4 increased from 2 1 to 6 2 the total quantity of electrons that were calculated from h2 and ch4 gas volume was relatively stable fig s5b in the tested range in the high ammonia loading mecs effective electron utilization r c a t and energy recovery η e and η e s were obtained which tended to raise with the increase of tc concentration fig 2e the high ammonia loading also adversely affected the tc removal efficiency by mecs figs 1f 2f in the low ammonia group the increase in the initial tc concentration from 0 5 l0 5 to 6 mg l 1 l6 didn t cause a severe reduction in tc removal efficiency the average removal efficiency for tc of 96 2 was obtained as the influent tc loading was 6 mg l 1 l6 fig 1f however in the high ammonia group when the initial tc concentration increased from 1 h1 to 6 mg l 1 h6 a significant decline in tc removal efficiency from 92 3 to 81 5 p 1 64 10 4 0 05 demonstrated that high ammonia loading adversely affected the antibiotic degradation capacity of mec fig 2f in summary tc loading of more than 2 mg l 1 adversely affected the current production and substrate metabolism of arb while the synergistic effect of tc and ammonia nitrogen aggravated the negative influence on mec with high ammonia nitrogen of 1000 mg l 1 both current production and cod removal were inhibited from h0 to h6 while the cycle time increased under both high and low ammonia loadings the h2 production showed a downward trend while ch4 production increased whereas the total electron recovered from biogas with highly concentrated ammonia was relatively stable than that of low ammonia mecs based on different calculation formulas the combined effects of those core parameters of mec operation caused changes in the recovery efficiencies of electrons and energy as discussed above 3 2 electrochemical characteristics of anode biofilm under different tc concentrations the internal resistances and electrochemical activities of anodes were measured by eis and cv tests fig 3 without tc ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 significantly reduced the ohmic resistance rs and charge transfer resistance rct1 and rct2 indicating the anodic activity was improved l0 vs h0 this phenomenon was consistent with the previous research that the electrochemical activity of the anode was improved as ammonia loading increased from 80 to 1000 mg l 1 wang et al 2022 the onset potential of cathodic reduction reaction in cv curves was also reduced from 1 024 0 004 v to 0 996 0 007 v due to the increased solution conductivity while the increase in tc concentration under the same ammonia loading didn t cause a significant difference in the cathodic activity fig s6 table s3 however in this study the highly concentrated ammonia adversely affected the responses of anodic electrochemical characteristics to tc in the eis curves the starting point represents the solution resistance rs the diameter of the semicircular arc in the high frequency range represents the charge transfer resistance rct1 affected by substrate diffusion wang et al 2022 while that of the large semicircle in the low frequency region was considered another charge transfer resistance rct2 related to the activation process on the anode surface owing to the dispersion effect the electric double layer deviates from the ideal electric double layer yin et al 2013 hence the rct1 and rct2 were in parallel with constant phase elements cpe and the impedance spectra of the mec anode were analyzed by fitting to the equivalent circuit r rc rc in the low ammonia group the rct2 initially presented a decreasing trend from 13 6 2 9 to 12 3 1 2 ω with tc concentration raising from 0 l0 to 1 mg l 1 l1 fig 3a table s4 simultaneously there was also a slight improvement in anodic catalytic activity under turnover conditions and the maximum catalytic current of 9 5 0 6 ma in the cv plot was obtained in l1 fig 3b the electrochemical performance of mec anodes was steady with tc concentration between 0 l0 and 4 mg l 1 l4 however the further increase in tc content didn t bring a correspondent improvement in electrochemical performance the rct2 then increased to 51 4 11 1 ω when tc concentration gradually raised to 6 mg l 1 l6 while the catalytic current reduced to 5 3 0 9 ma at the same time in the high ammonia group tc also demonstrated a significant enhancement of anode electrochemical performance fig 3c d however the peak anode electrochemical activity was obtained at a tc concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 h0 5 with a minimum charge transfer resistance of 15 2 3 7 ω and a maximum catalytic current of 11 2 ma then the electrochemical activity of anodes sharply declined it revealed that tc had a slight improvement in anodic electrochemical performance at low concentrations but the highly concentrated ammonia weakened that stimulating effect when further increased tc concentration to 1 mg l 1 the maximum current of cv curves began to be lower than that of low ammonia loading mecs with a rapid decline in the average current fig s7 the non turnover cv tests were performed to identify the changes in extracellular electron transfer features with tc concentration increasing fig 3e f without the interference of high ammonia two main redox peaks were detected in cv curves fig 3e the peak1 centered at 0 45 0 02 v which was linked to the mediated electron transfer met by endogenously secreted flavins xiao et al 2017 the peak2 centered at 0 19 0 01 v which may be related to the direct electron transfer det by outer membrane c type cytochrome a omca marsili et al 2008 these two peaks were not distinct and there was nearly no change in extracellular electron transfer as tc concentration increased from 0 l0 to 6 mg l 1 l6 however the electron transfer peaks in the biofilm which was cultured under ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 were more visible than that in the low ammonia group fig 3f one more redox peak appeared at 0 37 0 01 v which may be attributable to the direct electron transfer det by outer membrane c type cytochrome z omcz li et al 2020 that might be due to the decrease of biomass and extracellular polymeric substance eps secretion after long term exposure to high ammonia loading wang et al 2022 the activity of anode biofilm under different tc concentrations in two groups was characterized by clsm fig 4 in the low ammonia group increasing the initial tc concentration from 0 l0 to 2 mg l 1 l2 didn t significantly affect the biofilm activity carbon fibers were closely covered by a dense and active biofilm with an active cell proportion of 70 3 while it began to decrease with tc concentration further raising to higher than 2 mg l 1 fig 4a b at that moment the biomass showed a reduction from 16 2 0 6 to 14 8 0 6 mg g 1 fig s8 it was also demonstrated in sem that the biofilm was tightly attached to the graphic fibers during the whole experiment from l0 to l6 fig s9 however for the high ammonia group a serious inhibition of anode biofilm was caused by tc 1 mg l 1 fig 4a b when tc concentration gradually increased from 0 h0 to 6 mg l 1 h6 the percentage of active cells sharply decreased from 62 4 to 38 4 with a significant decline in biomass from 12 5 0 5 to 7 7 0 9 mg g 1 p 1 02 10 4 0 05 fig s8 initially in h0 parts of the graphite fibers were exposed to the medium while the biofilm was sparse in h6 fig s9 it is worth noticing in the high ammonia group that the biofilm demonstrated a distinct change from the surface to the interior layer when tc concentration was up to 4 mg l 1 h4 fig 4c as it manifested after being stained by pi and calcein am the green biofilm gradually changed to red from the surface to the inside which might be resulted from the increased hazard of tc with high ammonia the steady growth of biofilm helps the bacteria to enhance their ability to survive treatment with antimicrobial agents akinbobola et al 2017 the attenuation of anode biomass in the high ammonia group will inevitably weaken its tolerance to antibiotics moreover membrane permeabilization also aggravated the damage of biofilm by tc thus appearing as red in clsm images 3 3 changes in microbial community the high throughput sequencing was adopted to investigate the changes in anode communities caused by the co contamination of tc and ammonia fig 5 totally eight exoelectrogens genera with the abundance greater than 1 were found in the bacterial communities of two groups table s5 s6 in the low ammonia group increasing tc concentration from 0 l0 to 2 mg l 1 l2 significantly enhanced the enrichment of exoelectrogens as a typical exoelectrogen reguera et al 2005 adhikari et al 2016 the relative abundance of geobacter sp was greatly improved from 38 59 to 68 78 fig 5 table s5 at that point the substrate metabolic rate of exoelectrogens was steady for electric generation fig s4 the total relative abundance of all those exoelectrogen genera also raised from 60 24 to 74 89 from 0 l0 to 2 mg l 1 l2 however when tc concentration further increased to 4 mg l 1 l4 there was a sharp decline in the total abundance of exoelectrogens which might be resulted from the inhibition of tc on their metabolism capacity and biofilm activity figs 4 s4 for the high ammonia group different biocommunity changes were observed fig 5 table s6 with tc concentration gradually increasing from 0 h0 to 6 mg l 1 h6 the relative abundance of geobacter sp significantly increased from 3 05 to 68 12 while the total abundance of exoelectrogens also raised from 44 27 to 71 05 which might be attributed to the sharp decline of anode biomass fig s8 the increased tc loading had a certain screening effect on the anodic functional bacteria which made the exoelectrogens gradually dominate the community functional enzymes of microbial community predicted by picrust2 were further analyzed using the kegg database figs s10 s11 in high ammonia loading mecs the substrate utilization was seriously inhibited by tc while the total electron recovered from biogas showed a steady trend with an increasing ch4 proportion fig 2d the methanogenesis pathways that existed in acetate fed mecs mainly included the hydrogenotrophic pathway h2 and co2 to ch4 and the aceticlastic pathway acetate to ch4 xin et al 2019 yin et al 2018 fig s10 with tc loading increasing from 0 l0 to 6 mg l 1 l6 genes encoding hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis related enzymes sharply declined while the expressions of the genes encoding aceticlastic related enzymes were relatively stable which indicated that the enhanced electron recovery from ch4 in the high ammonia mecs may be caused by the gradual conversion from hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis to aceticlastic methanogenesis fig s5b the inhibition effects of tc on acetate metabolism by arbs also created conditions for this methanogenesis pathway fig 2c there are also some enzymes in anaerobic microbes that catalyze redox reactions of hydrogen which mainly contain hydrogen dehydrogenase ec 1 12 1 2 and hydrogenase ec 1 12 99 6 etc popov et al 1985 from h0 to h6 the enhanced expressions of those h2 cycling related enzymes in the high ammonia mecs may result in the significant rise of ce figs 2e s11 3 4 co occurrence network analysis of args and their potential hosts after the long term treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics the biofilm of mec would develop antibiotic resistance which is bound to result in the release of args into the environment due to the senescence and shedding of the biofilm xu et al 2019 additionally the mp in bioreactors poses a risk for the spread of args due to the large specific surface area for the adsorption of antibiotics and the propagation of microorganisms therefore the relative abundances of args were quantified figs 6 a s12 and the co occurrence patterns of anode biofilm and effluent between args and microbial taxa were investigated using network inference fig 6b c su et al 2021 under tc of 6 mg l 1 the relative abundance of all those target args and inti1 gene in anode biofilm was ranging from 1 05 10 5 to 1 53 10 2 while that of effluent samples was ranging from 1 06 10 6 to 2 53 10 3 with their absolute concentrations varying from 102 20 to 105 18 copies ml 1 which was similar to that detected in the effluent of the traditional anaerobic bioreactor with the interference of trace tetracycline concentrations 50 500 μg l 1 gao et al 2018 however tc is an easily adsorbed antibiotic in conventional bioreactors e g anaerobic digestion wu et al 2016 activated sludge auerbach et al 2007 and sbr liu et al 2018 the adsorption of tcs by sludge plays an important role in the generation diffusion and persistence of resistant bacteria and resistant genes unlike the conventional bioreactors the extremely low excess biomass production of mes was helpful to reduce the risk of resistance gene release wen et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 compared with anode biofilm more positive correlations were observed 27 vs 32 in effluent samples implying the existence of closer relations between bacteria and args the effluent suspension might contribute much to arg transmission although the residual sludge of mes is less than that of traditional bioreactors the influence of mec effluent in the spread of args should not be ignored furthermore the mp increased the risk of args spreading arias andres et al 2018 the presence of mp had no significant influence on the current of mecs but became an important carrier of args fig s13 the tc resistance genes and inti1 gene on the surface of mp has a total abundance of 2 29 10 2 which were higher than that of both anode and effluent samples notably the mobility of mp and high cell densities of mp biofilm may make them the considerable potential for hgt with a relatively higher abundance of inti1 1 93 10 2 the perturbation of mp on the abundance of mges might be a critical mechanism of mp affecting the transmission of args in environmental media hu et al 2022 in the antibiotic resistance mechanism the bacteria can pump the antibiotics out of the cell through the efflux pump system thus reducing the content of toxic compounds inside and leading to antibiotic resistance li et al 2022b the teta is a typical efflux pump gene in the tc resistance system which was significantly related to inti1 in both anode and effluent samples with the abundance of 2 42 10 4 and 1 65 10 4 another way is to generate args tetm teto tetq encoding ribosomal protective proteins zhang et al 2019 among the three args tetm was the most abundant in both anode and effluent with the mutual potential host of treponema norank f paludibacteraceae and anaerocella in addition a significant host bacterium of tetq observed in the anode network was geobacter sp which presented a dominant role 68 12 in the bacterial community for electric generation however it didn t significantly affect the spread and release of args due to its small proportion 0 23 in the effluent community fig s14 the antibiotic resistance generated after long term operation might be an important reason for the high abundance of exoelectrogens under 6 mg l 1 tc the tetx is the only gene encoding the enzyme to inactivate tetracycline huang et al 2015 more correlations between tetx and microbial taxa were observed in the effluent network with a relatively higher abundance of 2 53 10 3 than that of the anode the integron integrase gene of inti1 also affected the transmission of args the potential host bacteria of inti1 accounted for 0 50 of the anode community but 47 3 of the effluent which resulted in the horizontal transmission of tc resistance genes between different species harb and hong 2017 since inti1 has a close linkage to args it is often considered the core factor in the spread of antibiotic resistance from the bioreactor to the environment yuan et al 2016 unlike the conventional bioreactors more specialized functional biofilm dominated by exoelectrogens could be screened and enriched on mec anodes in the electric field which reduced the risk of args transmission between different species the mec demonstrates superior potential in the treatment of high strength wastewater e g swine wastewater however the complex composition of raw swine wastewater might cause synergistic effects on biological treatment processes in which ammonia nitrogen and antibiotics were essential this study comprehensively investigated the responses of mec to the co existing condition of ammonia and antibiotics with different loadings which will help to promote microbial electrochemical technology in practical application 4 conclusions this study focused on the response of mec to the increased tc concentration under different ammonia loadings results showed that mec can be used for efficient energy extraction from antibiotic wastewater containing high concentrations of ammonia nitrogen however the highly concentrated ammonia nitrogen would aggravate the inhibitory influence of the increased tc loading on the performance of mecs under ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 the current continuously dropped with the peak decreasing from 9 4 0 7 to 4 9 0 7 ma when tc concentration increased from 0 to 6 mg l 1 meanwhile both the cod and tc removal efficiencies declined without tc the anode electrochemical performance was greatly enhanced by ammonia of 1000 mg l 1 while the anode catalytic activity with tc higher than 1 mg l 1 was relatively seriously inhibited than that of low ammonia loading mecs the anode activity gradually decreased accompanied by a significant loss in biomass which resulted in an abundance increase of exoelectrogens from 44 27 to 71 05 exposure to tc selects resistance bacteria and induces them to produce resistance genes the effluent suspension of mecs might contribute much to arg transmission the presence of mp in bioreactors would also increase the risk of arg spreading due to its high abundance of mge this article provided a comprehensive evaluation of the co contamination effects of tc

15428,silver nanoparticles ag nps were found to be responsible for nitrous oxide n2o generation however the mechanism of ag np induced n2o production remains controversial and needs to be elucidated in this study chronic ag np exposure experiments were conducted in five independent sequencing batch biofilm reactors to systematically assess the effects of ag nps on n2o emission the results indicated that a low dose of ag nps 1 mg l slightly suppressed n2o generation by less than 22 99 compared with the no ag np control method in contrast a high dose 5 mg l of ag nps stimulated n2o emission by 67 54 icp ms and sem eds together revealed that high ag np content accumulated on the biofilm surface when exposed to 5 mg l ag nps n2o and do microelectrodes as well as n2o isotopic composition analyses further demonstrated that the accumulated ag nps construct the anaerobic zone in the biofilm which is the primary factor for the stimulation of the nitrite reduction pathway to release n2o a metagenomic analysis further attributed the higher n2o emissions under exposure to a high dose of ag nps to the higher relative abundance of narb and nirk genes i e 1 52 and 1 29 fold higher respectively these findings collectively suggest that chronic exposure to high doses of ag nps could enhance n2o emissions by forming anaerobic micro environments in biofilms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver nanoparticle nitrous oxide micro environment nitrite reductase denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the annual production of silver nanoparticles ag nps is estimated to be approximately 550 tons accounting for 24 of all nanomaterials worldwide piccinno et al 2012 owing to the excessive use of nanomaterials a large amount of ag nps released into the environment inevitably enters wastewater systems it has been reported that the concentration of ag nps in wastewater can range from 18 μg l to 1 9 mg l hoque et al 2012 blaser et al 2008 an increase in ag np concentration results in biological and environmental stress and presents an increased demand for risk assessment according to current research ag nps might pose risks to microbial activity and diversity once they accumulate in wastewater sludge thereby further deteriorating nitrogen removal efficiency zheng et al 2018 in addition to being detrimental to nitrogen removal ag nps could potentially impact nitrous oxide n2o emissions as a potent greenhouse gas n2o has a 273 fold greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide co2 ipcc 2021 wastewater treatment processes have been identified as one of the important n2o emission sources and n2o emissions from wastewater i e 601 mt co2eq were responsible for 8 of the global anthropogenic n2o emissions 7469 mt co2eq in 2015 usepa 2019 although some operating parameters and environmental conditions were found to be related to the n2o production colman et al 2012 the effects induced by ag nps have not yet been completely understood because of the complex mechanism of n2o production at present it has been widely established that commonly available nanomaterials can affect n2o production for instance chen et al 2012b reported that the presence of cu nps increases denitrifiers resulting in a decrease in n2o production this is largely because n2o reductase is a copper protein containing a binuclear electron transfer site and a catalytic site pomowski et al 2011 and the cu ions released by cu nps trigger the activation of n2o reductase leading to the reduction of n2o to n2 ultimately favouring the reduction of n2o emissions moreover another study by zheng et al 2014 showed that znonps significantly restrained the expression of denitrifying enzyme associated genes resulting in increased n2o emissions which could be partly attributed to the released zn ions which exhibited negative effects on microbial denitrification ye et al 2021 although these studies have elucidated the mechanisms of cu or zno nps on n2o emissions given metal species nps has different properties sengul and asmatulu 2020 there are still many controversies and debates regarding the effects of ag nps on n2o production a previous study reported that the released ag nps suppressed denitrification nari narj and napd gene expression in the presence of 5 mg l ag nps leading to increased n2o emissions zheng et al 2018 interestingly another independent study stated that ag nps were critical for the downregulation of the denitrifying enzyme nirk gene and for further reducing n2o emissions liu et al 2018 the inhibition of denitrification by ag nps has been attributed to the particles themselves wu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 these inconsistent observations indicate that there are knowledge gaps regarding the effect of ag nps on n2o emissions to systematically investigate the influence of ag nps on n2o emissions it is necessary to identify the primary sources and pathways of n2o production in wastewater treatment systems a few studies have confirmed that metagenomic analysis allows the investigation of bacterial community diversity and metabolic potentials miao et al 2019 liu et al 2019 although metagenomic analysis can identify the corresponding functional genes it cannot elucidate the individual sources of n2o emissions qiu et al 2016 in contrast yoshida and toyoda 2000 reported the n2o isotopic composition has been proven to be a promising innovative approach to quantify the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification in addition with advances in microelectrode techniques the influence of nanomaterials on biofilm micro environments e g do and n2o concentrations can be investigated accurately han et al 2012 consequently the combination of the three methods microelectrode n2o isotopic composition and metagenomic analysis may reveal the mechanism for np induced n2o emissions more clearly however few studies have systematically elucidated the mechanism of ag nps on n2o emissions through micro environmental exploration we operated five independent sequencing batch biofilm reactors sbbrs continually exposed to different concentrations of ag nps 0 20 μg l 100 μg l 1 mg l and 5 mg l in addition a combination of n2o isotopic composition microelectrode analysis and metagenomic analysis was used to elucidate the mechanism by which ag nps affect n2o production the main objectives of this study were to determine 1 the sources of impact of ag nps 2 the pathways of n2o emissions and 3 the causes of n2o production under ag np stress these findings could contribute to a better understanding of the potential risks of nps in wastewater biological systems and provide ideas for mitigating global warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 sequencing batch biofilm reactors configuration and operating condition an sbbr is a combination of conventional activated sludge and a biological biofilm that is attached onto the surface of carriers allowing the treatment of wastewater more effectively jucherski et al 2019 thus five lab scale sbbrs were set up and operated over a duration of 4 months to evaluate the impact of ag nps fig s1 the working volume was 3 7 l and approximately 4000 mg l of inoculated sludge was collected from a local wwtp in chongqing china all sbbrs were placed over a thermostatic magnetic stirrer and maintained at 25 2 c these reactors were operated in three cycles per day and each cycle consisted of 5 minutes min feeding 470 min of aeration and subsequently 5 min of decanting 480 min in total during the feed phase 2 46 l of synthetic wastewater with different ag nps i e 0 20 μg l 100 μg l 1 mg l and 5 mg l was pumped into the sbbrs synthetic wastewater constituents are described in text s1 i e 500 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod during the aeration phase 1 l min of air was supplied through a porous diffuser to maintain do levels between 4 8 and 5 5 mg l during the decanting phase two thirds of the working volume of the supernatant was decanted at the end of each cycle resulting in an actual hydraulic residence time of 12 h no sludge was discharged during the entire experiment except for sampling the solid retention time srt was considered to be infinite as the sampled volume was small and the membrane retained the majority of the solids 2 2 ag nps exposure to assess the possible effects of ag nps on nutrient removal and n2o production ag np exposure experiments were conducted in sbbrs after stable operation for more than 30 days an ag np solution purity 99 99 with an average particle diameter of 15 nm purchased from huzheng nanotechnology co shanghai china was used in this study before addition to reactors the ag np stock suspension was prepared by dissolving 60 mg ag nps in 1000 ml of milli q water ph 7 0 and sonicating 20 c 250 w 40 khz for 1 hours keller et al 2010 the uniform and dispersive distribution of the ag nps was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100 jeol co japan and the ag nps diameter was found to be in the range of 10 40 nm fig s2 these five sbbrs were respectively fed with wastewater containing 0 control sbbr 20 μg l 100 μg l 1 mg l and 5 mg l ag nps i e r1 r2 r3 r4 and r5 respectively which were prepared by adding relevant volumes of the above mentioned ag np stock suspension to wastewater to assess the chronic effects of different ag np doses a feeding controlled trial was performed for 81 d the effluents from the five sbbrs were measured every three days 2 3 microelectrode analysis to determine the main sources and pathways of n2o emissions in sbbr biofilms under different concentrations of ag nps the concentration microprofiles of do and n2o at different depths were measured using a microelectrode system unisense arhus denmark a schematic diagram of the microprofiling system used for do and n2o measurement is illustrated in fig s3 at the end of the exposure experiments a cluster of fillers was stripped together with the attached biofilm and fixed using insect pins on a carrier in the mini bioreactor bottom centre the mini bioreactor was completely sealed except for a 15 mm diameter hole for the insertion of microelectrodes and a portable do metre hq40d hach usa before the microelectrode measurements synthetic wastewater with homologous sbbr parameters was pumped into the mini bioreactor the do level of the synthetic wastewater was maintained at approximately 6 0 mg l through blasting air in the mini bioreactor and mixed using the same magnetic stirring speed as in the sbbrs the temperature was controlled at 25 0 5 c so that the external environmental conditions of the biofilm were similar to those of sbbrs according to the manufacturer s instructions measurements were performed using do ox 10 unisense denmark and n2o n2o 10 unisense denmark microelectrodes with tip diameters of 10 and 25 μm respectively to capture as much variations in do and n2o concentrations as possible the tip approached the biofilm surface with a vertical step size of 10 μm controlled by the 3d microelectrode propeller during the measurement period the contact between the tip and the biofilm surface was observed using a universal microscope with 5x magnification and the changes in do and n2o concentrations were confirmed using sensortrace pro version 3 1 3 software three sites were randomly selected and measured to check reproducibility 2 4 n2o isotopic composition analysis as n2o emissions are a highly complicated process to quantify the contribution of different pathways to n2o emissions an isotopomer ratio δ15nα δ15nβ analysis was performed according to the method proposed by zheng et al 2017 gas samples were collected in the last 8 hour cycle on the 81st day stored in aluminium coated gas bags and then introduced into an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v plus finnigan germany with a trace gas pre concentration unit calculation of the nitrogen stable isotope ratio of n2o is described in text s2 as no standards were available for n2o isotopes we performed two point calibration using reference gases commercially available n2o shenkai gas chongqing with a purity better than 99 999 following a previously described protocol mohn et al 2014 the measurement accuracies of δ15nbulk and δ15nα were 0 4 and 0 9 respectively obtained through replicate calibration in addition owing to a significant difference in the microbial and enzymatic responses to n2o production and no bond breaking there was a distribution gap between the two nitrogen atoms of 15n sp was therefore defined as δ15nα minus δ15nβ to serve as an illustrative parameter for the intramolecular distribution of 15n tumendelger et al 2014 sutka et al 2006 reported that the characteristic sp values for nitrification i e nh2oh oxidation and denitrification i e no2 n reduction were 33 and 0 respectively in pure cultures this sp is probably constant at various substrate concentrations and in various functional microbes tumendelger et al 2014 therefore we assumed that n2o emissions from microorganisms originated exclusively from nitrification and denitrification sp values of 33 and 0 were employed to calculate the contribution of n2o to nitrification and denitrification using the following formula 1 c n s p s a m p l e s p d s p n s p d 100 s p 33 100 2 c d 1 c n 100 where cn and cd denote the n2o contributions from nitrification and denitrification respectively spsample is the sp value measured for each sample and spn and spd represent the average sp values of nitrification and denitrification respectively as previously reported 2 5 metagenomic analysis to further elucidate the mechanism by which ag nps affect n2o emissions microbial structures and functional potentials were also assessed by comparing the coding genes after chronic exposure under different ag nps concentration using metagenomics briefly at the end of the 81 days experiments three carriers with biofilm samples were randomly collected from r1 r5 reactors into 35 ml of sterile 1x phosphate buffer solution the biofilm on the carriers was detached by vortexing at the highest speed for 2 min and then ultrasonicated using a qsonica q500 sonicator qsonica llc newton ct usa for 2 min at 25 frequency and 2 s intervals cheng et al 2021 the suspension was then centrifuged for 20 min at 10 000 x g to obtain the pellet biomass the e z n a soil dna kit omega biotek norcross ga usa was used to extract total genomic dna from the biofilm samples according to the manufacturer s instructions dna quality and quantity were determined using a 2100 bioanalyzer agilent santa clara ca usa and an invitrogen qubit dsdna br assay kit thermo fisher scientific ny usa respectively the samples were sheared on a covaris s220 covaris woburn ma usa to 350 bp following the manufacturer s recommendations and the paired end library was prepared using the truseq dna kit the dna seq libraries were sequenced in two lanes of an illumina hiseq 4000 platform majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china and approximately 45 8 gb of reads were obtained from each sample the raw reads were submitted to ncbi with the bioproject accession number prjna832684 sequence quality control genome assembly gene prediction and abundance calculations were performed as described in text s3 after evaluating the gene abundance of each sample the non redundant gene sets were aligned to the nr database using diamond blastp e value 10 5 to obtain taxonomic annotations and the sum of the gene abundances corresponding to the species was used to calculate the taxonomic abundance of that species in the concurrent phase the potential function of sequences was obtained by aligning the gene sets against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database and the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen metabolism was counted 2 6 other analytical methods and statistical analysis wastewater characteristics including cod tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were assessed following standard methods federation and aph 2005 lactate dehydrogenase ldh release was measured using a cytotoxicity assay kit following the manufacturer s instructions jiancheng bioengineering institute china the total ag and dissolved ag ions in the bioreactor were quantified using inductively coupled plasma optical mass spectrometry icp ms nexion300q perkinelmer usa scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometry sem eds vega 3 lmu tescan czech republic was employed to scan the surface distribution and composition of the samples the n2o concentration in the bioreactor was assessed using gas chromatography 6890 agilent usa these methods are detailed in the supporting information text s4 s5 and s6 n2o release per cycle was calculated by measuring the sample n2o concentration and total gas volume which was collected hourly in each cycle the ratio of n2o release to total nitrogen removal per day was considered to be the n2o conversion rate 2 7 statistical analysis data were compared using student s t test for statistical comparison using spss 20 0 significance was tested using analysis of variance and the null hypothesis was rejected at a confidence level of 95 i e p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal performance disturbed by ag nps exposure long term exposure of nanoparticles e g ag nps in wastewater has raised concerns over their potential shock to microcosms and removal performance in reactors nowack et al 2011 overall we observed that the presence of high ag nps concentrations i e 5 mg l dramatically impeded pollutant decomposition and caused cumulative inhibitory effects on pollutant removal as shown in fig 1 a the cod concentration remained stable throughout the 20 μg l 100 μg l and 1 mg l ag np exposure periods and the average removal efficiencies were more than 95 in contrast significantly lower cod removal was observed after exposure to 5 mg l ag nps for 21 days p 0 05 the removal of tn decreased from 95 4 1 3 in the control to 69 7 0 7 in r5 fig 1a the nh4 n average removal efficiencies drastically decreased since the 7th day at the end of the intervention nh4 n elimination under 5 mg l ag np stress was considerably lower than that of the control which may be a direct consequence of impaired nitrification zheng et al 2017 our results differ from those of a previous study that found no significant effects of 1 mg l and 5 mg l ag nps on tn and nh4 n removal efficiency after 30 to 40 days of exposure qiu et al 2016 these different observations can be interpreted as differences in the exposure duration affecting pollutant removal longer exposure to ag nps results in inhibition of pollutant removal ye et al 2021 to further reveal the effects of ag nps on the nitrogen cycle in sbbrs we conducted a detailed analysis of the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n during the last 8 hours cycle on the 81st day fig 1b shows the profile of nitrogen species in a typical cycle the nh4 n concentrations in r2 r3 and r4 were not distinctly different from those of the control during the entire typical cycle and the average removal percentages were all higher than 98 fig 1b this may be because pollutant removal largely depends on heterotrophic microorganisms which are strongly adapted to the low doses of ag nps in biofilms jeong et al 2014 in contrast the nh4 n removal efficiency in r5 was only 78 9 1 3 which was much lower than that of the other groups this observation indicates that high dose ag nps detrimentally affected the nh4 n removal rate resulting from the specific inhibition of the nitrification process huang et al 2019 remarkably despite no no2 n accumulation occurring at the end of the typical cycle the no2 n concentration experienced an initial slow increase within the first 6 h and then a sharp decrease under 0 and 20 μg l ag np stress fig 1b this result demonstrates that nitrification and denitrification in biofilms are complicated processes and that n2o emissions could occur simultaneously in both processes although neither no2 n nor no3 n concentrations were above 4 mg l overall the reduction in tn removal was likely due to the inhibition of nitrification but not denitrification which resulted in ammonia accumulation a similar observation was also obtained in that znonps inhibited no3 n reduction during denitrification resulting in detrimental tn removal efficiency ye et al 2021 3 2 n2o emissions varied under different ag nps stress exposure to various doses of ag nps may have different effects on nitrification and denitrification which could potentially affect n2o generation hu et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 a the 30th day was the turning point for the changes in n2o conversion rate after prolonged exposure to various ag np concentrations for example the n2o conversion rate was not significantly altered during the initial stage 0 30 days in the bioreactor exposed to 5 mg l ag nps p 0 05 the n2o conversion rate subsequently followed a gradually increasing trend and reached peak values on the 81st day 1 75 fold of the control fig 2a a high concentration of ag nps i e 5 mg l stimulated n2o conversion during long term exposure in contrast during the first 30 days the maximum n2o conversion rate at day 20 day 1 and day 20 respectively increased by 37 79 0 2 41 04 1 4 and 17 44 0 4 for r2 r3 and r4 respectively compared to the control the effects of low dose ag nps i e 20 μg l to 1 mg l on n2o conversion gradually transitioned from hormesis to inhibition with continued exposure in addition the effect of chronic ag np exposure on off gas n2o in a typical cycle was evaluated as shown in fig 2b the change in n2o production levels followed a bell shape and the n2o emissions in the five bioreactors experienced a steady increase followed by a drastic decline compared to r1 the generation of n2o in r2 r3 and r4 decreased by 9 02 18 73 and 22 99 respectively this could be explained by the microbial resistance excited upon ag np stress in cell metabolism chen et al 2012a however the biofilm substantially increased n2o emissions under 5 mg l ag nps compared with r1 by 67 54 p 0 05 we considered that part of this variation could be due to stress on the microbial community structure by 5 mg l ag nps according to previous reports hu et al 2013 however an increase in nitrite can increase the emission of n2o in accordance with a previous study ni and yuan 2015 thus figs 2b and 1b indicate that a large proportion of the n2o peak time overlapped with the no2 n peaks a strong correlation between n2o emissions and no2 n concentrations was observed indicating that ag nps in the biofilm can contribute to no2 n accumulation and further promote n2o emissions these observations coincided with those of previous studies which indicated that high environmental concentrations of ag nps stimulated n2o emissions li et al 2020 zheng and et co authors reported that a low dose of ag nps stimulated n2o production in estuarine environments zheng et al 2017 these contradictory results imply that there are different mechanisms of ag np stress in different environments in the biofilm environment of this study a fundamental transition may have occurred in the n2o production pathway induced by ag nps 3 3 ag nps mainly deposited on biofilm surface to further reveal the mechanism of n2o production under ag np exposure the distribution of different forms of silver i e particle specific ag nps and released ions was evaluated the concentrations of particle specific ag nps and released ag ions have been reported to be important factors for ag np stress cheng et al 2019 however as shown in table 1 the concentration of ag ions in all reactors was low with the proportion of ag ions for r3 r4 and r5 being only 0 37 0 23 and 0 09 respectively it is likely that the low concentration of ag ions resulted from the limited dissolution of ag nps which was trivial for the ag nps stress these observations are in line with previously reported results that ag nps leached low amounts of ag ions to stress in wastewater miao et al 2019 table 1 also clearly shows that biofilms play a crucial role in ag np aggregation and retention with the increase in ag np exposure concentration the total ag trapped by biofilms continued to grow to approximately 26 68 3 15 mg g ss at the end of the experiment in general nanoparticles can interact with biofilms through electrostatic steric and hydrophobic interactions resulting in their interception ikuma et al 2015 simultaneously ag nps can be immobilised by extracellular polymers eps produced by microorganisms puay et al 2015 therefore in this study the continuous inflow of synthetic wastewater accelerated the aggregation of ag nps in the biofilm making the biofilm a sink in particular under exposure to 5 mg l ag nps the biofilm acted as a large sink for ag nps through deposition and stabilization huang et al 2019 thus the enhancement of n2o emissions could be attributed to particle specific ag nps this phenomenon was further reiterated visually by the sem images fig 3 which were combined with the eds analysis in this study sem images showed the surface characteristics of the biofilm from the 5 mg l ag np treated group r5 and the control group r1 after 81 d of exposure to illustrate this abundant pores with approximate diameters of 2 10 μm were detected on the surface of the biofilm in r1 these pores can be regarded as transport channels for nutrients and oxygen to the interior of the biofilm park et al 2013 however the eds result indicated that much more ag nps were mainly adsorbed on the biofilm surface in r5 than in r1 fig 3 the pores on the biofilm surface in r5 were also predominantly covered by ag nps to form pits which would result in a lack of airflow in the innermost area oxygen is thought to be a pivotal electron acceptor during nitrification process boshers et al 2019 intercept with the oxygen supplement by the covered ag nps would inhibit ammonia nitrification and in turn enhance the denitrification process including nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification as n2o is an intermediate in the denitrification process incomplete denitrification can lead to n2o emissions kampschreur et al 2009 and the enhanced denitrification process by high doges of ag nps could likely result in the increment of n2o emission furthermore as ag np aggregates accumulated on the surface of biofilms we assessed the effect of ag nps on cell membrane integrity using the ldh kit as shown in fig s4 different exposure doses of ag nps resulted in variable ldh release for instance ldh release increased but not significantly by exposure to 20 μg l 100 μg l and 1 mg l ag nps compared to the control all p 0 05 indicating that exposure to ag nps did not result in severe damage to the cell membrane xu et al 2017 in contrast ldh release increased by 64 after exposure to r5 the level of ldh release was significantly increased p 0 05 suggesting that leakage or lysis of the cytoplasm occurred at ag np concentrations of 5 mg l these different leakages or lysis of the cytoplasm result from the toxicity of ag np to microorganisms chen et al 2012a thus exposure to 5 mg l ag nps disrupted the microbial membrane integrity which may lead to increased microbial mortality in addition our sem visualisation revealed that the biofilm surface was covered with numerous ag nps which also resulted in microorganism death on the surface layers morones et al 2005 therefore it was reasonable to infer that there was a dense dead zone present on the biofilm surface which was contributed by both dead cells and covered ag nps thereby creating an anaerobic microenvironment 3 4 micro environment affected n2o generation in biofilms to further verify the existence of an anaerobic microenvironment on the biofilm surface this study also evaluated the do variation across the biofilm do is considered to be a significant factor in controlling microbial kinetics wen et al 2016 the do concentration distribution in the biofilms after chronic ag np exposure is shown in fig 4 a it was found that the gradual decline in do content increased with the biofilm depth when the biofilm depth of r1 r4 respectively increased to 340 360 450 and 450 μm the minimum do content was reached additionally it was observed that the depth of the aerobic layer increased with exposure to ag nps which could probably be attributed to the repression of microbial activity and weakening of biochemical reactions on the surface layer by ag nps xu et al 2017 hou et al 2014 due to the lower reaction consumption on the biofilm surface with higher ag np exposure e g r4 the oxygen flux transferred from the external environment into the biofilm increased xu et al 2017 therefore ag nps at low concentrations 1 mg l can enhance the aerobic layer in the biofilm in contrast a sharp reduction in do content at a depth of less than 300 μm from the bulk solution to the biofilm was detected in r5 the biofilm depth was approximately 230 μm which was the shallowest amongst all the biofilms after prolonged exposure there is evidence that continuously high exposure levels cause the accumulation of nps beyond the resistance of cells resulting in a loss of microbial activity chen et al 2019 based on the results of ldh release 5 mg l ag nps had a damaging effect on the cell membrane after long term exposure as a result we confirmed that a rapid reduction in do level was responsible for the formation of larger anaerobic zones when biofilms were exposed to 5 mg l ag nps and consequently favoured denitrification by the existence of a dead zone in addition to characterising the micro environment of these five different biofilms in the do micro profile concentration this study also analysed the micro profile concentration of n2o in the biofilm as shown in fig 4b n2o was largely produced in the low do region i e 160 μm of the biofilm upon treatment with 5 mg l ag nps this indicated that the biofilm exposed to 5 mg l ag nps formed low do conditions to successfully facilitate denitrification fig 4 ni and yuan 2015 also confirmed that n2o production was positively associated with the enhancement of denitrification including nitrifier and heterotrophic denitrification pathways as a result it is likely that denitrification was a major potential contributor to n2o emissions under 5 mg l ag np stress when there was insufficient do content in the biofilm in addition the concentration of n2o from the surface layer was observed to be higher than deep inside the biofilm in r2 r4 fig 4b indicating that the n2o released was mainly due to the aerobic biochemical reaction wang et al 2017 because n2o production is affected by ag np concentrations the conversion of n2o production pathways after chronic exposure to ag nps is assessed in the following section 3 5 n2o production pathways driven by ag nps to reveal the n2o production pathway the characteristic sp values from the five bioreactors were analysed using n2o isotopic composition table 2 compared to 15n tracer and acetylene inhibition methods the natural isotope abundance method was considered not susceptible to marker diffusion thus facilitating the interference reduction of the original system in particular the n2o intramolecular site preference sp can be determined independently from the isotopic composition of the substrate and the sp values from different sources have different characteristics yu et al 2020 therefore this study used 15n natural isotope our results indicate that ag nps at different concentrations had different effects on the no2 n reduction pathway to produce n2o after long term exposure for example the sp value of n2o in r1 was 17 7 indicating that n2o could be produced by both nh2oh oxidation 54 and no2 n reduction 46 however the characteristic sp values gradually increased after long term exposure in r2 r3 and r4 the n2o derived from nh2oh oxidation accounted for 61 80 and 95 respectively indicating the dominant role of nitrification at low doses of ag np exposure 1 mg l in addition the contribution of nh2oh oxidation increased with increasing ag np dose in combination with the results in fig 4 this could be explained by the fact that n2o generation largely depended on nh2oh oxidation under high do conditions this finding corresponds to fig 1b where the no2 n concentration increased throughout the first 6 h in a typical cycle and then gradually decreased after administration in r2 r3 and r4 indicating that there was no significant accumulation of no2 n in the experiments this observation reiterated that n2o production following long term exposure to ag nps at 1 mg l was primarily the result of the nh2oh oxidation pathway law et al 2012 however the sp value in r5 stage was lower than that in the control this demonstrates that the addition of high dose ag nps enhanced n2o production from no2 n reduction during long term exposure similarly changes in no2 n as an electron acceptor during denitrification were evidence of a transformation in the n2o production pathway fig 1b therefore n2o production in bioreactors exposed to 5 mg l ag nps is primarily from the denitrification pathway through nitrifiers and heterotrophic denitrifiers hu et al 2013 it should be noted that both nitrification and denitrification processes could be similarly facilitated to trigger no2 n reduction process current research suggests that nitrifier denitrification is dominant at low do concentrations below 0 5 mg l and at a proper no2 n concentration 0 5 0 mg l ni and yuan 2015 harris et al 2015 however denitrifiers were more sensitive to metallic nps than nitrifiers zheng et al 2014 heterotrophic denitrification could be a major effector of n2o production via the no2 n reduction pathway gabarro et al 2014 stable isotope analysis could not distinguish the relative contributions of nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification to n2o production in the above mentioned assays thus in section 3 6 and 3 7 these two denitrification pathways are the focus of our discussion 3 6 microbial community altered by ag nps exposure at the end of long term exposure to ag nps the biofilm was collected for metagenomic analysis the similarity results amongst the five groups from the principal component analysis are shown in fig s5 the results indicated that the microbial community changed with an increase in the dose of ag nps the composition of the microbial species in r5 was the most different from that of the other biofilms the relative abundance of nitrosomonas an important ammonia oxidising bacterium decreased from 2 45 in r1 to 0 47 in r5 fig 5 table s2 indicating that ag nps had a dose dependant inhibitory effect on the ammonia oxidisation process a similar observation was obtained in a previous study which reported that ag nps could inhibit the function of nitrosomonas europaea by damaging the cell wall yuan et al 2013 this inhibition of ammonia oxidising bacteria could in part explain the accumulation of ammonia in r5 during the operation fig 1b in contrast the relative abundance of nitrospira a nitrite oxidising bacterium increased from 2 32 to 7 67 obviously an increase in ag nps resulted in a slight increase in nitrite oxidising bacteria whereas a decrease in ammonia oxidising bacteria was observed yang et al 2014 observed that the higher sensitivity of ammonia oxidising bacteria to ag nps was responsible for the increased vulnerability to ammonia oxidation processes compared to nitrite oxidising bacteria this may explain the discrepancy in abundance variation between these two nitrifiers this finding was also supported by the analysis of no2 n concentrations fig 1b for denitrification the denitrifiers increased with an increase in exogenous ag np concentration and reached a maximum in r5 fig 5 for instance the relative abundances of flavobacterium azoarcus and brevundimonas which are thought to be denitrifiers table s2 increased with the increase in exogenous ag nps concentration and finally reached the maximum in r5 from 1 02 to 7 06 0 83 to 2 26 and 0 42 to 2 76 respectively these results indicated that the added ag nps modified the microbial community distribution thereby affecting n2o emissions these results also revealed that the denitrification genus had a more obvious advantage than nitrification with increasing ag nps concentrations this variation in relative abundance likely resulted from the suitable anaerobic microenvironment created by the trapped ag nps fig 4b notably 5 mg l ag np stress decreased the relative abundance of thauera compared to that in the control i e from 4 30 to 2 54 although recognised as an important denitrifier thauera also acts as a competitive electron acceptor co et al 2017 thus thauera can reduce n2o emissions by limiting nosz expression semedo et al 2020 the decreased relative abundance of thauera in r5 further explains the higher observed n2o emissions after chronic exposure to 5 mg l ag nps fig 2 collectively combined with the results of the microelectrode and stable isotope analyses the promotion of no2 n reduction via heterotrophic denitrifiers in r5 was responsible for the significant increase in n2o emissions after chronic ag np exposure 3 7 gene abundances of nitrogen metabolism related enzymes changed under ag nps stress our results indicate that a high dose of ag nps could alert the relative abundance of denitrification related bacteria to further elucidate how ag nps affect n2o production by influencing functional potentials key nitrifying and denitrifying genes in metagenomic sequencing were annotated and analysed based on the kegg database fig 6 a illustrates the relative abundances of genes encoding key nitrification and denitrification enzymes for example the relative abundance of amoa amob and amoc ammonia monooxygenase genes was significantly downregulated by 61 66 74 94 74 83 and 82 56 respectively when exposed to r2 r5 for 81 days the addition of ag nps may be important for the cell surface as it interferes with the intracytoplasmic location of ammonia monooxygenase alito and gunsch 2014 as a result the activity of ammonia oxidising bacteria was inhibited reiterating our observations from the community analysis fig 5 similarly the relative abundance of hao hydroxylamine dehydrogenase gene was suppressed by ag nps the relative abundance of hao in r2 r3 and r4 was downregulated by 12 50 16 60 and 20 10 respectively whereas it was only 4 00 in r5 this was similar to the results for sp values where downregulation of hao abundance could weaken the oxidation of nh2oh to no2 n and increase the amount of n2o formed by nh2oh at a low concentration of ag nps 1 mg l harris et al 2015 in addition the relative abundance of nxra and nxrb nitrate oxidoreductase genes was upregulated with increasing ag np concentrations which is consistent with the abundance of nitrosomonas in terms of denitrification high dose ag nps enhanced the relative abundance of denitrifying genes during long term exposure fig 6a to illustrate the relative abundance of the ferredoxin nitrate reductase associated gene i e narb was upregulated by 53 28 after chronic exposure to 5 mg l ag nps compared to no exposure to ag nps i e r1 moreover the relative abundance of nirk and nirs nitrite reductase genes had no obvious effect after long term exposure with the exception of r5 increased by 29 46 overall notably the relative abundance of nirk nitrite reductase no forming gene was upregulated by 76 72 in r5 indicating a significant increase in denitrification zheng et al 2017 in contrast the relative abundance of norb and norc nitric oxide reductase genes which are directly related to n2o production kim et al 2016 was inhibited in r2 r3 and r4 compared to the control the relative abundance of nosz nitrous oxide reductase gene also decreased by 5 24 6 36 and 8 74 in r2 r3 and r4 respectively however nosz was upregulated by 8 33 in r5 stage indicating a positive correlation between the observed nitric oxide reductase associated genes and nosz therefore it is necessary to further analyse the net gene effect on n2o production and consumption via the no2 n reduction pathway net n2o production by the no2 n reduction pathway was reported to be significantly associated with the ratio of nitric oxide reductase associated i e norb and norc to nitrous oxide reductase associated i e nosz gene copy numbers n1 n2 chen et al 2012b as shown in fig s6 when exposed to r2 r3 and r4 the n1 n2 ratio was lower than that of r1 this indicates that the net n2o emissions became more negative under low doses of ag np stress than in the control however the n1 n2 ratio in r5 was 0 931 greater than 0 862 in the control indicating that the greatest net n2o emissions were produced through the no2 n reduction pathway after exposure to 5 mg l ag nps these results support the observations in biofilm micro environments and reconfirm the sp values employed for the relative contribution calculations nevertheless this study only analysed the gene abundance through metagenomics and failed to directly reveal metabolic activities further studies should also conduct directly experiments i e metatranscriptomics metaproteomics to elucidate the link between n2o isotopes gene expression and enzymes for the assimilatory nitrite reduction process blue line in fig 6b the relative abundance of nira nirb nird and nrfa nitrite reductase genes varied after prolonged exposure as illustrated the ag nps enhanced the total gene copy numbers of nira nirb nird and nrfa by 2 97 22 14 30 19 and 1 46 r2 r5 fig 6a therefore although the relative abundance of nirk and nirs was attenuated by low dose ag np treatment compared with r5 the levels of assimilatory nitrite reductase correspondingly increased this indicated that a large amount of no2 n in r2 r3 and r4 was consumed by the assimilatory nitrite reduction process liu et al 2019 possibly explaining on the other hand why higher n2o emissions were observed in r5 than in the other four groups fig 2b 4 conclusions the findings from this study suggest that a low dose of ag nps 1 mg l could slightly suppress n2o generation whereas a high dose 5 mg l of ag nps would stimulate n2o emissions this stimulation of high doses of ag nps is due to the following i a high content of ag nps would accumulate on the biofilm surface after long term exposure and then construct the anaerobic zone on the biofilm surface ii the anaerobic zone alerts the microbial community triggering the relative abundance of narb and nirk genes iii the upregulation of associated gene abundance may be responsible for the stimulation of the nitrite reduction pathway to release n2o these findings collectively suggest that chronic exposure to high doses of ag nps could enhance n2o emissions by forming anaerobic microenvironments in biofilms therefore precise and adequate aeration or low srt is required during long term operation in full scale wwtps

15428,silver nanoparticles ag nps were found to be responsible for nitrous oxide n2o generation however the mechanism of ag np induced n2o production remains controversial and needs to be elucidated in this study chronic ag np exposure experiments were conducted in five independent sequencing batch biofilm reactors to systematically assess the effects of ag nps on n2o emission the results indicated that a low dose of ag nps 1 mg l slightly suppressed n2o generation by less than 22 99 compared with the no ag np control method in contrast a high dose 5 mg l of ag nps stimulated n2o emission by 67 54 icp ms and sem eds together revealed that high ag np content accumulated on the biofilm surface when exposed to 5 mg l ag nps n2o and do microelectrodes as well as n2o isotopic composition analyses further demonstrated that the accumulated ag nps construct the anaerobic zone in the biofilm which is the primary factor for the stimulation of the nitrite reduction pathway to release n2o a metagenomic analysis further attributed the higher n2o emissions under exposure to a high dose of ag nps to the higher relative abundance of narb and nirk genes i e 1 52 and 1 29 fold higher respectively these findings collectively suggest that chronic exposure to high doses of ag nps could enhance n2o emissions by forming anaerobic micro environments in biofilms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords silver nanoparticle nitrous oxide micro environment nitrite reductase denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the annual production of silver nanoparticles ag nps is estimated to be approximately 550 tons accounting for 24 of all nanomaterials worldwide piccinno et al 2012 owing to the excessive use of nanomaterials a large amount of ag nps released into the environment inevitably enters wastewater systems it has been reported that the concentration of ag nps in wastewater can range from 18 μg l to 1 9 mg l hoque et al 2012 blaser et al 2008 an increase in ag np concentration results in biological and environmental stress and presents an increased demand for risk assessment according to current research ag nps might pose risks to microbial activity and diversity once they accumulate in wastewater sludge thereby further deteriorating nitrogen removal efficiency zheng et al 2018 in addition to being detrimental to nitrogen removal ag nps could potentially impact nitrous oxide n2o emissions as a potent greenhouse gas n2o has a 273 fold greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide co2 ipcc 2021 wastewater treatment processes have been identified as one of the important n2o emission sources and n2o emissions from wastewater i e 601 mt co2eq were responsible for 8 of the global anthropogenic n2o emissions 7469 mt co2eq in 2015 usepa 2019 although some operating parameters and environmental conditions were found to be related to the n2o production colman et al 2012 the effects induced by ag nps have not yet been completely understood because of the complex mechanism of n2o production at present it has been widely established that commonly available nanomaterials can affect n2o production for instance chen et al 2012b reported that the presence of cu nps increases denitrifiers resulting in a decrease in n2o production this is largely because n2o reductase is a copper protein containing a binuclear electron transfer site and a catalytic site pomowski et al 2011 and the cu ions released by cu nps trigger the activation of n2o reductase leading to the reduction of n2o to n2 ultimately favouring the reduction of n2o emissions moreover another study by zheng et al 2014 showed that znonps significantly restrained the expression of denitrifying enzyme associated genes resulting in increased n2o emissions which could be partly attributed to the released zn ions which exhibited negative effects on microbial denitrification ye et al 2021 although these studies have elucidated the mechanisms of cu or zno nps on n2o emissions given metal species nps has different properties sengul and asmatulu 2020 there are still many controversies and debates regarding the effects of ag nps on n2o production a previous study reported that the released ag nps suppressed denitrification nari narj and napd gene expression in the presence of 5 mg l ag nps leading to increased n2o emissions zheng et al 2018 interestingly another independent study stated that ag nps were critical for the downregulation of the denitrifying enzyme nirk gene and for further reducing n2o emissions liu et al 2018 the inhibition of denitrification by ag nps has been attributed to the particles themselves wu et al 2020 liu et al 2018 these inconsistent observations indicate that there are knowledge gaps regarding the effect of ag nps on n2o emissions to systematically investigate the influence of ag nps on n2o emissions it is necessary to identify the primary sources and pathways of n2o production in wastewater treatment systems a few studies have confirmed that metagenomic analysis allows the investigation of bacterial community diversity and metabolic potentials miao et al 2019 liu et al 2019 although metagenomic analysis can identify the corresponding functional genes it cannot elucidate the individual sources of n2o emissions qiu et al 2016 in contrast yoshida and toyoda 2000 reported the n2o isotopic composition has been proven to be a promising innovative approach to quantify the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification in addition with advances in microelectrode techniques the influence of nanomaterials on biofilm micro environments e g do and n2o concentrations can be investigated accurately han et al 2012 consequently the combination of the three methods microelectrode n2o isotopic composition and metagenomic analysis may reveal the mechanism for np induced n2o emissions more clearly however few studies have systematically elucidated the mechanism of ag nps on n2o emissions through micro environmental exploration we operated five independent sequencing batch biofilm reactors sbbrs continually exposed to different concentrations of ag nps 0 20 μg l 100 μg l 1 mg l and 5 mg l in addition a combination of n2o isotopic composition microelectrode analysis and metagenomic analysis was used to elucidate the mechanism by which ag nps affect n2o production the main objectives of this study were to determine 1 the sources of impact of ag nps 2 the pathways of n2o emissions and 3 the causes of n2o production under ag np stress these findings could contribute to a better understanding of the potential risks of nps in wastewater biological systems and provide ideas for mitigating global warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 sequencing batch biofilm reactors configuration and operating condition an sbbr is a combination of conventional activated sludge and a biological biofilm that is attached onto the surface of carriers allowing the treatment of wastewater more effectively jucherski et al 2019 thus five lab scale sbbrs were set up and operated over a duration of 4 months to evaluate the impact of ag nps fig s1 the working volume was 3 7 l and approximately 4000 mg l of inoculated sludge was collected from a local wwtp in chongqing china all sbbrs were placed over a thermostatic magnetic stirrer and maintained at 25 2 c these reactors were operated in three cycles per day and each cycle consisted of 5 minutes min feeding 470 min of aeration and subsequently 5 min of decanting 480 min in total during the feed phase 2 46 l of synthetic wastewater with different ag nps i e 0 20 μg l 100 μg l 1 mg l and 5 mg l was pumped into the sbbrs synthetic wastewater constituents are described in text s1 i e 500 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod during the aeration phase 1 l min of air was supplied through a porous diffuser to maintain do levels between 4 8 and 5 5 mg l during the decanting phase two thirds of the working volume of the supernatant was decanted at the end of each cycle resulting in an actual hydraulic residence time of 12 h no sludge was discharged during the entire experiment except for sampling the solid retention time srt was considered to be infinite as the sampled volume was small and the membrane retained the majority of the solids 2 2 ag nps exposure to assess the possible effects of ag nps on nutrient removal and n2o production ag np exposure experiments were conducted in sbbrs after stable operation for more than 30 days an ag np solution purity 99 99 with an average particle diameter of 15 nm purchased from huzheng nanotechnology co shanghai china was used in this study before addition to reactors the ag np stock suspension was prepared by dissolving 60 mg ag nps in 1000 ml of milli q water ph 7 0 and sonicating 20 c 250 w 40 khz for 1 hours keller et al 2010 the uniform and dispersive distribution of the ag nps was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100 jeol co japan and the ag nps diameter was found to be in the range of 10 40 nm fig s2 these five sbbrs were respectively fed with wastewater containing 0 control sbbr 20 μg l 100 μg l 1 mg l and 5 mg l ag nps i e r1 r2 r3 r4 and r5 respectively which were prepared by adding relevant volumes of the above mentioned ag np stock suspension to wastewater to assess the chronic effects of different ag np doses a feeding controlled trial was performed for 81 d the effluents from the five sbbrs were measured every three days 2 3 microelectrode analysis to determine the main sources and pathways of n2o emissions in sbbr biofilms under different concentrations of ag nps the concentration microprofiles of do and n2o at different depths were measured using a microelectrode system unisense arhus denmark a schematic diagram of the microprofiling system used for do and n2o measurement is illustrated in fig s3 at the end of the exposure experiments a cluster of fillers was stripped together with the attached biofilm and fixed using insect pins on a carrier in the mini bioreactor bottom centre the mini bioreactor was completely sealed except for a 15 mm diameter hole for the insertion of microelectrodes and a portable do metre hq40d hach usa before the microelectrode measurements synthetic wastewater with homologous sbbr parameters was pumped into the mini bioreactor the do level of the synthetic wastewater was maintained at approximately 6 0 mg l through blasting air in the mini bioreactor and mixed using the same magnetic stirring speed as in the sbbrs the temperature was controlled at 25 0 5 c so that the external environmental conditions of the biofilm were similar to those of sbbrs according to the manufacturer s instructions measurements were performed using do ox 10 unisense denmark and n2o n2o 10 unisense denmark microelectrodes with tip diameters of 10 and 25 μm respectively to capture as much variations in do and n2o concentrations as possible the tip approached the biofilm surface with a vertical step size of 10 μm controlled by the 3d microelectrode propeller during the measurement period the contact between the tip and the biofilm surface was observed using a universal microscope with 5x magnification and the changes in do and n2o concentrations were confirmed using sensortrace pro version 3 1 3 software three sites were randomly selected and measured to check reproducibility 2 4 n2o isotopic composition analysis as n2o emissions are a highly complicated process to quantify the contribution of different pathways to n2o emissions an isotopomer ratio δ15nα δ15nβ analysis was performed according to the method proposed by zheng et al 2017 gas samples were collected in the last 8 hour cycle on the 81st day stored in aluminium coated gas bags and then introduced into an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v plus finnigan germany with a trace gas pre concentration unit calculation of the nitrogen stable isotope ratio of n2o is described in text s2 as no standards were available for n2o isotopes we performed two point calibration using reference gases commercially available n2o shenkai gas chongqing with a purity better than 99 999 following a previously described protocol mohn et al 2014 the measurement accuracies of δ15nbulk and δ15nα were 0 4 and 0 9 respectively obtained through replicate calibration in addition owing to a significant difference in the microbial and enzymatic responses to n2o production and no bond breaking there was a distribution gap between the two nitrogen atoms of 15n sp was therefore defined as δ15nα minus δ15nβ to serve as an illustrative parameter for the intramolecular distribution of 15n tumendelger et al 2014 sutka et al 2006 reported that the characteristic sp values for nitrification i e nh2oh oxidation and denitrification i e no2 n reduction were 33 and 0 respectively in pure cultures this sp is probably constant at various substrate concentrations and in various functional microbes tumendelger et al 2014 therefore we assumed that n2o emissions from microorganisms originated exclusively from nitrification and denitrification sp values of 33 and 0 were employed to calculate the contribution of n2o to nitrification and denitrification using the following formula 1 c n s p s a m p l e s p d s p n s p d 100 s p 33 100 2 c d 1 c n 100 where cn and cd denote the n2o contributions from nitrification and denitrification respectively spsample is the sp value measured for each sample and spn and spd represent the average sp values of nitrification and denitrification respectively as previously reported 2 5 metagenomic analysis to further elucidate the mechanism by which ag nps affect n2o emissions microbial structures and functional potentials were also assessed by comparing the coding genes after chronic exposure under different ag nps concentration using metagenomics briefly at the end of the 81 days experiments three carriers with biofilm samples were randomly collected from r1 r5 reactors into 35 ml of sterile 1x phosphate buffer solution the biofilm on the carriers was detached by vortexing at the highest speed for 2 min and then ultrasonicated using a qsonica q500 sonicator qsonica llc newton ct usa for 2 min at 25 frequency and 2 s intervals cheng et al 2021 the suspension was then centrifuged for 20 min at 10 000 x g to obtain the pellet biomass the e z n a soil dna kit omega biotek norcross ga usa was used to extract total genomic dna from the biofilm samples according to the manufacturer s instructions dna quality and quantity were determined using a 2100 bioanalyzer agilent santa clara ca usa and an invitrogen qubit dsdna br assay kit thermo fisher scientific ny usa respectively the samples were sheared on a covaris s220 covaris woburn ma usa to 350 bp following the manufacturer s recommendations and the paired end library was prepared using the truseq dna kit the dna seq libraries were sequenced in two lanes of an illumina hiseq 4000 platform majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china and approximately 45 8 gb of reads were obtained from each sample the raw reads were submitted to ncbi with the bioproject accession number prjna832684 sequence quality control genome assembly gene prediction and abundance calculations were performed as described in text s3 after evaluating the gene abundance of each sample the non redundant gene sets were aligned to the nr database using diamond blastp e value 10 5 to obtain taxonomic annotations and the sum of the gene abundances corresponding to the species was used to calculate the taxonomic abundance of that species in the concurrent phase the potential function of sequences was obtained by aligning the gene sets against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database and the abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen metabolism was counted 2 6 other analytical methods and statistical analysis wastewater characteristics including cod tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were assessed following standard methods federation and aph 2005 lactate dehydrogenase ldh release was measured using a cytotoxicity assay kit following the manufacturer s instructions jiancheng bioengineering institute china the total ag and dissolved ag ions in the bioreactor were quantified using inductively coupled plasma optical mass spectrometry icp ms nexion300q perkinelmer usa scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometry sem eds vega 3 lmu tescan czech republic was employed to scan the surface distribution and composition of the samples the n2o concentration in the bioreactor was assessed using gas chromatography 6890 agilent usa these methods are detailed in the supporting information text s4 s5 and s6 n2o release per cycle was calculated by measuring the sample n2o concentration and total gas volume which was collected hourly in each cycle the ratio of n2o release to total nitrogen removal per day was considered to be the n2o conversion rate 2 7 statistical analysis data were compared using student s t test for statistical comparison using spss 20 0 significance was tested using analysis of variance and the null hypothesis was rejected at a confidence level of 95 i e p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal performance disturbed by ag nps exposure long term exposure of nanoparticles e g ag nps in wastewater has raised concerns over their potential shock to microcosms and removal performance in reactors nowack et al 2011 overall we observed that the presence of high ag nps concentrations i e 5 mg l dramatically impeded pollutant decomposition and caused cumulative inhibitory effects on pollutant removal as shown in fig 1 a the cod concentration remained stable throughout the 20 μg l 100 μg l and 1 mg l ag np exposure periods and the average removal efficiencies were more than 95 in contrast significantly lower cod removal was observed after exposure to 5 mg l ag nps for 21 days p 0 05 the removal of tn decreased from 95 4 1 3 in the control to 69 7 0 7 in r5 fig 1a the nh4 n average removal efficiencies drastically decreased since the 7th day at the end of the intervention nh4 n elimination under 5 mg l ag np stress was considerably lower than that of the control which may be a direct consequence of impaired nitrification zheng et al 2017 our results differ from those of a previous study that found no significant effects of 1 mg l and 5 mg l ag nps on tn and nh4 n removal efficiency after 30 to 40 days of exposure qiu et al 2016 these different observations can be interpreted as differences in the exposure duration affecting pollutant removal longer exposure to ag nps results in inhibition of pollutant removal ye et al 2021 to further reveal the effects of ag nps on the nitrogen cycle in sbbrs we conducted a detailed analysis of the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n during the last 8 hours cycle on the 81st day fig 1b shows the profile of nitrogen species in a typical cycle the nh4 n concentrations in r2 r3 and r4 were not distinctly different from those of the control during the entire typical cycle and the average removal percentages were all higher than 98 fig 1b this may be because pollutant removal largely depends on heterotrophic microorganisms which are strongly adapted to the low doses of ag nps in biofilms jeong et al 2014 in contrast the nh4 n removal efficiency in r5 was only 78 9 1 3 which was much lower than that of the other groups this observation indicates that high dose ag nps detrimentally affected the nh4 n removal rate resulting from the specific inhibition of the nitrification process huang et al 2019 remarkably despite no no2 n accumulation occurring at the end of the typical cycle the no2 n concentration experienced an initial slow increase within the first 6 h and then a sharp decrease under 0 and 20 μg l ag np stress fig 1b this result demonstrates that nitrification and denitrification in biofilms are complicated processes and that n2o emissions could occur simultaneously in both processes although neither no2 n nor no3 n concentrations were above 4 mg l overall the reduction in tn removal was likely due to the inhibition of nitrification but not denitrification which resulted in ammonia accumulation a similar observation was also obtained in that znonps inhibited no3 n reduction during denitrification resulting in detrimental tn removal efficiency ye et al 2021 3 2 n2o emissions varied under different ag nps stress exposure to various doses of ag nps may have different effects on nitrification and denitrification which could potentially affect n2o generation hu et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 a the 30th day was the turning point for the changes in n2o conversion rate after prolonged exposure to various ag np concentrations for example the n2o conversion rate was not significantly altered during the initial stage 0 30 days in the bioreactor exposed to 5 mg l ag nps p 0 05 the n2o conversion rate subsequently followed a gradually increasing trend and reached peak values on the 81st day 1 75 fold of the control fig 2a a high concentration of ag nps i e 5 mg l stimulated n2o conversion during long term exposure in contrast during the first 30 days the maximum n2o conversion rate at day 20 day 1 and day 20 respectively increased by 37 79 0 2 41 04 1 4 and 17 44 0 4 for r2 r3 and r4 respectively compared to the control the effects of low dose ag nps i e 20 μg l to 1 mg l on n2o conversion gradually transitioned from hormesis to inhibition with continued exposure in addition the effect of chronic ag np exposure on off gas n2o in a typical cycle was evaluated as shown in fig 2b the change in n2o production levels followed a bell shape and the n2o emissions in the five bioreactors experienced a steady increase followed by a drastic decline compared to r1 the generation of n2o in r2 r3 and r4 decreased by 9 02 18 73 and 22 99 respectively this could be explained by the microbial resistance excited upon ag np stress in cell metabolism chen et al 2012a however the biofilm substantially increased n2o emissions under 5 mg l ag nps compared with r1 by 67 54 p 0 05 we considered that part of this variation could be due to stress on the microbial community structure by 5 mg l ag nps according to previous reports hu et al 2013 however an increase in nitrite can increase the emission of n2o in accordance with a previous study ni and yuan 2015 thus figs 2b and 1b indicate that a large proportion of the n2o peak time overlapped with the no2 n peaks a strong correlation between n2o emissions and no2 n concentrations was observed indicating that ag nps in the biofilm can contribute to no2 n accumulation and further promote n2o emissions these observations coincided with those of previous studies which indicated that high environmental concentrations of ag nps stimulated n2o emissions li et al 2020 zheng and et co authors reported that a low dose of ag nps stimulated n2o production in estuarine environments zheng et al 2017 these contradictory results imply that there are different mechanisms of ag np stress in different environments in the biofilm environment of this study a fundamental transition may have occurred in the n2o production pathway induced by ag nps 3 3 ag nps mainly deposited on biofilm surface to further reveal the mechanism of n2o production under ag np exposure the distribution of different forms of silver i e particle specific ag nps and released ions was evaluated the concentrations of particle specific ag nps and released ag ions have been reported to be important factors for ag np stress cheng et al 2019 however as shown in table 1 the concentration of ag ions in all reactors was low with the proportion of ag ions for r3 r4 and r5 being only 0 37 0 23 and 0 09 respectively it is likely that the low concentration of ag ions resulted from the limited dissolution of ag nps which was trivial for the ag nps stress these observations are in line with previously reported results that ag nps leached low amounts of ag ions to stress in wastewater miao et al 2019 table 1 also clearly shows that biofilms play a crucial role in ag np aggregation and retention with the increase in ag np exposure concentration the total ag trapped by biofilms continued to grow to approximately 26 68 3 15 mg g ss at the end of the experiment in general nanoparticles can interact with biofilms through electrostatic steric and hydrophobic interactions resulting in their interception ikuma et al 2015 simultaneously ag nps can be immobilised by extracellular polymers eps produced by microorganisms puay et al 2015 therefore in this study the continuous inflow of synthetic wastewater accelerated the aggregation of ag nps in the biofilm making the biofilm a sink in particular under exposure to 5 mg l ag nps the biofilm acted as a large sink for ag nps through deposition and stabilization huang et al 2019 thus the enhancement of n2o emissions could be attributed to particle specific ag nps this phenomenon was further reiterated visually by the sem images fig 3 which were combined with the eds analysis in this study sem images showed the surface characteristics of the biofilm from the 5 mg l ag np treated group r5 and the control group r1 after 81 d of exposure to illustrate this abundant pores with approximate diameters of 2 10 μm were detected on the surface of the biofilm in r1 these pores can be regarded as transport channels for nutrients and oxygen to the interior of the biofilm park et al 2013 however the eds result indicated that much more ag nps were mainly adsorbed on the biofilm surface in r5 than in r1 fig 3 the pores on the biofilm surface in r5 were also predominantly covered by ag nps to form pits which would result in a lack of airflow in the innermost area oxygen is thought to be a pivotal electron acceptor during nitrification process boshers et al 2019 intercept with the oxygen supplement by the covered ag nps would inhibit ammonia nitrification and in turn enhance the denitrification process including nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification as n2o is an intermediate in the denitrification process incomplete denitrification can lead to n2o emissions kampschreur et al 2009 and the enhanced denitrification process by high doges of ag nps could likely result in the increment of n2o emission furthermore as ag np aggregates accumulated on the surface of biofilms we assessed the effect of ag nps on cell membrane integrity using the ldh kit as shown in fig s4 different exposure doses of ag nps resulted in variable ldh release for instance ldh release increased but not significantly by exposure to 20 μg l 100 μg l and 1 mg l ag nps compared to the control all p 0 05 indicating that exposure to ag nps did not result in severe damage to the cell membrane xu et al 2017 in contrast ldh release increased by 64 after exposure to r5 the level of ldh release was significantly increased p 0 05 suggesting that leakage or lysis of the cytoplasm occurred at ag np concentrations of 5 mg l these different leakages or lysis of the cytoplasm result from the toxicity of ag np to microorganisms chen et al 2012a thus exposure to 5 mg l ag nps disrupted the microbial membrane integrity which may lead to increased microbial mortality in addition our sem visualisation revealed that the biofilm surface was covered with numerous ag nps which also resulted in microorganism death on the surface layers morones et al 2005 therefore it was reasonable to infer that there was a dense dead zone present on the biofilm surface which was contributed by both dead cells and covered ag nps thereby creating an anaerobic microenvironment 3 4 micro environment affected n2o generation in biofilms to further verify the existence of an anaerobic microenvironment on the biofilm surface this study also evaluated the do variation across the biofilm do is considered to be a significant factor in controlling microbial kinetics wen et al 2016 the do concentration distribution in the biofilms after chronic ag np exposure is shown in fig 4 a it was found that the gradual decline in do content increased with the biofilm depth when the biofilm depth of r1 r4 respectively increased to 340 360 450 and 450 μm the minimum do content was reached additionally it was observed that the depth of the aerobic layer increased with exposure to ag nps which could probably be attributed to the repression of microbial activity and weakening of biochemical reactions on the surface layer by ag nps xu et al 2017 hou et al 2014 due to the lower reaction consumption on the biofilm surface with higher ag np exposure e g r4 the oxygen flux transferred from the external environment into the biofilm increased xu et al 2017 therefore ag nps at low concentrations 1 mg l can enhance the aerobic layer in the biofilm in contrast a sharp reduction in do content at a depth of less than 300 μm from the bulk solution to the biofilm was detected in r5 the biofilm depth was approximately 230 μm which was the shallowest amongst all the biofilms after prolonged exposure there is evidence that continuously high exposure levels cause the accumulation of nps beyond the resistance of cells resulting in a loss of microbial activity chen et al 2019 based on the results of ldh release 5 mg l ag nps had a damaging effect on the cell membrane after long term exposure as a result we confirmed that a rapid reduction in do level was responsible for the formation of larger anaerobic zones when biofilms were exposed to 5 mg l ag nps and consequently favoured denitrification by the existence of a dead zone in addition to characterising the micro environment of these five different biofilms in the do micro profile concentration this study also analysed the micro profile concentration of n2o in the biofilm as shown in fig 4b n2o was largely produced in the low do region i e 160 μm of the biofilm upon treatment with 5 mg l ag nps this indicated that the biofilm exposed to 5 mg l ag nps formed low do conditions to successfully facilitate denitrification fig 4 ni and yuan 2015 also confirmed that n2o production was positively associated with the enhancement of denitrification including nitrifier and heterotrophic denitrification pathways as a result it is likely that denitrification was a major potential contributor to n2o emissions under 5 mg l ag np stress when there was insufficient do content in the biofilm in addition the concentration of n2o from the surface layer was observed to be higher than deep inside the biofilm in r2 r4 fig 4b indicating that the n2o released was mainly due to the aerobic biochemical reaction wang et al 2017 because n2o production is affected by ag np concentrations the conversion of n2o production pathways after chronic exposure to ag nps is assessed in the following section 3 5 n2o production pathways driven by ag nps to reveal the n2o production pathway the characteristic sp values from the five bioreactors were analysed using n2o isotopic composition table 2 compared to 15n tracer and acetylene inhibition methods the natural isotope abundance method was considered not susceptible to marker diffusion thus facilitating the interference reduction of the original system in particular the n2o intramolecular site preference sp can be determined independently from the isotopic composition of the substrate and the sp values from different sources have different characteristics yu et al 2020 therefore this study used 15n natural isotope our results indicate that ag nps at different concentrations had different effects on the no2 n reduction pathway to produce n2o after long term exposure for example the sp value of n2o in r1 was 17 7 indicating that n2o could be produced by both nh2oh oxidation 54 and no2 n reduction 46 however the characteristic sp values gradually increased after long term exposure in r2 r3 and r4 the n2o derived from nh2oh oxidation accounted for 61 80 and 95 respectively indicating the dominant role of nitrification at low doses of ag np exposure 1 mg l in addition the contribution of nh2oh oxidation increased with increasing ag np dose in combination with the results in fig 4 this could be explained by the fact that n2o generation largely depended on nh2oh oxidation under high do conditions this finding corresponds to fig 1b where the no2 n concentration increased throughout the first 6 h in a typical cycle and then gradually decreased after administration in r2 r3 and r4 indicating that there was no significant accumulation of no2 n in the experiments this observation reiterated that n2o production following long term exposure to ag nps at 1 mg l was primarily the result of the nh2oh oxidation pathway law et al 2012 however the sp value in r5 stage was lower than that in the control this demonstrates that the addition of high dose ag nps enhanced n2o production from no2 n reduction during long term exposure similarly changes in no2 n as an electron acceptor during denitrification were evidence of a transformation in the n2o production pathway fig 1b therefore n2o production in bioreactors exposed to 5 mg l ag nps is primarily from the denitrification pathway through nitrifiers and heterotrophic denitrifiers hu et al 2013 it should be noted that both nitrification and denitrification processes could be similarly facilitated to trigger no2 n reduction process current research suggests that nitrifier denitrification is dominant at low do concentrations below 0 5 mg l and at a proper no2 n concentration 0 5 0 mg l ni and yuan 2015 harris et al 2015 however denitrifiers were more sensitive to metallic nps than nitrifiers zheng et al 2014 heterotrophic denitrification could be a major effector of n2o production via the no2 n reduction pathway gabarro et al 2014 stable isotope analysis could not distinguish the relative contributions of nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification to n2o production in the above mentioned assays thus in section 3 6 and 3 7 these two denitrification pathways are the focus of our discussion 3 6 microbial community altered by ag nps exposure at the end of long term exposure to ag nps the biofilm was collected for metagenomic analysis the similarity results amongst the five groups from the principal component analysis are shown in fig s5 the results indicated that the microbial community changed with an increase in the dose of ag nps the composition of the microbial species in r5 was the most different from that of the other biofilms the relative abundance of nitrosomonas an important ammonia oxidising bacterium decreased from 2 45 in r1 to 0 47 in r5 fig 5 table s2 indicating that ag nps had a dose dependant inhibitory effect on the ammonia oxidisation process a similar observation was obtained in a previous study which reported that ag nps could inhibit the function of nitrosomonas europaea by damaging the cell wall yuan et al 2013 this inhibition of ammonia oxidising bacteria could in part explain the accumulation of ammonia in r5 during the operation fig 1b in contrast the relative abundance of nitrospira a nitrite oxidising bacterium increased from 2 32 to 7 67 obviously an increase in ag nps resulted in a slight increase in nitrite oxidising bacteria whereas a decrease in ammonia oxidising bacteria was observed yang et al 2014 observed that the higher sensitivity of ammonia oxidising bacteria to ag nps was responsible for the increased vulnerability to ammonia oxidation processes compared to nitrite oxidising bacteria this may explain the discrepancy in abundance variation between these two nitrifiers this finding was also supported by the analysis of no2 n concentrations fig 1b for denitrification the denitrifiers increased with an increase in exogenous ag np concentration and reached a maximum in r5 fig 5 for instance the relative abundances of flavobacterium azoarcus and brevundimonas which are thought to be denitrifiers table s2 increased with the increase in exogenous ag nps concentration and finally reached the maximum in r5 from 1 02 to 7 06 0 83 to 2 26 and 0 42 to 2 76 respectively these results indicated that the added ag nps modified the microbial community distribution thereby affecting n2o emissions these results also revealed that the denitrification genus had a more obvious advantage than nitrification with increasing ag nps concentrations this variation in relative abundance likely resulted from the suitable anaerobic microenvironment created by the trapped ag nps fig 4b notably 5 mg l ag np stress decreased the relative abundance of thauera compared to that in the control i e from 4 30 to 2 54 although recognised as an important denitrifier thauera also acts as a competitive electron acceptor co et al 2017 thus thauera can reduce n2o emissions by limiting nosz expression semedo et al 2020 the decreased relative abundance of thauera in r5 further explains the higher observed n2o emissions after chronic exposure to 5 mg l ag nps fig 2 collectively combined with the results of the microelectrode and stable isotope analyses the promotion of no2 n reduction via heterotrophic denitrifiers in r5 was responsible for the significant increase in n2o emissions after chronic ag np exposure 3 7 gene abundances of nitrogen metabolism related enzymes changed under ag nps stress our results indicate that a high dose of ag nps could alert the relative abundance of denitrification related bacteria to further elucidate how ag nps affect n2o production by influencing functional potentials key nitrifying and denitrifying genes in metagenomic sequencing were annotated and analysed based on the kegg database fig 6 a illustrates the relative abundances of genes encoding key nitrification and denitrification enzymes for example the relative abundance of amoa amob and amoc ammonia monooxygenase genes was significantly downregulated by 61 66 74 94 74 83 and 82 56 respectively when exposed to r2 r5 for 81 days the addition of ag nps may be important for the cell surface as it interferes with the intracytoplasmic location of ammonia monooxygenase alito and gunsch 2014 as a result the activity of ammonia oxidising bacteria was inhibited reiterating our observations from the community analysis fig 5 similarly the relative abundance of hao hydroxylamine dehydrogenase gene was suppressed by ag nps the relative abundance of hao in r2 r3 and r4 was downregulated by 12 50 16 60 and 20 10 respectively whereas it was only 4 00 in r5 this was similar to the results for sp values where downregulation of hao abundance could weaken the oxidation of nh2oh to no2 n and increase the amount of n2o formed by nh2oh at a low concentration of ag nps 1 mg l harris et al 2015 in addition the relative abundance of nxra and nxrb nitrate oxidoreductase genes was upregulated with increasing ag np concentrations which is consistent with the abundance of nitrosomonas in terms of denitrification high dose ag nps enhanced the relative abundance of denitrifying genes during long term exposure fig 6a to illustrate the relative abundance of the ferredoxin nitrate reductase associated gene i e narb was upregulated by 53 28 after chronic exposure to 5 mg l ag nps compared to no exposure to ag nps i e r1 moreover the relative abundance of nirk and nirs nitrite reductase genes had no obvious effect after long term exposure with the exception of r5 increased by 29 46 overall notably the relative abundance of nirk nitrite reductase no forming gene was upregulated by 76 72 in r5 indicating a significant increase in denitrification zheng et al 2017 in contrast the relative abundance of norb and norc nitric oxide reductase genes which are directly related to n2o production kim et al 2016 was inhibited in r2 r3 and r4 compared to the control the relative abundance of nosz nitrous oxide reductase gene also decreased by 5 24 6 36 and 8 74 in r2 r3 and r4 respectively however nosz was upregulated by 8 33 in r5 stage indicating a positive correlation between the observed nitric oxide reductase associated genes and nosz therefore it is necessary to further analyse the net gene effect on n2o production and consumption via the no2 n reduction pathway net n2o production by the no2 n reduction pathway was reported to be significantly associated with the ratio of nitric oxide reductase associated i e norb and norc to nitrous oxide reductase associated i e nosz gene copy numbers n1 n2 chen et al 2012b as shown in fig s6 when exposed to r2 r3 and r4 the n1 n2 ratio was lower than that of r1 this indicates that the net n2o emissions became more negative under low doses of ag np stress than in the control however the n1 n2 ratio in r5 was 0 931 greater than 0 862 in the control indicating that the greatest net n2o emissions were produced through the no2 n reduction pathway after exposure to 5 mg l ag nps these results support the observations in biofilm micro environments and reconfirm the sp values employed for the relative contribution calculations nevertheless this study only analysed the gene abundance through metagenomics and failed to directly reveal metabolic activities further studies should also conduct directly experiments i e metatranscriptomics metaproteomics to elucidate the link between n2o isotopes gene expression and enzymes for the assimilatory nitrite reduction process blue line in fig 6b the relative abundance of nira nirb nird and nrfa nitrite reductase genes varied after prolonged exposure as illustrated the ag nps enhanced the total gene copy numbers of nira nirb nird and nrfa by 2 97 22 14 30 19 and 1 46 r2 r5 fig 6a therefore although the relative abundance of nirk and nirs was attenuated by low dose ag np treatment compared with r5 the levels of assimilatory nitrite reductase correspondingly increased this indicated that a large amount of no2 n in r2 r3 and r4 was consumed by the assimilatory nitrite reduction process liu et al 2019 possibly explaining on the other hand why higher n2o emissions were observed in r5 than in the other four groups fig 2b 4 conclusions the findings from this study suggest that a low dose of ag nps 1 mg l could slightly suppress n2o generation whereas a high dose 5 mg l of ag nps would stimulate n2o emissions this stimulation of high doses of ag nps is due to the following i a high content of ag nps would accumulate on the biofilm surface after long term exposure and then construct the anaerobic zone on the biofilm surface ii the anaerobic zone alerts the microbial community triggering the relative abundance of narb and nirk genes iii the upregulation of associated gene abundance may be responsible for the stimulation of the nitrite reduction pathway to release n2o these findings collectively suggest that chronic exposure to high doses of ag nps could enhance n2o emissions by forming anaerobic microenvironments in biofilms therefore precise and adequate aeration or low srt is required during long term operation in full scale wwtps

demonstrated excellent performance for tcacam decomposition the higher removal of tcacam could be achieved by vuv sulfite process 85 6 than vuv direct photolysis 13 5 due to the production of a great

with eaq was determined to be 2 41 1010 m 1 s 1 for the first time based on competitive kinetic method the complete tcacam degradation could be achieved at ph 8 3 while tcacam degradation efficiency decreased to 11 9 at ph 5 8 tcacam decay could be divided into two stages rapid growth sulfite dosage 0 25 1 0 mm and slow growth sulfite dosage 1 0 4 0 mm the yield of eaq was controlled by sulfite dosage and the predict yield of eaq increased from 3 69 10 14 to 2 58 10 12 m with increasing the sulfite dosage from 0 25 to 4 0 mm by kintecus 6 80 which resulted in an increase in tcacam removal meanwhile the presence of dissolved oxygen do chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and humic acid ha posed negative influence on tcacam decomposition to various degrees dichloroacetamide dcacam

2020 in order to reduce diseases caused by waterborne pathogens drinking water disinfection process is employed to eliminate them sedlak and gunten 2011 bao et al 2012 however the undesirable disinfection by products dbps are occurred during the drinking water treatment nowadays over 800 dbps have been recognized and identified which include nitrogenous chlorinated carbonaceous brominated dbps bond et al 2011 fang et al 2021 among these dbps nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps have attracted considerable attention in view of their high potential ecological risk bond et al 2011 chen et al 2018 krasner et al 2006 shah and mitch 2012 trichloroacetamide tcacam a newly recognized unregulated n dbps which generally forms in lower amount than regulated dbps nihemaiti et al 2017 while relevant studies revealed that it showed two orders of magnitude higher cytotoxic and genotoxic in mammalian cell assays than regulated dbps li et al 2012 chu et al 2016 richardson et al 2007 besides tcacam can also induce hepatotoxicity and even results in metabolic disfunction by disrupting the metabolic function of the gut microbiota zhang et al 2015 deng et al 2014 thence it is necessary to eliminate tcacam from drinking water to safeguard drinking water pre disinfection removal of dbp precursors and post formation removal of dbps have become the crucial control technologies for dbps zhang et al 2020 it s reported that uv persulfate process prior to disinfection is capable of reducing the formation of haloacetamides hacams as well as other n dbps chu et al 2015 meanwhile

chloroacetonitriles ling et al 2016 jo et al 2011 li et al 2022 however the trichlorinated dbps such as tcacam can be barely eliminated by uv aops due to the low reactive with ho chuang et al 2016 wang et al 2009 according to the polarity characteristics of tcacam chu et al 2016 luo et al 2015 advanced reduction processes arps is found to be an effective technology which can degrade the highly

benzoquinone uv sulfide s2 and uv ferrous iron gu et al 2017 liu et al 2013 yazdanbakhsh et al 2021 among these sulfite is the most popular choice due to its virtues of low cost and environmentally friendly weak mutagenic or other genotoxic effects rao et al 2021 in addition residual sulfite in water can be desalinized by aeration wu et al 2021 vuv can emit ultraviolet light with wavelength of 185 and 254 nm simultaneously compared with uv irradiation vuv has the advantages of hydrolysis and ionization directly to generate reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals ho hydrogen atoms h and hydrated electrons eaq eqs 1 2 gonzalez et al 2004 buxton et al 1988a due to the high energy photons production vuv is more capable for degrading chloroacetaldehyde trichloroacetic acid and

sulfite process in degradation of haloacetic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate gu et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 therefore vuv sulfite may be a promising process for the abatement of tcacam however

estimated to be 0 392 μeinstein s for the 254 nm uv and 0 063 μeinstein s for the 185 nm vuv respectively according to ki kio3 and the production rate of h2o2 methods li et al 2020 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 details for the determination of photon intensity at 254 and 185 nm were shown in text s1 and text s2 respectively the photoreactor was wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid the interference from other light sources the temperature was maintained at 25 c before starting the experiments the vuv and uv lamps were ignited and warmed up at least 30 min to guarantee the stable energy output unless otherwise noted the solution was purged with n2 at a pressure of 0 15 mpa to blow off the do from the water firstly 20 min and then continued to charge n2 to prevent oxygen from re entering and maintain the solution at low do concentration 1 mg l during the reaction 0 1 m phosphate buffer was introduced to adjust the solution initial ph 9 ml sample was withdrawn at a pre set time intervals 0 0 5 1 2 3 4 6 8 min for analysis 2 3 analytical methods 3 g anhydrous na2so4 and 3 ml mtbe were introduced into 9 ml sample and shaken by a circumferential oscillator ks 130 b ika germany at 720 r min for 10 min and then left for 5 min the concentrations of tcacam and haloacetic acids haas were determined by gas chromatography gc which was coupled with an electron capture

shimadzu japan 2 4 kinetic modeling the concentrations of reactive species were simulated in vuv sulfite process by kinetic modeling kintecus 6 80 chlorate iodine model ianni 2021 the related reactions based on reactive species in vuv sulfite process were summarized in table s1 and additional details of the model were provided in text s3 2 5 trapping of reactive species by electron paramagnetic resonance epr 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was adopted to capture reactive species which were generated in vuv or vuv sulfite process under n2 saturation conditions and by the epr spectrometer bruker emxnano liang et al 2021 the additions of sulfite and dmpo were 10 mm and 100 mm respectively in order to capture eaq more easily in the reactive species capture experiment the initial ph was adjusted to 9 2 unless otherwise noted the magnetic field modulation amplitude modulation frequency microwave frequency microwave power receiver gain number of detections and sweep time were set as 344 5 mt 2 g 100 khz 9 64 ghz 10 mw 40 3 30 s respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 degradation of tcacam by vuv sulfite process 3 1 1 degradation of tcacam using different reductants under vuv or uv irradiation different reductants can significantly affect the removal of pollutants by arps milh et al 2021 thus the degradation of tcacam using different reductants sulfite sulfide and ferrous iron under vuv or uv irradiation were investigated fig 2 fig 2 demonstrates that both reductants and vuv or uv were uncapable of abating tcacam effectively sulfite sulfide and ferrous iron only accounted for 4 9 1 6 and 0 8 of tcacam removal respectively meanwhile uv and vuv could achieve less than 15 0 degradation of tcacam however when different reductants irradiated under vuv or uv tcacam removal rates reached up to 85 6 or 78 0 in vuv or uv sulfite under the same condition the difference in degradation efficiency is mainly due to the generated reactive species with different reductive capabilities and the difference of optimal photolysis wavelength of reductants yu et al 2018 liu et al 2014 2013 sulfide can absorb uv lights resulting in the generation of excited state bisulfide ion hs with a redox potential e of 0 45 v yu et al 2018 melsheimer and schlögl 1997 besides uv irradiation of sulfite or ferrous iron produce eaq e 2 9 v while sulfite generates additional other reactive species such as h e 2 3 v and so3 e 0 8 v zhang et al 2022 airey and dainton 1966 the reduction ability of sulfite sulfide and ferrous iron are relatively weak which may be responsible for the poor tcacam removal song et al 2013 in addition vuv irradiation exhibited better tcacam degradation performance than uv irradiation at the same uv power 4 w which probably because the tcacam degradation under vuv is associated with direct photolysis by 185 254 nm and indirect photolysis by reactive species which was generated by vuv via hydrolysis directly gonzalez et al 2004 while under uv irradiation tcacam can be decomposed only by direct photolysis by 254 nm however the tcacam has a weak molar absorbance coefficient at 254 nm ε254 27 64 m 1 cm 1 detail information was provided in text s4 only 13 5 of tcacam removal was observed by vuv irradiation which was lower than that of monochloroacetic acid mcaa and dichloroacetonitrile dcan zhang et al 2022 wu et al 2020 two reasons may account for this phenomenon i low yield of eaq in vuv photolysis of h2o eqs 1 2 ii eaq is consumed by h2o to generate other reactive species e g ho h eqs 3 5 buxton et al 1988b with the addition of sulfite 1 mm the tcacam decomposition was greatly enhanced during the vuv or uv process because the photolysis of sulfite can generate an amount of reactive reductive species e g eaq h and so3 which are effective for the dehalogenation of compounds containing c x x f cl br i bonds li et al 2012 fischer and warneck 1996 yang et al 2013 3 e aq h 2 o h o h k 1 9 10 1 m 1 s 1 4 e aq ho o h k 3 0 10 10 m 1 s 1 5 e aq h h 2 o h k 2 5 10 10 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig s2 the degradation of tcacam during vuv uv sulfite and vuv sulfite processes followed pseudo first order kinetics well the first order rate constant k obs min 1 in vuv sulfite process was 0 24416 min 1 which was 14 3 and 1 3 folds greater than that in vuv and uv sulfite processes respectively the k obs during vuv irradiation was only 0 01705 min 1 which indicated that the generated reactive species in vuv sulfite process played a crucial role in the tcacam degradation accordingly vuv sulfite process is expected to be an alternative technology for the elimination of tcacam 3 1 2 contribution of reactive species and vuv uv to tcacam degradation in order to explore the reaction mechanism epr experiments were performed to detect the generated reactive species rs such as eaq h ho and so3 in vuv sulfite process and the results were shown in fig 3 a the weak dmpo adduct of ho dmpo ho was detected during vuv irradiation under anaerobic conditions while the eaq was not captured by dmpo which may be due to the low quantum yield of eaq in vuv process or its short lifetime fortunately the signals of eaq and so3 as indicated by dmpo h and dmpo so3 were obtained in vuv irradiation of n2 purged 10 mm sulfite solution at ph 9 2 and the dmpo h signal disappeared when 3 mm nano2 was introduced into the sulfite solution meanwhile quenching experiments were conducted to determine the contribution of these rs nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 can react rapidly with eaq eqs 6 7 while no3 reacts much more slowly with h than no2 eqs 8 9 li et al 2012 buxton et al 1988a b so no3 and no2 were selected as quenchers of eaq and h t butanol tba can quench ho with a rate constant of 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 eq 10 but it has a weak effect on eaq and h eqs 11 12 buxton et al 1988b 1988a wu et al 2020 thus it is crucial to determinate the suitable scavenger dosage in vuv sulfite process the calculation details about tba dosage were shown in text s5 according to the previous literature wu et al 2020 and the dosages of no3 and no2 were determined by chemical modeling software kintecus 6 80 fig 3b the results indicated that 1 mm tba could consume nearly 100 ho but only 1 3 eaq 300 μm no2 could consume 99 9 eaq and 100 h on the contrary 300 μm no3 could deplete 100 eaq while only 8 4 h 6 no 3 e aq no 3 2 k 9 7 10 9 m 1 s 1 7 no 2 e aq no 2 2 k 4 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 8 no 3 h n o 3 h k 1 4 10 6 m 1 s 1 9 no 2 h no o h k 7 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 10 c h 3 3 coh ho h 2 o c h 2 c h 3 2 coh k 6 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 11 c h 3 3 coh e aq c h 3 3 coh k 4 0 10 5 m 1 s 1 12 c h 3 3 coh h h 2 c h 2 c h 3 2 coh k 1 7 10 5 m 1 s 1 fig 3c shows the tcacam degradation by vuv sulfite process with different scavengers the addition of 1 mm tba could significantly enhance the degradation of tcacam from 85 6 to 94 8 to further demonstrate the role of ho the uv h2o2 process was adopted to degrade tcacam as shown in fig s5 the concentration of tcacam remained almost unchanged in the presence or absence of 1 mm tba which revealed that the contribution of ho to tcacam degradation could be ignored however the improvement of tcacam decomposition in the presence of tba during vuv sulfite process may be attributed to the fact that tba can prevent eaq from being consumed by ho eq 4 the introduction of no3 or no2 300 μm could decrease the removal of tcacam significantly and no2 exerted a greater negative effect than that of no3 which suggested that eaq and or h played an important role in tcacam degradation to further distinguish the contributions of eaq h uv vuv and other rs their relative contributions r were calculated via the pseudo first order rate constant table s2 in vuv sulfite process using the following equations 13 r e aq k obsvuv sulfite k obsno 3 k obsvuv sulfite 100 14 h k obsno 3 k obsno 2 k obsvuv sulfite 100 15 r uv k obsuv k obsvuv sulfite 100 16 r vuv and other rs 1 r e aq r h r uv the results were presented in fig 3d r eaq r h r uv and r vuv and other rs were determined to be 83 5 8 8 4 7 and 3 0 respectively the difference of r may be related to the redox potential of the reactive species which are ranked in order of their reducing capacity eaq e 2 9 v h e 2 3 v so3 e 0 8 v buxton et al 1988b compared with the degradation of monochloroacetic acid in vuv sulfite process by zhang et al similar r h was calculated in the same way while the r eaq was higher than that of them 61 1 zhang et al 2022 which might be due to the fact that ho did not contribute to the degradation of tcacam in this study the low value of r uv can be ascribed to the relatively weak molar absorbance coefficient of tcacam at 254 nm ε254 27 64 m 1 cm 1 in this study these results revealed that eaq was the dominant contributor to tcacam decomposition 3 1 3 second order rate constant between tcacam and eaq competitive kinetic method was employed to determine the second order rate constant between eaq and tcacam for further understanding the reaction mechanism trichloromethane tcm which has a known second order rate constant with eaq 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 wu et al 2020 was chosen as the probe compound for its similar structure with tcacam thus the second order rate constant of tcacam with eaq during uv sulfite process a process that created a good environment for eaq yu et al 2018 li et al 2012 could be calculated using the following equation 17 ln tcacam t tcacam 0 k tcacam e aq k tcm e aq ln tcm t tcm 0 where tcacam t and tcacam 0 are the real time concentration and the initial concentration of tcacam μg l tcm t and tcm 0 are the real time concentration and the initial concentration of tcm μg l k tcacam e aq and k tcm e aq are the second order rate constant of eaq with tcacam and tcm m 1 s 1 respectively as shown in fig s6 the k tcacam e aq was measured as 2 41 1010 m 1 s 1 this result was lower than that the second order rate constant of dcan with eaq 3 76 1010 m 1 s 1 using the same method wu et al 2020 the difference may be attributed to the fact that tcacam has one more c cl bond in its structure than dcan even though they are both n dbps 3 2 influence of main reaction parameters in vuv sulfite process 3 2 1 influence of initial ph ph is considered as a key parameter for sulfite activation which can affect the interaction between sulfite and target pollutions as well as the yields of reactive species wu et al 2021 as shown in fig 4 the effect of initial ph on tcacam degradation was investigated it can be seen from fig 4a that the degradation of tcacam increased from 11 9 to 100 when the initial ph increased from 5 8 to 9 2 it is well known that the existence forms of sulfite species e g so3 2 hso3 is highly ph dependent pka2 7 2 banayan esfahani and mohseni 2022 eldridge et al 2016 tartar and garretson 1941 so3 2 is the dominant sulfite species at ph 7 2 while hso3 occupies a predominant position in ph range of 2 0 7 0 so3 2 can be easily irradiated to generate eaq eq 18 under alkaline conditions because it has a higher molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield than hso3 eq 19 wu et al 2021 meanwhile the reactions of eaq with h and hso3 eqs 20 21 result in the decrease of eaq yield in vuv sulfite process under acidic conditions xiao et al 2017 ph can affect the generation of reactive species and thus affect the decomposition of tcacam to further explain the yields of reactive species the yields of eaq and h as a function of initial ph were simulated by kintecus 6 80 fig 4b as the ph increased from 1 0 to 12 0 the concentration of eaq increased from 1 46 10 18 to 2 54 10 12 m and then kept stability under alkaline conditions ph 9 0 12 0 however the concentration of h presented a downward tendency totally which decreased from 4 65 10 10 to 3 00 10 10 m slightly at first ph 1 0 6 0 and then dropped sharply to 5 15 10 15 m ph 12 0 noteworthy taking ph 7 0 as the cut off point eaq was the dominant reactive species at ph 7 0 while the high concentration of h was observed at ph 7 0 meanwhile the degradation efficiency of tcacam at ph 5 8 was only 11 9 which indirectly indicated that the contribution of h was much lower than that of eaq however further increasing ph from 9 2 to 11 0 only enhanced the decomposition of tcacam slightly which may be attributed to the fact that the quantum yield of eaq reaches the peak value of 2 54 10 12 m fig 4b in vuv sulfite process interestingly the removal of tcacam also achieved 85 6 under neutral conditions so the initial ph of the experiment was set at 7 0 to approximate the actual aquatic environment 18 so 3 2 hv so 3 e aq 19 hso 3 hv so 3 h k 2 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 20 h e aq h k 2 3 10 10 m 1 s 1 21 hso 3 e aq h so 3 2 k 2 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 3 2 2 influence of sulfite dosage the concentration of sulfite is crucial to the reductive degradation of contaminants during sulfite activation wu et al 2021 therefore the effect of sulfite dosage on tcacam degradation and the yields of eaq and h were investigated in vuv sulfite process fig 5 compared with vuv 13 5 solely the introduction of sulfite 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 mm could enlarge the degradation of tcacam 52 7 63 5 85 6 85 9 96 0 respectively in vuv sulfite process fig 5a obviously the tcacam decomposition efficiency significantly increased from 52 7 to 85 6 with increasing the sulfite dosage from 0 25 mm to 1 0 mm however when the sulfite dosage further increased to 2 0 mm and 4 0 mm the tcacam decomposition efficiency was only enhanced by 0 3 and 10 4 respectively compared to that of 1 0 mm sulfite the k obs increased from 0 09426 min 1 to 0 40232 min 1 when the sulfite dosage increased from 0 25 mm to 4 0 mm fig 5b shows that the tcacam decomposition can be divided into two stages rapid growth and slow growth which consistent with the study by zhang et al zhang et al 2022 the phenomenon may be related to the yield of eaq which was controlled by sulfite dosage at rapid growth stage the generated eaq is largely consumed to degrade tcacam while at slow growth stage the presence of more sulfite results in the generation of more eaq and so3 however the presence of high concentrations of eaq and so3 in the reaction solution may compete with tcacam for eaq eqs 22 23 fischer and warneck 1996 in addition eaq also may be consumed by sulfite eqs 24 25 zhang et al 2022 22 e aq so 3 so 3 2 23 e aq e aq h 2 2 o h k 5 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 24 e aq so 3 2 product k 1 3 10 6 m 1 s 1 25 e aq hso 3 h so 3 2 k 2 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 fig 5c indicates that the eaq yield increased from 0 to 2 58 10 12 m as sulfite dosage increased from 0 to 4 0 mm this further explains that the yield of eaq was controlled by sulfite dosage the conclusion is in accordance with the results of song et al in which the relative quasi stationary concentration of eaq was increased with increasing so3 2 concentration song et al 2013 noteworthy the kintecus 6 80 simulation results also demonstrated the existence of two phases fast and slow which was consistent with the experimental results fig 5b this also explains that sulfite dosage was the determining factor for controlling eaq generation unlike the eaq yield the concentration of h firstly increased to 1 02 10 10 m 0 0 75 mm and then decreased sharply to 3 51 10 17 m 0 75 4 0 mm with increasing sulfite dosage from 0 to 4 0 mm fig 5d which may be closely related to the depletion of h by the high concentration of eaq 0 75 4 mm eq 5 3 2 3 influence of dissolved oxygen do may exert a significant effect on the degradation of contaminants in vuv sulfite process cao et al 2021 the influence of do on tcacam decay was shown in fig 6 compared to that of 8 5 mg l without n2 purge the removal efficiency of tcacam decreased from 85 6 to 21 7 when the do concentration was lower than 1 mg l fig 6a do is an excellent scavenger of eaq and h which can react with eaq and h with rate constants of 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 and 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively eqs 26 27 wu et al 2021 do can not only convert eaq to the rather weakly reactive species o2 and ho2 but also reduces the available steady state concentrations of eaq and h that for tcacam degradation fig 6b predicts the yields of eaq and h as a function of do in vuv sulfite process which also supports the view that do can reduce the concentrations of reactive species the yields of eaq and h were gradually decreased as do increased in vuv sulfite process when do concentration was set at 8 0 mg l the concentrations of eaq and h were found to be 7 04 10 16 m and 1 39 10 18 m respectively which were 3 267 103 and 3 2 104 times lower than that of do 0 mg l 26 e aq o 2 o 2 k 1 9 10 10 m 1 s 1 27 h o 2 ho 2 k 1 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 3 2 4 influence of water matrix water is a mixture which consists of many components such as chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and dissolved organic matters dom wu et al 2021 it is reported that the presence of cl hco3 and dom may pose an impact on the performance of aops aprs nawaz et al 2017 cao et al 2021 gu et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 therefore the influence of cl hco3 and dom on tcacam degradation in vuv sulfite process were investigated fig 7 a 15 5 decline of tcacam degradation was observed in fig 7a at a cl concentration of 16 mm when compared with the absence of cl and the corresponding k obs decreased from 0 23932 min 1 to 0 14818 min 1 when the concentration of cl increased from 2 mm to 16 mm fig 7b cl has a high molar absorption coefficient of 3500 m 1 cm 1 at 185 nm zhang et al 2022 which can compete with sulfite for vuv light source furthermore the reaction between cl and eaq may be enhanced at high cl concentration and thus leading to a decrease in tcacam degradation nawaz et al 2017 the degradation of tcacam was also inhibited from 82 8 to 70 4 with increasing hco3 concentration from 0 5 mm to 4 mm fig 7c and d the inhibitory effect of hco3 on tcacam decay can be attributed to the fact that eaq is consumed by hco3 at a relatively slow second order rate constant of 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988b fig 7e f show that the decomposition of tcacam decreased from 85 6 to 32 1 and k obs decreased from 0 24416 min 1 to 0 04805 min 1 as ha concentration increased from 0 mg l to 8 mg l ha can induce the generation of ho 1o2 h2o2 and other reactive oxygen species through a series of chain reactions during vuv or uv irradiation dalrymple et al 2010 lester et al 2013 and these generated reactive oxygen species will quench eaq at different reaction rates in addition ha can also act as the optical filter to absorb uv light wang et al 2012 therefore shading effect and or quenching of eaq are caused by ha which may be account for inhibition effect on tcacam degradation in vuv sulfite process 3 3 intermediate products and mechanisms of tcacam decomposition by vuv sulfite process fig 8 shows the concentration variations of tcacam cl dichloroacetamide dcacam trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dichloroacetic acid dcaa during the tcacam degradation in vuv sulfite process as shown in fig 8a the theory and actual dechloriantion of tcacam were studied tcacam theory dechloriantion tcl tcl 3 tcacam t where tcacam t is the real time degradation concentration efficiency was always higher than actual dechloriantion acl efficiency which suggested that a certain of cl containing products were likely to generated in tcacam degradation process to confirm this hypothesis three intermediate products namely dcacam tcaa and dcaa were detected by gc ecd according to certified reference substances fig 8b respectively and the concentrations of intermediate products were also quantified the concentrations of dcacam and tcaa both firstly increased 0 20 26 μg l and 0 4 84 μg l with reaction time 0 2 min and 0 3 min and then decreased to 0 61 μg l and 2 21 μg l at the end of reaction 8 min whereas the dcaa concentration was only detected at the last sampling point the results revealed that reductive dechlorination and hydrolysis coexisted during the degradation of tcacam in vuv sulfite process which was consistent with results from previous researches chu et al 2016 chu et al 2009 however a significant difference existed between the concentrations sum of intermediate products the remain tcacam formed dcacam tcaa and dcaa and the initial tcacam concentration in which the concentrations sum of intermediate products was much lower than the initial tcacam concentration fig 8b moreover the undetectable of monochloroacetamide mcacam and mcaa showed that the dechlorination of tcacam or tcaa was incomplete and other products such as dcacam sulfonate might be generated during vuv sulfite process ding et al 2018 in view of the above results three possible degradation pathways of tcacam by vuv sulfite process were proposed in fig 8c i most of tcacam degradation comes from the attack of c cl bond by eaq and h to form dcacam and cl ii some tcacam is reduced to dcacam sulfonate and cl by so3 and then dcacam sulfonate quite slowly hydrolyses to form dcacam and so4 2 yiin et al 1987 ding et al 2018 haag and mill 2010 iii a small part of tcacam is converted to tcaa because of its own hydrolysis reaction chu et al 2009 then tcaa can be further reduced by eaq and h to form dcaa and cl 3 4 combined toxicity risk during tcacam decomposition by vuv sulfite process intermediate products including dcacam tcaa dcaa were detected during the degradation of tcacam by vuv sulfite process as reported tcacam dcacam tcaa and dcaa are a series of dbps with cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in drinking water table s3 and their combined toxicity values are 233 168 833 and 274 m 1 respectively table s3 plewa et al 2010 plewa et al 2008 to evaluate the toxic effect during tcacam decomposition by vuv sulfite process the combined toxicity risk value was calculated by eq 28 table s4 according to the previous research chu et al 2016 28 ctr v t ct v products c products t where ctrvt is the combined toxicity risk value at t reaction time min ctvproducts is the combined toxicity value m 1 of each detected intermediate product cproducts t is the intermediate product concentration nm at t reaction time min although the combined toxicity values of tcaa 833 m 1 and dcaa 274 m 1 were higher than tcacam 233 m 1 the combined toxicity risk value was still gradually decreased during the tcacam decomposition by vuv sulfite process fig s7 this may be attributed to the fact that the generated intermediate products were further degraded by vuv sulfite process and the degradation rate was higher than the production rate the results supported that vuv sulfite process could not only effectively degrade tcacam but also show favorable toxicity inhibition 4 conclusions the vuv sulfite process presented the best performance for tcacam removal eaq as one of the most reactive species played an important role in the tcacam decomposition the second order rate constant of eaq reacting with tcacam was determined to be 2 41 1010 m 1 s 1 do posed a negative effect on the degradation of tcacam which can be due to the fact that do can significantly consume eaq with the increase of ph and sulfite dosage the degradation efficiency of tcacam increased sharply which may be attributed to the fact that eaq is more stable under alkaline conditions and increasing sulfite dosage results in the rising of the eaq concentration the presence of ha obviously hindered tcacam degradation whereas cl and hco3 exhibited slight inhibition intermediate products including dcacam tcaa dcaa and cl were detected indicating that reductive dechlorination and hydrolysis coexisted during the degradation of tcacam in vuv sulfite process vuv sulfite process could not only decompose tcacam but also remove the formation of intermediate products and inhibit consequence on toxicity during the degradation of tcacam supporting its effective applicability in the drinking water treatment therefore vuv sulfite process is expected to be an alternative technology for the elimination of tcacam in drinking water credit authorship contribution statement huahan huang conceptualization data curation formal

15429,trichloroacetamide tcacam is among of the nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps with high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity which is usually detected at low concentration μg l in drinking water in this study advanced reduction process arp based on vacuum ultraviolet vuv was employed to eliminate tcacam compared with vuv vuv sulfide and vuv ferrous iron processes vuv sulfite process demonstrated excellent performance for tcacam decomposition the higher removal of tcacam could be achieved by vuv sulfite process 85 6 than vuv direct photolysis 13 5 due to the production of a great number of reactive species the degradation of tcacam followed the pseudo first order kinetics well in vuv sulfite process and the pseudo first order rate constant k obs increased with increasing sulfite concentration reactive species quenching experiments demonstrated that eaq so3 and h were involved in the degradation of tcacam the in situ generated eaq so3 and ho via vuv sulfite process were identified by electron paramagnetic resonance epr and the eaq was proved to be the dominated species relative contribution 83 5 for tcacam decomposition the second order rate constant of tcacam with eaq was determined to be 2 41 1010 m 1 s 1 for the first time based on competitive kinetic method the complete tcacam degradation could be achieved at ph 8 3 while tcacam degradation efficiency decreased to 11 9 at ph 5 8 tcacam decay could be divided into two stages rapid growth sulfite dosage 0 25 1 0 mm and slow growth sulfite dosage 1 0 4 0 mm the yield of eaq was controlled by sulfite dosage and the predict yield of eaq increased from 3 69 10 14 to 2 58 10 12 m with increasing the sulfite dosage from 0 25 to 4 0 mm by kintecus 6 80 which resulted in an increase in tcacam removal meanwhile the presence of dissolved oxygen do chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and humic acid ha posed negative influence on tcacam decomposition to various degrees dichloroacetamide dcacam trichloroacetic acid tcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa and cl were identified as intermediate products indicated that reductive dechlorination and hydrolysis coexisted during the degradation of tcacam in

will be made available on request 1 introduction waterborne pathogens such as viruses protozoa and other microorganisms pose an enduring threat to human health chen et al 2021 du et al 2021 tang et al 2020 in order to reduce diseases caused by waterborne pathogens drinking water disinfection process is employed to eliminate them sedlak and gunten 2011 bao et al 2012 however the undesirable disinfection by products dbps are occurred during the drinking water treatment nowadays over 800 dbps have been recognized and identified which include nitrogenous chlorinated carbonaceous brominated dbps bond et al 2011 fang et al 2021 among these dbps nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps have attracted considerable attention in view of their high potential ecological risk bond et al 2011 chen et al 2018 krasner et al 2006 shah and mitch 2012 trichloroacetamide tcacam a newly recognized unregulated n dbps which generally forms in lower amount than regulated dbps nihemaiti et al 2017 while relevant studies revealed that it showed two orders of magnitude higher cytotoxic and genotoxic in mammalian cell assays than regulated dbps li et al 2012 chu et al 2016 richardson et al 2007 besides tcacam can also induce hepatotoxicity and even results in metabolic disfunction by disrupting the metabolic function of the gut microbiota zhang et al 2015 deng et al 2014 thence it is necessary to eliminate tcacam from drinking water to safeguard drinking water pre disinfection removal of dbp precursors and post formation removal of dbps have become the crucial control technologies for dbps zhang et al 2020 it s reported that uv persulfate process prior to disinfection is capable of reducing the formation of haloacetamides hacams as well as other n dbps chu et al 2015 meanwhile many processes such as uv h2o2 uv persulfate which principle based on oxidation uv aops have been developed to tackle the post formation dbps e g brominated trihalomethanes brominated acetic acids chloroacetonitriles ling et al 2016 jo et al 2011 li et al 2022 however the trichlorinated dbps such as tcacam can be barely eliminated by uv aops due to the low reactive with ho chuang et al 2016 wang et al 2009 according to the polarity characteristics of tcacam chu et al 2016 luo et al 2015 advanced reduction processes arps is found to be an effective technology which can degrade the highly toxic halogenated organic compounds into low toxic organic compounds and halide ions luo et al 2015 milh et al 2021 the most commonly arps are uv sulfite so3 2 uv dithionite s2o4 2 uv iodide and uv benzoquinone uv sulfide s2 and uv ferrous iron gu et al 2017 liu et al 2013 yazdanbakhsh et al 2021 among these sulfite is the most popular choice due to its virtues of low cost and environmentally friendly weak mutagenic or other genotoxic effects rao et al 2021 in addition residual sulfite in water can be desalinized by aeration wu et al 2021 vuv can emit ultraviolet light with wavelength of 185 and 254 nm simultaneously compared with uv irradiation vuv has the advantages of hydrolysis and ionization directly to generate reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals ho hydrogen atoms h and hydrated electrons eaq eqs 1 2 gonzalez et al 2004 buxton et al 1988a due to the high energy photons production vuv is more capable for degrading chloroacetaldehyde trichloroacetic acid and haloacetonitriles than uv moussavi and rezaei 2017 gonzalez et al 2004 kiattisaksiri et al 2016 pan et al 2022 relevant literatures confirmed that the vuv sulfite process was superior to the uv sulfite process in degradation of haloacetic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate gu et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 therefore vuv sulfite may be a promising process for the abatement of tcacam however there is no report on tcacam decomposition by vuv sulfite process thus leaving some knowledge gaps to be filled 1 h 2 o hv hv 185 nm h ho φ 0 33 2 h 2 o hv hv 185 nm h ho e aq φ 0 045 in order to

diameter 15 mm lamps which were purchased from beijing aerospace hongda optoelectronics technology co ltd were used for the tcacam degradation 2 2 experimental procedures the photonic intensity was estimated to be 0 392 μeinstein s for the 254 nm uv and 0 063 μeinstein s for the 185 nm vuv respectively according to ki kio3 and the production rate of h2o2 methods li et al 2020 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 details for the determination of photon intensity at 254 and 185 nm were shown in text s1 and text s2 respectively the photoreactor was wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid the interference from other light sources the temperature was maintained at 25 c before starting the experiments the vuv and uv lamps were ignited and warmed up at least 30 min to guarantee the stable energy output unless otherwise noted the solution was purged with n2 at a pressure of 0 15 mpa to blow off the do from the water firstly 20 min and then continued to charge n2 to prevent oxygen from re entering and maintain the solution at low do concentration 1 mg l during the reaction 0 1 m phosphate buffer was introduced to adjust the solution initial ph 9 ml sample was withdrawn at a pre set time intervals 0 0 5 1 2 3 4 6 8 min for analysis 2 3 analytical methods 3 g anhydrous na2so4 and 3 ml mtbe were introduced into 9 ml sample and shaken by a circumferential oscillator ks 130 b ika

reactions based on reactive species in vuv sulfite process were summarized in table s1 and additional details of the model were provided in text s3 2 5 trapping of reactive species by electron paramagnetic resonance epr 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was adopted to capture reactive species which were generated in vuv or vuv sulfite process under n2 saturation conditions and by the epr spectrometer bruker emxnano liang et al 2021 the additions of sulfite and dmpo were 10 mm and 100 mm respectively in order to capture eaq more easily in the reactive species capture experiment the initial ph was adjusted to 9 2 unless otherwise noted the magnetic field modulation amplitude modulation frequency microwave frequency microwave power receiver gain number of detections and sweep time were set as 344 5 mt 2 g 100 khz 9 64 ghz 10 mw 40 3 30 s respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 degradation of tcacam by vuv sulfite process 3 1 1 degradation of tcacam using different reductants under vuv or uv irradiation different reductants can significantly affect the removal of pollutants by arps milh et al 2021 thus the degradation of tcacam using different reductants sulfite sulfide and ferrous iron under vuv or uv irradiation were investigated fig 2 fig 2 demonstrates that both reductants and vuv or uv were uncapable of abating tcacam effectively sulfite sulfide and ferrous iron only accounted for 4 9 1 6 and 0 8 of tcacam removal respectively meanwhile uv and vuv could achieve less than 15 0 degradation of tcacam however when different reductants irradiated under vuv or uv tcacam removal rates reached up to 85 6 or 78 0 in vuv or uv sulfite under the same condition the difference in degradation efficiency is mainly due to the generated reactive species with different reductive capabilities and the difference of optimal photolysis wavelength of reductants yu et al 2018 liu et al 2014 2013 sulfide can absorb uv lights resulting in the generation of excited state bisulfide ion hs with a redox potential e of 0 45 v yu et al 2018 melsheimer and schlögl 1997 besides uv irradiation of sulfite or ferrous iron produce eaq e 2 9 v while sulfite generates additional other reactive species such as h e 2 3 v and so3 e 0 8 v zhang et al 2022 airey and dainton 1966 the reduction ability of sulfite sulfide and ferrous iron are relatively weak which may be responsible for the poor tcacam removal song et al 2013 in addition vuv irradiation exhibited better tcacam degradation performance than uv irradiation at the same uv power 4 w which probably because the tcacam degradation under vuv is associated with direct photolysis by 185 254 nm and indirect photolysis by reactive species which was generated by vuv via hydrolysis directly gonzalez et al 2004 while under uv irradiation tcacam can be decomposed only by direct photolysis by 254 nm however the tcacam has a weak molar absorbance coefficient at 254 nm ε254 27 64 m 1 cm 1 detail information was provided in text s4 only 13 5 of tcacam removal was observed by vuv irradiation which was lower than that of monochloroacetic acid mcaa and dichloroacetonitrile dcan zhang et al 2022 wu et al 2020 two reasons may account for this phenomenon i low yield of eaq in vuv photolysis of h2o eqs 1 2 ii eaq is consumed by h2o to generate other reactive species e g ho h eqs 3 5 buxton et al 1988b with the addition of sulfite 1 mm the tcacam decomposition was greatly enhanced during the vuv or uv process because the photolysis of sulfite can generate an amount of reactive reductive species e g eaq h and so3 which are effective for the dehalogenation of compounds containing c x x f cl br i bonds li et al 2012 fischer and warneck 1996 yang et al 2013 3 e aq h 2 o h o h k 1 9 10 1 m 1 s 1 4 e aq ho o h k 3 0 10 10 m 1 s 1 5 e aq h h 2 o h k 2 5 10 10 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig s2 the degradation of tcacam during vuv uv sulfite and vuv sulfite processes followed pseudo first order kinetics well the first order rate constant k obs min 1 in vuv sulfite process was 0 24416 min 1 which was 14 3 and 1 3 folds greater than that in vuv and uv sulfite processes respectively the k obs during vuv irradiation was only 0 01705 min 1 which indicated that the generated reactive species in vuv sulfite process played a crucial role in the tcacam degradation accordingly vuv sulfite process is expected to be an alternative technology for the elimination of tcacam 3 1 2 contribution of reactive species and vuv uv to tcacam degradation in order to explore the reaction mechanism epr experiments were performed to detect the generated reactive species rs such as eaq h ho and so3 in vuv sulfite process and the results were shown in fig 3 a the weak dmpo adduct of ho dmpo ho was detected during vuv irradiation under anaerobic conditions while the eaq was not captured by dmpo which may be due to the low quantum yield of eaq in vuv process or its short lifetime fortunately the signals of eaq and so3 as indicated by dmpo h and dmpo so3 were obtained in vuv irradiation of n2 purged 10 mm sulfite solution at ph 9 2 and the dmpo h signal disappeared when 3 mm nano2 was introduced into the sulfite solution meanwhile quenching experiments were conducted to determine the contribution of these rs nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 can react rapidly with eaq eqs 6 7 while no3 reacts much more slowly with h than no2 eqs 8 9 li et al 2012 buxton et al 1988a b so no3 and no2 were selected as quenchers of eaq and h t butanol tba can quench ho with a rate constant of 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 eq 10 but it has a weak effect on eaq and h eqs 11 12 buxton et al 1988b 1988a wu et al 2020 thus it is crucial to determinate the suitable scavenger dosage in vuv sulfite process the calculation details about tba dosage were shown in text s5 according to the previous literature wu et al 2020 and the dosages of no3 and no2 were determined by chemical modeling software kintecus 6 80 fig 3b the results indicated that 1 mm tba could consume nearly 100 ho but only 1 3 eaq 300 μm no2 could consume 99 9 eaq and 100 h on the contrary 300 μm no3 could deplete 100 eaq while only 8 4 h 6 no 3 e aq no 3 2 k 9 7 10 9 m 1 s 1 7 no 2 e aq no 2 2 k 4 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 8 no 3 h n o 3 h k 1 4 10 6 m 1 s 1 9 no 2 h no o h k 7 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 10 c h 3 3 coh ho h 2 o c h 2 c h 3 2 coh k 6 0 10 8 m 1 s 1 11 c h 3 3 coh e aq c h 3 3 coh k 4 0 10 5 m 1 s 1 12 c h 3 3 coh h h 2 c h 2 c h 3 2 coh k 1 7 10 5 m 1 s 1 fig 3c shows the tcacam degradation by vuv sulfite process with different scavengers the addition of 1 mm tba could significantly enhance the degradation of tcacam from 85 6 to 94 8 to further demonstrate the role of ho the uv h2o2 process was adopted to degrade tcacam as shown in fig s5 the concentration of tcacam remained almost unchanged in the presence or absence of 1 mm tba which revealed that the contribution of ho to tcacam degradation could be ignored however the improvement of tcacam decomposition in the presence of tba during vuv sulfite process may be attributed to the fact that tba can prevent eaq from being consumed by ho eq 4 the introduction of no3 or no2 300 μm could decrease the removal of tcacam significantly and no2 exerted a greater negative effect than that of no3 which suggested that eaq and or h played an important role in tcacam degradation to further distinguish the contributions of eaq h uv vuv and other rs their relative contributions r were calculated via the pseudo first order rate constant table s2 in vuv sulfite process using the following equations 13 r e aq k obsvuv sulfite k obsno 3 k obsvuv sulfite 100 14 h k obsno 3 k obsno 2 k obsvuv sulfite 100 15 r uv k obsuv k obsvuv sulfite 100 16 r vuv and other rs 1 r e aq r h r uv the results were presented in fig 3d r eaq r h r uv and r vuv and other rs were determined to be 83 5 8 8 4 7 and 3 0 respectively the difference of r may be related to the redox potential of the reactive species which are ranked in order of their reducing capacity eaq e 2 9 v h e 2 3 v so3 e 0 8 v buxton et al 1988b compared with the degradation of monochloroacetic acid in vuv sulfite process by zhang et al similar r h was calculated in the same way while the r eaq was higher than that of them 61 1 zhang et al 2022 which might be due to the fact that ho did not contribute to the degradation of tcacam in this study the low value of r uv can be ascribed to the relatively weak molar absorbance coefficient of tcacam at 254 nm ε254 27 64 m 1 cm 1 in this study these results revealed that eaq was the dominant contributor to tcacam decomposition 3 1 3 second order rate constant between tcacam and eaq competitive kinetic method was employed to determine the second order rate constant between eaq and tcacam for further understanding the reaction mechanism trichloromethane tcm which has a known second order rate constant with eaq 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 wu et al 2020 was chosen as the probe compound for its similar structure with tcacam thus the second order rate constant of tcacam with eaq during uv sulfite process a process that created a good environment for eaq yu et al 2018 li et al 2012 could be calculated using the following equation 17 ln tcacam t tcacam 0 k tcacam e aq k tcm e aq ln tcm t tcm 0 where tcacam t and tcacam 0 are the real time concentration and the initial concentration of tcacam μg l tcm t and tcm 0 are the real time concentration and the initial concentration of tcm μg l k tcacam e aq and k tcm e aq are the second order rate constant of eaq with tcacam and tcm m 1 s 1 respectively as shown in fig s6 the k tcacam e aq was measured as 2 41 1010 m 1 s 1 this result was lower than that the second order rate constant of dcan with eaq 3 76 1010 m 1 s 1 using the same method wu et al 2020 the difference may be attributed to the fact that tcacam has one more c cl bond in its structure than dcan even though they are both n dbps 3 2 influence of main reaction parameters in vuv sulfite process 3 2 1 influence of initial ph ph is considered as a key parameter for sulfite activation which can affect the interaction between sulfite and target pollutions as well as the yields of reactive species wu et al 2021 as shown in fig 4 the effect of initial ph on tcacam degradation was investigated it can be seen from fig 4a that the degradation of tcacam increased from 11 9 to 100 when the initial ph increased from 5 8 to 9 2 it is well known that the existence forms of sulfite species e g so3 2 hso3 is highly ph dependent pka2 7 2 banayan esfahani and mohseni 2022 eldridge et al 2016 tartar and garretson 1941 so3 2 is the dominant sulfite species at ph 7 2 while hso3 occupies a predominant position in ph range of 2 0 7 0 so3 2 can be easily irradiated to generate eaq eq 18 under alkaline conditions because it has a higher molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield than hso3 eq 19 wu et al 2021 meanwhile the reactions of eaq with h and hso3 eqs 20 21 result in the decrease of eaq yield in vuv sulfite process under acidic conditions xiao et al 2017 ph can affect the generation of reactive species and thus affect the decomposition of tcacam to further explain the yields of reactive species the yields of eaq and h as a function of initial ph were simulated by kintecus 6 80 fig 4b as the ph increased from 1 0 to 12 0 the concentration of eaq increased from 1 46 10 18 to 2 54 10 12 m and then kept stability under alkaline conditions ph 9 0 12 0 however the concentration of h presented a downward tendency totally which decreased from 4 65 10 10 to 3 00 10 10 m slightly at first ph 1 0 6 0 and then dropped sharply to 5 15 10 15 m ph 12 0 noteworthy taking ph 7 0 as the cut off point eaq was the dominant reactive species at ph 7 0 while the high concentration of h was observed at ph 7 0 meanwhile the degradation efficiency of tcacam at ph 5 8 was only 11 9 which indirectly indicated that the contribution of h was much lower than that of eaq however further increasing ph from 9 2 to 11 0 only enhanced the decomposition of tcacam slightly which may be attributed to the fact that the quantum yield of eaq reaches the peak value of 2 54 10 12 m fig 4b in vuv sulfite process interestingly the removal of tcacam also achieved 85 6 under neutral conditions so the initial ph of the experiment was set at 7 0 to approximate the actual aquatic environment 18 so 3 2 hv so 3 e aq 19 hso 3 hv so 3 h k 2 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 20 h e aq h k 2 3 10 10 m 1 s 1 21 hso 3 e aq h so 3 2 k 2 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 3 2 2 influence of sulfite dosage the concentration of sulfite is crucial to the reductive degradation of contaminants during sulfite activation wu et al 2021 therefore the effect of sulfite dosage on tcacam degradation and the yields of eaq and h were investigated in vuv sulfite process fig 5 compared with vuv 13 5 solely the introduction of sulfite 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 mm could enlarge the degradation of tcacam 52 7 63 5 85 6 85 9 96 0 respectively in vuv sulfite process fig 5a obviously the tcacam decomposition efficiency significantly increased from 52 7 to 85 6 with increasing the sulfite dosage from 0 25 mm to 1 0 mm however when the sulfite dosage further increased to 2 0 mm and 4 0 mm the tcacam decomposition efficiency was only enhanced by 0 3 and 10 4 respectively compared to that of 1 0 mm sulfite the k obs increased from 0 09426 min 1 to 0 40232 min 1 when the sulfite dosage increased from 0 25 mm to 4 0 mm fig 5b shows that the tcacam decomposition can be divided into two stages rapid growth and slow growth which consistent with the study by zhang et al zhang et al 2022 the phenomenon may be related to the yield of eaq which was controlled by sulfite dosage at rapid growth stage the generated eaq is largely consumed to degrade tcacam while at slow growth stage the presence of more sulfite results in the generation of more eaq and so3 however the presence of high concentrations of eaq and so3 in the reaction solution may compete with tcacam for eaq eqs 22 23 fischer and warneck 1996 in addition eaq also may be consumed by sulfite eqs 24 25 zhang et al 2022 22 e aq so 3 so 3 2 23 e aq e aq h 2 2 o h k 5 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 24 e aq so 3 2 product k 1 3 10 6 m 1 s 1 25 e aq hso 3 h so 3 2 k 2 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 fig 5c indicates that the eaq yield increased from 0 to 2 58 10 12 m as sulfite dosage increased from 0 to 4 0 mm this further explains that the yield of eaq was controlled by sulfite dosage the conclusion is in accordance with the results of song et al in which the relative quasi stationary concentration of eaq was increased with increasing so3 2 concentration song et al 2013 noteworthy the kintecus 6 80 simulation results also demonstrated the existence of two phases fast and slow which was consistent with the experimental results fig 5b this also explains that sulfite dosage was the determining factor for controlling eaq generation unlike the eaq yield the concentration of h firstly increased to 1 02 10 10 m 0 0 75 mm and then decreased sharply to 3 51 10 17 m 0 75 4 0 mm with increasing sulfite dosage from 0 to 4 0 mm fig 5d which may be closely related to the depletion of h by the high concentration of eaq 0 75 4 mm eq 5 3 2 3 influence of dissolved oxygen do may exert a significant effect on the degradation of contaminants in vuv sulfite process cao et al 2021 the influence of do on tcacam decay was shown in fig 6 compared to that of 8 5 mg l without n2 purge the removal efficiency of tcacam decreased from 85 6 to 21 7 when the do concentration was lower than 1 mg l fig 6a do is an excellent scavenger of eaq and h which can react with eaq and h with rate constants of 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 and 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively eqs 26 27 wu et al 2021 do can not only convert eaq to the rather weakly reactive species o2 and ho2 but also reduces the available steady state concentrations of eaq and h that for tcacam degradation fig 6b predicts the yields of eaq and h as a function of do in vuv sulfite process which also supports the view that do can reduce the concentrations of reactive species the yields of eaq and h were gradually decreased as do increased in vuv sulfite process when do concentration was set at 8 0 mg l the concentrations of eaq and h were found to be 7 04 10 16 m and 1 39 10 18 m respectively which were 3 267 103 and 3 2 104 times lower than that of do 0 mg l 26 e aq o 2 o 2 k 1 9 10 10 m 1 s 1 27 h o 2 ho 2 k 1 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 3 2 4 influence of water matrix water is a mixture which consists of many components such as chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and dissolved organic matters dom wu et al 2021 it is reported that the presence of cl hco3 and dom may pose an impact on the performance of aops aprs nawaz et al 2017 cao et al 2021 gu et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 therefore the influence of cl hco3 and dom on tcacam degradation in vuv sulfite process were investigated fig 7 a 15 5 decline of tcacam degradation was observed in fig 7a at a cl concentration of 16 mm when compared with the absence of cl and the corresponding k obs decreased from 0 23932 min 1 to 0 14818 min 1 when the concentration of cl increased from 2 mm to 16 mm fig 7b cl has a high molar absorption coefficient of 3500 m 1 cm 1 at 185 nm zhang et al 2022 which can compete with sulfite for vuv light source furthermore the reaction between cl and eaq may be enhanced at high cl concentration and thus leading to a decrease in tcacam degradation nawaz et al 2017 the degradation of tcacam was also inhibited from 82 8 to 70 4 with increasing hco3 concentration from 0 5 mm to 4 mm fig 7c and d the inhibitory effect of hco3 on tcacam decay can be attributed to the fact that eaq is consumed by hco3 at a relatively slow second order rate constant of 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988b fig 7e f show that the decomposition of tcacam decreased from 85 6 to 32 1 and k obs decreased from 0 24416 min 1 to 0 04805 min 1 as ha concentration increased from 0 mg l to 8 mg l ha can induce the generation of ho 1o2 h2o2 and other reactive oxygen species through a series of chain reactions during vuv or uv irradiation dalrymple et al 2010 lester et al 2013 and these generated reactive oxygen species will quench eaq at different reaction rates in addition ha can also act as the optical filter to absorb uv light wang et al 2012 therefore shading effect and or quenching of eaq are caused by ha which may be account for inhibition effect on tcacam degradation in vuv sulfite process 3 3 intermediate products and mechanisms of tcacam decomposition by vuv sulfite process fig 8 shows the concentration variations of tcacam cl dichloroacetamide dcacam trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dichloroacetic acid dcaa during the tcacam degradation in vuv sulfite process as shown in fig 8a the theory and actual dechloriantion of tcacam were studied tcacam theory dechloriantion tcl tcl 3 tcacam t where tcacam t is the real time degradation concentration efficiency was always higher than actual dechloriantion acl efficiency which suggested that a certain of cl containing products were likely to generated in tcacam degradation process to confirm this hypothesis three intermediate products namely dcacam tcaa and dcaa were detected by gc ecd according to certified reference substances fig 8b respectively and the concentrations of intermediate products were also quantified the concentrations of dcacam and tcaa both firstly increased 0 20 26 μg l and 0 4 84 μg l with reaction time 0 2 min and 0 3 min and then decreased to 0 61 μg l and 2 21 μg l at the end of reaction 8 min whereas the dcaa concentration was only detected at the last sampling point the results revealed that reductive dechlorination and hydrolysis coexisted during the degradation of tcacam in vuv sulfite process which was consistent with results from previous researches chu et al 2016 chu et al 2009 however a significant difference existed between the concentrations sum of intermediate products the remain tcacam formed dcacam tcaa and dcaa and the initial tcacam concentration in which the concentrations sum of intermediate products was much lower than the initial tcacam concentration fig 8b moreover the undetectable of monochloroacetamide mcacam and mcaa showed that the dechlorination of tcacam or tcaa was incomplete and other products such as dcacam sulfonate might be generated during vuv sulfite process ding et al 2018 in view of the above results three possible degradation pathways of tcacam by vuv sulfite process were proposed in fig 8c i most of tcacam degradation comes from the attack of c cl bond by eaq and h to form dcacam and cl ii some tcacam is reduced to dcacam sulfonate and cl by so3 and then dcacam sulfonate quite slowly hydrolyses to form dcacam and so4 2 yiin et al 1987 ding et al 2018 haag and mill 2010 iii a small part of tcacam is converted to tcaa because of its own hydrolysis reaction chu et al 2009 then tcaa can be further reduced by eaq and h to form dcaa and cl 3 4 combined toxicity risk during tcacam decomposition by vuv sulfite process intermediate products including dcacam tcaa dcaa were detected during the degradation of tcacam by vuv sulfite process as reported tcacam dcacam tcaa and dcaa are a series of dbps with cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in drinking water table s3 and their combined toxicity values are 233 168 833 and 274 m 1 respectively table s3 plewa et al 2010 plewa et al 2008 to evaluate the toxic effect during tcacam decomposition by vuv sulfite process the combined toxicity risk value was calculated by eq 28 table s4 according to the previous research chu et al 2016 28 ctr v t ct v products c products t where ctrvt is the combined toxicity risk value at t reaction time min ctvproducts is the combined toxicity value m 1 of each detected intermediate product cproducts t is the intermediate product concentration nm at t reaction time min although the combined toxicity values of tcaa 833 m 1 and dcaa 274 m 1 were higher than tcacam 233 m 1 the combined toxicity risk value was still gradually decreased during the tcacam decomposition by vuv sulfite process fig s7 this may be attributed to the fact that the generated intermediate products were further degraded by vuv sulfite process and the degradation rate was higher than the production rate the results supported that vuv sulfite process could not only effectively degrade tcacam but also show favorable toxicity inhibition 4 conclusions the vuv sulfite process presented the best performance for tcacam removal eaq as one of the most reactive species played an important role in the tcacam decomposition the second order rate constant of eaq reacting with tcacam was determined to be 2 41 1010 m 1 s 1 do posed a negative effect on the degradation of tcacam which can be due to the fact that do can significantly consume eaq with the increase of ph and sulfite dosage the degradation efficiency of tcacam increased sharply which may be attributed to the fact that eaq is more stable under alkaline conditions and increasing sulfite dosage results in the rising of the eaq concentration the presence of ha obviously hindered tcacam degradation whereas cl and hco3 exhibited slight inhibition intermediate products including dcacam tcaa dcaa and cl were detected indicating that reductive dechlorination and hydrolysis coexisted during the degradation of tcacam in vuv sulfite process vuv sulfite process could not only decompose tcacam but also remove the formation of intermediate products and inhibit consequence on toxicity during the degradation of tcacam supporting its effective applicability in the drinking water treatment therefore vuv sulfite process is expected to be an alternative technology for the elimination of tcacam in drinking water credit authorship contribution statement huahan huang conceptualization data curation formal
