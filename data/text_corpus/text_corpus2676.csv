13380,azadirachta indica or neem is a natural plant commonly used in medicine and pesticides due to the useful compounds it contains this study aimed to determine the performance of neem leaves as a natural coagulant in the removal of turbidity total suspended solids tss and colour from real aquaculture effluent the experiment was conducted to determine the effect of mass ratio of the tss mg mass of coagulant mg on the removal of turbidity tss and colour in which the ratio is calculated based on the tss concentration as an index of aquaculture pollution the experiment was carried out with a ratio range of 0 1 to 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant and a total volume of 500 ml the operational conditions were fixed at 180 rpm and 3 min for rapid mixing 10 rpm and 20 min for slow mixing and settling time from 30 min to 60 min the results showed a turbidity removal of 82 7 tss removal of 81 37 and colour removal of 65 8 at an optimum ratio of 1000 and coagulant dosage of 0 3 mg l for comparison the performance of alum was also tested and showed higher turbidity tss and colour removals of 99 7 98 8 and 97 3 respectively based on the optimum ratio of 1 with a dosage of 362 7 mg l both coagulants showed a similar optimum settling time of 30 min from these results it is clearly seen that neem has a high potential for use as a coagulant indicating further exploration to optimize the extraction of active compounds from the leaves keywords coagulant colour leaves natural neem removal tss turbidity 1 introduction aquaculture is a growing industry estimated to produce 46 82 1 million metric tonnes of total global fish production and 52 of total fish produced goes directly for human consumption 2 17 the increase of aquaculture industry to meet the global demand can result negative impacts to the environment such as water pollution this is due to the presence of nitrogenous and phosphorus compounds and high chemical oxygen demand cod in aquaculture effluent 65 thus it could lead to eutrophication 35 60 but from the positive aspect these nitrogeous and phosphorus compounds can be harvested and converted into natural fertiliser 25 30 37 through wastewater treatment methods such as coagulation flocculation 13 38 47 66 phytoremediation 31 46 49 65 and filtration 26 64 in coagulation flocculation chemical coagulants have been widely and commonly applied to treat wastewater because of their effectiveness in reducing pollution parameters such as turbidity colour total suspended solids tss biological oxygen demand bod and cod conventional coagulants flocculants are derived from metal based compounds and are hazardous if consumed over longer periods and will affect human health which is linked to alzheimer s disease and senile dementia 38 58 thus natural coagulants are introduced as alternative coagulating agents to replace chemical coagulants there have been many studies utilising various types of plants and plant parts to explore the performance of natural coagulants in effluent treatment and to determine their potential to replace conventional coagulants plants including moringa oleifera 12 19 okra 41 45 banana 33 44 cassava 42 45 and acorn 5 54 have been used as natural coagulants in treating different types of wastewater and some have exhibited good performance in removing turbidity tss colour and cod most of the studies used simulated kaolin solution 3 5 54 and others applied them to real effluents such as palm oil mill effluent pome 41 dairy wastewater 45 soil water 12 river water 19 33 42 and paint effluent 32 with much research being conducted into natural coagulants yet there are still limited studies into the use of leaves as natural coagulants 9 44 most of the studies involved seeds since the results showed high removal activities 53 however leaves may also be useful as they still contain active compounds that may have potential in wastewater treatment 21 thus the aim of this study was to investigate the performance of neem leaves as a natural coagulant to treat aquaculture wastewater neem scientific name a indica from the mahogany family has been widely used as cure for disease in parts of asia and africa a indica is a common tree that can be found in countries such as malaysia sri lanka indonesia and parts of africa 6 29 due to its perceived miraculous activities it has been known as heal all village pharmacy a panacea for all diseases and also as nature s drugstore 24 various parts of the tree have been investigated to observe their potential advantages and have been studied in areas of medicine such as anticancer 1 23 62 and antibacterial 22 36 57 it has also been used as a pesticide in agriculture management 50 56 while in water and wastewater treatment neem has been explored to remove microbes bacteria 10 14 34 colour 8 20 heavy metals 8 16 43 and turbidity 4 44 52 in this study the ability of neem as coagulant to remove turbidity tss and colour was examined using a ratio defined as mass ratio mg tss per mg coagulant as a new approach instead of common application using dosage the mass ratio approach is based on selected pollution parameters and in this experiment the selected parameter was tss the performance of neem as coagulant was compared with commonly used coagulant aluminium sulphate alum in treating aquaculture wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of aquaculture effluent the aquaculture wastewater was collected in a district of labu negeri sembilan malaysia where small to medium scale aquaculture is carried out for the local market table 1 lists the characteristics of the aquaculture wastewater based on the initial data from table 1 most of the aquaculture characteristics exceeded the levels of tss colour and ammonia as stipulated in the malaysian environmental quality of industrial effluent regulations 2009 for both standard a and standard b standard a refers to any effluent discharged upstream of a water supply intake and standard b refers to effluent discharged downstream 15 the tss in the aquaculture effluent with a value of 247 7 mg l was above both standards a and b of 50 and 100 mg l respectively while for the colour parameter the effluent contained an extremely high colour of 1310 7 admi compared to standard levels of 100 admi standard a and 200 admi standard b for ammonia its concentration is around 24 5 mg l which did not superceed standard b 20 mg l very much but yet greatly exceeds standard a 10 mg l the high levels of these parameters in the aquaculture wastewater might be due to rich nutrients resulting from uneaten food and fish excrement 2 2 2 preparation of natural coagulant for the experiment neem leaves were selected for use as natural coagulant the leaves were collected from bangi selangor malaysia dried in an oven 1370 gx shel lab usa at 40 c for 72 h and then crushed into powder 38 μm using a mechanical blender panasonic malaysia to prepare the solution stock of neem coagulant the powder was weighed and mixed with distilled water stirred for 30 min to ensure the mixture was mixed homogeneously filtered using 10 μm filter paper double rings china and kept in duran bottles before being used for the jar test experiments 2 3 jar test experimental runs for the jar test experiment to each of five 500 ml beakers iwaki germany were added 450 ml of aquaculture wastewater and 50 ml of neem coagulant tss is selected as an index for the aquaculture pollution to determine the ratio value used in this experiment the ratio is defined as the mass ratio of tss and

and colour for determination of the effect of settling time on the turbidity removal activity a range of 30 60 min was selected 32 33 63 after 30 min settling a 25 ml sample of supernatant was withdrawn at a point 5 cm below the surface for analysis of turbidity tss and colour removal the settling time was later varied from 30 to 45 and 60 min to investigate the pattern of removal activity with increase in settling time 2 4 statistical analysis using anova the statistical package for the social sciences spss or ibm spss statistics is a software tool for statistical analysis of from data

anova was used to compare the investigated groups of plant based and metal based coagulants in the removal of turbidity tss and colour and to determine those were statistically significantly different from each other or not post hoc test using turkey hsd was carried out to find the significant differences in the results 40 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mass ratio on reduction of pollution parameters 3 1 1 turbidity removal to study the effect of dosage of neem leaves coagulant on turbidity removal the experiment was run based on the ratio as calculated in eq 1 and the performance was compared with alum the different mass ratios had established a good result for neem coagulant as seen in fig 1 in which the increase in the mass ratio with lower coagulant mass contributed to increased turbidity removal the result indicated over 50 removal turbidity with the applied ratio from 0 1 up to 1000 with removal of 78 9 82 7 statistically the ratio increase showed a significant positive removal turbidity of up to 4 with ratios of 0 1 to 10 mg tss per mg coagulant but further increases in the ratio from 10 to 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant had no significant effect on removal activity based on eq 1 the highest removal was obtained at 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant with 82 7 for the turbidity removal which required only 0 3 mg l of coagulant dosage and 0 2 mg for the mass of neem with the shown result the optimum ratio was selected at 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant both low mass and dosage of coagulant are selected as the optimum point but still could attain the same turbidity removal as the mass and dosage were increased up to 15 4 mg and 30 8 mg l respectively with alum as metal coagulant the turbidity removal reacted very positively with turbidity removal from aquaculture wastewater with an efficiency of 90 the mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant showed significant differences from the others with a removal of 99 7 alum mass used 181 4 mg with coagulant dosage 362 7 mg l followed by mass ratios of 10 and 0 1 mg tss per mg coagulant with 98 3 removal coagulant mass and dosage of 18 1 mg and 36 3 mg l respectively 96 3 coagulant mass and dosage of 1813 5 mg and 3627 mg l respectively and ratios of 100 and 1000 with 90 6 removal coagulant mass and dosage of 1 8 mg at 3 6 mg l and 0 2 mg at 0 4 mg l respectively thus the optimum condition obtained for alum was a mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant a few previous studies have used neem as natural coagulant in removing turbidity from municipal wastewater 44 and domestic wastewater 52 which reported that in municipal wastewater a turbidity removal of around 43 9 was achieved with a dosage of 1000 mg l while for domestic wastewater 55 removal was accomplished with a dosage of 15 ml l 3 1 2 tss removal on the aspect of tss removal based on the ratio the results revealed that the efficiency of tss removal was increased with the increase in the ratio fig 2 the tss removal reached 81 4 with a mass ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant which was increased significantly from 75 8 at a mass ratio of 0 1 mg tss per mg coagulant from 0 1 to 100 mg tss per mg coagulant the finding indicated significant differences in tss removal but when the ratio was increased from 100 to 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant the removal activity showed no significant different in tss removal indicating that the condition has been met at a ratio of 100 mg tss per mg coagulant however with consideration of low dosage and the low mass coagulant used 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant was selected as the optimum point for tss removal with a removal activity at 81 4 at a dosage of 0 3 mg l with mass of coagulant used of 0 2 mg for alum the findings were consistent with those from the turbidity removal in which a high removal activity of 98 8 was achieved at the ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant coagulant dosage and mass used of 362 7 mg l and 181 4 mg respectively even at the lowest dosage 0 4 mgl and mass of 0 2 mg at a mass ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant alum managed to reduce around 89 1 of tss and showed better performance than the neem coagulant even though neem coagulant showed a lower removal activity than alum it was still able to remove turbidity at a low coagulant dosage compared to alum which can be considered as environmentally friendly coagulant maurya and daverey 44 also investigated the performance of neem leaves in tss removal and reported a removal activity of around 35 8 at 400 mg l dosage in which the removal in this experiment was higher compared to the finding reported by maurya and daverey 44 3 1 3 colour removal the results for colour removal are shown in fig 3 the removal also showed increase with the increase in the ratio within the range of 47 9 to 66 2 the neem coagulant has a yellowish colour which was intensified with the increase in coagulant dosage or coagulant mass which contributed directly to the colour of the aquaculture wastewater based on the data reported in fig 3 the colour was successfully reduced at high ratios compared to low ratios at 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant an estimated 0 2 mg of neem was used to remove 65 8 and this mass increased with the decrease in the ratio to 0 1 at 1537 5 mg which removed around 47 9 the result indicated optimum point was achieved at a mass ratio of 100 mg tss per mg coagulant with 66 2 removal but showed no statistically significant difference when the ratio increased to 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant however from the lower mass ratio below 100 mg tss per mg coagulant the significant difference was more obvious nevertheless the optimum point of colour removal could be selected at a ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant due to the low dosage used 0 3 mg l for the alum performance a mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant was selected as the optimum ratio as the experiment showed a significant difference in colour removal compared to the others a reduction of around 97 3 at a dosage of 362 7 mg l coagulant mass used 181 4 mg followed by the mass ratios of 10 0 1 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant for colour removal previous studies have been conducted using different types of plants such as surjana and maize 48 okra 18 and ocimum basilicum 55 in these studies the colour removal obtained was 98 0 at a dosage of 25 mg l surjana 89 4 at 25 mg l maize 93 6 at 3 2 mg l okra and 68 5 at 16 mg l ocimum basilicum even though the colour removal by neem coagulant is considered low compared to the reports in the literature it still has potential due to the low dosage used for the colour removal obtained and the possibilities of further optimisation 3 2 effect of settling time on the efficiency of pollution parameter reduction 3 2 1 turbidity removal based on the result as displayed in fig 4 the findings indicated that the settling time had no effect on the increase in turbidity removal at the mass ratios of 10 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant based on the statistics there was no significant difference in turbidity removal from 30 min 82 4 82 7 and 82 7 respectively to 60 min 84 6 84 9 and 84 6 respectively for the mass ratios of 10 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant however at the low ratios of 0 1 and 1 mg tss per mg coagulant the results showed a positive increase in turbidity removal from an estimated 78 9 turbidity removal to 81 7 and 82 7 at 45 and 60 min at the ratio 0 1 mg tss per mg coagulant at the mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant the removal increased from 81 2 30 min to 83 1 45 min and eventually attained 84 1 60 min and the increased settling time resulted in significant differences in removal activity the removal at the high ratios of 10 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant consumed low masses of coagulant compared to at the ratios of 0 1 and 1 with ranges 0 2 1 5 mg and 15 4 153 8 mg respectively due to this mass of coagulant used the optimum settling time was selected at 30 min for neem as increasing settling time would require large amounts of coagulant which would directly impact the cost as for alum the turbidity was removed efficiently at over than 90 at 30 min fr settling time with the highest removal of 99 96 obtained at the mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant when the settling time was increased from 45 to 60 min no significant differences between the mass ratios were seen except at 45 and 60 min at the high ratios of 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant where the removal activity increased from 90 6 at 30 min for both 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant to 92 6 45 min for both ratios eventually reaching 93 2 100 mg tss per mg coagulant and 93 3 1000 mg tss pr mg coagulant at 60 min respectively hence the optimum settling time for alum was selected at 30 min alum coagulant mass used 181 4 mg hussain et al 27 investigated settling from 1 h up to 4 h with 1 h intervals where at the first hour the maximum turbidity removal obtained was 64 67 which decreased intensely in the subsequent hour rahim et al 51 used cassava peel starch as natural coagulant to investigate the effect of settling time from 10 to 120 min where they showed that the turbidity removal efficiency obtained after 30 min of settling time indicated that the longer the settling time the more turbidity can be removed 7 51 both studies showed that the minimum settling time to obtain good turbidity removal is 30 60 min this is accordance with our study using neem the optimum settling time was selected at 45 min to achieve high turbidity removal 3 2 2 tss removal based on the data presented in fig 5 tss removal reached the optimum condition at a settling time of 30 min due to no significant increase in tss removal with at settling times of 45 and 60 min at 30 min the high removal of 81 37 was obtained at the ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant however for the ratio of 0 1 mg tss per mg coagulant the high removal was obtained at 60 min settling time increasing from 75 8 30 min to 80 0 60 min yet this ratio cannot be considered as optimum due to the use of a high mass of coagulant of 1537 5 mg for alum the results were the same as for turbidity removal removal was 98 8 at 30 min with the selected ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant compared to the other alum ratios hence there was no reason to extend the settling time longer to 60 min to obtain high removal ats other mass ratio thus for alum the optimum settling time for tss removal was also selected to be 30 min which was consistent with that for turbidity removal 3 2 3 colour removal as neem coagulant is made from the leaves the colour of the leaves will affect directly the performance of the coagulant in treating the colour of the aquaculture water as the coagulant itself increases from yellowish to dark green with the amount of coagulant used based on the findings the colour of the effluent removal managed to be reduced by 47 68 however the effect of a longer settling time from 45 and 60 min showed no significant difference in colour reduction in the data presented fig 6 for that reason a settling time of 30 min was already sufficient and could be considered as the optimum as at the mass ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant neem coagulant successfully reduced colour to 65 8 as for alum which is colourless a clear solution it achieved very good results with efficient colour removal of above 80 with the highest removal of 97 3 obtained at a mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant and did not require a longer settling time for the colour treatment process thus for alum the optimum settling time selected was 30 min 4 evaluation of production cost and challenges for natural coagulant application table 2 summarizes the findings based on the experimental runs for the turbidity tss and colour removal from the aquaculture wastewater treatment the data demonstrate the optimum ratio for neem and alum coagulants with each dosage and mass used to achieve the percentage of removal activities for 500 ml effluent table 3 compares the cost evaluation for coagulation process using neem and alum the estimated coagulant cost is usd0 2 kg and usd1 5 kg for neem and alum respectively based on the data provided by thirugnanasambandam and karri 2021 for neem cost evaluation the process starts from raw material collection followed by cleaning and drying process of neem leaves in an oven to eliminate contaminants e g grains and completely dry extraction of active compounds using water and finally the implementation of coagulation flocculation process which acquire around 73 4 h for complete end to end process while for alum as the coagulant is well established and readily available in in powder form for directly application in the treatment process thus only required around 1 38 h for end to end process based on the data listed in table 3 the cost for neem application as coagulant is estimated to be usd586 77 kg tss compared to alum which is significantly lower with only usd12 31 kg tss the cost is calculated based on per kg tss since tss is fixed as the measured index as mentioned earlier even the cost due to the application of neem as coagulant is expensive it is potential to be significantly reduced by shortening the drying process duration also research on extraction process of contributing active compounds from natural coagulants are still at research stage and yet to be developed and optimized hasan et al 2021 which is still time consuming and directly incurring cost on contrast alum in powder form can be purchased for direct use apart from high cost one of good attributes of using neem is its environmentally friendly secondary sludge produced after the coagulation flocculation process since it originates from natural resources and will have no detrimental impact on the environment upon disposal and yet it can be manipulated as biofertilizer or soil conditioner for agro industry application 2 39 it is considered very safe compared to alum which can leave irreversible negative impact to the ecosystem due to its metal content to conclude the cost evaluation is a rough estimation based on the jar test scale experiment at early stage a thorough analysis on various affecting factors is still required for optimization process in which the outcomes could be possible to alter the cost evaluation 5 conclusions the present study indicates that neem leaves can be used as natural coagulant for aquaculture wastewater treatment for the removal activities of turbidity tss and colour it managed to remove 82 7 81 4 and 65 8 of turbidity tss and colour respectively at an optimum ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant with a dosage used at 0 3 mg l and coagulant mass at 0 2 mg while for alum the respective removals for turbidity tss and colour were achieved at 99 7 98 8 and 97 3 with an optimum ratio at 1 mg tss per mg coagulant requiring a dosage of 362 7 mg l and coagulant mass of 181 4 mg for the settling time both alum and neem coagulants required an optimum time of 30 min since no significant effect to the removal activities at longer settling time although the performance of neem showed lower removal activities compared to alum at the selected optimum ratio but neem still attained over 50 for the removals and still can be improved with further study the resultant sludge after using neem as the coagulant is safer it originates from plant and even the produced sludge can be further explored to be used as biofertilizer or soil conditioner for agro industry for future study it is suggested to optimize on the drying and extraction process for neem preparation for cost reduction other factors such as speed and duration for rapid or slow mixing as well as ph that can influence coagulation flocculation process by neem leaves as coagulant can be thoroughly investigated to attain maximum removal of pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

anova was used to compare the investigated groups of plant based and metal based coagulants in the removal of turbidity tss and colour and to determine those were statistically significantly different from each other or not post hoc test using turkey hsd was carried out to find the significant differences in the results 40 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of mass ratio on reduction of pollution parameters 3 1 1 turbidity removal to study the effect of dosage of neem leaves coagulant on turbidity removal the experiment was run based on the ratio as calculated in eq 1 and the performance was compared with alum the different mass ratios had established a good result for neem coagulant as seen in fig 1 in which the increase in the mass ratio with lower coagulant mass contributed to increased turbidity removal the result indicated over 50 removal turbidity with the applied ratio from 0 1 up to 1000 with removal of 78 9 82 7 statistically the ratio increase showed a significant positive removal turbidity of up to 4 with ratios of 0 1 to 10 mg tss per mg coagulant but further increases in the ratio from 10 to 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant had no significant effect on removal activity based on eq 1 the highest removal was obtained at 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant with 82 7 for the turbidity removal which required only 0 3 mg l of coagulant dosage and 0 2 mg for the mass of neem with the shown result the optimum ratio was selected at 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant both low mass and dosage of coagulant are selected as the optimum point but still could attain the same turbidity removal as the mass and dosage were increased up to 15 4 mg and 30 8 mg l respectively with alum as metal coagulant the turbidity removal reacted very positively with turbidity removal from aquaculture wastewater with an efficiency of 90 the mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant showed significant differences from the others with a removal of 99 7 alum mass used 181 4 mg with coagulant dosage 362 7 mg l followed by mass ratios of 10 and 0 1 mg tss per mg coagulant with 98 3 removal coagulant mass and dosage of 18 1 mg and 36 3 mg l respectively 96 3 coagulant mass and dosage of 1813 5 mg and 3627 mg l respectively and ratios of 100 and 1000 with 90 6 removal coagulant mass and dosage of 1 8 mg at 3 6 mg l and 0 2 mg at 0 4 mg l respectively thus the optimum condition obtained for alum was a mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant a few previous studies have used neem as natural coagulant in removing turbidity from municipal wastewater 44 and domestic wastewater 52 which reported that in municipal wastewater a turbidity removal of around 43 9 was achieved with a dosage of 1000 mg l while for domestic wastewater 55 removal was accomplished with a dosage of 15 ml l 3 1 2 tss removal on the aspect of tss removal based on the ratio the results revealed that the efficiency of tss removal was increased with the increase in the ratio fig 2 the tss removal reached 81 4 with a mass ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant which was increased significantly from 75 8 at a mass ratio of 0 1 mg tss per mg coagulant from 0 1 to 100 mg tss per mg coagulant the finding indicated significant differences in tss removal but when the ratio was increased from 100 to 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant the removal activity showed no significant different in tss removal indicating that the condition has been met at a ratio of 100 mg tss per mg coagulant however with consideration of low dosage and the low mass coagulant used 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant was selected as the optimum point for tss removal with a removal activity at 81 4 at a dosage of 0 3 mg l with mass of coagulant used of 0 2 mg for alum the findings were consistent with those from the turbidity removal in which a high removal activity of 98 8 was achieved at the ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant coagulant dosage and mass used of 362 7 mg l and 181 4 mg respectively even at the lowest dosage 0 4 mgl and mass of 0 2 mg at a mass ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant alum managed to reduce around 89 1 of tss and showed better performance than the neem coagulant even though neem coagulant showed a lower removal activity than alum it was still able to remove turbidity at a low coagulant dosage compared to alum which can be considered as environmentally friendly coagulant maurya and daverey 44 also investigated the performance of neem leaves in tss removal and reported a removal activity of around 35 8 at 400 mg l dosage in which the removal in this experiment was higher compared to the finding reported by maurya and daverey 44 3 1 3 colour removal the results for colour removal are shown in fig 3 the removal also showed increase with the increase in the ratio within the range of 47 9 to 66 2 the neem coagulant has a yellowish colour which was intensified with the increase in coagulant dosage or coagulant mass which contributed directly to the colour of the aquaculture wastewater based on the data reported in fig 3 the colour was successfully reduced at high ratios compared to low ratios at 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant an estimated 0 2 mg of neem was used to remove 65 8 and this mass increased with the decrease in the ratio to 0 1 at 1537 5 mg which removed around 47 9 the result indicated optimum point was achieved at a mass ratio of 100 mg tss per mg coagulant with 66 2 removal but showed no statistically significant difference when the ratio increased to 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant however from the lower mass ratio below 100 mg tss per mg coagulant the significant difference was more obvious nevertheless the optimum point of colour removal could be selected at a ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant due to the low dosage used 0 3 mg l for the alum performance a mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant was selected as the optimum ratio as the experiment showed a significant difference in colour removal compared to the others a reduction of around 97 3 at a dosage of 362 7 mg l coagulant mass used 181 4 mg followed by the mass ratios of 10 0 1 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant for colour removal previous studies have been conducted using different types of plants such as surjana and maize 48 okra 18 and ocimum basilicum 55 in these studies the colour removal obtained was 98 0 at a dosage of 25 mg l surjana 89 4 at 25 mg l maize 93 6 at 3 2 mg l okra and 68 5 at 16 mg l ocimum basilicum even though the colour removal by neem coagulant is considered low compared to the reports in the literature it still has potential due to the low dosage used for the colour removal obtained and the possibilities of further optimisation 3 2 effect of settling time on the efficiency of pollution parameter reduction 3 2 1 turbidity removal based on the result as displayed in fig 4 the findings indicated that the settling time had no effect on the increase in turbidity removal at the mass ratios of 10 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant based on the statistics there was no significant difference in turbidity removal from 30 min 82 4 82 7 and 82 7 respectively to 60 min 84 6 84 9 and 84 6 respectively for the mass ratios of 10 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant however at the low ratios of 0 1 and 1 mg tss per mg coagulant the results showed a positive increase in turbidity removal from an estimated 78 9 turbidity removal to 81 7 and 82 7 at 45 and 60 min at the ratio 0 1 mg tss per mg coagulant at the mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant the removal increased from 81 2 30 min to 83 1 45 min and eventually attained 84 1 60 min and the increased settling time resulted in significant differences in removal activity the removal at the high ratios of 10 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant consumed low masses of coagulant compared to at the ratios of 0 1 and 1 with ranges 0 2 1 5 mg and 15 4 153 8 mg respectively due to this mass of coagulant used the optimum settling time was selected at 30 min for neem as increasing settling time would require large amounts of coagulant which would directly impact the cost as for alum the turbidity was removed efficiently at over than 90 at 30 min fr settling time with the highest removal of 99 96 obtained at the mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant when the settling time was increased from 45 to 60 min no significant differences between the mass ratios were seen except at 45 and 60 min at the high ratios of 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant where the removal activity increased from 90 6 at 30 min for both 100 and 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant to 92 6 45 min for both ratios eventually reaching 93 2 100 mg tss per mg coagulant and 93 3 1000 mg tss pr mg coagulant at 60 min respectively hence the optimum settling time for alum was selected at 30 min alum coagulant mass used 181 4 mg hussain et al 27 investigated settling from 1 h up to 4 h with 1 h intervals where at the first hour the maximum turbidity removal obtained was 64 67 which decreased intensely in the subsequent hour rahim et al 51 used cassava peel starch as natural coagulant to investigate the effect of settling time from 10 to 120 min where they showed that the turbidity removal efficiency obtained after 30 min of settling time indicated that the longer the settling time the more turbidity can be removed 7 51 both studies showed that the minimum settling time to obtain good turbidity removal is 30 60 min this is accordance with our study using neem the optimum settling time was selected at 45 min to achieve high turbidity removal 3 2 2 tss removal based on the data presented in fig 5 tss removal reached the optimum condition at a settling time of 30 min due to no significant increase in tss removal with at settling times of 45 and 60 min at 30 min the high removal of 81 37 was obtained at the ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant however for the ratio of 0 1 mg tss per mg coagulant the high removal was obtained at 60 min settling time increasing from 75 8 30 min to 80 0 60 min yet this ratio cannot be considered as optimum due to the use of a high mass of coagulant of 1537 5 mg for alum the results were the same as for turbidity removal removal was 98 8 at 30 min with the selected ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant compared to the other alum ratios hence there was no reason to extend the settling time longer to 60 min to obtain high removal ats other mass ratio thus for alum the optimum settling time for tss removal was also selected to be 30 min which was consistent with that for turbidity removal 3 2 3 colour removal as neem coagulant is made from the leaves the colour of the leaves will affect directly the performance of the coagulant in treating the colour of the aquaculture water as the coagulant itself increases from yellowish to dark green with the amount of coagulant used based on the findings the colour of the effluent removal managed to be reduced by 47 68 however the effect of a longer settling time from 45 and 60 min showed no significant difference in colour reduction in the data presented fig 6 for that reason a settling time of 30 min was already sufficient and could be considered as the optimum as at the mass ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant neem coagulant successfully reduced colour to 65 8 as for alum which is colourless a clear solution it achieved very good results with efficient colour removal of above 80 with the highest removal of 97 3 obtained at a mass ratio of 1 mg tss per mg coagulant and did not require a longer settling time for the colour treatment process thus for alum the optimum settling time selected was 30 min 4 evaluation of production cost and challenges for natural coagulant application table 2 summarizes the findings based on the experimental runs for the turbidity tss and colour removal from the aquaculture wastewater treatment the data demonstrate the optimum ratio for neem and alum coagulants with each dosage and mass used to achieve the percentage of removal activities for 500 ml effluent table 3 compares the cost evaluation for coagulation process using neem and alum the estimated coagulant cost is usd0 2 kg and usd1 5 kg for neem and alum respectively based on the data provided by thirugnanasambandam and karri 2021 for neem cost evaluation the process starts from raw material collection followed by cleaning and drying process of neem leaves in an oven to eliminate contaminants e g grains and completely dry extraction of active compounds using water and finally the implementation of coagulation flocculation process which acquire around 73 4 h for complete end to end process while for alum as the coagulant is well established and readily available in in powder form for directly application in the treatment process thus only required around 1 38 h for end to end process based on the data listed in table 3 the cost for neem application as coagulant is estimated to be usd586 77 kg tss compared to alum which is significantly lower with only usd12 31 kg tss the cost is calculated based on per kg tss since tss is fixed as the measured index as mentioned earlier even the cost due to the application of neem as coagulant is expensive it is potential to be significantly reduced by shortening the drying process duration also research on extraction process of contributing active compounds from natural coagulants are still at research stage and yet to be developed and optimized hasan et al 2021 which is still time consuming and directly incurring cost on contrast alum in powder form can be purchased for direct use apart from high cost one of good attributes of using neem is its environmentally friendly secondary sludge produced after the coagulation flocculation process since it originates from natural resources and will have no detrimental impact on the environment upon disposal and yet it can be manipulated as biofertilizer or soil conditioner for agro industry application 2 39 it is considered very safe compared to alum which can leave irreversible negative impact to the ecosystem due to its metal content to conclude the cost evaluation is a rough estimation based on the jar test scale experiment at early stage a thorough analysis on various affecting factors is still required for optimization process in which the outcomes could be possible to alter the cost evaluation 5 conclusions the present study indicates that neem leaves can be used as natural coagulant for aquaculture wastewater treatment for the removal activities of turbidity tss and colour it managed to remove 82 7 81 4 and 65 8 of turbidity tss and colour respectively at an optimum ratio of 1000 mg tss per mg coagulant with a dosage used at 0 3 mg l and coagulant mass at 0 2 mg while for alum the respective removals for turbidity tss and colour were achieved at 99 7 98 8 and 97 3 with an optimum ratio at 1 mg tss per mg coagulant requiring a dosage of 362 7 mg l and coagulant mass of 181 4 mg for the settling time both alum and neem coagulants required an optimum time of 30 min since no significant effect to the removal activities at longer settling time although the performance of neem showed lower removal activities compared to alum at the selected optimum ratio but neem still attained over 50 for the removals and still can be improved with further study the resultant sludge after using neem as the coagulant is safer it originates from plant and even the produced sludge can be further explored to be used as biofertilizer or soil conditioner for agro industry for future study it is suggested to optimize on the drying and extraction process for neem preparation for cost reduction other factors such as speed and duration for rapid or slow mixing as well as ph that can influence coagulation flocculation process by neem leaves as coagulant can be thoroughly investigated to attain maximum removal of pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

rich wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords heterotrophic nitrification simultaneous nitrification and denitrification kinetics analysis denitrification pathway aggregation performance 1 introduction generally industrial and agricultural production will produce a large amount of high strength nitrogenous wastewater however traditional biological denitrification that needs larger infrastructure areas generally leads to high operating costs and system instability 1 although massive new denitrification technologies have recently emerged such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox short cut nitrification and denitrification simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd but there are still some limitations 2 4 with the improvement of environmental microbiology abundant heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria hnb have increasingly drawn widespread attention due to their excellent cell proliferation and activity slight requirements for dissolved oxygen do strong tolerance to acidic environments and efficient denitrification capacity 5 8 according to the recent detection and description of an increasing number of hnb with different characteristics 7 9 some have a great ability of heterotrophic nitrification some are capable of aerobic denitrification 10 11 and others reportedly can accumulate phosphorus in an effective way 6 12 at present the hnb research has mainly focused on nitrogen removal efficiency intermediate products and optimal reaction conditions however the metabolic mechanism and pathway of heterotrophic nitrification have not been entirely clear up to now it is widely believed that hnb oxidized nh4 n to no2 n and no3 n and converted into gaseous nitrogen subsequently 7 while other researchers believe hydroxylamine nh2oh can be directly oxidized to n2o and n2 13 14 besides some studies have shown that the effective removal of nitrogen by hnb is the result of the microbial assimilation 15 furthermore reportedly n2 was generally detected during heterotrophic nitrification process by hnb 1 and the greenhouse gas n2o was also significantly accumulated by some other strains 16 17 nevertheless due to its wide varieties complex functions and characteristics a comprehensive and in depth study is urgently needed to improve the mechanism and pathway theory of hnb the aggregation of microbial cells is an indispensable part of applying pure bacteria to wastewater treatment and can provide a theoretical basis for the formation of sludge flocs and biofilms in practical applications currently only a few scholars have studied the aggregation properties of hnb 18 19 its auto aggregation ability and correlation with extracellular polymeric substances eps have been preliminarily discovered but there is no detailed discussion on the flocculation performance of hnb during the reactor operation furthermore research on denitrification of hnb has mostly focused on culture in erlenmeyer flasks rather than on its practical operation in a reactor and its application in nitrogenous wastewater 5 20 the existing reactor enhancement is mainly to inoculate functional bacteria into activated sludge but previous bioaugmentation generally have short duration and unstable efficiency 21 studies have shown that the sludge flocs formed by the enrichment of pure bacteria can ensure the stability of functional microorganisms thereby making the treatment efficiency more durable 8 22 however compared with the attention to the treatment effect few discussions have been held on the enrichment of pure bacteria in terms of floc formation and flora abundance therefore it is necessary to evaluate the potential of hnb in engineering applications from the aspects of microbial flocculation capacity compositions of eps nutrient removal and microbial community in the enhanced activated sludge system previously the strain yl has been isolated from activated sludge and identified as p aeruginosa besides the efficiency of nitrogen degradation and the activities of the key enzymes hao nr and nir also proved the isolate with a capability of high efficient heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification hn ad 23 however its metabolic pathway flocculation characteristics and application potential are still unclear in this paper the metabolic pathway and the kinetic characteristics of strain yl were further clarified through the research on the conversion process of different nitrogen sources and ammoxidation characteristic simulated by the gompertz model under different environment conditions additionally its flocculation performance was analyzed by discussing the variation of flocculating ability fa relative hydrophobicity rh zeta potential and eps components during the cultivation furthermore its enrichment culture formation of microbial flocs as well as nutrient removal in a sequencing batch reactor sbr were investigated to evaluate its value in treating ammonia nitrogenous

discussion 3 1 heterotrophic ammonium removal under different nh4 n levels four nh4 n concentrations 100 200 500 1000 mg l were investigated to elucidate the heterotrophic nitrification capacity of strain yl as shown in fig 1 the isolate grew normally under different concentrations with the maximum od600 of 1 38 1 82 1 90 and 1 49 respectively moreover a brief 3 h adaptation was observed at 100 mg l compared with more than 6 h at other concentrations besides the maximal specific growth rate gradually increased from 0 18 to 0 25 h 1 with the rise of nh4 n within 500 mg l but fell to 0 20 h 1 at 1000 mg l nh4 n in addition nh4 n and tn were almost completely degraded at low concentrations but the removal efficiency dropped to about 50 at high concentrations it is speculated that excessive free ammonia inhibited the metabolic activity of strain yl under high nh4 n conditions 29 30 the intermediate products were detected at different nh4 n concentrations obviously the accumulation of nh2oh was observed under the high nh4 n loads with the maximum of 49 08 and 58 15 mg l respectively however the small impact of high nh2oh on the growth and ammoxidation process of yl was contrary to the studies of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 31 besides the accumulation of no2 n was undetectable during the whole process only a small amount of no3 n accumulated at high nh4 n concentrations in combination with the high nh4 n removal ability the slight formation of nitrification intermediates was superior to some previous hnb 7 32 indicating great potential of strain yl in treating high ammonia nitrogen wastewater 3 2 ammonium degradation kinetics of strain yl the utilization of nh4 n under different carbon sources are shown in fig 2 a the optimal carbon source was sodium succinate followed by sodium acetate and sodium citrate after 36 h the maximal nh4 n removal efficiency reached 98 80 96 60 94 35 respectively in the mediums that carbon supplied by macromolecular saccharides however the efficiency fell to 35 30 glucose and 24 60 sucrose with the r m of only 2 32 and 1 03 mg l h respectively table 1 this proved the poor capability of strain yl for utilizing macromolecular saccharides besides the highest r m was achieved in sodium succinate further proving that sodium succinate was the optimal carbon resource as shown in fig 2b the heterotrophic nitrification was significantly affected by the amounts of organic carbon p 0 05 specifically the nh4 n removal performed inferiorly under low c n ratios c n 2 5 accompanied by the low growth of biomass table 1 while the cellular growth and nh4 n removal obviously ameliorated when the c n ratios were added to 10 and 15 with the maximum nh4 n removal efficiencies and od600 above 97 and 1 38 the kinetic fitting results showed that the lag time was reduced with the increase of c n ratio with the shortest t 0 achieved at a high c n ratio c n 15 however excessive c n did not improve removal efficiency markedly therefore the most suitable c n ratio was 10 as for the fig 2c the nh4 n degradation was closely related to the ambient temperature p 0 05 the removal performance was inefficient at low temperature while nh4 n were entirely removed at 30 and 37 c generous studies reported the nitrification rate of hnb was mainly related to the enzyme activity and that the most suitable temperature of enzyme was 28 37 c 6 12 according to table 1 the r m and od600 of strain increased with the temperature going up while t 0 decreased significantly the highest r m 11 28 mg l h and lowest t 0 3 63 h achieved at 37 c indicated that a relatively high temperature was beneficial for heterotrophic nitrification of strain yl dissolved oxygen do which can be characterized by the shake speed is an indispensable condition for maintaining microbial vital movement fig 2d showed that the nh4 n removal efficiency of strain yl was only 94 24 at 80 rpm and exceeded 98 at a speed of above 120 rpm moreover the r m increased with the rise of shake speed and the maximal r m was achieved at 200 rpm table 1 besides a prolonged t 0 observed at the low speeds proved longer adaptation required for the strain in the insufficient do condition meanwhile high shake speed also accelerated the cellular growth with the maximum od600 and specific growth rate of 1 38 and 0 28 h 1 at 160 rpm thus the optimal condition of shake speed is in the range of 160 to 200 r min which is consistent with the findings of most reported hnb 7 33 from the results in fig 2e the maximum nh4 n removal efficiencies were kept at above 95 and od600 maintained at more than 1 20 at the tested ph of 5 10 indicating that strain yl was capable of adapting to the ph variation with its performance in this regard superior to other hnb 32 besides a higher r m was observed under the neutral or slightly alkaline condition table 1 the improved nh4 n removal efficiency at ph 7 8 may be due to the formation of more ammonia ions conducive to the oxidation of ammonia monooxygenase since negligible difference in the growth and nutrient removal was realized in the ph range of 7 9 p 0 05 ph 7 5 has been regarded as the optimum condition for strain yl with consideration of the practical wastewater treatment applications in fig 2f the nh4 n was almost degraded completely at the low nh4 n conditions while the efficiency separately reached 52 71 and 53 77 with the nh4 n concentration going up to 500 and 1000 mg l this indicated the strain yl was capable of adapting to the nh4 n variation the fitting results table 1 exhibited that maximum r m 28 69 mg l h and minimum t 0 2 66 h were achieved at 1000 mg l nh4 n condition above studies proved the strong tolerance of strain yl to high nh4 n load confirmed its potential value in treating ammonium rich wastewater 3 3 metabolic mechanism of denitrification 3 3 1 aerobic denitrification of the consortium no3 n and no2 n were separately utilized as the sole nitrogen source to evaluate the aerobic denitrification capability of strain yl according to fig 3 a and b strain grew fleetly after 3 h adaptation in dm 1 2 with the maximum od600 of 1 04 and 0 96 respectively after 48 h cultivation the removal efficiencies of no2 n and no3 n reached up to 99 98 and 99 95 with the maximum removal rates separately achieving 7 81 and 6 89 mg l h much higher than those of other hnb 17 32 this indicated that strain yl exhibited an efficient aerobic denitrification ability in addition massive generation of no2 n as a main intermediate could be observed in dm 1 with the maximum concentration of 25 55 mg l it happened in some previous studies 19 34 but no accumulation of no2 n was also reported in other strains 33 besides a slight accumulation of nh4 n could be detected after 24 h in both mediums because of the cells growth limitation by nutrient deficiency and nh4 n release by dead cells 3 3 2 snd of the consortium two groups of mixed n sources were set to detect the snd of strain yl as shown in fig 3c and d the biomass in both mediums increased significantly during the cultivation with the maximum od600 and growth rates reaching 1 05 0 36 h 1 and 1 02 0 41 h 1 for sndm 1 and sndm 2 respectively moreover the nh4 n decreased rapidly to 0 25 mg l and 0 34 mg l within 9 h while both no3 n and no2 n increased slightly in the initial 6 h period and then decreased the result was similar to that study in ochrobactrum anthropic lj81 7 indicating the degradation of no3 n and no2 n lagged behind that of nh4 n under the mixed n source condition the results fully demonstrate that strain yl can simultaneously use different nitrogen sources for hn ad and that the nitrification takes precedence over the denitrification 3 3 3 n balance the n balance analysis demonstrated that almost half of initial nitrogen was conversed to intracellular nitrogen 3 26 of nitrogen was transformed into nitrification products and the rest was in the form of gaseous nitrogen table 2 with no3 n used as the n source an obvious accumulation of no2 n and nh4 n was observed stemming from the incomplete denitrification and the release of nh4 n by cells in the endogenous respiration phase moreover previous studies found that hnb would produce the greenhouse gas n2o during the heterotrophic nitrification process whereas the n2o produced by strain yl was negligible 6 63 0 46 μg in bm this demonstrated the efficient ability of yl on controlling n2o emissions up to now numerous studies have shown that the majority of removed tn by hnb comes down to the assimilation of microorganisms 15 35 whereas the denitrification products of some other strains are mainly nitrogenous gas 9 36 from the n balance strain yl mainly utilized n sources to synthesize biomass with the rest portion of nitrogen converted to n2 and a slight amount of nitrification products 3 3 4 utilization of hydroxylamine and inhibition of atu after a 3 h adaptation the strain began to degrade nh2oh rapidly fig 4 a with the maximum rate of 4 54 mg l h and the final removal efficiency reached to 89 02 in addition the removal trend of tn was similar to nh2oh about half of the removed tn was transformed to intracellular n with the rest was utilized for denitrification the significantly increased od600 also proved that strain yl can utilize nh2oh for growth which was consistent with pseudomonas pb16 37 as for the addition of atu on heterotrophic nitrification fig 4b it was obvious that the adaptation period extended the removal efficiency of nh4 n decreased to 82 57 after 48 h cultivation with the obviously accumulation of no3 n this phenomenon proved that the growth and nitrification of the strain were partially inhibited by atu but not be restrained completely which was quite different from other reported strains 12 15 in conclusion the nitrification and denitrification processes were connected in series through the studies on metabolization of different n resource n balance analysis and the formation of intermediate products it is speculated that the denitrification pathway of yl may be conducted by a sequential hn ad process nh4 nh2oh no2 no3 no2 no n2o n2 3 4 flocculation performance fig 5 a and b showed the variation of fa and rh of strain yl under the three mediums of bm and dm 1 2 the fa increased rapidly within 20 h reaching 46 67 42 21 and 37 81 respectively then decreased fleetly after 25 h the variations of rh was similar to that of fa with the maximum value achieved in bm 85 97 at 20 h followed by dm 1 78 75 and dm 2 72 63 significantly higher than that of klebsiella pneumoniae cf s9 19 moreover after 10 h cultivation fa and rh in dm 1 were significantly higher than those in dm 2 indicating the strain yl in medium containing no3 n had a preferable re flocculating ability and relative hydrophobicity than that of no2 n conditions the variation of zeta potential was related to the growth of strain yl fig 5c and d in the logarithmic growth period negative charge increased rapidly then stabilized during the equilibrium period and finally reduced in the decay phase the negative charges in dm1 2 were apparently higher than that of bm which was conformed to the theory that the increase in surface negative charges of bacterial cells would lead to a weaker bonding between the cells 38 at present few scholars have briefly discussed the flocculation performance of hnb k pneumoniae cf s9 and enterobacter sp strain fl were preliminary analyzed the capability of microbial aggregation 19 39 the findings in this study will help to further understand the formation mechanisms of cell aggregates 3 5 characteristic of eps eps is the product of active secretion cell surface material shedding cell lysis and sorption from environment numerous studies have shown that eps is closely related to the flocculation performance of microbes 40 thus the variations of polysaccharide and protein of eps in hn ad process were specially studied fig 5e and f obviously the protein in bm was higher than those of dm 1 2 besides comparing to bm the protein peaks in dm 1 2 were obviously delayed which corresponded to the trends of the fa and rh this finding broadly supports the work that the pn content in eps is positively correlated with the zeta potential and rh which probably due to the unique positively charged amino groups in pn 38 in addition the production of ps was opposite to that of pn in the order of dm 2 dm 1 bm it was obvious that the contents of pn and ps increased within initial 28 h and then dropped gradually in all three mediums the total eps in dm 2 was obviously higher than those observed in bm and dm 1 which accorded with earlier observations of strain cf s9 19 more eps secretion in dm 2 might be due to the self protection of stain yl when confronting nitrite inhibition eps is generally considered to comprise a double layer structure outer layer of lb eps and inner layer of tb eps 41 the components of the two types of eps after 48 h cultivated in bm were investigated fig s1a obviously the contents of pn and ps in tb eps were significantly higher than those of lb eps and ps was the predominant constituent for both lb eps and tb eps as the dominate part in extracellular matrix the tb eps was reported to play a decisive role in cell adhesion and biofloc structural stability 40 moreover dna was main component in lb eps with the content of 3 34 mg l implying that dna was inclined to cling to the bacterial surface furthermore a 3d eem spectroscopy was used to detect the fluorescent expression of lb eps and tb eps fig s1b and c two main peaks ex em of 400 470 480 and 260 270 470 were observed in lb eps corresponding to humic like and fulvic acid like substances respectively while in tb eps five fluorescence peaks including tyrosine protein like substances ex em 225 305 tryptophan protein like substances ex em 310 320 380 fulvic acid like substances ex em 250 280 450 metabolites of microorganisms ex em 250 280 330 380 and humic like substances ex em 400 440 were detected further indicating the abundant protein in tb eps besides fulvic and humic acid like substances which were related to decomposition of dead cells and macromolecular organics 42 43 were detected as the significant components in lb eps this phenomenon might closely relate to the high contents of dna in lb eps at present literatures are barely available for the eps analysis relating to hnb the results in this study are expected to be valuable for enhancing the realization on bioflocculation of hnb 3 6 applicability of strain yl in ammonium rich wastewater treatment the study on the application of yl in sbr is shown in fig 6 in the first 10 days the microorganisms in the adaptation made poor use of substrates having plenty of nh4 n and no2 n left after 30 days the removal efficiency of toc and tn improved obviously reaching 97 75 and 99 17 in a single reaction period at stable stage fig 6d toc and nh4 n were almost completely removed within 8 h the maximal removal rate of nh4 n and tn were up to 10 49 and 10 65 mg l h respectively moreover a slight accumulation of intermediate products was observed during the process but the formation of nitrification products was far less than that in previous studies 21 the above results proved that the sbr inoculated with strain yl has a significant hn ad ability in wastewater treatment the variations of biomass are shown in fig 6e in the early stage mlss increased rapidly and then stabilized at 2500 3000 mg l after 30 days as for the results of fig 6f the sludge had a poor settling ability in the initial period with the fa and sludge flocs size of only 10 27 and 15 72 μm after 60 days the flocculation performance of sludge improved significantly the fa rose to 81 51 and floc size reached 168 87 μm besides the sludge settled fleetly with svi reducing to 122 64 ml g demonstrating that the sludge flocs formed by strain yl had a decent flocculation and sedimentation performance furthermore according to the investigation on the proportion of bacterial genuses in the sbr after 60 days pseudomonas 46 17 brevundimonas 20 64 and delftia 12 61 were found to be the most dominant genuses fig s2 pseudomonas accounting for the largest proportion showed that strain yl can exist in the sludge system steadily in the studies by chen et al 21 pcn bacteria the mixture of a tumefaciens lad9 c testosteroni gad3 and a xylosoxidans gad4 in the ratio of 1 1 1 capable of hn ad was successfully applied in a pilot scale sbr but failed to become the dominant genus in the system moreover su et al 44 found that the abundance of pseudomonas sp h117 was only 33 83 in an immobilized biofilm reactor by contrast strain yl has excellent stability in the system compared with other strains the research fully proves that the enhanced treatment of simulated wastewater by p aeruginosa yl can not only ensure the long term existence of functional bacterial strain but also has a high application value for treating ammonium rich wastewater 4 conclusions the hnb p aeruginosa yl was isolated and purified from activated sludge which presented a promising ability on hn ad with the slight formation of nitrification intermediates kinetic analysis demonstrated the optimal ammoxidation condition was succinate as carbon source c n ratio 10 temperature of 37 c ph 6 8 and 160 200 rpm as shaking speed through the studies on inhibition of atu and the metabolization of different n resource by strain yl a possible pathway of nitrogen removal was proposed nh4 nh2oh no2 no3 no2 no n2o n2 besides fa and rh of the isolate in bm were significantly higher than those in dm 1 2 while the negative charges were apparently lower proved a decent aggregate performance of strain yl with nh4 n existence additionally the variations in ps pn and dna in eps revealed the remarkable relevance of eps and bioflocculation moreover the significant hn ad ability in sbr application with superior flocculation sedimentation performance and stable bacterial community structures further confirmed

denitrification ability through the efficient utilization of sole and mixed n sources kinetics analysis carried out by gompertz model r2 0 99 explicated the optimal condition of n degradation and its denitrification pathway was proposed as a sequential heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification process moreover strain yl had higher flocculating ability relative hydrophobicity and lower negative charges when nh4 n used as n source which fully proved the stronger aggregation ability of the isolate during heterotrophic nitrification process the formation mechanism of cell aggregates was explained by discussing the variations of extracellular polymeric substances eps components and exhibited an obviously relevance of eps and bioflocculation furthermore the great nutrients removal stable existence of functional strain and the excellent flocculation sedimentation performance in a sequencing batch reactor further confirmed the good potential of strain yl for treating ammonium rich wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords heterotrophic nitrification simultaneous nitrification and denitrification kinetics analysis denitrification pathway aggregation performance 1 introduction generally industrial and agricultural production will produce a large amount of high strength nitrogenous wastewater however traditional biological denitrification that needs larger infrastructure areas generally leads to high operating costs and system instability 1 although massive new denitrification technologies have recently emerged such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox short cut nitrification and denitrification simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd but there are still some limitations 2 4 with the improvement of environmental microbiology abundant heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria hnb have increasingly drawn widespread attention due to their excellent cell proliferation and activity slight requirements for dissolved oxygen do strong tolerance to acidic environments and efficient denitrification capacity 5 8 according to the recent detection and description of an increasing number of hnb with different characteristics 7 9 some have a great ability of heterotrophic nitrification some are capable of aerobic denitrification 10 11 and others reportedly can accumulate phosphorus in an effective way 6 12 at present the hnb research has mainly focused on nitrogen removal efficiency intermediate products and optimal reaction conditions however the metabolic mechanism and pathway of heterotrophic nitrification have not been entirely clear up to now it is widely believed that hnb oxidized nh4 n to no2 n and no3 n and converted into gaseous nitrogen subsequently 7 while other researchers believe hydroxylamine nh2oh can be directly oxidized to n2o and n2 13 14 besides some studies have shown that the effective removal of nitrogen by hnb is the result of the microbial assimilation 15 furthermore reportedly n2 was generally detected during heterotrophic nitrification process by hnb 1 and the greenhouse gas n2o was also significantly accumulated by some other strains 16 17 nevertheless due to its wide varieties complex functions and characteristics a comprehensive and in depth study is urgently needed to improve the mechanism and pathway theory of hnb the aggregation of microbial cells is an indispensable part of applying pure bacteria to wastewater treatment and can provide a theoretical basis for the formation of sludge flocs and biofilms in practical applications currently only a few scholars have studied the aggregation properties of hnb 18 19 its auto aggregation ability and correlation with extracellular polymeric substances eps have been preliminarily discovered but there is no detailed discussion on the flocculation performance of hnb during the reactor operation furthermore research on denitrification of hnb has mostly focused on culture in erlenmeyer flasks rather than on its practical operation in a reactor and its application in nitrogenous wastewater 5 20 the existing reactor enhancement is mainly to inoculate functional bacteria into activated sludge but previous bioaugmentation generally have short duration and unstable efficiency 21 studies have shown that the sludge flocs formed by the enrichment of pure bacteria can ensure the stability of functional microorganisms thereby making the treatment efficiency more durable 8 22 however compared with the attention to the treatment effect few discussions have been held on the enrichment of pure bacteria in terms of floc formation and flora abundance therefore it is necessary to evaluate the potential of hnb in engineering applications from the aspects of microbial flocculation capacity compositions of eps nutrient removal and microbial community in the enhanced activated sludge system previously the strain yl has been isolated from activated sludge and identified as p aeruginosa besides the efficiency of nitrogen degradation and the activities of the key enzymes hao nr and nir also proved the isolate with a capability of high efficient heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification hn ad 23 however its metabolic pathway flocculation characteristics and application potential are still unclear in this paper the metabolic pathway and the kinetic characteristics of strain yl were further clarified through the research on the conversion process of different nitrogen sources and ammoxidation characteristic simulated by the gompertz model under different environment conditions additionally its flocculation performance was analyzed by discussing the variation of flocculating ability fa relative hydrophobicity rh zeta potential and eps components during the cultivation furthermore its enrichment culture formation of microbial flocs as well as nutrient removal in a sequencing batch reactor sbr were investigated to evaluate its value in treating ammonia nitrogenous wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 microorganism the hnb pseudomonas aeruginosa yl genbank id kj765709 was isolated and purified from activated sludge of pig wastewater treatment plant on a solid heterotrophic nitrification medium by gradient dilution and flat stripe method 23 the strain cells were stored in 25 glycerol solution at 80 c and were activated before use 2 2 mediums the basal medium bm and the denitrification medium dm 1 2 were formulated according to yang et al 23 which were utilized for nh4 n no3 n and no2 n reduction respectively the nh2oh medium consists of the following parts per liter 2 81 g of sodium succinate 0 25 g of honh3cl 50 ml of vickers salt solution containing 5 g k2hpo4 3h2o 2 5 g mgso4 7h2o and nacl 0 05 g mnso4 4h2o and feso4 7h2o per liter

were adjusted to ph 7 5 2 3 heterotrophic nitrification strain yl was inoculated in sterile bm and cultured at 30 c 160 rpm and ph 7 for 24 h the cells were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min at 4 c and were washed with sterile phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 4 for three times subsequently one milliliter of the bacterial suspension was inoculated into a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask with 99 ml sterile bm and different initial ammonium concentrations 100 200 500 and 1000 mg l then sealed with sterile breathable membranes all the experiments were performed in triplicate at 30 c 160 rpm and c n ratio of 10 during the cultivation the od600 nh4 n no2 n no3 n nh2oh and total nitrogen tn were regularly sampled from the erlenmeyer flasks to detect the heterotrophic nitrification ability of yl 2 4 kinetic analysis the kinetic analysis was carried out to examine the ammonium removal performance under different culture conditions specifically sucrose glucose sodium acetate sodium citrate and sodium succinate were selected to be sole carbon source respectively the shaking speed was adjusted to 80 120 160 and 200 rpm the ph was controlled to 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 using 1 mol l hcl or 1 mol l naoh the c n ratio was set to 2 5 10 and 15 the temperature was regulated at 10 20 30 37 c and the initial ammonium concentrations were set to 100 200 500 and 1000 mg l by changing the n content in the sterile bm unless the change of single factors all other conditions were kept at 100 mg l nh4 n c n 10 30 c ph 7 5 160 rpm and 1 inoculation size in triplicated 250 ml erlenmeyer

inoculated into 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml sterile nh2oh medium in triplicate then cultivated aerobically at 30 c with the speed of 160 rpm furthermore the effect of the inhibitor was clarified by the addition of 10 mg l allylthiourea atu in the sterile bm where yl was activated and inoculated according to the procedure of section 2 3 samples were regularly collected to detect the nh2oh nh4 n no3 n no2 n and od600 2 7 aggregation ability a volume of 1 ml of cell suspension was added to 100 ml sterile bm and dm 1 2 in 250 ml flasks sealed with sterile breathable membranes then cultivated aerobically at 30 c with the speed of 160 rpm for 48 h the fa and rh of which were periodically taken from flasks were separately analyzed as the reflocculation ability and the adherence to hexadecane 19 24 the zeta potential of cells was analyzed and determined by malvern zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk before measurement the ph of cell suspension at different stages was adjusted to 7 0 0 02 the eps composed of loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted by using thermal extraction method 25 the total amount of eps was the sum of lb eps and tb eps each sample was measured three times the 3d excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectrum used to discriminate the fluorescence compounds in the eps of strain yl was determined by a

by the illumina platform and the data was processed by using the qiime software shanghai sangon co ltd china data in this experiment were analyzed by one way anova with turkey s hsd test p 0 05 using spss statistics 19 0 software and figures were made by origin 9 1 software each experiment had three repetitions and the results were presented as means sd standard deviation of means 3 results and discussion 3 1 heterotrophic ammonium removal under different nh4 n levels four nh4 n concentrations 100 200 500 1000 mg l were investigated to elucidate the heterotrophic nitrification capacity of strain yl as shown in fig 1 the isolate grew normally under different concentrations with the maximum od600 of 1 38 1 82 1 90 and 1 49 respectively moreover a brief 3 h adaptation was observed at 100 mg l compared with more than 6 h at other concentrations besides the maximal specific growth rate gradually increased from 0 18 to 0 25 h 1 with the rise of nh4 n within 500 mg l but fell to 0 20 h 1 at 1000 mg l nh4 n in addition nh4 n and tn were almost completely degraded at low concentrations but the removal efficiency dropped to about 50 at high concentrations it is speculated that excessive free ammonia inhibited the metabolic activity of strain yl under high nh4 n conditions 29 30 the intermediate products were detected at different nh4 n concentrations obviously the accumulation of nh2oh was observed under the high nh4 n loads with the maximum of 49 08 and 58 15 mg l respectively however the small impact of high nh2oh on the growth and ammoxidation process of yl was contrary to the studies of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 31 besides the accumulation of no2 n was undetectable during the whole process only a small amount of no3 n accumulated at high nh4 n concentrations in combination with the high nh4 n removal ability the slight formation of nitrification intermediates was superior to some previous hnb 7 32 indicating great potential of strain yl in treating high ammonia nitrogen wastewater 3 2 ammonium degradation kinetics of strain yl the utilization of nh4 n under different carbon sources are shown in fig 2 a the optimal carbon source was sodium succinate followed by sodium acetate and sodium citrate after 36 h the maximal nh4 n removal efficiency reached 98 80 96 60 94 35 respectively in the mediums that carbon supplied by macromolecular saccharides however the efficiency fell to 35 30 glucose and 24 60 sucrose with the r m of only 2 32 and 1 03 mg l h respectively table 1 this proved the poor capability of strain yl for utilizing macromolecular saccharides besides the highest r m was achieved in sodium succinate further proving that sodium succinate was the optimal carbon resource as shown in fig 2b the heterotrophic nitrification was significantly affected by the amounts of organic carbon p 0 05 specifically the nh4 n removal performed inferiorly under low c n ratios c n 2 5 accompanied by the low growth of biomass table 1 while the cellular growth and nh4 n removal obviously ameliorated when the c n ratios were added to 10 and 15 with the maximum nh4 n removal efficiencies and od600 above 97 and 1 38 the kinetic fitting results showed that the lag time was reduced with the increase of c n ratio with the shortest t 0 achieved at a high c n ratio c n 15 however excessive c n did not improve removal efficiency markedly therefore the most suitable c n ratio was 10 as for the fig 2c the nh4 n degradation was closely related to the ambient temperature p 0 05 the removal performance was inefficient at low temperature while nh4 n were entirely removed at 30 and 37 c generous studies reported the nitrification rate of hnb was mainly related to the enzyme activity and that the most suitable temperature of enzyme was 28 37 c 6 12 according to table 1 the r m and od600 of strain increased with the temperature going up while t 0 decreased significantly the highest r m 11 28 mg l h and lowest t 0 3 63 h achieved at 37 c indicated that a relatively high temperature was beneficial for heterotrophic nitrification of strain yl dissolved oxygen do which can be characterized by the shake speed is an indispensable condition for maintaining microbial vital movement fig 2d showed that the nh4 n removal efficiency of strain yl was only 94 24 at 80 rpm and exceeded 98 at a speed of above 120 rpm moreover the r m increased with the rise of shake speed and the maximal r m was achieved at 200 rpm table 1 besides a prolonged t 0 observed at the low speeds proved longer adaptation required for the strain in the insufficient do condition meanwhile high shake speed also accelerated the cellular growth with the maximum od600 and specific growth rate of 1 38 and 0 28 h 1 at 160 rpm thus the optimal condition of shake speed is in the range of 160 to 200 r min which is consistent with the findings of most reported hnb 7 33 from the results in fig 2e the maximum nh4 n removal efficiencies were kept at above 95 and od600 maintained at more than 1 20 at the tested ph of 5 10 indicating that strain yl was capable of adapting to the ph variation with its performance in this regard superior to other hnb 32 besides a higher r m was observed under the neutral or slightly alkaline condition table 1 the improved nh4 n removal efficiency at ph 7 8 may be due to the formation of more ammonia ions conducive to the oxidation of ammonia monooxygenase since negligible difference in the growth and nutrient removal was realized in the ph range of 7 9 p 0 05 ph 7 5 has been regarded as the optimum condition for strain yl with consideration of the practical wastewater treatment applications in fig 2f the nh4 n was almost degraded completely at the low nh4 n conditions while the efficiency separately reached 52 71 and 53 77 with the nh4 n concentration going up to 500 and 1000 mg l this indicated the strain yl was capable of adapting to the nh4 n variation the fitting results table 1 exhibited that maximum r m 28 69 mg l h and minimum t 0 2 66 h were achieved at 1000 mg l nh4 n condition above studies proved the strong tolerance of strain yl to high nh4 n load confirmed its potential value in treating ammonium rich wastewater 3 3 metabolic mechanism of denitrification 3 3 1 aerobic denitrification of the consortium no3 n and no2 n were separately utilized as the sole nitrogen source to evaluate the aerobic denitrification capability of strain yl according to fig 3 a and b strain grew fleetly after 3 h adaptation in dm 1 2 with the maximum od600 of 1 04 and 0 96 respectively after 48 h cultivation the removal efficiencies of no2 n and no3 n reached up to 99 98 and 99 95 with the maximum removal rates separately achieving 7 81 and 6 89 mg l h much higher than those of other hnb 17 32 this indicated that strain yl exhibited an efficient aerobic denitrification ability in addition massive generation of no2 n as a main intermediate could be observed in dm 1 with the maximum concentration of 25 55 mg l it happened in some previous studies 19 34 but no accumulation of no2 n was also reported in other strains 33 besides a slight accumulation of nh4 n could be detected after 24 h in both mediums because of the cells growth limitation by nutrient deficiency and nh4 n release by dead cells 3 3 2 snd of the consortium two groups of mixed n sources were set to detect the snd of strain yl as shown in fig 3c and d the biomass in both mediums increased significantly during the cultivation with the maximum od600 and growth rates reaching 1 05 0 36 h 1 and 1 02 0 41 h 1 for sndm 1 and sndm 2 respectively moreover the nh4 n decreased rapidly to 0 25 mg l and 0 34 mg l within 9 h while both no3 n and no2 n increased slightly in the initial 6 h period and then decreased the result was similar to that study in ochrobactrum anthropic lj81 7 indicating the degradation of no3 n and no2 n lagged behind that of nh4 n under the mixed n source condition the results fully demonstrate that strain yl can simultaneously use different nitrogen sources for hn ad and that the nitrification takes precedence over the denitrification 3 3 3 n balance the n balance analysis demonstrated that almost half of initial nitrogen was conversed to intracellular nitrogen 3 26 of nitrogen was transformed into nitrification products and the rest was in the form of gaseous nitrogen table 2 with no3 n used as the n source an obvious accumulation of no2 n and nh4 n was observed stemming from the incomplete denitrification and the release of nh4 n by cells in the endogenous respiration phase moreover previous studies found that hnb would produce the greenhouse gas n2o during the heterotrophic nitrification process whereas the n2o produced by strain yl was negligible 6 63 0 46 μg in bm this demonstrated the efficient ability of yl on controlling n2o emissions up to now numerous studies have shown that the majority of removed tn by hnb comes down to the assimilation of microorganisms 15 35 whereas the denitrification products of some other strains are mainly nitrogenous gas 9 36 from the n balance strain yl mainly utilized n sources to synthesize biomass with the rest portion of nitrogen converted to n2 and a slight amount of nitrification products 3 3 4 utilization of hydroxylamine and inhibition of atu after a 3 h adaptation the strain began to degrade nh2oh rapidly fig 4 a with the maximum rate of 4 54 mg l h and the final removal efficiency reached to 89 02 in addition the removal trend of tn was similar to nh2oh about half of the removed tn was transformed to intracellular n with the rest was utilized for denitrification the significantly increased od600 also proved that strain yl can utilize nh2oh for growth which was consistent with pseudomonas pb16 37 as for the addition of atu on heterotrophic nitrification fig 4b it was obvious that the adaptation period extended the removal efficiency of nh4 n decreased to 82 57 after 48 h cultivation with the obviously accumulation of no3 n this phenomenon proved that the growth and nitrification of the strain were partially inhibited by atu but not be restrained completely which was quite different from other reported strains 12 15 in conclusion the nitrification and denitrification processes were connected in series through the studies on metabolization of different n resource n balance analysis and the formation of intermediate products it is speculated that the denitrification pathway of yl may be conducted by a sequential hn ad process nh4 nh2oh no2 no3 no2 no n2o n2 3 4 flocculation performance fig 5 a and b showed the variation of fa and rh of strain yl under the three mediums of bm and dm 1 2 the fa increased rapidly within 20 h reaching 46 67 42 21 and 37 81 respectively then decreased fleetly after 25 h the variations of rh was similar to that of fa with the maximum value achieved in bm 85 97 at 20 h followed by dm 1 78 75 and dm 2 72 63 significantly higher than that of klebsiella pneumoniae cf s9 19 moreover after 10 h cultivation fa and rh in dm 1 were significantly higher than those in dm 2 indicating the strain yl in medium containing no3 n had a preferable re flocculating ability and relative hydrophobicity than that of no2 n conditions the variation of zeta potential was related to the growth of strain yl fig 5c and d in the logarithmic growth period negative charge increased rapidly then stabilized during the equilibrium period and finally reduced in the decay phase the negative charges in dm1 2 were apparently higher than that of bm which was conformed to the theory that the increase in surface negative charges of bacterial cells would lead to a weaker bonding between the cells 38 at present few scholars have briefly discussed the flocculation performance of hnb k pneumoniae cf s9 and enterobacter sp strain fl were preliminary analyzed the capability of microbial aggregation 19 39 the findings in this study will help to further understand the formation mechanisms of cell aggregates 3 5 characteristic of eps eps is the product of active secretion cell surface material shedding cell lysis and sorption from environment numerous studies have shown that eps is closely related to the flocculation performance of microbes 40 thus the variations of polysaccharide and protein of eps in hn ad process were specially studied fig 5e and f obviously the protein in bm was higher than those of dm 1 2 besides comparing to bm the protein peaks in dm 1 2 were obviously delayed which corresponded to the trends of the fa and rh this finding broadly supports the work that the pn content in eps is positively correlated with the zeta potential and rh which probably due to the unique positively charged amino groups in pn 38 in addition the production of ps was opposite to that of pn in the order of dm 2 dm 1 bm it was obvious that the contents of pn and ps increased within initial 28 h and then dropped gradually in all three mediums the total eps in dm 2 was obviously higher than those observed in bm and dm 1 which accorded with earlier observations of strain cf s9 19 more eps secretion in dm 2 might be due to the self protection of stain yl when confronting nitrite inhibition eps is generally considered to comprise a double layer structure outer layer of lb eps and inner layer of tb eps 41 the components of the two types of eps after 48 h cultivated in bm were investigated fig s1a obviously the contents of pn and ps in tb eps were significantly higher than those of lb eps and ps was the predominant constituent for both lb eps and tb eps as the dominate part in extracellular matrix the tb eps was reported to play a decisive role in cell adhesion and biofloc structural stability 40 moreover dna was main component in lb eps with the content of 3 34 mg l implying that dna was inclined to cling to the bacterial surface furthermore a 3d eem spectroscopy was used to detect the fluorescent expression of lb eps and tb eps fig s1b and c two main peaks ex em of 400 470 480 and 260 270 470 were observed in lb eps corresponding to humic like and fulvic acid like substances respectively while in tb eps five fluorescence peaks including tyrosine protein like substances ex em 225 305 tryptophan protein like substances ex em 310 320 380 fulvic acid like substances ex em 250 280 450 metabolites of microorganisms ex em 250 280 330 380 and humic like substances ex em 400 440 were detected further indicating the abundant protein in tb eps besides fulvic and humic acid like substances which were related to decomposition of dead cells and macromolecular organics 42 43 were detected as the significant components in lb eps this phenomenon might closely relate to the high contents of dna in lb eps at present literatures are barely available for the eps analysis relating to hnb the results in this study are expected to be valuable for enhancing the realization on bioflocculation of hnb 3 6 applicability of strain yl in ammonium rich wastewater treatment the study on the application of yl in sbr is shown in fig 6 in the first 10 days the microorganisms in the adaptation made poor use of substrates having plenty of nh4 n and no2 n left after 30 days the removal efficiency of toc and tn improved obviously reaching 97 75 and 99 17 in a single reaction period at stable stage fig 6d toc and nh4 n were almost completely removed within 8 h the maximal removal rate of nh4 n and tn were up to 10 49 and 10 65 mg l h respectively moreover a slight accumulation of intermediate products was observed during the process but the formation of nitrification products was far less than that in previous studies 21 the above results proved that the sbr inoculated with strain yl has a significant hn ad ability in wastewater treatment the variations of biomass are shown in fig 6e in the early stage mlss increased rapidly and then stabilized at 2500 3000 mg l after 30 days as for the results of fig 6f the sludge had a poor settling ability in the initial period with the fa and sludge flocs size of only 10 27 and 15 72 μm after 60 days the flocculation performance of sludge improved significantly the fa rose to 81 51 and floc size reached 168 87 μm besides the sludge settled fleetly with svi reducing to 122 64 ml g demonstrating that the sludge flocs formed by strain yl had a decent flocculation and sedimentation performance furthermore according to the investigation on the proportion of bacterial genuses in the sbr after 60 days pseudomonas 46 17 brevundimonas 20 64 and delftia 12 61 were found to be the most dominant genuses fig s2 pseudomonas accounting for the largest proportion showed that strain yl can exist in the sludge system steadily in the studies by chen et al 21 pcn bacteria the mixture of a tumefaciens lad9 c testosteroni gad3 and a xylosoxidans gad4 in the ratio of 1 1 1 capable of hn ad was successfully applied in a pilot scale sbr but failed to become the dominant genus in the system moreover su et al 44 found that the abundance of pseudomonas sp h117 was only 33 83 in an immobilized biofilm reactor by contrast strain yl has excellent stability in the system compared with other strains the research fully proves that the enhanced treatment of simulated wastewater by p aeruginosa yl can not only ensure the long term existence of functional bacterial strain but also has a high application value for treating ammonium rich wastewater 4 conclusions the hnb p aeruginosa yl was isolated and purified from activated sludge which presented a promising ability on hn ad with the slight formation of nitrification intermediates kinetic analysis demonstrated the optimal ammoxidation condition was succinate as carbon source c n ratio 10 temperature of 37 c ph 6 8 and 160 200 rpm as shaking speed through the studies on inhibition of atu and the metabolization of different n resource by strain yl a possible pathway of nitrogen removal was proposed nh4 nh2oh no2 no3 no2 no n2o n2 besides fa and rh of the isolate in bm were significantly higher than those in dm 1 2 while the negative charges were apparently lower proved a decent aggregate performance of strain yl with nh4 n existence additionally the variations in ps pn and dna in eps revealed the remarkable relevance of eps and bioflocculation moreover the significant hn ad ability in sbr application with superior flocculation sedimentation performance and stable bacterial community structures further confirmed the tremendous value and great potential of strain yl for treating nitrogenous wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

occurrence network 1 introduction sulfate is a common contaminant in acid mine pharmaceutical food processing and industrial wastewater which has the property of high stability and solubility 1 the sulfate wastewater discharged into environments changes the color and odor of the water poisons aquatic organisms and reduces soil productivity 2 high concentration of sulfate leads to steel and concrete corrosion causes acid rain and results in the disorder of natural sulfur cycle 3 moreover long term ingestion of sulfate can cause diarrhea and dehydration thereby endangering people s lives 4 therefore sulfate removal from wastewater with reasonable approaches is of great importance the traditional physical and chemical techniques for removing sulfate from saline wastewater generally have disadvantages of poor treatment efficiencies and difficulties in secondary waste disposal 5 considerable attention has been paid to the use of biological approaches for sulfate removal previous studies have reported that sulfate removal in constructed wetlands cws is between 25 and 90 6 cws are an effective biological treatment approach for sulfate removal 7 sulfate in cws can be removed via plant uptake substrate deposition and microbiological degradation 8 plants slightly assimilate sulfate and reduce to amino acids 9 10 11 approximately 50 of the input sulfur in cws can be removed by substrate accumulation 8 in addition microorganisms such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb play an important role in the sulfate removal of cws 12 cws are generally considered a system under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions which are favorable to srb activities in the lower oxidation and reduction conditions of anaerobic zone 13 researchers have found that the migration and transformation of sulfur in cws are affected by carbon sources 8 wiessner et al 14 concluded that sulfate reduction and the stability of its reduced products are inhibited when carbon source is limited carbon consuming bacteria and sulfur metabolizing bacteria interact to form complex microbial communities to collaborate in sulfate removal 8 fixed carbon by autotrophic bacteria is provided to srb as electron donors during sulfate reduction 15 sulfate is reduced to elemental sulfur or sulfide and carbon is oxidized to carbon dioxide previous research on sulfur transformation has focused on the influence of abiotic factors and community diversity 16 relatively little is known about the interrelationships between sulfur metabolizing bacteria and other bacteria 17 co occurrence networks of microbial community have been increasingly used to predict species interactions and indicate keystone species thereby providing a new perspective for complex microbial community structure 18 therefore this study aims to verify the feasibility of sulfate removal in cws explore the relationship between microorganisms related to carbon and sulfur cycles and provide opportunities for further extraction of cooperative microorganisms intertidal wetland sediment iws with rich halophilic tolerant microbes is an effective microbial inoculant 19 the introduction of iws as a matrix in cws enriches microbial diversity and enhances organic matter removal 51 80 3 03 and phosphorus removal 89 03 1 47 20 numbers microorganisms relevant to sulfate removal have also been found in cws with iws such as desulfobacterales and desulfuromonadales 21 in this study iws was introduced into cws to establish iws enhanced cws iws enhanced cws pa and non iws enhanced cws pa planted with phragmites australis were analyzed under different sulfate concentrations 120 240 360 and 480 mg l and compared with unplanted control cws ct and ct the removal rates of sulfate and cod were investigated moreover keystone and dominant bacteria were identified the co occurrence network was analyzed to reveal the microbial metabolism mechanism about the collaboration of carbon and sulfur this study provides further insight for the extraction of high efficiency carbon and sulfur synergistic microorganisms for sulfate wastewater treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design sixteen separate vertical subsurface flow vssf cws systems subsurface microcosms were constructed in this paper at shandong normal university in jinan china 36 n 117 e each microcosm with a volume of 33 9 l radius 15 cm height 48 cm was made of polyvinylchloride pvc columns and were mainly filled with gravel 15 mm river sand particle size 2 mm and iws the white pvc columns radius 2 cm fixed in the center of the system were used to measure dissolved oxygen every system was fed with sulfate wastewater on june 17 2019 in this experiment 16 experimental apparatuses were composed of four treatments pa pa ct and ct with sulfate concentration gradients 120 240 360 and 480 mg l device parameters of pa pa ct and ct were set based on previous studies 20 the microcosm composition and the fill particle size of the different experimental unit pa pa ct and ct was shown in fig 1 wetland plants were obtained from nansi lake and cultivated in 10 hoagland nutrition solution for two weeks prior to the start of the experiment 22 the iws used in the experiment was gathered from the yellow river delta 2 2 operating performance the microcosms were batch operated and the hydraulic retention time was five days the simulated saline wastewater was fed from the top and collected from the portion bottom which was composed of nh4cl 44 583 mg l kh2po4 52 5 mg l mgso4 30 mg l feso4 30 mg l cacl2 30 mg l h3bo3 2 86 mg

table 1 prior to the experiment cws were fed with salt free simulated wastewater until the plants returned to a stable state by growing new buds the influent cod concentration to s concentration ratio is an important parameter that affects the competition between srb and other anaerobic bacteria e g methane producing archaea mpa for carbon sources 6 several studies have reported that srb utilizes more than 50 of the total electron flow compared with mpa and cod removal reaches 79 2 when cod to s ratio is 1 5 23 thus to ensure cod s 1 5 sucrose and na2so4 were added in the proportion which are shown on table 1 sucrose and sulfate concentrations were slowly adjusted to the corresponding experimental concentration to establish the system environment the volume of water for a cycle was 3 5 l and the water level was maintained below the surface of the sand 20 the water loss was compensated for deionized water at the same inflow height every day the system start time of 75 100 days would stabilize the microbial community and the mean removal rate of cod and sulfate of different cws at steady state are shown in the table s1 the batch experiments were thus conducted 3 months after the pretreatment 24 2 3 sampling the effluent samples were collected every five days and the sulfate was determined immediately after filtration through 0 45 μm membrane soil samples were dug from substrate of each group using soil applicator subsequently soil samples were preserved in sterile eppendorf tubes 5 ml and then stored under 80 c until the microbiological analysis 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 water properties analysis sulfate concentration was detected using ics 1100 usa ion chromatography method 25 the cod content was measured by potassium dichromate method using an hach dr 2800tm spectrophotometer usa 21 2 4 2 microbial community analyses microbial samples were collected from each system with a sampling depth of 5 10 cm and three parallel analyses truseq nano dna lt library

analysis co occurrence network analysis was used based on the relative abundance of all samples 26 cytoscape software was used to construct the network diagram inherent patterns of co occurrence or co exclusion driven by the environment were studied through network analysis of microbial interrelationships the topology characteristics of the co occurrence network constructed were calculated using the r package igraph the keystone members were identified in zi pi plot 26 on the basis of the abundance of nodes asv otu the top 50 nodes of average abundance were extracted to construct the seed network of dominant species 2 4 4 data analyses the experimental data were analyzed using origin 8 5 software spss 22 0 ibm usa software was used to analyze and correlate experimental data and anova was performed which determined the sulfate removal efficiency and difference analysis between microorganisms for every microcosm p 0 05 was statistically significant and p 0 01 was extremely significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfate and cod removal performance of different cws the removal rates of sulfate in different cws are shown in fig 2 a the average removal rate of sulfate could be arranged as pa 60 60 0 80 pa 44 64 2 72 ct 24 76 1 76 ct 21 73 2 26 the result indicated that the introduction of iws could improve the sulfate removal rates in cws previous studies have confirmed the existence of desulfobacterales and desulfuromonadales with high abundance in iws 21 desulfobacterales and desulfuromonadales are srb that are beneficial for sulfate removal from saline wastewater which may be an important factor for improving sulfate removal rates the results also showed that the sulfate removal rates of the planting groups pa and pa were significantly higher than that of the unplanted groups ct and ct p 0 05 previous studies have shown that plant roots absorb sulfate and transport it to the aboveground by transpiration for growth and development 10 11 in addition plant litter and root exudates can drive dissimilated sulfate reduction 6 therefore the presence of plants was positive for sulfate removal sulfate removal rate in pa and pa was significantly correlated to different sulfate concentration 120 mg l 240 mg l 360 mg l and 480 mg l p 0 05 at 120 mg l of sulfate concentration the sulfate removal rate in pa and pa was 13 27 and 14 17 higher than that at 480 mg l of sulfate concentration 53 16 0 13 and 36 41 3 15 the results showed that the sulfate removal rate decreased with increase of sulfate concentration in pa and pa this result is closely related to the stress of high sulfate concentration on microorganisms and plants in cws 14 moreover hydrogen sulfide a sulfate reduction product is found to be toxic to plants and microorganisms 27 no significant correlation exhibited in ct and ct p 0 05 the removal rates of cod in different cws are shown in fig 2 b the average cod removal rate of the planted group pa 73 90 1 93 pa 57 94 1 91 was significantly higher than that of the unplanted group ct 47 52 1 67 ct 34 85 2 37 p 0 05 the results showed that plants are beneficial to cod removal similar finding was reported by wang et al 21 who discovered that plants can send signals and protect the microbial activities of cod removal organic matter removal in cws depend on the absorption of plant root biofilms 28 the average cod removal rates in pa and ct were 15 96 and 12 67 higher than those of pa and ct respectively thus adding iws could promote the cod removal in cw of sulfate stress a significant difference in cod removal was observed between ct and ct p 0 05 the cod removal rate in pa was 14 91 16 19 17 20 and 18 67 higher than those in pa 48 39 1 40 55 16 2 18 63 54 1 57 61 67 2 49 with sulfate concentration stresses of 120 mg l 240 mg l 360 mg l and 480 mg l sulfate concentration was positive related with the cod removal rates in pa and pa p 0 05 high sulfate concentration promoted methanogens to compete with srb for carbon sources under anaerobic conditions 23 no significant correlation exhibited between sulfate concentration and cod removal in ct and ct p 0 05 in addition the relationship between sulfate reduction and cod removal was not significant in pa pa ct and ct p 0 05 this finding is consistent with that of wiessner et al 29 who reported that sulfate reduction has a slight effect on carbon removal 3 2 analysis of microbial communities 3 2 1 microbial community diversity table 2 shows the microbial community diversity and richness at different sulfate concentrations in cws chao index was used to characterize microbial diversity 30 the simpson and shannon indexes were used to evaluate the uniformity of the microbial community 31 the results showed that the chao1 index in pa 5114 27 was slightly lower than that in pa 5415 49 at 120 mg l of sulfate concentration however with the increase of sulfate concentration this index in pa is significantly higher than that in pa p 0 05 moreover the simpson and shannon indexes in pa were all higher than that in pa at different sulfate concentrations these results suggested that the addition of iws had a positive effect on the growth of microorganisms under sulfate stress the result also showed that chao 1 index in pa was significantly higher than that in ct in all systems with iws indicating that the presence of plants was conducive to the increase in microbial community diversity which was consistent with previous studies 21 3 2 2 microbial community structures the microbial analyses at the phylum level in different cws are shown in fig 3 in the planted units proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria in pa 45 66 and pa 43 49 probacteria were an essential population for organic matter degradation which play an important role in carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling 32 actinobacteria and acidobacteria were also the dominant bacteria no significant difference p 0 05 was found in actinobacteria in pa 8 25 and pa 9 14 the abundance level of acidobacteria was 7 85 and 6 63 in pa and pa respectively previous studies have shown that actinobacteria had a positive effect on the degradation of organic matter and acidobacteria had many encoded cellulases and hemicellulases 33 the relative abundance of chloroflexi was 15 11 in pa which was 3 6 times of that in pa 4 23 the abundance of chloroflexi in pa was significantly higher than that in pa p 0 05 chloroflexi which acts as photosynthetic bacteria participated in converting co2 to acetate and was also highly tolerant to salinity stress 34 therefore chloroflexi offered carbon source and energy for the system by photosynthesis 35 in the unplanted units the relative abundance of proteobacteria in ct and ct was 43 67 and 42 08 respectively the relative abundance of acidobacteria in ct 12 03 was 3 22 higher than that in ct 8 81 acidobacteria were also involved in the degradation of organic pollutants 35 in addition chloroflexi was the dominant phyla in ct 7 39 which was nearly 1 6 times of ct 3 77 the addition of iws to cw increased the content level of proteobacteria chloroflexi and acidobacteria whether planted or not similar results were reported by wang et al 21 who discovered considerable amounts of microbes associated with the contaminant removal in cws with the introduction of iws the microorganisms related to sulfur and carbon cycles were further analyzed as shown in fig 4 the results showed that more microorganisms were associated with sulfur and carbon transformation in cws with iws reduced sulfur compounds were oxidized to elemental sulfur or sulfate under the action of sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob in the microaerobic environment at the upper layer of the cws 36 ectothiorhodospiraceae phylum proteobacteria was the dominant family in pa 0 33 which was not present in pa ectothiorhodospiraceae was one of the purple sulfur bacteria which are important drivers of the sulfur compounds for re oxidation to obtain energy and electrons for co2 reduction 37 the average relative abundance of hyphomicrobiaceae in pa and pa were 0 20 and 0 42 respectively hyphomicrobiaceae can use s2 and s2o3 2 for photosynthetic autotrophy under anaerobic conditions 38 the relative abundance of rhodoferax phylum proteobacteria in pa 0 12 was higher than that in pa 0 01 previous studies have reported that rhodoferax is a group of purple non sulfur bacteria that can be used sulfide as an electron donor under aerobic conditions 39 some colorless sulfur bacteria such as paracoccus phylum proteobacteria and thiobacillus phylum proteobacteria were detected in pa whereas these strains were fewer in pa many studies have confirmed that paracoccus participates in the sulfur oxidation process and has strong cellulose decomposition capability 40 the average abundance of thiobacillus in pa 0 56 was obviously higher than that of pa 0 01 previous studies have proved that thiobacillus could drive the autotrophic denitrification using sulfur compounds 41 these results showed that the addition of iws improves the oxidation capacity of sulfides in cws srb and sob contribute to the sulfur cycle in cw via good teamwork srb removed sulfate by reducing sulfate to elemental sulfur or sulfides in the anaerobic environment at the bottom layer of cws 14 16 a significant difference was observed in the relative abundance of desulfobacteraceae phylum proteobacteria in pa and pa p 0 05 the average relative abundance of desulfobacteraceae in pa and ct was 0 96 and 0 07 respectively which was not detected in pa and ct desulfobacteraceae belonging to completely oxidizing srb regard sulfate as electron receptors for sulfate metabolism and organic carbon is completely converted to co2 in cw systems 42 the average relative abundance of desulfobulbaceae phylum proteobacteria in pa 1 66 was 1 48 times that in pa 1 12 desulfobulbaceae reduced so4 2 to s2 hs by using h2 or acetate as an electron donor 43 a previous study reported that desulfobacteraceae and desulfobulbaceae might be in competition for electron acceptors during sulfate reduction such as sulfate 44 desulfuromonas phylum proteobacteria was detected as a dominant family in pa 11 19 and pa 4 33 which were 19 29 and 6 98 times those in ct 0 58 and ct 0 62 respectively previous studies have found that desulfuromonas can provide electrons in the sulfur reduction process to speed up the sulfur cycle 45 the average relative abundance of geobacter phylum proteobacteria in pa 1 17 was higher than that in pa 0 19 geobacter is a heterotrophic bacterium which contains the genetic sequence of nitrite reductase for sulfite reduction 46 desulfuromonas is closely related to geobacter which belong to order desulfuromonadales desulfuromonas is a member of incompletely oxidizing srb geobacter utilizes acetate as an electron donor which is produced during desulfuromonas metabolism process 41 a syntrophic relationship between desulfuromonas and geobacter may exist microbes decompose organic matter to obtain electrons for sulfate reduction 47 the result indicated that some bacteria closely related to carbon metabolism were found in cws with iws the average relative abundance of anaerolineaceae phylum chloroflexi in pa 4 61 and ct 0 66 was 6 98 and 1 06 times than those in pa 0 50 and ct 0 47 respectively jia et al 34 reported that anaerolineaceae is the major family to hydrocarbons degradation in anaerobic environments the average relative abundance of lysobacter phylum proteobacteria in pa 1 34 and ct 1 96 was significantly higher than that in pa 0 09 and ct 0 49 p 0 05 lysobacter is highly proteolytic and metabolizes with citric acid as a carbon source 48 pseudomonas phylum proteobacteria had an average relative abundance of 2 44 in ct which was 3 75 times that of ct 0 65 no significant difference was found in the relative abundance of pseudomonas in pa 1 70 and pa 1 99 p 0 05 pseudomonas is facultative chemoautotrophic bacteria that can degrade cellulose which can utilize various electron donors e g organic carbon h2 or reductive vulcanization compounds 49 burkholderiaceae phylum proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria in pa 2 70 pa 5 29 ct 8 05 and ct 9 69 burkholderiaceae play crucial roles in carbon conversion 32 amaricoccus phylum proteobacteria in ct 2 35 were 3 05 times of that in ct 0 77 saccharimonadia phylum patescibacteria with a relative abundance of 1 60 were found in ct which exhibited 1 26 times more than that in ct 1 27 these strains were less than 0 1 in pa saccharimonadia can degrade carbon under anaerobic conditions 50 previous studies have reported that amaricoccus can participate in polyhydroxybutyrate storage 51 the average relative abundance of flavobacterium phylum proteobacteria accounted for 1 06 4 12 2 50 and 2 28 in pa pa ct and ct respectively and these strains could degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 52 the results showed that the average relative abundance of burkholderiaceae saccharimonadia amaricoccus and flavobacterium in cw iws was lower than that of cws without iws 3 3 topological function and co occurrence network of microbial communities the key topological characteristics of the microbial community are presented in table s2 and table s3 and the degree distribution of the microbial community structure is shown in fig s1 the type of network was scale free which has the property of robustness 53 the modularization value and closeness centrality value of the empirical network 0 3855 157 8138 were higher than those of the random network 0 0606 0 0010 12 1706 0 6634 respectively the empirical network was considered significantly clustered and modular the result indicated that a tight network existed among the microbial communities 18 moreover the average path length of pa 2 30 and ct 2 48 was shorter than that of pa 2 61 and ct 2 57 previous research has found that the short path lengths between microbes accelerate the exchange of matter energy and information 54 thus the microbial metabolic activity in pa and ct was faster than that in pa and ct in cw systems the zi pi plot is described in fig 5 zi and pi score values are topological indexes indicating keystone species 55 the majority of the nodes 95 67 fell into peripherals specialists zi 2 5 and 0 pi 0 62 the other nodes 4 33 were located in module hubs and connector generalists zi 2 5 and 0 pi 0 62 or zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 including 1 32 that belonged to module hubs and 3 01 that belonged to connectors no network hubs were identified super generalists zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 the keystone species in the module hubs play an important role in maintaining ecosystem stability 18 nineteen module hubs were observed which mainly belonged to class thermoleophilia phylum actinobacteria order rhodobacterales phylum proteobacteria order rhizobiale phylum proteobacteria order tistrellales phylum proteobacteria order thermomicrobiales phylum chloroflexi and genus nitrospira phylum nitrospirae table s4 these keystone microorganisms belonging to aerobic and heterotrophic organic decomposers can adapt to complex environmental systems and release metabolites to feed plants and other organisms 17 previous studies have showed that some members of rhodobacterales can use hydrogen sulfide as an electron acceptor for photoautotrophic growth which can prevent the accumulation of hydrogen sulfide 56 rhizobiales play vital roles in providing nitrogen nutrients to systems 57 the stress resistance of keystone genera has also been found in key species thermoleophilia preform unusual adaptation to frigid temperatures 58 nitrospira and tistrellales tend to aid in water purification 59 a previous study stated that thermomicrobiales is known as the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and have high tolerance for radiation and high temperatures 60 tistrellales and thermomicrobiales had a low relative abundance 1 these results indicated that some keystone members of low abundance taxa could play more essential role in maintaining the function of material circulation and resisting the disturbance than some abundant genera this finding is in accordance with that of wang et al 26 who confirmed that some low abundance microorganisms display active roles in driving functions and community composition the microbial correlations among the top 50 asv otu of average sample abundance are shown in fig 6 the bacteria of carbon and sulfur metabolism were closely connected in the network such bacteria included thauera phylum proteobacteria flavobacterium phylum bacteroidetes unclassified burkholderiaceae phylum proteobacteria unclassified desulfuromonadaceae phylum proteobacteria azoarcus phylum proteobacteria and pseudomonas phylum proteobacteria flavobacterium had a positive correlation with thauera and unclassified burkholderiaceae flavobacterium and thauera belong to denitrifying bacteria which utilize organic substance for reaction 34 61 thauera can also use sulfide as an electron donor for denitrification under the tolerance of salinity 62 flavobacterium and thauera were spread out in the same modules which can denitrify through different electron donors to avoid competition 63 unclassified burkholderiaceae were located in different modules with flavobacterium and thauera unclassified burkholderiaceae which belong to nitrite oxidizing bacteria can reduce nitrite via nitrification 64 flavobacterium and thauera cooperate to promote the nitrogen cycle within the system the result showed that pseudomonas was positively correlated with amaricoccus pseudomonas and amaricoccus are associated with the degradation of organic matter which belong to the same module having an intimate relationship 49 51 recent research has reported that pseudomonas can perform autotrophic metabolism during carbon source restriction 49 amaricoccus synthesizes storage polymers e g phb which is beneficial for the supply nutrients to the systems in a highly stressful ecosystem 65 the finding showed that pseudomonas and amaricoccus had cross feeding and cooperation in the network unclassified desulfuromonadaceae had a negative correlation with thauera flavobacterium and unclassified burkholderiaceae the metabolic activities of these strains compete for the organic matter and living space in the cw systems for survival wang et al 2020b desulfuromonadaceae are a major family of srb and the metabolism of sulfate in desulfuromonadaceae is divided into sulfate transport sulfate activation adenosine phosphosulphate aps reduction and sulfite reduction 9 10 desulfuromonadaceae can compete with thauera flavobacterium and unclassified burkholderiaceae for carbon sources as electron donors in the process of aps reduction and sulfite reduction which inhibits sulfate removal therefore reducing the abundance of thauera flavobacterium and unclassified burkholderiaceae might enhance the adaptability of unclassified desulfuromonadaceae with conditions of restricted carbon source availability 45 lysobacter and unclassified saccharimonadales which were distributed in different modules had a negative correlation unclassified saccharimonadales affect the degradation of organic compounds at aerobic or facultative anaerobic conditions 50 other studies have concluded that lysobacter can secrete numerous extracellular enzymes such as lipohydrolysase and chitinase and have a strong bacteriolytic property 66 thus it can be concluded that amensalism exists between lysobacter and unclassified saccharimonadales 67 the study found that the relative abundance of lysobacte was higher in iws cw whereas unclassified saccharimonadales had a lower abundance in iws cw fig 4 this result may be due to the srb having a strong role in competing with unclassified saccharimonadales for electron donors in the iws cw system 50 hence lysobacter can replace unclassified scharimonadales in the system to reduce the competition with srb for electron receptors the above results indicated that the complex co occurrence network of microorganisms was formed through elemental metabolite relationships which is a strategy to cope with salinity stress and is beneficial to the stability of microbial communities in cws 35 4 conclusion in this study sulfate removal was inhibited whereas cod removal increased under a high sulfate stress iws as microbial inoculants introduced considerable srb sob and carbon consuming bacteria which are closely related to the carbon and sulfur cycles the keystone bacteria in the system had important functions in providing nutrients e g rhizobiales responding to extreme environments e g thermoleophilia and thermolicrobiales and restoring aquatic environments e g rhodobacterales nitrospira and tistrellales in addition the carbon metabolizing bacteria in the same module established the relationships of cooperation and cross feeding by utilizing different substances to metabolize and adapt to the stress environment together however some

occurrence network 1 introduction sulfate is a common contaminant in acid mine pharmaceutical food processing and industrial wastewater which has the property of high stability and solubility 1 the sulfate wastewater discharged into environments changes the color and odor of the water poisons aquatic organisms and reduces soil productivity 2 high concentration of sulfate leads to steel and concrete corrosion causes acid rain and results in the disorder of natural sulfur cycle 3 moreover long term ingestion of sulfate can cause diarrhea and dehydration thereby endangering people s lives 4 therefore sulfate removal from wastewater with reasonable approaches is of great importance the traditional physical and chemical techniques for removing sulfate from saline wastewater generally have disadvantages of poor treatment efficiencies and difficulties in secondary waste disposal 5 considerable attention has been paid to the use of biological approaches for sulfate removal previous studies have reported that sulfate removal in constructed wetlands cws is between 25 and 90 6 cws are an effective biological treatment approach for sulfate removal 7 sulfate in cws can be removed via plant uptake substrate deposition and microbiological degradation 8 plants slightly assimilate sulfate and reduce to amino acids 9 10 11 approximately 50 of the input sulfur in cws can be removed by substrate accumulation 8 in addition microorganisms such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb play an important role in the sulfate removal of cws 12 cws are generally considered a system under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions which are favorable to srb activities in the lower oxidation and reduction conditions of anaerobic zone 13 researchers have found that the migration and transformation of sulfur in cws are affected by carbon sources 8 wiessner et al 14 concluded that sulfate reduction and the stability of its reduced products are inhibited when carbon source is limited carbon consuming bacteria and sulfur metabolizing bacteria interact to form complex microbial communities to collaborate in sulfate removal 8 fixed carbon by autotrophic bacteria is provided to srb as electron donors during sulfate reduction 15 sulfate is reduced to elemental sulfur or sulfide and carbon is oxidized to carbon dioxide previous research on sulfur transformation has focused on the influence of abiotic factors and community diversity 16 relatively little is known about the interrelationships between sulfur metabolizing bacteria and other bacteria 17 co occurrence networks of microbial community have been increasingly used to predict species interactions and indicate keystone species thereby providing a new perspective for complex microbial community structure 18 therefore this study aims to verify the feasibility of sulfate removal in cws explore the relationship between microorganisms related to carbon and sulfur cycles and provide opportunities for further extraction of cooperative microorganisms intertidal wetland sediment iws with rich halophilic tolerant microbes is an effective microbial inoculant 19 the introduction of iws as a matrix in cws enriches microbial diversity and enhances organic matter removal 51 80 3 03 and phosphorus removal 89 03 1 47 20 numbers microorganisms relevant to sulfate removal have also been found in cws with iws such as desulfobacterales and desulfuromonadales 21 in this study iws was introduced into cws to establish iws enhanced cws iws enhanced cws pa and non iws enhanced cws pa planted with phragmites australis were analyzed under different sulfate concentrations 120 240 360 and 480 mg l and compared with unplanted control cws ct and ct the removal rates of sulfate and cod were investigated moreover keystone and dominant bacteria were identified the co occurrence network was analyzed to reveal the microbial metabolism mechanism about the collaboration of carbon and sulfur this study provides further insight for the extraction of high efficiency carbon and sulfur synergistic microorganisms for sulfate wastewater treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design sixteen separate vertical subsurface flow vssf cws systems subsurface microcosms were constructed in this paper at shandong normal university in jinan china 36 n 117 e each microcosm with a volume of 33 9 l radius 15 cm height 48 cm was made of polyvinylchloride pvc columns and were mainly filled with gravel 15 mm river sand particle size 2 mm and iws the white pvc columns radius 2 cm fixed in the center of the system were used to measure dissolved oxygen every system was fed with sulfate wastewater on june 17 2019 in this experiment 16 experimental apparatuses were composed of four treatments pa pa ct and ct with sulfate concentration gradients 120 240 360 and 480 mg l device parameters of pa pa ct and ct were set based on previous studies 20 the microcosm composition and the fill particle size of the different experimental unit pa pa ct and ct was shown in fig 1 wetland plants were obtained from nansi lake and cultivated in 10 hoagland nutrition solution for two weeks prior to the start of the experiment 22 the iws used in the experiment was gathered from the yellow river delta 2 2 operating performance the microcosms were batch operated and the hydraulic retention time was five days the simulated saline wastewater was fed from the top and collected from the portion bottom which was composed of nh4cl 44 583 mg l kh2po4 52 5 mg l mgso4 30 mg l feso4 30 mg l cacl2 30 mg l h3bo3 2 86 mg

table 1 prior to the experiment cws were fed with salt free simulated wastewater until the plants returned to a stable state by growing new buds the influent cod concentration to s concentration ratio is an important parameter that affects the competition between srb and other anaerobic bacteria e g methane producing archaea mpa for carbon sources 6 several studies have reported that srb utilizes more than 50 of the total electron flow compared with mpa and cod removal reaches 79 2 when cod to s ratio is 1 5 23 thus to ensure cod s 1 5 sucrose and na2so4 were added in the proportion which are shown on table 1 sucrose and sulfate concentrations were slowly adjusted to the corresponding experimental concentration to establish the system environment the volume of water for a cycle was 3 5 l and the water level was maintained below the surface of the sand 20 the water loss was compensated for deionized water at the same inflow height every day the system start time of 75 100 days would stabilize the microbial community and the mean removal rate of cod and sulfate of different cws at steady state are shown in the table s1 the batch experiments were thus conducted 3 months after the pretreatment 24 2 3 sampling the effluent samples were collected every five days and the sulfate was determined immediately after filtration through 0 45 μm membrane soil samples were dug from substrate of each group using soil applicator subsequently soil samples were preserved in sterile eppendorf tubes 5 ml and then stored under 80 c until the microbiological analysis 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 water properties analysis sulfate concentration was detected using ics 1100 usa ion chromatography method 25 the cod content was measured by potassium dichromate method using an hach dr 2800tm spectrophotometer usa 21 2 4 2 microbial community analyses microbial samples were collected from each system with a sampling depth of 5 10 cm and three parallel analyses truseq nano dna lt library

the r package igraph the keystone members were identified in zi pi plot 26 on the basis of the abundance of nodes asv otu the top 50 nodes of average abundance were extracted to construct the seed network of dominant species 2 4 4 data analyses the experimental data were analyzed using origin 8 5 software spss 22 0 ibm usa software was used to analyze and correlate experimental data and anova

significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfate and cod removal performance of different cws the removal rates of sulfate in different cws are shown in fig 2 a the average removal rate of sulfate could be arranged as pa 60 60 0 80 pa 44 64 2 72 ct 24 76 1 76 ct 21 73 2 26 the result indicated that the introduction of iws could improve the sulfate removal rates in cws previous studies have confirmed the existence of desulfobacterales and desulfuromonadales with high abundance in iws 21 desulfobacterales and desulfuromonadales are srb that are beneficial for sulfate removal from saline wastewater which may be an important factor for improving sulfate removal rates the results also showed that the sulfate removal rates of the planting groups pa and pa were significantly higher than that of the unplanted groups ct and ct p 0 05 previous studies have shown that plant roots absorb sulfate and transport it to the aboveground by transpiration for growth and development 10 11 in addition plant litter and root exudates can drive dissimilated sulfate reduction 6 therefore the presence of plants was positive for sulfate removal sulfate removal rate in pa and pa was significantly correlated to different sulfate concentration 120 mg l 240 mg l 360 mg l and 480 mg l p 0 05 at 120 mg l of sulfate concentration the sulfate removal rate in pa and pa was 13 27 and 14 17 higher than that at 480 mg l of sulfate concentration 53 16 0 13 and 36 41 3 15 the results showed that the sulfate removal rate decreased with increase of sulfate concentration in pa and pa this result is closely related to the stress of high sulfate concentration on microorganisms and plants in cws 14 moreover hydrogen sulfide a sulfate reduction product is found to be toxic to plants and microorganisms 27 no significant correlation exhibited in ct and ct p 0 05 the removal rates of cod in different cws are shown in fig 2 b the average cod removal rate of the planted group pa 73 90 1 93 pa 57 94 1 91 was significantly higher than that of the unplanted group ct 47 52 1 67 ct 34 85 2 37 p 0 05 the results showed that plants are beneficial to cod removal similar finding was reported by wang et al 21 who discovered that plants can send signals and protect the microbial activities of cod removal organic matter removal in cws depend on the absorption of plant root biofilms 28 the average cod removal rates in pa and ct were 15 96 and 12 67 higher than those of pa and ct respectively thus adding iws could promote the cod removal in cw of sulfate stress a significant difference in cod removal was observed between ct and ct p 0 05 the cod removal rate in pa was 14 91 16 19 17 20 and 18 67 higher than those in pa 48 39 1 40 55 16 2 18 63 54 1 57 61 67 2 49 with sulfate concentration stresses of 120 mg l 240 mg l 360 mg l and 480 mg l sulfate concentration was positive related with the cod removal rates in pa and pa p 0 05 high sulfate concentration promoted methanogens to compete with srb for carbon sources under anaerobic conditions 23 no significant correlation exhibited between sulfate concentration and cod removal in ct and ct p 0 05 in addition the relationship between sulfate reduction and cod removal was not significant in pa pa ct and ct p 0 05 this finding is consistent with that of wiessner et al 29 who reported that sulfate reduction has a slight effect on carbon removal 3 2 analysis of microbial communities 3 2 1 microbial community diversity table 2 shows the microbial community diversity and richness at different sulfate concentrations in cws chao index was used to characterize microbial diversity 30 the simpson and shannon indexes were used to evaluate the uniformity of the microbial community 31 the results showed that the chao1 index in pa 5114 27 was slightly lower than that in pa 5415 49 at 120 mg l of sulfate concentration however with the increase of sulfate concentration this index in pa is significantly higher than that in pa p 0 05 moreover the simpson and shannon indexes in pa were all higher than that in pa at different sulfate concentrations these results suggested that the addition of iws had a positive effect on the growth of microorganisms under sulfate stress the result also showed that chao 1 index in pa was significantly higher than that in ct in all systems with iws indicating that the presence of plants was conducive to the increase in microbial community diversity which was consistent with previous studies 21 3 2 2 microbial community structures the microbial analyses at the phylum level in different cws are shown in fig 3 in the planted units proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria in pa 45 66 and pa 43 49 probacteria were an essential population for organic matter degradation which play an important role in carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling 32 actinobacteria and acidobacteria were also the dominant bacteria no significant difference p 0 05 was found in actinobacteria in pa 8 25 and pa 9 14 the abundance level of acidobacteria was 7 85 and 6 63 in pa and pa respectively previous studies have shown that actinobacteria had a positive effect on the degradation of organic matter and acidobacteria had many encoded cellulases and hemicellulases 33 the relative abundance of chloroflexi was 15 11 in pa which was 3 6 times of that in pa 4 23 the abundance of chloroflexi in pa was significantly higher than that in pa p 0 05 chloroflexi which acts as photosynthetic bacteria participated in converting co2 to acetate and was also highly tolerant to salinity stress 34 therefore chloroflexi offered carbon source and energy for the system by photosynthesis 35 in the unplanted units the relative abundance of proteobacteria in ct and ct was 43 67 and 42 08 respectively the relative abundance of acidobacteria in ct 12 03 was 3 22 higher than that in ct 8 81 acidobacteria were also involved in the degradation of organic pollutants 35 in addition chloroflexi was the dominant phyla in ct 7 39 which was nearly 1 6 times of ct 3 77 the addition of iws to cw increased the content level of proteobacteria chloroflexi and acidobacteria whether planted or not similar results were reported by wang et al 21 who discovered considerable amounts of microbes associated with the contaminant removal in cws with the introduction of iws the microorganisms related to sulfur and carbon cycles were further analyzed as shown in fig 4 the results showed that more microorganisms were associated with sulfur and carbon transformation in cws with iws reduced sulfur compounds were oxidized to elemental sulfur or sulfate under the action of sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob in the microaerobic environment at the upper layer of the cws 36 ectothiorhodospiraceae phylum proteobacteria was the dominant family in pa 0 33 which was not present in pa ectothiorhodospiraceae was one of the purple sulfur bacteria which are important drivers of the sulfur compounds for re oxidation to obtain energy and electrons for co2 reduction 37 the average relative abundance of hyphomicrobiaceae in pa and pa were 0 20 and 0 42 respectively hyphomicrobiaceae can use s2 and s2o3 2 for photosynthetic autotrophy under anaerobic conditions 38 the relative abundance of rhodoferax phylum proteobacteria in pa 0 12 was higher than that in pa 0 01 previous studies have reported that rhodoferax is a group of purple non sulfur bacteria that can be used sulfide as an electron donor under aerobic conditions 39 some colorless sulfur bacteria such as paracoccus phylum proteobacteria and thiobacillus phylum proteobacteria were detected in pa whereas these strains were fewer in pa many studies have confirmed that paracoccus participates in the sulfur oxidation process and has strong cellulose decomposition capability 40 the average abundance of thiobacillus in pa 0 56 was obviously higher than that of pa 0 01 previous studies have proved that thiobacillus could drive the autotrophic denitrification using sulfur compounds 41 these results showed that the addition of iws improves the oxidation capacity of sulfides in cws srb and sob contribute to the sulfur cycle in cw via good teamwork srb removed sulfate by reducing sulfate to elemental sulfur or sulfides in the anaerobic environment at the bottom layer of cws 14 16 a significant difference was observed in the relative abundance of desulfobacteraceae phylum proteobacteria in pa and pa p 0 05 the average relative abundance of desulfobacteraceae in pa and ct was 0 96 and 0 07 respectively which was not detected in pa and ct desulfobacteraceae belonging to completely oxidizing srb regard sulfate as electron receptors for sulfate metabolism and organic carbon is completely converted to co2 in cw systems 42 the average relative abundance of desulfobulbaceae phylum proteobacteria in pa 1 66 was 1 48 times that in pa 1 12 desulfobulbaceae reduced so4 2 to s2 hs by using h2 or acetate as an electron donor 43 a previous study reported that desulfobacteraceae and desulfobulbaceae might be in competition for electron acceptors during sulfate reduction such as sulfate 44 desulfuromonas phylum proteobacteria was detected as a dominant family in pa 11 19 and pa 4 33 which were 19 29 and 6 98 times those in ct 0 58 and ct 0 62 respectively previous studies have found that desulfuromonas can provide electrons in the sulfur reduction process to speed up the sulfur cycle 45 the average relative abundance of geobacter phylum proteobacteria in pa 1 17 was higher than that in pa 0 19 geobacter is a heterotrophic bacterium which contains the genetic sequence of nitrite reductase for sulfite reduction 46 desulfuromonas is closely related to geobacter which belong to order desulfuromonadales desulfuromonas is a member of incompletely oxidizing srb geobacter utilizes acetate as an electron donor which is produced during desulfuromonas metabolism process 41 a syntrophic relationship between desulfuromonas and geobacter may exist microbes decompose organic matter to obtain electrons for sulfate reduction 47 the result indicated that some bacteria closely related to carbon metabolism were found in cws with iws the average relative abundance of anaerolineaceae phylum chloroflexi in pa 4 61 and ct 0 66 was 6 98 and 1 06 times than those in pa 0 50 and ct 0 47 respectively jia et al 34 reported that anaerolineaceae is the major family to hydrocarbons degradation in anaerobic environments the average relative abundance of lysobacter phylum proteobacteria in pa 1 34 and ct 1 96 was significantly higher than that in pa 0 09 and ct 0 49 p 0 05 lysobacter is highly proteolytic and metabolizes with citric acid as a carbon source 48 pseudomonas phylum proteobacteria had an average relative abundance of 2 44 in ct which was 3 75 times that of ct 0 65 no significant difference was found in the relative abundance of pseudomonas in pa 1 70 and pa 1 99 p 0 05 pseudomonas is facultative chemoautotrophic bacteria that can degrade cellulose which can utilize various electron donors e g organic carbon h2 or reductive vulcanization compounds 49 burkholderiaceae phylum proteobacteria were the dominant bacteria in pa 2 70 pa 5 29 ct 8 05 and ct 9 69 burkholderiaceae play crucial roles in carbon conversion 32 amaricoccus phylum proteobacteria in ct 2 35 were 3 05 times of that in ct 0 77 saccharimonadia phylum patescibacteria with a relative abundance of 1 60 were found in ct which exhibited 1 26 times more than that in ct 1 27 these strains were less than 0 1 in pa saccharimonadia can degrade carbon under anaerobic conditions 50 previous studies have reported that amaricoccus can participate in polyhydroxybutyrate storage 51 the average relative abundance of flavobacterium phylum proteobacteria accounted for 1 06 4 12 2 50 and 2 28 in pa pa ct and ct respectively and these strains could degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 52 the results showed that the average relative abundance of burkholderiaceae saccharimonadia amaricoccus and flavobacterium in cw iws was lower than that of cws without iws 3 3 topological function and co occurrence network of microbial communities the key topological characteristics of the microbial community are presented in table s2 and table s3 and the degree distribution of the microbial community structure is shown in fig s1 the type of network was scale free which has the property of robustness 53 the modularization value and closeness centrality value of the empirical network 0 3855 157 8138 were higher than those of the random network 0 0606 0 0010 12 1706 0 6634 respectively the empirical network was considered significantly clustered and modular the result indicated that a tight network existed among the microbial communities 18 moreover the average path length of pa 2 30 and ct 2 48 was shorter than that of pa 2 61 and ct 2 57 previous research has found that the short path lengths between microbes accelerate the exchange of matter energy and information 54 thus the microbial metabolic activity in pa and ct was faster than that in pa and ct in cw systems the zi pi plot is described in fig 5 zi and pi score values are topological indexes indicating keystone species 55 the majority of the nodes 95 67 fell into peripherals specialists zi 2 5 and 0 pi 0 62 the other nodes 4 33 were located in module hubs and connector generalists zi 2 5 and 0 pi 0 62 or zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 including 1 32 that belonged to module hubs and 3 01 that belonged to connectors no network hubs were identified super generalists zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 the keystone species in the module hubs play an important role in maintaining ecosystem stability 18 nineteen module hubs were observed which mainly belonged to class thermoleophilia phylum actinobacteria order rhodobacterales phylum proteobacteria order rhizobiale phylum proteobacteria order tistrellales phylum proteobacteria order thermomicrobiales phylum chloroflexi and genus nitrospira phylum nitrospirae table s4 these keystone microorganisms belonging to aerobic and heterotrophic organic decomposers can adapt to complex environmental systems and release metabolites to feed plants and other organisms 17 previous studies have showed that some members of rhodobacterales can use hydrogen sulfide as an electron acceptor for photoautotrophic growth which can prevent the accumulation of hydrogen sulfide 56 rhizobiales play vital roles in providing nitrogen nutrients to systems 57 the stress resistance of keystone genera has also been found in key species thermoleophilia preform unusual adaptation to frigid temperatures 58 nitrospira and tistrellales tend to aid in water purification 59 a previous study stated that thermomicrobiales is known as the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and have high tolerance for radiation and high temperatures 60 tistrellales and thermomicrobiales had a low relative abundance 1 these results indicated that some keystone members of low abundance taxa could play more essential role in maintaining the function of material circulation and resisting the disturbance than some abundant genera this finding is in accordance with that of wang et al 26 who confirmed that some low abundance microorganisms display active roles in driving functions and community composition the microbial correlations among the top 50 asv otu of average sample abundance are shown in fig 6 the bacteria of carbon and sulfur metabolism were closely connected in the network such bacteria included thauera phylum proteobacteria flavobacterium phylum bacteroidetes unclassified burkholderiaceae phylum proteobacteria unclassified desulfuromonadaceae phylum proteobacteria azoarcus phylum proteobacteria and pseudomonas phylum proteobacteria flavobacterium had a positive correlation with thauera and unclassified burkholderiaceae flavobacterium and thauera belong to denitrifying bacteria which utilize organic substance for reaction 34 61 thauera can also use sulfide as an electron donor for denitrification under the tolerance of salinity 62 flavobacterium and thauera were spread out in the same modules which can denitrify through different electron donors to avoid competition 63 unclassified burkholderiaceae were located in different modules with flavobacterium and thauera unclassified burkholderiaceae which belong to nitrite oxidizing bacteria can reduce nitrite via nitrification 64 flavobacterium and thauera cooperate to promote the nitrogen cycle within the system the result showed that pseudomonas was positively correlated with amaricoccus pseudomonas and amaricoccus are associated with the degradation of organic matter which belong to the same module having an intimate relationship 49 51 recent research has reported that pseudomonas can perform autotrophic metabolism during carbon source restriction 49 amaricoccus synthesizes storage polymers e g phb which is beneficial for the supply nutrients to the systems in a highly stressful ecosystem 65 the finding showed that pseudomonas and amaricoccus had cross feeding and cooperation in the network unclassified desulfuromonadaceae had a negative correlation with thauera flavobacterium and unclassified burkholderiaceae the metabolic activities of these strains compete for the organic matter and living space in the cw systems for survival wang et al 2020b desulfuromonadaceae are a major family of srb and the metabolism of sulfate in desulfuromonadaceae is divided into sulfate transport sulfate activation adenosine phosphosulphate aps reduction and sulfite reduction 9 10 desulfuromonadaceae can compete with thauera flavobacterium and unclassified burkholderiaceae for carbon sources as electron donors in the process of aps reduction and sulfite reduction which inhibits sulfate removal therefore reducing the abundance of thauera flavobacterium and unclassified burkholderiaceae might enhance the adaptability of unclassified desulfuromonadaceae with conditions of restricted carbon source availability 45 lysobacter and unclassified saccharimonadales which were distributed in different modules had a negative correlation unclassified saccharimonadales affect the degradation of organic compounds at aerobic or facultative anaerobic conditions 50 other studies have concluded that lysobacter can secrete numerous extracellular enzymes such as lipohydrolysase and chitinase and have a strong bacteriolytic property 66 thus it can be concluded that amensalism exists between lysobacter and unclassified saccharimonadales 67 the study found that the relative abundance of lysobacte was higher in iws cw whereas unclassified saccharimonadales had a lower abundance in iws cw fig 4 this result may be due to the srb having a strong role in competing with unclassified saccharimonadales for electron donors in the iws cw system 50 hence lysobacter can replace unclassified scharimonadales in the system to reduce the competition with srb for electron receptors the above results indicated that the complex co occurrence network of microorganisms was formed through elemental metabolite relationships which is a strategy to cope with salinity stress and is beneficial to the stability of microbial communities in cws 35 4 conclusion in this study sulfate removal was inhibited whereas cod removal increased under a high sulfate stress iws as microbial inoculants introduced considerable srb sob and carbon consuming bacteria which are closely related to the carbon and sulfur cycles the keystone bacteria in the system had important functions in providing nutrients e g rhizobiales responding to extreme environments e g thermoleophilia and thermolicrobiales and restoring aquatic environments e g rhodobacterales nitrospira and tistrellales in addition the carbon metabolizing bacteria in the same module established the relationships of cooperation and cross feeding by utilizing different substances to metabolize and adapt to the stress environment together however some strain e g lysobacter may release substance that inhibit the survival of other carbon metabolizing strain e g unclassified scharimonadales in addition sulfate metabolizing bacteria and carbon consuming bacteria in different modules compete for electron donors during sulfate reduction declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

13383,seawater and bilge water samples were used to isolate hydrocarbon degrading bacteria to be screened for biosurfactant production in the presence of different carbon sources namely tetradecane d glucose and sunflower oil the panel of tested isolates affiliated to alcanivorax acinetobacter pseudomonas halomonas and marinobacter genera showed promising results both in terms of emulsifying activity and surface tension reduction the selected strains marinobacter sp bic3m3 alcanivorax sp bic1a5 and halomonas sp bic1h44 achieved total raw biosurfactant amount of 3 148 2 922 and 2 596 g l respectively the sunflower oil here proposed as low cost carbon source was successfully used by all strains as substrate for biosurfactant production with the only exception of halomonas sp bic1h44 while different efficiency levels were detected during incubation in the presence of glucose and tetradecane among all strains marinobacter spp strains from bilge waters were proven to be very competitive although this genus has been poorly reported for biosurfactant production the high efficiency exhibited by some strains especially alcanivorax sp bic1a5 acinetobacter sp bic1ac and marinobacter sp bic3m3 during growth with tetradecane and sunflower oil suggested a promising potential for application in bioremediation purposes and hydrocarbon enriched wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biosurfactants bilge water sunflower oil emulsification hydrophobicity 1 introduction the release of bilge water bw into the sea is one of the major inputs of contaminants and hydrocarbons also considered as more impactful than accidental oil spills 1 4 bw is a complex mixture of seawater fuels lubricating oil cleaning diesel oil oily sludge spills from engine room cooling water and other miscellaneous chemicals accumulated in the bottom of the ships and deriving from machinery leakage and washing waters 5 7 the legislation concerning the landfill of untreated bw into the sea has been revised for many years up to the absolute ban by the international maritime organization regulation imo 8 today it is established that the petroleum hydrocarbon content for commercial and armed forced vessels discharges should not exceed 15 ppm as regulated by marpol annex i and for armed forces vessels dod regulation 4715 06 v2 u s dod 2017 several treatment methods i e membrane separation electrocoagulation centrifugation chemical agents are used 9 11 but they imply operational overheads 12 moreover the use of chemicals is harmful and involves additional treatments before the release into the environment 13 the severe provisions settled by marpol reflect the urgent need of alternative and innovative technologies for a cost efficient and ecofriendly treatment of bilge wastewaters in this direction the isolation of native bw microorganisms could be a source of unknown taxa suitable for biological treatment and biosurfactant bs production 13 15 with possible implications in wastewater treatment bss are considered potential green alternative to chemical surfactants for numerous industrial marketable products and for a myriad of applications in several fields i e agri food pharmaceutical bioremediative 16 during last decades several bioprospecting studies have been focused on bs production but the applied approaches remain qualitatively and quantitatively limited many efforts have been devoted to the cultivation of already widely studied bacterial strains sacrificing the search for new resources and therefore the possibility of discovering new producers and chemical structures another critical point regards the production times and costs which still make poorly competitive the employment of bss for large scale production therefore the exploration of new possible sources and the optimization of production conditions through the use of raw economic substrates is considered a key approach in the field although there are conflicting opinions on the actual correlation between cell hydrophobicity biodegradation efficiency and bs production 17 some scientific contributions have provided evidences of correlation between hydrocarbon degradation and bs production 18 20 indeed hydrocarbon degrading bacteria have been proven to be very promising as their ability to use hydrocarbons as the sole carbon source could be mediated by bss allowing the assimilation of the insoluble compounds 21 therefore oil contaminated matrices containing large amounts of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons still represent a valuable source for the isolation of bs producing microorganisms this work was aimed at investigating hydrocarbon oxidizing bacteria isolated from poorly explored bw and from seawater sw for bs production and for their possible exploitation in the bioremediation field including enhancement of current technology on bw treatment the screening for bs production was performed by using different carbon sources including sunflower oil as a suitable and effective low cost alternative substrate 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains bw and sw depth 10 m samples were aseptically collected by using pre

in glass tubes the emulsification percentage was measured after 1 min of stabilization 29 for the detection of stable emulsion production e24 a 2 ml portion of each culture was added to 2 ml of kerosene petroleum ether panreac as test oil and the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 2 min after 24 h the emulsification index e24 was calculated by dividing the measured height of the emulsion layer by the total height of the mixture and multiplying by 100 30 uninoculated cultures were used as negative controls while a chemical anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate was used as positive control the c tab agar method 31 and blood agar assay ba 32 were carried out to detect production of anionic biosurfactants and potential hemolytic activity respectively 2 3 3 bacterial adhesion to

biosurfactant production results obtained from the screening procedure are summarized in table 2 where maximum percentage of ea and e24 initial and final st values sti and stf and maximum percentage of bath assay are highlighted in bold generally all strains provided positive results to the screening tests with particular regard for the ea the c tab and ba assays recorded positivity only in limited cases due to the large amount of data details on most relevant results are reported in the following sections 3 2 1 emulsifying activity all the strains from sw samples were able to grow in onr tet with the only exception of the isolate pseudomonas sp bic1p7 that showed lower od values fig 1 c i an optimal growth was generally observed for all strains in onr oil this was particularly evident for acinetobacter sp bic1ac fig 1d ii glucose was proven to be a good carbon source for pseudomonas sp bic1p7 marinobacter spp bic3m3 and bic5m1 while no growth was observed for acinetobacter

pronounced interface ability during incubation with in onr tet and onr glu and only six strains reduced st when grown in onr glu the most evident interfacial action during growth with hydrocarburic substrates were obtained for acinetobacter strains with a st reduction from 55 2 mn m to 35 5 mn m by acinetobacter sp bic1ac and a reduction from 53 mn m to 35 9 mn m by acinetobacter sp bic2a47 a moderate activity reduction of 5 7 and 4 8 mn m for acinetobacter sp bic1ac and acinetobacter sp bic2a47 respectively was also evidenced in onr oil alcanivorax strains produced a reduction of about 8 mn m units during growth in onr tet and 5 mn m units in onr oil among marinobacter spp isolates bic2m32 and bic3m3 showed most remarkable results with the highest st of 19 9 mn m units from 55 9 mn m

hydrocarbon assay bath only some isolates showed adhesion percentage values from the hydrophobicity assay during the screening procedure fig 4 shows the comparison between hydrophobicity and the correspondent e24 indices acinetobacter sp bic1ac showed the highest hydrophobic affinity 80 after 144 h of incubation in onr oil coinciding with the highest ea index of 80 at the same time and a e24 10 while lower affinity was observed in onr tet differently acinetobacter sp bic2a47 achieved a value of 45 of hydrocarbon affinity coinciding with an e24 of 57 7 at 144 h of incubation in onr tet the hydrophobicity percentage of alcanivorax sp bic1a5 achieved the maximum of 48 after 144 h in onr tet when e24 index was about 36 while a percentage affinity of 49 was exhibited in onr oil coinciding with an e24 index of 25 8 all the isolates affiliated to marinobacter didn t show remarkable affinity toward insoluble substrates with only some exceptions in which a bath percentage of around 20 30 was recorded i e marinobacter sp bic4m3b with affinity of 20 and concomitant e24 38 5 and marinobacter sp bic5m1 with affinity of 16 and concomitant e24 of 23 7 in onr tet data not shown pseudomonas sp bic2p44 and pseudomonas sp bic1p7 obtained maximum bath indices of 59 4 and 54 in onr oil respectively halomonas sp bic1h44 showed a maximum hydrocarbon affinity of 28 when incubated in onr tet concomitant to the start of the emulsifying activity 3 2 4 supplementary tests table 3 shows the results obtained from the c tab and ba assays among sw isolates blue halos were observed when using supernatants of pseudomonas sp bic1p7 from onr oil with regard to bw samples acinetobacter strains halomonas sp bic1h44 and marinobacter sp bic1m9 supernatants obtained from onr oil cultures and only marinobacter sp bic2m32 supernatants from onr glu cultures produced blue halos haemolytic activity was evidenced as greenish or clarification halos alpha and beta haemolysis respectively around the supernatant drop on ba medium supernatants obtained from onr oil cultures of both acinetobacter spp strains from sw and bw showed alpha haemolysis but in the case of acinetobacter sp bic1ac alpha haemolysis was evidenced also for supernatant from onr tet cultures only the alcanivorax member isolated from bw bic2a5 showed beta haemolysis after growth in onr tet marinobacter spp bic1m9 bic4m3b and bic3m3 produced greenish halos during growth in onr tet while marinobacter sp bic2m32 during growth in onr glu alpha and beta haemolysis were both highlighted for pseudomonas strains as follows pseudomonas sp bic1p7 supernatants obtained from onr oil and onr glu cultures produced alpha and beta haemolysis respectively pseudomonas sp bic2p44 produced alpha haemolysis during growth in onr tet while beta haemolysis was shown during growth in onr glu and onr oil halomonas sp bic1h44 and marinobacter sp bic5m1 supernatants showed no haemolytic activity 3 3 statistical analyses one way anova was performed on od data to check differences between growth values in the presence of the three carbon sources per strain and between all the strains in dependence on the carbon source the results highlighted some significant differences in the use of the different carbon sources per strain specifically in the case of marinobacter sp bic1m9 and bic2m32 growth in in onr tet was significantly lower than growth in onr oil respectively p 0 05 bic4m3b growth in onr glu resulted significantly lower than growth in onr oil p 0 05 in addition the growth of the two pseudomonas strains was significantly lower in onr tet and onr oil p 0 05 halomonas sp bic1h44 growth values resulted significant different respect to those of all other isolates with a growth significantly higher in all growth conditions p 0 05 while no significant differences were detected between strains in the ea some differences occurred by comparing the average ea from each strain on the different carbon sources indeed the emulsion production resulted significantly higher for the strains halomonas sp bic1h44 marinobacter spp bic4m3b and bic3m3 during growth in onr tet than in onr oil and onr glu p 0 05 similarly no differences occurred between strains in the production of e24 and in the st reduction but in some cases the e24 produced by strains during growth in onr tet resulted significantly higher in comparison with those obtained under the other culture conditions i e marinobacter sp bic3m3 and bic4m3b alcanivorax sp bic1a5 halomonas sp bic1h44 and acinetobacter sp bic1ac and overall the st resulted significantly reduced during growth in in onr tet p 0 05 no significant differences were evidenced between hydrophobicity level between strains and carbon sources as resulted from the one way anova the entire dataset average values of emulsions stable emulsions hydrophobicity percentage and the global surface tension reduction was used to perform the pca in fig 5 the spatial distribution of strains showed mostly a grouping according to the phylogenetic affiliation as in the case of pseudomonas spp marinobacter spp and acinetobacter spp strains forming a cluster with 80 of similarities differently the strain alcanivorax sp bic2a5 marinobacter sp bic2m32 and halomonas sp bic1h44 grouped alone the two main components explained the 69 1 of the total variance with the first component explaining the 49 7 of the total variance and mainly influenced by emulsion and e24 produced in the presence of glucose and the second components accounting for the 19 4 and influenced mainly by the hydrophobicity values in the presence of oil negatively correlated 3 4 biosurfactant extraction on the basis of results from the screening procedure three strains i e halomonas sp bic1h44 alcanivorax sp bic1a5 and marinobacter sp bic3m3 were selected to perform the bs extraction halomonas sp bic1h44 was chosen thanks to overall promising results and versatility in the use of different carbon sources alcanivorax sp bic1a5 was further analyzed due to promising results in both onr tet and in onr oil and to its phylogenetic affiliation strongly related to a well known hydrocarbon degradation ability finally marinobacter sp bic3m3 produced the highest e24 in onr tet the higher yield of extracted bss was obtained from marinobacter sp bic3m3 quantified as 3 148 g l during its exponential phase alcanivorax sp bic1a5 achieved a bs amount of 2 922 g l while a total of 2 596 g l of bs was obtained from halomonas sp bic1h44 cultures the bs produced from alcanivorax sp bic1a5 was used for a bw degradation experiment 3 5 microcosm biodegradation experiment in the microcosm m1 the maximum bacterial density was achieved after four days of incubation od600 0 867 and the st value was reduced up to 10 9 mn m the maximum e24 and hydrophobicity percentages were 21 8 and 25 respectively the microcosms m2 achieved a maximum of optical density od600 0 436 after one week while st was reduced to 12 1 mn m after thirty days of incubation the e24 production after 15 days of incubation was of 22 64 while maximum hydrophobicity percentage was of 4 after 15 days of incubation 3 6 microtox r test the ec50 value in the microcosms with bs addition showed a slight increase with values of 52 and 59 after 15 and 30 days of incubation and a reduction of 52 in the level of toxicity the microcosm used as control showed an increase of ec50 of 41 and 47 after 15 and 30 days of incubation respectively with a reduction of toxicity level of 40 respect to the initial value 4 discussion the isolation from polluted systems of native microorganisms with the capacity to degrade contaminants or to produce bioactive molecules with contaminant removal potential is an intriguing approach which could provide novel insights in bioremediation strategies the present work assessed two central aspects of bs production by using bacteria isolated from seawater and bilge water the exploration of peculiar sources for the isolation of bs producing strains and the possible use of low cost alternative as suitable substrates the bws are very complex and heterogeneous systems whose high variability could represent a good tool for the isolation of a wide spectrum of bacterial isolates with great specificity and ability to degrade numerous petroleum hydrocarbons 39 the isolation of oil degrading strains from bw has been recently explored by several authors 39 42 who reported rhodococcus acinetobacter pseudomonas bacillus and halomonas as main representative taxa in the field the phylogenetic characterization revealed isolates with taxonomical affiliations mostly reported in the field of bs production 43 46 such as pseudomonas alcanivorax and acinetobacter members the focus on hydrocarbon degrading isolates by using selective culture media for isolation that already have a high potential in terms of bs production 21 made the screening procedure more rapid by discriminating possible isolates not useful for the purpose and reducing the employment of resources during the experimentation the results obtained from the screening procedure appeared very diversified differently correlated to the bacterial affiliation and or to the carbon source considered since the strategy chosen for this research was to quickly obtain a picture of the bs production potential of sw and bw isolates it was preferred to make a close selection during the isolation step nevertheless results provided a detailed time courses progress of the main selected parameters emulsion production and interface activity throughout the growth of the isolates the carbon source is one of the most important parameter affecting the bs production as numerous studies have shown a direct influence on the bs composition even if the hydrocarbon uptake is not ever considered a determinant factor for the bacterial bs production 17 47 overall strains isolated from bw samples resulted most promising when grown in the presence of tetradecane especially in terms of ea and e24 exceptions were pseudomonas spp strains which showed promising results in both onr glu and onr oil thus confirming a huge potential in large scale production with perspectives of lower production costs the case of the two pseudomonas strains which interestingly showed different patterns in terms of bs production efficiency suggested the involvement of specie specific differences or a correlation with the origin of the strains thus supporting the use of bilge water as a source of native microorganisms with potential in the field indeed the strain bic2p44 which showed higher performance in the presence of tetradecane derived from bw sample thus probably resulting better specialized in the use of hydrocarbon substrates for growth as it was expected the better performances of alcanivorax spp strains were recorded during growth with tetradecane but interestingly the sunflower oil resulted a good substrate too probably due to the hydrophobic nature of the compound in the presence of sunflower oil all strains showed a good ea but they didn t produce e24 this could be due to the production of a surfactant with a moderate action or to a lower amount of it as the emulsion stability could designate the bs strength 48 or its concentration 31 the glucose was better used by pseudomonas sp bic1p7 halomonas sp bic1h44 marinobacter spp bic2m32 and bic3m3 the different efficiency of here reported bss in terms of surface tension reducers or emulsion stabilizing agents led to hypothesize the possible production of polymers with high as in the case of halomonas sp bic1h44 and alcanivorax isolates more effective in ea or low as for pseudomonas strains more able in st reduction molecular weights 49 51 interestingly acinetobacter sp bic1ac showed optimal results in terms of high e24 and hydrophobicity the genus acinetobacter is well known for the production of a potent bioemulsifier the emulsan 52 which could explain the high hydrophobicity rate of the strain species of acinetobacter has been reported as player of an important role in hydrocarbon pollution remediation 53 recently two acinetobacter members isolated from bw exhibited excellent crude oil removal capacity and good emulsification and interfacial activity during growth in mineral medium supplemented with tetradecane 54 halomonas sp was reported as producer of a glycoprotein with emulsifying activity by gutiérrez et al 55 in line with what reported for other halomonas spp strains isolated from bw samples 39 our results confirmed the optimal ea and oil degrading capacity this aspect is strongly interesting as halomonas members take the additional advantage to be able to produce specific enzymes and metabolites 54 56 thus increasing their suitable application for the industrial field contrastingly few references are available about marinobacter as bs producers 54 recently a marinobacter sp strain associated with sabellids was reported as bs producer and with higher bs in limiting conditions of salinity 49 50 for this reason the results obtained in this study were very surprising with marinobacter bic3m3 the best producer of e24 finally results obtained from the semi qualitative assay for detection of extracellular glycolipids or other anionic surfactants c tab agar plate showed that the specificity of this test allowed to a limited number of positive responses on the contrary ba assay showed diversified results by highlighting different types of hemolytic activity among tested strains these findings were in line and confirmed previous assessments namely that they could be used as additional tests as fairly inexpensive and easy to use 49 50 the spatial distribution of isolates determined by the pca fig 5 reveals details on the screening test response the separation of the strains alcanivorax sp bic2a5 and marinobacter sp bic2m32 could be due to the low hydrophobicity exhibited by these strains in comparison with the other isolates differently halomonas sp bic1h44 showed the lowest emulsification and e24 values during growth in the presence of sunflower oil the isolation of native bw microorganisms with ability to degrade hydrocarbon and produce bss could have important implications also for the wastewater treatment and in cleaning processes 15 to test the potential of obtained bs microcosm biodegradation experiment was attempted with the bs produced by alcanivorax sp bic1a5 the use of a selection of bs producers and the addition of natural bs have been proved as really promising in terms of e24 and st reduction the possibility of using a defined microbial consortium as specialized group of microorganisms capable of sequestering and degrading the main polluting compounds present in bw seems to be a winning proposal in the search for new disposal techniques the approach involving a group of microorganisms instead of single isolates lies on the theory for which it is interesting combine the innate resistance with resistances and degradation skills stimulated in consequence of environmental stress phenomena or artificially induced in the laboratory indeed single microorganisms could degrade a strict range of hydrocarbons while a consortium could gain a wider enzymatic spectrum able to extend the biodegradation level anyway the addition of bs led to a sensible improvement of biodegradation processes as supported by the ec50 values used as indirect measure of biodegradation process by demonstrating that the initial toxicity decisively decreased in the both microcosms and at higher level with bs addition with the possibility of owning on board the proper structures to optimize the degrading conditions of the autochthonous microflora and the added consortium this proposed biotechnological application could become even more interesting and efficient with economic benefits and environmental issues of great concern 5 conclusions the study contributes to the existing knowledge on the use of bw as a source of bs producing strains and highlights some aspects related to the use of low cost substrates for biosynthesis processes the results obtained by strains growing with addition of sunflower oil confirm the possibility to use it as a low cost alternative but it is necessary to furtherly improve the knowledge for an optimal application the use of industrial and or municipal wastewaters or of raw substrates with negligible value is suggested to achieve a double benefit of reducing the pollutants while producing useful products further studies are necessary for a better comprehension of the consortium dynamics and for the exact determination of hydrocarbon removal the implications at economic and environmental level are really promising many of the major shipping companies use multiple membranes filtration systems to reduce at least the presence of coarse material and suspended sludge and as bw pre treatment although the effectiveness of these systems clogging and maintenance could cause even higher costs than expected the involvement of biological treatment by using lyophilized microbial consortia could be thought as complementary solutions to the normal physical mechanical abatement techniques in order to solve the problem and cut the costs further studies are in progress to scale up growth conditions and bs production of native bw isolates the following is the supplementary data related to this article table s1 selection of bacterial strains as

13383,seawater and bilge water samples were used to isolate hydrocarbon degrading bacteria to be screened for biosurfactant production in the presence of different carbon sources namely tetradecane d glucose and sunflower oil the panel of tested isolates affiliated to alcanivorax acinetobacter pseudomonas halomonas and marinobacter genera showed promising results both in terms of emulsifying activity and surface tension reduction the selected strains marinobacter sp bic3m3 alcanivorax sp bic1a5 and halomonas sp bic1h44 achieved total raw biosurfactant amount of 3 148 2 922 and 2 596 g l respectively the sunflower oil here proposed as low cost carbon source was successfully used by all strains as substrate for biosurfactant production with the only exception of halomonas sp bic1h44 while different efficiency levels were detected during incubation in the presence of glucose and tetradecane among all strains marinobacter spp strains from bilge waters were proven to be very competitive although this genus has been poorly reported for biosurfactant production the high efficiency exhibited by some strains especially alcanivorax sp bic1a5 acinetobacter sp bic1ac and marinobacter sp bic3m3 during growth with tetradecane and sunflower oil suggested a promising potential for application in bioremediation purposes and hydrocarbon enriched wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biosurfactants bilge water sunflower oil emulsification hydrophobicity 1 introduction the release of bilge water bw into the sea is one of the major inputs of contaminants and hydrocarbons also considered as more impactful than accidental oil spills 1 4 bw is a complex mixture of seawater fuels lubricating oil cleaning diesel oil oily sludge spills from engine room cooling water and other miscellaneous chemicals accumulated in the bottom of the ships and deriving from machinery leakage and washing waters 5 7 the legislation concerning the landfill of untreated bw into the sea has been revised for many years up to the absolute ban by the international maritime organization regulation imo 8 today it is established that the petroleum hydrocarbon content for commercial and armed forced vessels discharges should not exceed 15 ppm as regulated by marpol annex i and for armed forces vessels dod regulation 4715 06 v2 u s dod 2017 several treatment methods i e membrane separation electrocoagulation centrifugation chemical agents are used 9 11 but they imply operational overheads 12 moreover the use of chemicals is harmful and involves additional treatments before the release into the environment 13 the severe provisions settled by marpol reflect the urgent need of alternative and innovative technologies for a cost efficient and ecofriendly treatment of bilge wastewaters in this direction the isolation of native bw microorganisms could be a source of unknown taxa suitable for biological treatment and biosurfactant bs production 13 15 with possible implications in wastewater treatment bss are considered potential green alternative to chemical surfactants for numerous industrial marketable products and for a myriad of applications in several fields i e agri food pharmaceutical bioremediative 16 during last decades several bioprospecting studies have been focused on bs production but the applied approaches remain qualitatively and quantitatively limited many efforts have been devoted to the cultivation of already widely studied bacterial strains sacrificing the search for new resources and therefore the possibility of discovering new producers and chemical structures another critical point regards the production times and costs which still make poorly competitive the employment of bss for large scale production therefore the exploration of new possible sources and the optimization of production conditions through the use of raw economic substrates is considered a key approach in the field although there are conflicting opinions on the actual correlation between cell hydrophobicity biodegradation efficiency and bs production 17 some scientific contributions have provided evidences of correlation between hydrocarbon degradation and bs production 18 20 indeed hydrocarbon degrading bacteria have been proven to be very promising as their ability to use hydrocarbons as the sole carbon source could be mediated by bss allowing the assimilation of the insoluble compounds 21 therefore oil contaminated matrices containing large amounts of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons still represent a valuable source for the isolation of bs producing microorganisms this work was aimed at investigating hydrocarbon oxidizing bacteria isolated from poorly explored bw and from seawater sw for bs production and for their possible exploitation in the bioremediation field including enhancement of current technology on bw treatment the screening for bs production was performed by using different carbon sources including sunflower oil as a suitable and effective low cost alternative substrate 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains bw and sw depth 10 m samples were aseptically collected by using pre

was checked manually corrected and then analyzed using the neighbour joining method 26 according to the model of jukes cantor distances 2 3 biosurfactant production 2 3 1 culture conditions strains were pre grown at 25 c until an optical density od600 uv mini 1240 shimadzu of 0 5 0 6 a preculture aliquot 10 v v was used to inoculate 50 ml of onr7a supplemented with three different carbon sources

in glass tubes the emulsification percentage was measured after 1 min of stabilization 29 for the detection of stable emulsion production e24 a 2 ml portion of each culture was added to 2 ml of kerosene petroleum ether panreac as test oil and the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 2 min after 24 h the emulsification index e24 was calculated by dividing the measured height of the emulsion

2 4 biosurfactant extraction basing on results from ea and e24 tests bs extraction was performed from most promising bs producing isolates i e alcanivorax sp bic1a5 and marinobacter sp bic3m3 from sw

in onr oil fig 1d e ii alcanivorax sp produced the highest e24 when inoculated in onr tet fig 1e i while pseudomonas sp bic1p7 produced e24 only during growth in onr glu with a maximum e24 index of 61 7 after 120 of incubation fig 1c iii among bw isolates halomonas sp bic1h44 grew well under all tested conditions fig 2 e marinobacter strains i e bic1m9 bic2m32 and bic4m3b were generally able to grow with all carbon sources with higher extent in onr oil fig 2a c ii acinetobacter sp bic2a47 and alcanivorax sp bic2a5 didn t grow in onr glu fig 2f g but they were able to use tetradecane and sunflower oil similarly pseudomonas sp bic2p44 achieved higher values of od during growth in onr oil even if it showed good profiles also in the presence of tetradecane and glucose all strains exhibited ea ranging from 16 alcanivorax sp bic2a5 in onr tet to 100 under at least one of the growth conditions tested the only exception was represented by halomonas sp bic1h44 that although having good growth in onr oil did not show ea nor e24 fig 2e ii similarly to sw isolates the ea followed the growth value profiles reaching higher percentages near or in concomitance with the exponential phase overall the production of e24 by all strains occurred at higher extent during growth in onr tet with e24 of 58 and 55 for acinetobacter sp bic2a47 and alcanivorax bic2a5 fig 2f g i among marinobacter isolates the highest e24 were produced by marinobacter spp bic2m32 and bic4m3b during growth in onr tet and onr glu fig 2b c i and iii in detail marinobacter sp bic2m32 achieved an e24 of 58 3 with both substrates while marinobacter sp bic3m3b achieved an e24 of 57 and 21 1 in onr tet and onr glu fig 2b c i iii marinobacter sp bic1m9 achieved an e24 of 11 4 9 2 and 27 9 during incubation in onr tet onr oil and onr glu respectively fig 2a pseudomonas sp bic2p44 produced e24 in onr tet and onr glu with maximum values of 3 7 and 12 1 respectively fig 2d i iii halomonas sp bic1h44 showed better performance in onr tet with e24 of 54 5 while in onr glu achieved an e24 of 42 3 no stable emulsions were produced in onr oil fig 2e i iii 3 2 2 surface tension the st reduction values reported in table 2 and shown in fig 3 are expressed as the difference between st value at the beginning and end of the incubation period for all isolates overall the strains showed most pronounced interface ability during incubation with in onr tet and onr glu and only six strains reduced st when grown in onr glu the most evident interfacial action during growth with hydrocarburic substrates were obtained for acinetobacter strains with a st reduction from 55 2 mn m to 35 5 mn m by acinetobacter sp bic1ac and a reduction from 53 mn m to 35 9 mn m by acinetobacter sp bic2a47 a moderate activity reduction of 5 7 and 4 8 mn m for acinetobacter sp bic1ac and acinetobacter sp bic2a47 respectively was also evidenced in onr oil alcanivorax strains produced a reduction of about 8 mn m units during growth in onr tet and 5 mn m units in onr oil among marinobacter spp isolates bic2m32 and bic3m3 showed most remarkable results with the highest st of 19 9 mn m units from 55 9 mn m to 36 mn m and 18 3 mn m from 58 5 mn m to 40 2 mn m in onr tet and onr glu respectively in the case of growth in onr oil the st resulted better reduced by pseudomonas strains from 56 to 42 4 mn m for strain bic1p7 and from 56 9 to 40 7 mn m for bic2p44 strain pseudomonas strains bic1p7 and bic2p44 reduced optimally the st also in onr glu with a reduction of 19 7 and 13 7 mn m finally halomonas sp bic1h44 reduced surface tension from 55 1 mn m to 43 5 mn m in onr tet while no remarkable interfacial activity was evidenced during growth with the other carbon sources 3 2 3 bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon assay bath only some isolates showed adhesion percentage values from the hydrophobicity assay during the screening procedure fig 4 shows the comparison between hydrophobicity and the correspondent e24 indices acinetobacter sp bic1ac showed the highest hydrophobic affinity 80 after 144 h of incubation in onr oil coinciding with the highest ea index of 80 at the same time and a e24 10 while lower affinity was observed in onr tet differently acinetobacter sp bic2a47 achieved a value of 45 of hydrocarbon affinity coinciding with an e24 of 57 7 at 144 h of incubation in onr tet the hydrophobicity percentage of alcanivorax sp bic1a5 achieved the maximum of 48 after 144 h in onr tet when e24 index was about 36 while a percentage affinity of 49 was exhibited in onr oil coinciding with an e24 index of 25 8 all the isolates affiliated to marinobacter didn t show remarkable affinity toward insoluble substrates with only some exceptions in which a bath percentage of around 20 30 was recorded i e marinobacter sp bic4m3b with affinity of 20 and concomitant e24 38 5 and marinobacter sp bic5m1 with affinity of 16 and concomitant e24 of 23 7 in onr tet data not shown pseudomonas sp bic2p44 and pseudomonas sp bic1p7 obtained maximum bath indices of 59 4 and 54 in onr oil respectively halomonas sp bic1h44 showed a maximum hydrocarbon affinity of 28 when incubated in onr tet concomitant to the start of the emulsifying activity 3 2 4 supplementary tests table 3 shows the results obtained from the c tab and ba assays among sw isolates blue halos were observed when using supernatants of pseudomonas sp bic1p7 from onr oil with regard to bw samples acinetobacter strains halomonas sp bic1h44 and marinobacter sp bic1m9 supernatants obtained from onr oil cultures and only marinobacter sp bic2m32 supernatants from onr glu cultures produced blue halos haemolytic activity was evidenced as greenish or clarification halos alpha and beta haemolysis respectively around the supernatant drop on ba medium supernatants obtained from onr oil cultures of both acinetobacter spp strains from sw and bw showed alpha haemolysis but in the case of acinetobacter sp bic1ac alpha haemolysis was evidenced also for supernatant from onr tet cultures only the alcanivorax member isolated from bw bic2a5 showed beta haemolysis after growth in onr tet marinobacter spp bic1m9 bic4m3b and bic3m3 produced greenish halos during growth in onr tet while marinobacter sp bic2m32 during growth in onr glu alpha and beta haemolysis were both highlighted for pseudomonas strains as follows pseudomonas sp bic1p7 supernatants obtained from onr oil and onr glu cultures produced alpha and beta haemolysis respectively pseudomonas sp bic2p44 produced alpha haemolysis during growth in onr tet while beta haemolysis was shown during growth in onr glu and onr oil halomonas sp bic1h44 and marinobacter sp bic5m1 supernatants showed no haemolytic activity 3 3 statistical analyses one way anova was performed on od data to check differences between growth values in the presence of the three carbon sources per strain and between all the strains in dependence on the carbon source the results highlighted some significant differences in the use of the different carbon sources per strain specifically in the case of marinobacter sp bic1m9 and bic2m32 growth in in onr tet was significantly lower than growth in onr oil respectively p 0 05 bic4m3b growth in onr glu resulted significantly lower than growth in onr oil p 0 05 in addition the growth of the two pseudomonas strains was significantly lower in onr tet and onr oil p 0 05 halomonas sp bic1h44 growth values resulted significant different respect to those of all other isolates with a growth significantly higher in all growth conditions p 0 05 while no significant differences were detected between strains in the ea some differences occurred by comparing the average ea from each strain on the different carbon sources indeed the emulsion production resulted significantly higher for the strains halomonas sp bic1h44 marinobacter spp bic4m3b and bic3m3 during growth in onr tet than in onr oil and onr glu p 0 05 similarly no differences occurred between strains in the production of e24 and in the st reduction but in some cases the e24 produced by strains during growth in onr tet resulted significantly higher in comparison with those obtained under the other culture conditions i e marinobacter sp bic3m3 and bic4m3b alcanivorax sp bic1a5 halomonas sp bic1h44 and acinetobacter sp bic1ac and overall the st resulted significantly reduced during growth in in onr tet p 0 05 no significant differences were evidenced between hydrophobicity level between strains and carbon sources as resulted from the one way anova the entire dataset average values of emulsions stable emulsions hydrophobicity percentage and the global surface tension reduction was used to perform the pca in fig 5 the spatial distribution of strains showed mostly a grouping according to the phylogenetic affiliation as in the case of pseudomonas spp marinobacter spp and acinetobacter spp strains forming a cluster with 80 of similarities differently the strain alcanivorax sp bic2a5 marinobacter sp bic2m32 and halomonas sp bic1h44 grouped alone the two main components explained the 69 1 of the total variance with the first component explaining the 49 7 of the total variance and mainly influenced by emulsion and e24 produced in the presence of glucose and the second components accounting for the 19 4 and influenced mainly by the hydrophobicity values in the presence of oil negatively correlated 3 4 biosurfactant extraction on the basis of results from the screening procedure three strains i e halomonas sp bic1h44 alcanivorax sp bic1a5 and marinobacter sp bic3m3 were selected to perform the bs extraction halomonas sp bic1h44 was chosen thanks to overall promising results and versatility in the use of different carbon sources alcanivorax sp bic1a5 was further analyzed due to promising results in both onr tet and in onr oil and to its phylogenetic affiliation strongly related to a well known hydrocarbon degradation ability finally marinobacter sp bic3m3 produced the highest e24 in onr tet the higher yield of extracted bss was obtained from marinobacter sp bic3m3 quantified as 3 148 g l during its exponential phase alcanivorax sp bic1a5 achieved a bs amount of 2 922 g l while a total of 2 596 g l of bs was obtained from halomonas sp bic1h44 cultures the bs produced from alcanivorax sp bic1a5 was used for a bw degradation experiment 3 5 microcosm biodegradation experiment in the microcosm m1 the maximum bacterial density was achieved after four days of incubation od600 0 867 and the st value was reduced up to 10 9 mn m the maximum e24 and hydrophobicity percentages were 21 8 and 25 respectively the microcosms m2 achieved a maximum of optical density od600 0 436 after one week while st was reduced to 12 1 mn m after thirty days of incubation the e24 production after 15 days of incubation was of 22 64 while maximum hydrophobicity percentage was of 4 after 15 days of incubation 3 6 microtox r test the ec50 value in the microcosms with bs addition showed a slight increase with values of 52 and 59 after 15 and 30 days of incubation and a reduction of 52 in the level of toxicity the microcosm used as control showed an increase of ec50 of 41 and 47 after 15 and 30 days of incubation respectively with a reduction of toxicity level of 40 respect to the initial value 4 discussion the isolation from polluted systems of native microorganisms with the capacity to degrade contaminants or to produce bioactive molecules with contaminant removal potential is an intriguing approach which could provide novel insights in bioremediation strategies the present work assessed two central aspects of bs production by using bacteria isolated from seawater and bilge water the exploration of peculiar sources for the isolation of bs producing strains and the possible use of low cost alternative as suitable substrates the bws are very complex and heterogeneous systems whose high variability could represent a good tool for the isolation of a wide spectrum of bacterial isolates with great specificity and ability to degrade numerous petroleum hydrocarbons 39 the isolation of oil degrading strains from bw has been recently explored by several authors 39 42 who reported rhodococcus acinetobacter pseudomonas bacillus and halomonas as main representative taxa in the field the phylogenetic characterization revealed isolates with taxonomical affiliations mostly reported in the field of bs production 43 46 such as pseudomonas alcanivorax and acinetobacter members the focus on hydrocarbon degrading isolates by using selective culture media for isolation that already have a high potential in terms of bs production 21 made the screening procedure more rapid by discriminating possible isolates not useful for the purpose and reducing the employment of resources during the experimentation the results obtained from the screening procedure appeared very diversified differently correlated to the bacterial affiliation and or to the carbon source considered since the strategy chosen for this research was to quickly obtain a picture of the bs production potential of sw and bw isolates it was preferred to make a close selection during the isolation step nevertheless results provided a detailed time courses progress of the main selected parameters emulsion production and interface activity throughout the growth of the isolates the carbon source is one of the most important parameter affecting the bs production as numerous studies have shown a direct influence on the bs composition even if the hydrocarbon uptake is not ever considered a determinant factor for the bacterial bs production 17 47 overall strains isolated from bw samples resulted most promising when grown in the presence of tetradecane especially in terms of ea and e24 exceptions were pseudomonas spp strains which showed promising results in both onr glu and onr oil thus confirming a huge potential in large scale production with perspectives of lower production costs the case of the two pseudomonas strains which interestingly showed different patterns in terms of bs production efficiency suggested the involvement of specie specific differences or a correlation with the origin of the strains thus supporting the use of bilge water as a source of native microorganisms with potential in the field indeed the strain bic2p44 which showed higher performance in the presence of tetradecane derived from bw sample thus probably resulting better specialized in the use of hydrocarbon substrates for growth as it was expected the better performances of alcanivorax spp strains were recorded during growth with tetradecane but interestingly the sunflower oil resulted a good substrate too probably due to the hydrophobic nature of the compound in the presence of sunflower oil all strains showed a good ea but they didn t produce e24 this could be due to the production of a surfactant with a moderate action or to a lower amount of it as the emulsion stability could designate the bs strength 48 or its concentration 31 the glucose was better used by pseudomonas sp bic1p7 halomonas sp bic1h44 marinobacter spp bic2m32 and bic3m3 the different efficiency of here reported bss in terms of surface tension reducers or emulsion stabilizing agents led to hypothesize the possible production of polymers with high as in the case of halomonas sp bic1h44 and alcanivorax isolates more effective in ea or low as for pseudomonas strains more able in st reduction molecular weights 49 51 interestingly acinetobacter sp bic1ac showed optimal results in terms of high e24 and hydrophobicity the genus acinetobacter is well known for the production of a potent bioemulsifier the emulsan 52 which could explain the high hydrophobicity rate of the strain species of acinetobacter has been reported as player of an important role in hydrocarbon pollution remediation 53 recently two acinetobacter members isolated from bw exhibited excellent crude oil removal capacity and good emulsification and interfacial activity during growth in mineral medium supplemented with tetradecane 54 halomonas sp was reported as producer of a glycoprotein with emulsifying activity by gutiérrez et al 55 in line with what reported for other halomonas spp strains isolated from bw samples 39 our results confirmed the optimal ea and oil degrading capacity this aspect is strongly interesting as halomonas members take the additional advantage to be able to produce specific enzymes and metabolites 54 56 thus increasing their suitable application for the industrial field contrastingly few references are available about marinobacter as bs producers 54 recently a marinobacter sp strain associated with sabellids was reported as bs producer and with higher bs in limiting conditions of salinity 49 50 for this reason the results obtained in this study were very surprising with marinobacter bic3m3 the best producer of e24 finally results obtained from the semi qualitative assay for detection of extracellular glycolipids or other anionic surfactants c tab agar plate showed that the specificity of this test allowed to a limited number of positive responses on the contrary ba assay showed diversified results by highlighting different types of hemolytic activity among tested strains these findings were in line and confirmed previous assessments namely that they could be used as additional tests as fairly inexpensive and easy to use 49 50 the spatial distribution of isolates determined by the pca fig 5 reveals details on the screening test response the separation of the strains alcanivorax sp bic2a5 and marinobacter sp bic2m32 could be due to the low hydrophobicity exhibited by these strains in comparison with the other isolates differently halomonas sp bic1h44 showed the lowest emulsification and e24 values during growth in the presence of sunflower oil the isolation of native bw microorganisms with ability to degrade hydrocarbon and produce bss could have important implications also for the wastewater treatment and in cleaning processes 15 to test the potential of obtained bs microcosm biodegradation experiment was attempted with the bs produced by alcanivorax sp bic1a5 the use of a selection of bs producers and the addition of natural bs have been proved as really promising in terms of e24 and st reduction the possibility of using a defined microbial consortium as specialized group of microorganisms capable of sequestering and degrading the main polluting compounds present in bw seems to be a winning proposal in the search for new disposal techniques the approach involving a group of microorganisms instead of single isolates lies on the theory for which it is interesting combine the innate resistance with resistances and degradation skills stimulated in consequence of environmental stress phenomena or artificially induced in the laboratory indeed single microorganisms could degrade a strict range of hydrocarbons while a consortium could gain a wider enzymatic spectrum able to extend the biodegradation level anyway the addition of bs led to a sensible improvement of biodegradation processes as supported by the ec50 values used as indirect measure of biodegradation process by demonstrating that the initial toxicity decisively decreased in the both microcosms and at higher level with bs addition with the possibility of owning on board the proper structures to optimize the degrading conditions of the autochthonous microflora and the added consortium this proposed biotechnological application could become even more interesting and efficient with economic benefits and environmental issues of great concern 5 conclusions the study contributes to the existing knowledge on the use of bw as a source of bs producing strains and highlights some aspects related to the use of low cost substrates for biosynthesis processes the results obtained by strains growing with addition of sunflower oil confirm the possibility to use it as a low cost alternative but it is necessary to furtherly improve the knowledge for an optimal application the use of industrial and or municipal wastewaters or of raw substrates with negligible value is suggested to achieve a double benefit of reducing the pollutants while producing useful products further studies are necessary for a better comprehension of the consortium dynamics and for the exact determination of hydrocarbon removal the implications at economic and environmental level are really promising many of the major shipping companies use multiple membranes filtration systems to reduce at least the presence of coarse material and suspended sludge and as bw pre treatment although the effectiveness of these systems clogging and maintenance could cause even higher costs than expected the involvement of biological treatment by using lyophilized microbial consortia could be thought as complementary solutions to the normal physical mechanical abatement techniques in order to solve the problem and cut the costs further studies are in progress to scale up growth conditions and bs production of native bw isolates the following is the supplementary data related to this article table s1 selection of bacterial strains as

13384,although electrospun based membranes may be engineered as efficient platforms for the capture of biomolecules in aqueous environments the capability of such membranes to selectively capture viruses and proteins is often limited due to poor and constrained surface affinity for molecular bonding in order to generate more efficient electrospun based membranes fine tuning van der waals and ionic interactions is required to control chemical affinities with such contaminants and support advanced remediation solutions here diallydimethylammonium chloride and poly acrylonitrile electrospun nanofibres were developed to enhance the adsorption of specific contaminant molecules compared to equivalently shaped pristine poly acrylonitrile nanofibre membranes the results showed that the incorporation of the ionic liquid improved contact with water by forming super hydrophilic nanofibres with narrow diameters and smaller pore size distributions while also significantly changing the surface charge of the material and shifting the isoelectric point of the surface from 3 to 4 4 the specific surface area of the membranes was also increased by up to 4 times upon ionic liquid loading which was found to support efficient coronavirus capture and filtration efficiency this new strategy represents a promising way to control surface properties of virus filtration membranes towards efficient and targeted remediation solutions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ionic liquid composite charged nanofibres super hydrophilic electrospun membranes virus filtration 1 introduction the design of remediation strategies to limit the transmission pathways of waterborne pathogens is a key priority for health organizations worldwide to shore up safe water supply in war torn natural disaster and epidemic outbreak areas 1 2 the transmission of waterborne diseases such as cholera typhoid fever hepatitis a and gastrointestinal infections can be tackled by modern water treatment technologies 3 4 recent studies have demonstrated that coronaviruses including sars cov 2 and other members of the coronavidae family can survive in wastewater for days increasing the demand of efficient sanitation strategies to limit transmission and prevent dramatic outbreaks 5 6 traditional wastewater remediation methods include physical and chemical treatments such as heat treatment irradiation with uv light and chlorination while advanced oxidation processes aops have started to emerge as valuable candidates 7 traditional methods are specifically designed to inactivate viruses e g via exposure to radical oxidative species ros nonetheless these strategies are resource intensive and require long treatment times limiting their potential for point of use applications 8 membrane technologies have gained momentum over the last decades as an efficient cost effective alternative to remove pathogens from liquid streams predominantly by capture and separation rather than by inactivation 9 the maximization of throughput capacity and selectivity is considered the overarching requirement in the design of breakthrough membrane adsorbents for virus remediation 10 electrospun membranes have emerged as ideal candidates for the removal of pathogens in wastewater due to their high surface area to volume ratio tunable porosity as well as the facile incorporation of antiviral and biocide agents 7 8 11 the filtration throughput in electrospun membranes can be enhanced by tailoring pore size and porosity while selective surfaces can be prepared by introducing active functional groups and by tuning the surface texture 12 poly acrylonitrile pan nano fibrous membranes modified with poly dual and tri vinyl monomers afforded a 4log10 99 99 retention of bacteriophage ms2 ms2 while unmodified pan membranes did not show any capture 13 the enhanced capture performance was ascribed to the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged ms2 virus and the positively charged surface of pan membranes upon functionalization enhanced electrostatic interactions critically contributed to increase the sindbis virus removal efficiency of poly vinyl alcohol pva electrospun membranes functionalized with quaternary amines up to 4 2log10 99 993 while the control membranes only achieved a virus removal of 1 5 log10 96 8 14 the composite pan tetraethyl orthosilicate teos and tetrathiomolybdate attm nanofibre membranes showed a removal efficiency of the semliki forest virus sfv as high as 98 9 12 the nanoscale surface roughness induced by the modification with teos and attm correlated with the increase in virus capture observed in the composite membrane compared to the pristine pan 1log10 90 the design and optimization of nano fibrous membranes combining tunable surface charge and energy with nano textured surfaces represents a critical step to enhance the virus capture 8 15 nano engineered surfaces with controlled density and distribution of active groups are therefore required to unlock the potential of nano fibrous membranes in waterborne virus remediation applications ionic liquids il offer unique opportunities to act as surface charge and surface interaction modifiers 16 18 the properties as well as thermal and chemical stabilities of ils combined to their very low solubility in water based media support the alteration of materials surface properties 19 20 and hence specific interactions with particulate matter volatile compounds or bio molecules in solution 12 ils have been used for this purpose in water filtration chemical synthesis and towards the development of functional or reactive polymeric materials 21 22 a challenge remains the intrinsic solubility of ils in solvents including water which depends on the strength and nature of the ionic interactions as well as on the solvation shells around the ions 19 the vast array of ils chemistries make them extremely versatile materials to develop advanced manufacturing platforms 23 and the incorporation of ils across nanofibres for example was shown to alter the di electric constant and charge distributions during the electro spinning process 24 25 the presence of ils in the spinning dope will alter the solvent evaporation rate during the taylor cone formation resulting in thinner fibres with highly porous and rough surfaces 26 27 in terms of applications in separation science the implementation of hydrophilic anions within the il was also used to develop electropositive filters with strongly shifted isoelectric points and electrostatic properties with great potential in biomolecules and pathogen removal 28 this study demonstrates the engineering of hybrid polymer ionic liquid membranes with controlled surface charge and specific surface area for capture of viruses during filtration of contaminated waters here hybrid nanofibre membranes composed of diallyldimethylammonium chloride dadmac and pan were developed by electrospinning to incorporate advanced surface enablers to modify the intrinsic properties of the separation materials the main objective was to evaluate the impact of the ils on the macro properties of the nanofibre membranes in terms of fibre diameter surface charge and specific surface area which are all key properties for components separation in liquids leaching of the ils from within the fibres was also evaluated to confirm the stability of the materials this study opens new paths to generate hybrid surface responsive membranes for complex viral loads remediation and to support the development of low cost virus filtration technologies as water pre treatment solutions 2 experimental 2 1 materials poly acrylonitrile pan mw 150 000 g mol powder n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 8 purity

methods 2 2 1 dope solution preparation a 10 wt pan dmf solution was prepared and stirred for 2 h at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution then different concentrations of dadmac ranging from 0 25 0 5 1 and 2 5 wt with respect to the polymer content were added to the solution and kept under stirring for 24 h at room temperature 2 2 2 dope solution characterization viscosity and conductivity were measured in order to characterize the properties of dadmac pan solutions viscosity was measured using a rheometer ta instruments united states of america via the shear of a cone rotating inside the solution at 100 s 1 a stainless steel cone geometry disc 40 mm diameter was used the solution conductivity was analyzed using a portable conductivity meter wp 81 tps a standard solution was used to calibrate the meter during the experiments at least three measurements were performed for each sample in order to obtain a precise result the tests were developed at room temperature 25 c 2 2 3 fabrication of pan dadmac nanofibre membranes pan dadmac solutions were placed into 10 ml plastic syringes fitted with a metal needle gauge 23 and placed in a commercial electrospinning system holmark ho nfes 043 u kerala india as previously described 29 a flow rate of 0 8 ml h and an applied voltage of 17 kv were used as electrospinning operating parameters an aluminum foil was wrapped around a drum collector spinning at 300 rpm to collect the nanofibres at 17 cm from the needle tip all experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 c and constant humidity 30 for consistent durations to generate membranes of constant thicknesses or basis weight 2 2 4 structural and morphological properties of nanofibre membranes scanning electron microscopy sem jeol 7800f tokyo japan was used to determine the morphology of the fibres and their diameter distributions as previously described 29 a 5 nm thick gold layer was applied to the sample using a leica em ace600 sputter coater leica microsystems australia to prevent charging during image capture imaging of the samples was performed at 5 kv and a working distance of 10 mm the fibre diameter was calculated using the image analysis software imagej following a previously described procedure 29 the chemical groups of the nano fibrous membranes were analyzed by fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy bruker vertex 70 australia and recorded in the range of 600 4000 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 the pore size distribution in the range of 0 5 to 5 μm was measured by perm porometry porometer 3g quantachrome florida united states of america with porofil as a wetting liquid in a liquid gas wet dry mode 30 the area of the samples analyzed was 3 14 cm2 and the pressure in the range of 0 16 1 3 bar the specific surface area of the samples was characterized by brunauer emmett teller bet method the samples were first degassed for 10 h at 100 c prior to performing n2 adsorption at 77 k the charge of the membranes was characterized by streaming potential analysis surpass 3 anton paar australia in a cylindrical cell across a ph range of 3 to 10 using 0 1 m kcl as an eluent the hydrophilicity of the membranes was analyzed using liquid water droplets during contact angle ksv instrument made cam 101 with 4 μl of water model 50 frames s 2 2 5 virus filtration performance of nano fibrous membranes the human coronavirus 229e hcov 229e isolates were provided by the victorian infectious disease reference laboratory vdrl hcov 229e was used as a model virus in all filtration tests within the virology department of the university of melbourne the coronavirus 229e is a respiratory virus known as a mild pathogen and common cause of flu like symptoms in humans 31 in this study hcov 229e titres were quantified by median tissue culture infectious dose tcid50 on lung fibroblasts mrc 5 tcid50 is a technique widely used to calculate infectious virus in a sample 12 tcid50 represents the concentration at which 50 of the cells present in the culture medium are infected when cultured and inoculated with a diluted solution of viral fluid in brief a 30 μl sample were collected from the filtered solutions and serial tenfold dilutions were made 50 μl of each dilution were inoculated to 6 wells of a 98 well plate with an amrc 5 cell monolayer plates were incubated for five days at 37 c with 5 co2 cytopathology was then observed in a light microscope the dilution of the suspension that causes cytopathology in half of the cultured wells was determined prior to evaluating the filtration performance of dadmac pan membranes on 229e an empty sample holder was used in a filtration experiment in order to evaluate potential losses of the virus due to adsorption phenomena the filtration experiments conducted on an empty membrane holder are presented as control experiments in the discussion 3 results and discussion membranes fabricated from various dadmac concentrations were electrospun to evaluate the impact of the il loading on the charge and surface properties of the membranes the pan il interactions across the electrospun nanofibres were studied and correlated to their virus filtration capabilities 3 1 morphological and structural properties of nanofibre membranes the morphology features of the electrospun nanofibres using sem images were evaluated to achieve uniform beadless nanofibres fig 1 the fibre diameter and membrane pore size distributions contribute significantly to the compactness of the medium affecting the permeance and the molecular transport through the microfiltration mf membranes the morphologies of pristine pan fig s1a and dadmac pan nanofibres fig 1a b c and d were both found to be uniform and a minute number of beads often formed from spinning dopes exhibiting high conductivities were observed for dadmac concentrations up to 0 5 wt fig 1a and b a critical value in conductivity was observed above 1 wt which can be attributed to greater densities of beads being detected across the web structure fig s2 thus loading dadmac into polymeric nanofibres induced significant changes in the morphological properties of the membranes and an increase upon il loading may be expected as previously reported in literature 32 thus hypothetically supporting the greater specific surface area calculated from the bet data the mean fibre diameter decreased when dadmac was incorporated into the polymeric nanofibres fig 1e dadmac pan membranes showed a minimum mean fibre diameter of 380 nm for a dadmac concentration of 1 wt corresponding to a 33 decrease compared to pristine pan membranes 570 nm as shown in table s1 interestingly the mean fibre diameter for the series of dadmac pan membranes reached a constant value above 1 wt demonstrating that the taylor cone stabilization and nanofibre formation mechanisms started to plateau at 1 wt this dramatic change in fibre diameter is a consequence of both the lower viscosity and higher conductivity of the dope solution used for electrospinning 0 47 0 03 pa s at 1 w t resulting in less elastic forces upon electro extrusion from the syringe and to the enhanced conductivity of the solution 33 free charges within the solution were able to move more freely from the bulk of the solution to the surface of the nanofibres upon densification favoring thinner taylor cone formation and thus smaller fibres the lower level of chain entanglements occurring with il loading may be related to the fact that the ils act as a plasticizer within the polymeric matrix as previously reported 34 the impact of dadmac on the properties of the dope was also found to become detrimental at high concentrations the electrostatic interactions during electrospinning resulted in the repellence of the nanofibres from the collector leading to the formation of even nanofibres but to uneven webs which were not collecting onto the collecting drum but randomly into the electrospinning system this phenomenon likely started at dadmac concentrations between 1 and 2 5 wt and can be clearly evidenced in dadmac pan membranes with a dadmac concentration of 5 wt fig s1b this outcome is consistent with the intrinsic limitations associated with high conductivity dopes of the electrospinning process 35 for this reason only the dadmac pan membranes spanning a dadmac concentration of 0 25 to 2 5 wt were considered in future experiments the pore size distributions of the membranes were also found to be directly impacted by the dadmac loading the addition of salts for instance including ils was found to lead to tighter structures at 2 5 wt dadmac pan the membranes were found to yield tight mean pore size at around 1 75 μm the smallest among the series of membranes followed by 1 wt 2 16 μm 0 25 wt 2 80 μm 0 5 wt 2 89 μm and 0 wt 2 93 μm fig 1f and table s1 the mean pore size of non woven materials is directly related to the fibre diameters present within the mixture 36 the limited impact of the low dadmac concentration levels on the pore size are well correlated with the limited changes visible at these concentrations in terms of fibre diameters the ft ir spectra of the pristine pan and dadmac loaded nanofibres were also evaluated to reveal the presence of the il onto the surface of the fibres fig 2a the ir band at 2243 cm 1 cn stretching as well as at 2923 cm 1 1450 cm 1 and 1360 cm 1 correspond to the methylene ch2 groups present across the pan backbone the intensity of the ir bands attributed to stretching vibrations of co groups at 1664 cm 1 and cn groups at 1093 cm 1 decreased upon dadmac addition which suggests that dadmac interacted with pan and displaced dmf the solvent used for the spinning process fig 2b and c the presence of emerging ir bands which may be linked to the ch bending vibrations of ch2 groups located next to the quaternary ammonium groups of dadmac at 960 cm 1 and to the stretching vibrations of ccl groups visible at 877 cm 1 also confirms the presence of dadmac onto the nanofibres fig 2c the intensity of the ccl band was found to increase as a function of the dadmac concentration up to a maximum intensity revealed at 2 5 wt confirming the greater surface density of the il with respect to dope solution concentration the appearance of ccl vibrations may be ascribed to the specific interactions of the polymer materials with the il macromolecular chains h bonding as well as van der waals interactions may also strengthen the interactions between the ils and polymer 37 the specific surface area of the samples was analyzed to evaluate the impact of dadmac addition on the surface properties of the nanofibres fig 3a the specific surface area increased from 12 to 52 m2 g attributed to the pristine pan and dadmac pan membranes with a 1 wt dadmac loading respectively the fivefold increase in specific surface area is consistent with a potential alteration of the surface roughness suggesting that the roughness of the material as well as potentially the free volume within the fibres were affected in depth by the il incorporation interestingly increasing the dadmac concentration from 1 to 2 5 wt led to a drop in specific surface area 22 42 m2 g this drop in specific surface area above 1 wt might be attributed to an increase in inter fibre adhesion and fibre interconnectivity at high dadmac loadings this phenomenon is in agreement with the presence of stronger inter fibre interactions due to increasing van der waals forces as highlighted by the ft ir analysis furthermore the contact angle values for the samples also showed dramatic changes in hydrophilicity for the series the material became super hydrophilic above 1 wt of dadmac in the pan as reported in table s1 the contact angle of the pristine and both 0 25 and 0 5 wt dadmac pan were however all on the order of 100 110o the high hydrophilicity above 1 wt of dadmac concentration in the electrospun membranes is likely the result of the transition from a cassie baxter to a wenzel wetting regime 38 along with the introduction of a surface chemistry modifier such as dadmac a compact arrangement of fibres in the membranes can promote liquid wicking into the pores formed across the nano fibrous mesh resulting in a wenzel wetting regime 39 this is an important aspect since the materials exhibiting high surface hydrophilicity but limited water uptake are to be preferred for biological contaminants capture here the pristine pan material is not prone to water uptake and the changes reported in wettability are therefore solely due to surface interactions from the presence of the ils onto the nanofibres surface the streaming potential of the samples was evaluated to measure the surface charges of the membranes fig 3b the streaming potential increased positively by 83 for 1 wt dadmac nanofibres compared to the pristine pan nanofibres at ph 6 although the pan did not exhibit any isoelectric point the isoelectric point iep of the il pan composites was found to shift from 3 to 4 4 after adding between 0 25 and 1 wt of dadma interestingly a further increase in dadmac concentration from 1 to 2 5 wt led to the generation of a positively charged membrane across the entire ph range this shift is attributed to the introduction of quaternary amine bearing functional groups from the dadmac added onto the surface of the pan nanofibres the minimum density of quaternary amine bearing functional groups required to shift the iep above the neutrality is likely to occurr between 1 and 2 5 wt the change in ph can be explained as a result of the protonation of the quaternary amine of the ionic liquids 40 long term leaching and stability tests were also performed for these membranes to assess the potential release of the ils in water the ils used in this study exhibit naturally a very high thermal stability and low vapour pressure ensuring their safe operation and limited physical dispersion at environmental operating temperatures it was also found that no ils could be detected after one week of exposure in both water and a kcl eluent solution from uv visible spectroscopy on the leachate solutions while no changes of the nanofibre morphologies could be evidenced in addition the streaming potential of the membranes were also found to be consistent over time confirming the lack of changes in surface composition of the nanofibres fig s3 this experiment is supporting the fact that the dadmac are well entangled with the pan macromolecular chains and not able to leach from the polymer matrix as recently reported for similar exposures 41 3 2 human coronavirus 229e capture and filtration performance the coronavirus hcov 229e is typically associated with mild respiratory infections in healthy adults with rare cases of acute respiratory distress not linked to comorbidities or immunodeficiency reported 42 this virus is classified under the same family of sars cov 2 coronaviridae however they belong to two different genii alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus for hcov 229e and sars cov 2 respectively 43 the virion size 100 nm and spike morphology of these two human pathogens is however similar 43 46 the tcid50 assay protocol conducted on the dadmac pan membranes revealed that upon the introduction of dadmac the hcov 229e titer decreased in all the hybrid membranes compared to the pristine pan as shown in fig 4a the virus removal efficiency was then calculated to assess the performance of the dadmac pan membranes as a function of the dadmac concentration the pristine pan membrane achieved only a 1 6log10 97 3 removal while the removal efficiency of 0 25 0 5 and 1 wt increased to 1 8log10 98 5 interestingly the maximum removal efficiency was ascribed to the dadmac pan membrane presenting a dadmac loading of 2 5 wt affording a removal efficiency of 2 3log10 99 2 as shown in fig 4b virus removal mechanisms in electrospun nanofibres include size exclusion and adsorption although weak intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding hydrophobic bonding and van der waals forces can also contribute to the rejection of waterborne viruses in membrane filters as highlighted in fig s4 8 47 the promising antiviral activity shown by dadmac pan membranes can be ascribed to the enhanced adsorption due to electrostatic interactions between the positively charged quaternary amine groups and negatively charged functional groups such as carboxyl functionalities in specific protein sectors of hcov 229e 48 although reverse osmosis ro is acknowledged as the gold standard in wastewater virus remediation affording more than 6log10 99 9999 removal of pathogens including viruses the utilization of mf membranes has recently been explored 49 the synergistic combination of both electrostatic interactions and sieving effects in mf membranes is known to offer a removal efficiency between 2 and 3 log10 99 99 9 for common viruses 50 mf membranes modified with cationic polymeric chains showed promising ms2 virus retention attributed to the adsorption of negatively charged viruses on the surface of mf membranes 51 unmodified mf membranes reached an average of 1log10 90 ms2 removal which is in the same range as the pan membranes and the negatively charged dadmac pan membranes used in this study nonetheless poly ethyleneimine pei modified mf membranes achieved a virus removal of 3log10 99 9 which is higher than the 2 3log10 removal registered in this study for dadmac pan 2 5 wt similarly pva membranes modified with quaternized chitosan n 2 hydroxyl 3 trimethylammonium propyl chitosan htcc showed up to 4 2log10 99 993 sindbis virus removal while the control membranes only afforded 1 5log10 96 8 removal 14 in our study the contribution of the size exclusion mechanism to the virus removal is likely limited due to the large mean pore size 1 5 μm of dadmac pan membranes the increase in iep as a function of the dadmac concentration and the transition to a positively charged surface across the entire ph range for a dadmac concentration of 2 5 wt correlated well with the removal efficiency although high surface areas are expected to significantly contribute to the virus rejection in electrospun membranes no direct correlations with the virus removal could be drawn in this study dadmac concentrations of 0 25 and 2 5 wt led to nanofibres with similar surface area table s1 however only dadmac pan membranes with a dadmac loading of 2 5 wt achieved a virus removal of at least 2log10 suggesting that electrostatic interactions between positively charged quaternary amines in dadmac and e229 represent the main rejection mechanism tailoring the surface charge of nano fibrous membrane by introducing low amounts of il could represent a valuable strategy to develop membrane filters with enhanced virus removal since the electrostatic interactions appear as critical in promoting the remediation efficiency further investigation into the role of specific functional groups along with their density and surface distribution is required to develop breakthrough antiviral filters nonetheless the separation mechanisms underpinning the virus removal such as size exclusion and electrostatic interactions should be holistically assessed to carefully design membranes with optimal morphology and controlled surface charge and energy although this study only considers the virus removal efficiency the virus inactivation upon adsorption on specifically engineered functional surfaces poses a new challenge and a market opportunity towards the design of smart antiviral membrane technologies 4 conclusions and prospects a novel and facile strategy to alter the surface structure and charge of electrospun membranes with ils was hereby demonstrated with minute amounts of additives to support virus capture most notably the addition of the il to the polymer material led to super hydrophilicity and allowed for fine tuning the streaming potential as well as the roughness and specific surface area of the nanofibres the decrease in nanofibre diameters and reduction in mean pore sizes observed upon dadmac addition were also found to improve the virus filtration capabilities leading up 3 log of virus removal in addition investigations on the stability of the materials in water to evaluate potential il release also showed no measurable leaching after one week of exposure confirming the strong intercalation of the ionic liquids in the polymer matrix the high charge membranes fabricated in this paper offer new opportunities to be applied as multifunctional water purification systems to remove viral contaminants and support the control of interactions towards specific bio contaminants capture although recovery and reuse of such membrane materials aiming at virus capture may be of interest issues related to sanitary disinfection remain prevalent these challenges to ensure that the viruses are entirely de activated or destroyed prior to reusing the membranes typically limit the potential for such materials for multiple use generating a strong single use market routes to trigger deactivation of the viruses should be envisioned to support the selected repurposing or reuse of such charge controlled membranes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

13384,although electrospun based membranes may be engineered as efficient platforms for the capture of biomolecules in aqueous environments the capability of such membranes to selectively capture viruses and proteins is often limited due to poor and constrained surface affinity for molecular bonding in order to generate more efficient electrospun based membranes fine tuning van der waals and ionic interactions is required to control chemical affinities with such contaminants and support advanced remediation solutions here diallydimethylammonium chloride and poly acrylonitrile electrospun nanofibres were developed to enhance the adsorption of specific contaminant molecules compared to equivalently shaped pristine poly acrylonitrile nanofibre membranes the results showed that the incorporation of the ionic liquid improved contact with water by forming super hydrophilic nanofibres with narrow diameters and smaller pore size distributions while also significantly changing the surface charge of the material and shifting the isoelectric point of the surface from 3 to 4 4 the specific surface area of the membranes was also increased by up to 4 times upon ionic liquid loading which was found to support efficient coronavirus capture and filtration efficiency this new strategy represents a promising way to control surface properties of virus filtration membranes towards efficient and targeted remediation solutions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ionic liquid composite charged nanofibres super hydrophilic electrospun membranes virus filtration 1 introduction the design of remediation strategies to limit the transmission pathways of waterborne pathogens is a key priority for health organizations worldwide to shore up safe water supply in war torn natural disaster and epidemic outbreak areas 1 2 the transmission of waterborne diseases such as cholera typhoid fever hepatitis a and gastrointestinal infections can be tackled by modern water treatment technologies 3 4 recent studies have demonstrated that coronaviruses including sars cov 2 and other members of the coronavidae family can survive in wastewater for days increasing the demand of efficient sanitation strategies to limit transmission and prevent dramatic outbreaks 5 6 traditional wastewater remediation methods include physical and chemical treatments such as heat treatment irradiation with uv light and chlorination while advanced oxidation processes aops have started to emerge as valuable candidates 7 traditional methods are specifically designed to inactivate viruses e g via exposure to radical oxidative species ros nonetheless these strategies are resource intensive and require long treatment times limiting their potential for point of use applications 8 membrane technologies have gained momentum over the last decades as an efficient cost effective alternative to remove pathogens from liquid streams predominantly by capture and separation rather than by inactivation 9 the maximization of throughput capacity and selectivity is considered the overarching requirement in the design of breakthrough membrane adsorbents for virus remediation 10 electrospun membranes have emerged as ideal candidates for the removal of pathogens in wastewater due to their high surface area to volume ratio tunable porosity as well as the facile incorporation of antiviral and biocide agents 7 8 11 the filtration throughput in electrospun membranes can be enhanced by tailoring pore size and porosity while selective surfaces can be prepared by introducing active functional groups and by tuning the surface texture 12 poly acrylonitrile pan nano fibrous membranes modified with poly dual and tri vinyl monomers afforded a 4log10 99 99 retention of bacteriophage ms2 ms2 while unmodified pan membranes did not show any capture 13 the enhanced capture performance was ascribed to the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged ms2 virus and the positively charged surface of pan membranes upon functionalization enhanced electrostatic interactions critically contributed to increase the sindbis virus removal efficiency of poly vinyl alcohol pva electrospun membranes functionalized with quaternary amines up to 4 2log10 99 993 while the control membranes only achieved a virus removal of 1 5 log10 96 8 14 the composite pan tetraethyl orthosilicate teos and tetrathiomolybdate attm nanofibre membranes showed a removal efficiency of the semliki forest virus sfv as high as 98 9 12 the nanoscale surface roughness induced by the modification with teos and attm correlated with the increase in virus capture observed in the composite membrane compared to the pristine pan 1log10 90 the design and optimization of nano fibrous membranes combining tunable surface charge and energy with nano textured surfaces represents a critical step to enhance the virus capture 8 15 nano engineered surfaces with controlled density and distribution of active groups are therefore required to unlock the potential of nano fibrous membranes in waterborne virus remediation applications ionic liquids il offer unique opportunities to act as surface charge and surface interaction modifiers 16 18 the properties as well as thermal and chemical stabilities of ils combined to their very low solubility in water based media support the alteration of materials surface properties 19 20 and hence specific interactions with particulate matter volatile compounds or bio molecules in solution 12 ils have been used for this purpose in water filtration chemical synthesis and towards the development of functional or reactive polymeric materials 21 22 a challenge remains the intrinsic solubility of ils in solvents including water which depends on the strength and nature of the ionic interactions as well as on the solvation shells around the ions 19 the vast array of ils chemistries make them extremely versatile materials to develop advanced manufacturing platforms 23 and the incorporation of ils across nanofibres for example was shown to alter the di electric constant and charge distributions during the electro spinning process 24 25 the presence of ils in the spinning dope will alter the solvent evaporation rate during the taylor cone formation resulting in thinner fibres with highly porous and rough surfaces 26 27 in terms of applications in separation science the implementation of hydrophilic anions within the il was also used to develop electropositive filters with strongly shifted isoelectric points and electrostatic properties with great potential in biomolecules and pathogen removal 28 this study demonstrates the engineering of hybrid polymer ionic liquid membranes with controlled surface charge and specific surface area for capture of viruses during filtration of contaminated waters here hybrid nanofibre membranes composed of diallyldimethylammonium chloride dadmac and pan were developed by electrospinning to incorporate advanced surface enablers to modify the intrinsic properties of the separation materials the main objective was to evaluate the impact of the ils on the macro properties of the nanofibre membranes in terms of fibre diameter surface charge and specific surface area which are all key properties for components separation in liquids leaching of the ils from within the fibres was also evaluated to confirm the stability of the materials this study opens new paths to generate hybrid surface responsive membranes for complex viral loads remediation and to support the development of low cost virus filtration technologies as water pre treatment solutions 2 experimental 2 1 materials poly acrylonitrile pan mw 150 000 g mol powder n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 8 purity

methods 2 2 1 dope solution preparation a 10 wt pan dmf solution was prepared and stirred for 2 h at room temperature to obtain a homogeneous solution then different concentrations of dadmac ranging

electrospinning system holmark ho nfes 043 u kerala india as previously described 29 a flow rate of 0 8 ml h and an applied voltage of 17 kv were used as electrospinning operating parameters an aluminum foil was wrapped around a drum collector spinning at 300 rpm to collect the nanofibres at 17 cm from the needle tip all experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 c and constant humidity 30 for consistent durations to generate membranes of constant thicknesses or basis weight 2 2 4 structural and morphological properties of nanofibre membranes scanning electron microscopy sem jeol 7800f tokyo japan was used to determine the morphology of the fibres and their diameter distributions as previously described 29 a 5 nm thick gold layer was applied to the sample using a leica em

study hcov 229e titres were quantified by median tissue culture infectious dose tcid50 on lung fibroblasts mrc 5 tcid50 is a technique widely used to calculate infectious virus in a sample 12 tcid50 represents the concentration at which 50 of the cells present in the culture medium are infected when cultured and inoculated with a diluted solution of viral fluid in brief a 30 μl sample were collected from the filtered solutions and serial tenfold dilutions were made 50 μl of each dilution were inoculated to 6 wells of a 98 well plate with an amrc 5 cell monolayer plates were incubated for five days at 37 c with 5 co2 cytopathology was then observed in a light microscope the dilution of the suspension that causes cytopathology in half of the cultured wells was determined prior to evaluating the filtration performance of dadmac pan membranes on 229e an empty sample holder was used in a filtration experiment in order to evaluate potential losses of the virus due to adsorption phenomena the filtration experiments conducted on an empty membrane holder are presented as control experiments in the discussion 3 results and discussion membranes fabricated from various dadmac concentrations were electrospun to evaluate the impact of the il loading on the charge and surface properties of the membranes the pan il interactions across the electrospun nanofibres were studied and correlated to their virus filtration capabilities 3 1 morphological and structural properties of nanofibre membranes the morphology features of the electrospun nanofibres using sem images were evaluated to achieve uniform beadless nanofibres fig 1 the fibre diameter and membrane pore size distributions contribute significantly to the compactness of the medium affecting the permeance and the molecular transport through the microfiltration mf membranes the morphologies of pristine pan fig s1a and dadmac pan nanofibres fig 1a b c and d were both found to be uniform and a minute number of beads often formed from spinning dopes exhibiting high conductivities were observed for dadmac concentrations up to 0 5 wt fig 1a and b a critical value in conductivity was observed above 1 wt which can be attributed to greater densities of beads being detected across the web structure fig s2 thus loading dadmac into polymeric nanofibres induced significant changes in the morphological properties of the membranes and an increase upon il loading may be expected as previously reported in literature 32 thus hypothetically supporting the greater specific surface area calculated from the bet data the mean fibre diameter decreased when dadmac was incorporated into the polymeric nanofibres fig 1e dadmac pan membranes showed a minimum mean fibre diameter of 380 nm for a dadmac concentration of 1 wt corresponding to a 33 decrease compared to pristine pan membranes 570 nm as shown in table s1 interestingly the mean fibre diameter for the series of dadmac pan membranes reached a constant value above 1 wt demonstrating that the taylor cone stabilization and nanofibre formation mechanisms started to plateau at 1 wt this dramatic change in fibre diameter is a consequence of both the lower viscosity and higher conductivity of the dope solution used for electrospinning 0 47 0 03 pa s at 1 w t resulting in less elastic forces upon electro extrusion from the syringe and to the enhanced conductivity of the solution 33 free charges within the solution were able to move more freely from the bulk of the solution to the surface of the nanofibres upon densification favoring thinner taylor

within the mixture 36 the limited impact of the low dadmac concentration levels on the pore size are well correlated with the limited changes visible at these concentrations in terms of fibre diameters the ft ir spectra of the pristine pan and dadmac loaded nanofibres were also evaluated to reveal the presence of the il onto the surface of the fibres fig 2a the ir band at 2243 cm 1 cn

co groups at 1664 cm 1 and cn groups at 1093 cm 1 decreased upon dadmac addition which suggests that dadmac interacted with pan and displaced dmf the solvent used for the spinning process fig 2b and c the presence of emerging ir bands which may be linked to the ch bending vibrations of ch2 groups located next to the quaternary ammonium groups of dadmac at 960 cm 1 and to the stretching vibrations of ccl groups visible at 877 cm 1 also confirms the presence of dadmac onto the nanofibres fig 2c the intensity of the ccl band was found to increase as a function of the dadmac concentration up to a maximum intensity revealed at 2 5 wt confirming the greater surface density of the il with respect to dope solution concentration the appearance of ccl vibrations may be ascribed to the specific interactions of the polymer materials with the il macromolecular chains h bonding as well as van der waals interactions may also strengthen the interactions between the ils and polymer 37 the specific surface area of the samples was analyzed to evaluate the impact of dadmac addition on the surface properties of the nanofibres fig 3a the specific surface area increased from 12 to 52 m2 g attributed to the pristine pan and dadmac pan membranes with a 1 wt dadmac loading respectively the fivefold increase in specific surface area is consistent with a potential alteration of the surface roughness suggesting that the roughness of the material as well as potentially the free volume within the fibres were affected in depth by the il incorporation interestingly increasing the dadmac concentration

contact angle of the pristine and both 0 25 and 0 5 wt dadmac pan were however all on the order of 100 110o the high hydrophilicity above 1 wt of dadmac concentration in the electrospun membranes is likely the result of the transition from a cassie baxter to a wenzel wetting regime 38 along with the introduction of a surface chemistry modifier such as dadmac a compact arrangement of fibres in the

include size exclusion and adsorption although weak intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding hydrophobic bonding and van der waals forces can also contribute to the rejection of waterborne viruses in membrane filters as highlighted in fig s4 8 47 the promising antiviral activity shown by dadmac pan membranes can be ascribed to the enhanced adsorption due to electrostatic interactions between the positively charged quaternary amine groups and negatively charged functional groups such as carboxyl functionalities in specific protein sectors of hcov 229e 48 although reverse osmosis ro is acknowledged as the gold standard in wastewater virus remediation affording more than 6log10 99 9999 removal of pathogens including viruses the utilization of mf membranes has recently been explored 49 the synergistic combination of both electrostatic interactions and sieving effects in mf membranes is known to offer a removal efficiency between 2 and 3 log10 99 99 9 for common viruses 50 mf membranes modified with cationic polymeric chains showed promising ms2 virus retention attributed to the adsorption of negatively charged viruses on the surface of mf membranes 51 unmodified mf membranes reached an average of 1log10 90 ms2 removal which is in the same range as the pan membranes and the negatively charged dadmac pan membranes used in this study nonetheless poly ethyleneimine pei modified mf membranes achieved a virus removal of 3log10 99 9 which is higher than the 2 3log10 removal registered in this study for dadmac pan 2 5 wt similarly pva membranes modified with quaternized chitosan n 2 hydroxyl 3 trimethylammonium propyl chitosan htcc showed up to 4 2log10 99 993 sindbis virus removal while the control membranes only afforded 1 5log10 96 8 removal 14 in our study the contribution of the size exclusion mechanism to the virus removal is likely limited due to the large mean pore size 1 5 μm of dadmac pan membranes the increase in iep as a function of the dadmac concentration and the transition to a positively charged surface across the entire ph range for a dadmac concentration of 2 5 wt correlated well with the removal efficiency although high surface areas are expected to significantly contribute to the virus rejection in electrospun membranes no direct correlations with the virus removal could be drawn in this study dadmac concentrations of 0 25 and 2 5 wt led to nanofibres with similar surface area table s1 however only dadmac pan membranes with a dadmac loading of 2 5 wt achieved a virus removal of at least 2log10 suggesting that electrostatic interactions between positively charged quaternary amines in dadmac and e229 represent the main rejection mechanism tailoring the surface charge of nano fibrous membrane by introducing low amounts of il could represent a valuable strategy to develop membrane filters with enhanced virus removal since the electrostatic interactions appear as critical in promoting the remediation efficiency further investigation into the role of specific functional groups along with their density and surface distribution is required to develop breakthrough antiviral filters nonetheless the separation mechanisms underpinning the virus removal such as size exclusion and electrostatic interactions should be holistically assessed to carefully design membranes with optimal morphology and controlled surface charge and energy although this study only considers the virus removal efficiency the virus inactivation upon adsorption on specifically engineered functional surfaces poses a new challenge and a market opportunity towards the design of smart antiviral membrane technologies 4 conclusions and prospects a novel and facile strategy to alter the surface structure and charge of electrospun membranes with ils was hereby demonstrated with minute amounts of additives to support virus capture most notably the addition of the il to the polymer material led to super hydrophilicity and allowed for fine tuning the streaming potential as well as the roughness and specific surface area of the nanofibres the decrease in nanofibre diameters and reduction in mean pore sizes observed upon dadmac addition were also found to improve the virus filtration capabilities leading up 3 log of virus removal in addition investigations on the stability of the materials in water to evaluate potential il release also showed no measurable leaching after one week of exposure confirming the strong intercalation of the ionic liquids in the polymer matrix the high charge membranes fabricated in this paper offer new opportunities to be applied as multifunctional water purification systems to remove viral contaminants and support the control of interactions towards specific bio contaminants capture although recovery and reuse of such membrane materials aiming at virus capture may be of interest issues related to sanitary disinfection remain prevalent these challenges to ensure that the viruses are entirely de activated or destroyed prior to reusing the membranes typically limit the potential for such materials for multiple use generating a strong single use market routes to trigger deactivation of the viruses should be envisioned to support the selected repurposing or reuse of such charge controlled membranes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
