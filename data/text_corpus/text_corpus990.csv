4950,when researching the mixing of two or more water masses and their subsequent transformation ideally the most conservative parameters are used since the 1970s the isotopic parameter δ18o has been used in various oceanological research works for example ostlund and hut 1984 j geophys res 89 6373 6381 and many others the use of the salinity value and δ18o allowed the construction of a three component system classic of equations tsc nevertheless in the work dubinina et al 2019 okeanologiya no 1 57 38 48 it was demonstrated that the application of the three component mixing to modified waters causes an overestimation of river water input a model of mixing modification which eliminated this drawback was presented in the work and the difference of estimation with the three component system may be up to 20 in the present study are also shown that the classic three component system is fully applicable only under the conditions of ice melting and under the conditions of ice formation estimates based on the three component system give overestimated results of basic waters content in the final water mass however the methodology of sea water component composition estimation in this work differs slightly from the methodology presented in the above publication a modified three component system tsm presented in this work allows elimination of such inaccuracies the difference between average values for the available series of observations according to tsc and tsm increases in the following order kara sea laptev sea barents sea and the maximum difference for atlantic waters and river waters 30 5 and 25 2 respectively was observed for laptev sea 17 6 and 9 5 respectively for the barents sea and 16 3 for both components of the kara sea to reveal newly formed water masses a method of cluster analysis was applied the composition of basic waters in the final water masses of the seas in question was obtained as well as the values of these waters modification during ice formation or ice melting general regularities of water masses formations in the discussed seas are delineated an illustration of the average values of these magnitudes in water masses clusters in the system of coordinates content of atlantic waters river water ice water for each sea had similar character but their magnitudes differed depending on the different magnitude of the river runoff and different extent of these waters modification during ice formation and ice melting it is noteworthy that the value of ice water has an important scientific and practical significance because it is used to summarise singular cycle values and possibly several observation cycles of ice formation while also being unique maintaining the memory of the ice formation process values which occurred in these waters keywords ice formation ice melting atlantic waters river water sea water ice water 1 introduction in the classic monograph of e g nikiforov and a o shpaikher nikiforov and shpaikher 1980 it has been demonstrated that atlantic waters although they serve to form significant quantities of other types of waters surface intermediate and bottom however within the boundaries of the atlantic basin and indeed the whole arctic ocean they fully preserve their individuality runoff waters of great siberian rivers are the other waters which participate during water mass formation the river water content varies from 70 in the water masses adjacent to the river mouths to 0 5 or less in the bottom of atlantic waters of the arctic seas bauch et al 2016 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 nevertheless the process of waters transformation as a result of ice formation and ice melting participates in the formation of the final water mass the maximum content of meltwater can reach 40 and desalination caused only by ice melting processes can be 0 2 0 7 psu water withdrawal for ice formation in some areas can reach 20 and the maximum value of salinization can reach 1 7 psu semeryuk and namyatov 2018 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 it causes changes in the salinity and isotopic composition of both ice and sub ice waters therefore in this case sea waters means the water formed because of the mixing of atlantic and river waters which are subject to transformation as a result of ice formation and ice melting when researching the mixing of two or more water masses and their subsequent transformation ideally the most conservative parameters are used sea water salinity is one such parameter in various works they also include total carbon content ctot dissolved silica concentration total alkalinity value alk and temperature for instance in the work of polukhin and makkaveev 2017 using the above parameters salinity total carbon content silicon content and total alkalinity a separation of fresh water in the kara sea into the water of ob yenisei and melt water was performed polukhin and makkaveev 2017 the above parameters mentioned are not adequately conservative they have significant seasonal variability especially silica concentration and water temperature which may cause errors when they are used in specific instances since the 1970s the isotopic parameter δ18o has been used in various oceanological research works it characterises the change in the content of stable isotopes 18o and 16o in sea water ferronskii et al 1978 ostlund and hut 1984 letolle et al 1993 melling and moor 1995 bauch et al 1995 2003 2005 2009 2011 2014 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 frank 1996 ekwurzel et al 2001 mueller lupp et al 2003 semeryuk and namyatov 2018 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 dubinina et al 2017 2019 these changes occur because of evaporation and are therefore reflected in the precipitation as well which accumulates in river runoffs in this case evaporation means the entry of water vapors to the atmosphere in the process of the global carry over of air masses from the west to the east when moving to the east air masses are gradually depleted of 18o compared to 16o and the reduction of the δ18o value from the west to the east takes place from the barents sea to the laptev sea it is well demonstrated in the work of letolle r with co authors letolle et al 1993 moreover the sea itself possesses a large volume and the siberian rivers possess enormous water catchment areas thus mixing of winter and summer precipitation always occurs therefore in this study same as in the studies using the classical system the seasonal trend of the δ18o value is not discussed additionally isotope fractionation occurs as a result of ice formation and consequently during ice melting the use of the salinity value and δ18o allowed the construction of a three component system of equations the three component system is discussed in more detail below its solution resulted in the estimation of atlantic ocean river and meltwater contents in addition to relative volumes of water used for ice formation ostlund and hut 1984 furthermore this three component system of equations was used in many works devoted to oceanographic research in arctic seas ostlund and hut 1984 letolle et al 1993 melling and moor 1995 bauch et al 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 and others the use of the three component system of equations also allowed the estimation of actual salinity and desalination of water masses in the laptev sea related only to the processes of ice formation and ice melting semeryuk and namyatov 2018 in the works of d bauch and co authors bauch et al 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 they obtained calculated values and measured parameters of temperature salinity phosphate phosphorus nitrate nitrogen and dissolved silica and subjected it to a cluster analysis as a result eight water masses were identified and the average values of the above parameters were calculated for the barents kara and laptev seas location diagrams of these water masses propagation boundaries were plotted in plan view and cross section nevertheless in the work of e o dubinina and co authors dubinina et al 2019 it was demonstrated that the application of the three component mixing to modified waters causes an overestimation of river water input a model of mixing modification which eliminated this drawback was presented in the work and the difference of estimation with the three component system may be up to 20 it was also shown that for waters where ice formation and removal occurred typical for the ice opening of arctic seas the mixing modification model should be used for waters desalinated by a melt component a classic model of the three component mixing can be used however in this work dubinina et al 2019 estimations only for the river component based on 100 samples collected in 2015 and 2017 table 1 are presented additionally the above mentioned work dubinina et al 2019 was methodical in the present study are also shown that the classic three component system is fully applicable only under the conditions of ice melting and under the conditions of ice formation estimates based on the three component system give overestimated results of basic waters content in the final water mass however the methodology of sea water component composition estimation in this work differs slightly from the methodology presented in the above mentioned publication the objectives of this work are as follows 1 assessment of the conditions under which the results of basic waters content in the final water mass are overestimated when the classic three component mixing model tsc three component system classic is used 2 presentation of the modified methodology tsm three component system modified which excludes such inaccuracies 3 delineation of the patterns of water mass mixing and transformation their peculiarities and their position under consideration in the arctic seas 2 materials and methods in this work the results of δ18o and salinity determinations that are available in public data bases were used these determinations of the data occurred from 1972 to 2008 and are published in the websites of nasa nasa n d and nodc nodc n d when the data warehousing was conducted data content duplicates were checked furthermore the data from 2015 and 2017 were used in this study they were obtained at the kara sea and the laptev sea dubinina et al 2017 2019 a list of used data is presented in table 1 and the diagram of station locations is shown in fig 1 for further estimations in this work a design model was used wherein it was assumed that in the seas there are only two relict or basic water masses pure atlantic and pure river waters and the rest of the water masses are the result of mixing and transformation of these two waters this model was already used in several publications ostlund and hut 1984 letolle et al 1993 melling and moor 1995 bauch et al 1995 2003 2005 2009 2011 2014 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 frank 1996 ekwurzel et al 2001 mueller lupp et al 2003 semeryuk and namyatov 2018 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 dubinina et al 2017 2019 as noted above in this case the term sea waters means the real sea waters in which mixing of atlantic and river waters took place in a certain proportion and which were subjected to the transformation as a result of ice formation or ice melting based on such prior works by knowing the values of the isotopic parameter δ18o and sea water salinity it is possible to estimate the values of atlantic river and melt waters content and the contents of water used for ice formation this study further identifies melt waters and waters used for ice formation as ice waters to estimate the values of relative volumes of atlantic river and ice waters a three component system of mixing equations was used in various prior works ostlund and hut 1984 melling and moor 1995 dubinina et al 2019 bauch et al 1995 2003 2005 2009 2011 2014 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 ekwurzel et al 2001 frank 1996 ferronskii et al 1978 letolle et al 1993 mueller lupp et al 2003 semeryuk and namyatov 2018 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 and others 1 fa s a f r s r f i s i s m e a s f a o a f r o r f i o i o m e a s f a f r f i 1

is a changes of relative content of 18o over 16o calibrated with the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the conditions of this three component model applicability are as follows 2 fa f r f i 1 dubinina et al 2019 demonstrated that the approach with the use of negative fi values results in erroneous estimations of the share of river waters because negative values of fi require the increase of other components share to maintain the balance 1 however in that work estimations were made based on 100 samples see table 1 and only for the river component in this work a different estimation methodology for atlantic and river water content in the sub ice layer is presented in the case of sea water desalination with meltwater 3 fa f r 1 4 fi 0 if the faw and frw the content of atlantic and river waters in the sub ice layer then faw fa and frw fr the classical three component system of equations is suitable for this case for the case of sea water withdrawal ice formation 5 fi 0 6 fa f r 1 in this case the fa value consists of faw the content of atlantic waters in the sub ice layer and fai the content of atlantic waters in the formed ice this is true for river water as well fr consists of frw the content of river water in the sub ice layer and fri the content of river water in the formed ice base waters atlantic and river during the ice formation period is both in a liquid phase sea water and in a solid phase sea ice however in the collection of only liquid phase sea water as a result of the solution using the classical three component system of equations tsc eq 1 the content of base atlantic and river water is determined which at the moment of sampling was not only in the sea water liquid phase faw and frw but also passed in the solid phase ice fai and fri in this case faw fa and frw fr the results of the classical three component system will give an overestimated result for sub ice waters by the amount of atlantic and river water on the quantity of formed ice eq 7 7 f a i f r i fi f a w f a i f a f r w f r i f r in this case the composition of a single volume of sub ice water is 8 f a w f r w 1 using the classic three component system of equations a sum of fractions of this component content in the sub ice water layer and the content of this component on the formed ice is obtained however fa fr and fi values calculated according to the three component system have an imperative practical significance as the unique parameters of the memory of ice formation or ice melting volumes that occurred previously physical value of the memory is in the change of the interrelation between the content of stable isotopes 16o and 18o in the sea water this memory will last very long until as a result of advection convectional and turbulent mixing with other layers as well as a result of the reverse process ice formation ice melting the relation between stable isotopes 16o and 18o will return to the previous level or come close to it to calculate the specific faw and frw values it can be assumed that ice is formed of well mixed water consisting of atlantic and river waters which are included in the ice composition in the same ratio as in the water for pure river ice fri 1 fai 0 and fri 0 fai 1 for ice formed from pure atlantic water in this case 9 fa f r f a i f r i k 10 f a i k f i 1 k 11 f r i fi k fi 1 k eventually the content of atlantic

identified as classic tsc and a three component system after correction eqs 1 9 12 and 13 as a modified three component system tsm the differences are associated with the change of the model only in particular the addition of equations to the classical three component system eqs 1 9 12 and 13 under the condition of ice formation process domination fi 0 in case of ice melting fi 0 the classical three component system is applied eq 1 the modified system tsm presented in the article allows separating the quantity of the base water only in the liquid phase i e the sea water all the disadvantages indicative for the classical three component system are attributable to the modified system too the only difference and disadvantage are in the supposition that the relation between the river and atlantic water in the ice is the same as in the sea water from which this ice is formed this issue is not researched but it is difficult to suppose that it is not truein addition the three component model allows to estimate the values of salinity change only through ice formation and ice melting processes ds psu this value demonstrates the difference between the final salinity values which are formed as a result of simple mixing of two water masses using mamaev 1987 or a two component system the mixing of two water masses together with salination or desalination of the sea water due to the processes of ice formation or ice melting eq 1 is a three component system the minus indicates salination and the plus sign indicates desalination the calculation methodology is described in detail in semeryuk and namyatov 2018 14 f a 2 s a f r 2 s r s m e a s f a 2 f r 2 1 the actual values of the volume of pure atlantic and river waters fa3 and fr3 are calculated based on the three component system of equations eq 1 fa2 and fr2 are apparent values of these waters volume which if calculated based on the two component system without considering ice formation and ice melting eq 15 are the actual values of water salinity smeas but differ from the actual values by the water transformation values during ice formation and ice melting in this case indices 2 and 3 demonstrate that the calculation was performed based on the two eq 14 and three eq 1 component systems of equations respectively therefore 15 f a 2 s a f r 2 s r s m e a s f a 3 s a f r 3 s r s m e a s 16 smeas s m e

considering waters and salts participating in the processes of ice formation and ice melting with fa3 fa2 and fr3 fr2 18 smeas s m e a s for further calculations the salinity and δ18o values for pure atlantic river and ice waters are assumed as used in several other works table 2 for the barents sea the values were assumed based on the references provided in table 2 or according to fig 2 according to the methodology presented above and based on the use of measured salinity and δ18o it is possible to calculate faw frw and fi values additionally the value of sea water salinity change caused only by ice formation and ice melting was calculated as ds psu furthermore the relationships between these parameters and water salinity were researched to research the composition of water masses a set of observations for each sea was subjected to cluster analysis based on the classification by ward s method and euclidian distances ward 1963 all the input data were rated similar works using parameters of temperature salinity phosphate phosphorus nitrate nitrogen and silica as well as the calculated fr and fi values were already completed bauch et al 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 additionally in those works for the laptev sea the data only for the layer 0 150 m were used in the current work the list of input data was slightly different for faw frw fi and ds all the data up to 3 000 m were used which allowed us to distinguish the cores of the atlantic water mass which lay below 150 m depth in this case distinguishing the cores of atlantic waters is an important link in verifying the obtained results because their position was studied well nikiforov and shpaikher 1980 3 theory calculation in this work were used all the data from 1972 to 2017 presented in table 1 3 1 assessment of the difference in values of sea water composition calculated according to the classic tsc and modified three component systems tsm as demonstrated above in case of ice formation fi 0 the estimation of fa and fr values according to the three component system of equations demonstrates a sum of basic atlantic and river waters content in the sub ice layer of water and in the ice for the case of meltwater ingress this system of equations demonstrates a sum of atlantic and river waters only in the sea water fi 0 because the samples were collected in the sub ice layer for the case of ice formation it is necessary to subtract the values of atlantic and river fractions excluded for ice formation which is not implied by the classic three component system in this case both atlantic and river sub ice waters are modified by ice formation processes and the calculated fi value if it is negative shows the value of accumulated transformations of sub sea waters possibly attributed to several ice formation cycles the difference in estimations of fractions of atlantic and river waters content according to tsc and tsm are presented in table 3 for the ice formation case the highest average values of the difference in the analysis of the existing series of calculation according to tsc and tsm up to 4 for atlantic waters and up to 1 8 for river water are in the composition of the kara sea water then the laptev sea goes in descending order of these values and then the barents sea therefore the maximum difference for atlantic waters and river waters 30 5 and 25 2 respectively was observed for the laptev sea 17 6 and 9 5 respectively for barents sea and 16 3 for both components of the kara sea 3 2 main regularities in mixing and transformation of sea waters the distribution of the atlantic river and ice water content values on the surface and bottom horizons as well as on sections in the kara and laptev seas is presented in appendix a figs a1 a4 first the interrelationship between the salinity and δ18o values was discussed graphs of the relationship between salinity and δ18o for all three seas are presented in fig 2 for all water basins under consideration these relationships are close to one but they do not coincide for two reasons first river runoff has various δ18o values which results in various values of curve crossings with the axis of coordinates second the sag values of these curves are different for the barents sea the relationship is approximately linear and for the laptev sea a distinctive sag is traced it characterises the influence of the ice formation processes prevailing over the ice melting processes the results of tsm based calculations demonstrate that the equation of inter relationships among the atlantic and river waters salinity and dependence of river water content on atlantic water content have a correlation factor close to one but the interrelationships themselves differ from each other for the barents sea they are linear the nonlinearity value increases from west to east from the barents sea to the laptev sea fig 3 a b and 4a the interrelationship between the atlantic waters and river waters is inverse in nature with a correlation coefficient nearly equal to one dependencies of sea water salinity change ds on fi value for the seas in question also vary from each other for example to have the salinity increase as a result of ice formation by 0 5 psu in the laptev sea it is necessary to remove approximately 13 of water for ice formation in the laptev sea 10 in the kara sea and approximately 8 in the barents sea on the contrary for sea water desalination caused by ice melting for the same value approximately 8 of meltwater in the barents sea 12 in the kara sea and 13 in the laptev sea fig 4 a is required it is interesting to contemplate this dependence of the value of fi on salinity obviously it will have a different appearance for the period of ice formation and ice melting as all the samples were collected in the summer autumn period this dependence is only for the period of ice melting fig 3c it is noteworthy that for the whole salinity range both positive and negative fi values were observed for the barents sea a determination factor of fi dependence on salinity is equal to zero at all dependency values determinations for the kara and laptev seas are much lower than for the dependencies for atlantic and river content as discussed earlier for these seas although samples were collected during the summer autumn period the average fi values within the range of salinity values of 10 35 psu had negative values and the lowest values were observed within the range of salinity of 20 25 psu for the kara and laptev seas the average fi values for this salinity range reached 6 and 11 respectively these salination values according to equations presented in fig 4b and are equal to 0 31 and 0 44 psu respectively the highest salination value for the kara sea and the laptev sea was 1 7 psu with the salinity of the sea water equal to 21 5 and 28 psu respectively 3 3 composition of water masses the atlantic waters move eastward form new water masses and preserve their individuality for these water basins of the world oceans the process of atlantic waters mixing with the runoff of the large siberian rivers as well as the mechanisms of water modification during ice formation and ice melting represent the main mechanisms of new water mass formation to reveal newly formed water masses and to estimate the content of basic waters in these water masses a method of cluster analysis was applied as previously employed in other studies bauch et al 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 in the present work the method of cluster analysis was also applied to reveal the structure of water masses of the seas in question however the list of input data was different faw frw fi and ds results of the cluster analysis are presented in appendix b in the barents sea eight clusters were identified but only seven were reviewed because one of the clusters contained only two samples in the kara and laptev seas six clusters in each were reviewed in fig 5 relative positions of average values faw frw and fi are shown for each cluster in this graph the axis fr has a reverse value in relation to the axis fa because a change in these values has a differently directed nature see fig 4a additionally the trends of faw and frw values change against the fi value and are plotted in these figures they show the tendencies of these parameters differ from one another a composition of basic waters in the final water masses of the seas under consideration faw and frw are obtained and the values of these waters modification during ice formation or ice melting fi are presented the average values of these magnitudes in water masses clusters for each sea have similar characters but their magnitudes differ from one another depending on the different magnitudes of the river runoff and extents of these waters modification during ice formation and ice melting if an analogy is made with the biological environment the water masses in this case in each of the seas occupy similar ecological niches in total eight clusters were revealed in these seas cluster 2 was observed only in the kara sea and cluster 8 only in the barents sea it is noteworthy that the location of stations in the barents sea was sparse and those stations are mostly concentrated around the spitsbergen archipelago and in the south eastern part of the sea the central parts of the sea are not encompassed by such research therefore with further research encompassing the central parts of the sea including the central depression the number of revealed water masses in the barents sea may change statistical characteristics of the measured and calculated values for each cluster are presented below in fig 5 the magnitudes of the calculated standard deviations are presented as error bars however they are shown as approximate values the propagation of water masses clusters on the surface and bottom horizons and in the sections are presented in fig 6 the classification of water masses for arctic seas was made by e g nikiforov and e g shpaikher nikiforov and shpaikher 1980 their classification and names are used in this study to analyse the obtained results 4 results 4 1 cluster 1 and 2 the cluster analysis showed that river waters in the kara sea were distributed into two clusters see fig 6 which differ mainly in fi value the boundaries of cluster 1 waters propagation are confined closer to estuaries and the effect of the waters modification caused by ice melting prevail there water modifications caused by ice melting are also observed in the cluster 2 but to a lower extent in clusters 1 and 2 according to the water classification presented above the characteristics are those of summer river water masses table 4 additionally the presence of waters modified during ice formation up to 1 8 was detected in the barents sea river waters are not split in two clusters and characteristics of this water mass are close to the relevant characteristics of the cluster 1 in the kara sea conversely in the laptev sea the characteristics of waters belonging to this water mass are close to those of waters presented in cluster 2 of the kara sea where waters were modified by ice melting but waters modified during ice formations were also encountered with the maximum modification value of 10 6 areas of these waters propagation in all three seas are adjacent to the estuaries of the inflowing rivers in the barents sea the estuary is associated with the pechora river in the kara sea the estuaries are of the ob and the yenisei rivers and in the laptev sea it is the estuary of the lena river the median content of atlantic river waters in this water mass is 76 89 0 3 in the kara sea 71 14 in the barents sea and 62 27 in the laptev seathe median k values eq 9 in these water masses vary from 0 to 0 43 4 2 cluster 3 and 4 further from the estuaries there are areas of so called shelf waters fig 6 a b c d and their characteristics are described below table 5 these are waters that were subjected to the transformation because of ice formation a part of this water mass which is adjacent to river waters is more desalinated cluster 3 however these waters differ from river waters due to a higher modification degree caused by ice formation average values of atlantic river waters content in the barents kara and laptev seas are 64 2 35 7 35 9 64 0 and 49 3 50 7 respectively the median k values eq 9 in these water masses vary from 0 8 to 7 7 the median fi values are 6 2 5 5 and 16 8 in the barents kara and laptev seas respectively a part of this water mass which is in closer contact with the open sea basin cluster 4 has a relatively lower temperature due to ice formation in the barents and laptev seas however in the kara sea the modification of this water mass fraction increases due to the ice formation 4 3 cluster 5 and 6 surface water of arctic seas in winter these waters are subjected to salination as a result of ice formation cluster 5 although a degree of these waters modification caused by ice formation is much lower than that of shelf waters clearly it is due to convective mixing wherein modified water is mixed with a much larger volume of water than in the shelf water mass the median k values eq 9 in these water masses vary from 12 to 40 the average modification values caused by ice formation vary 1 7 3 7 which is much lower than in shelf waters table 6 however as these are the average fi values for a given water mass when referring these values to the averaging layer it determines the amount of ice formed from this water mass 300 m for barents sea 150 m for kara and 50 for laptev seas in this case the size of formed ice in this water mass of the barents kara and laptev seas is 4 5 m 2 6 m and 1 2 m respectively if it is assumed that the size of thick first year ice in the barents sea is 1 35 m terziev 1991 then these waters did not mix with waters containing meltwaters for at least 3 5 years the summer surface water of arctic seas cluster 6 is in the surface layer in the barents and kara seas the content of meltwaters completely grades the processes of ice formation and fi values are always positive in the laptev sea a modest manifestation of ice formation processes is observed the median k values eq 9 in these water masses vary from 10 to 45 4 4 cluster 7 atlantic waters with the current set of incoming values this cluster incorporated both direct atlantic waters and bottom waters of the arctic basin table 7 in the kara sea these water masses are not identified at implemented stations as the data presented in table 1 are not uniform and have large gaps in water temperature values which is typical for the kara and the barents seas in the barents sea the research is represented in two isolated areas therefore the cluster analysis was conducted based on the composition of incoming data allowing the maximum preservation of series continuance in a more detailed examination of the characteristics of waters in this cluster several cores of water masses can be identified in the layer of 200 400 m and 550 1000 m the bottom layers of the arctic basin are the waters which have negative temperatures and lie below the atlantic waters temperature below 0 c was observed at 1000 m below the horizon the average temperature of these waters was 0 49 0 42 c north of the spitsbergen archipelago and to 0 69 0 10 c in the laptev sea which is approximately 2 0 c below the average temperature of atlantic waters and the average water salinity is 34 92 0 02 psu which is higher than that of atlantic waters by approximately 0 07 psu the value of atlantic waters content in this water mass was 99 74 the value of river waters content is 0 21 0 12 the negative value of fi 0 23 0 16 indicates that these waters were located in the upper layers where as a result of the convective mixing there was an ingress of waters containing both river waters and waters transformed as a result of ice formation 4 5 cluster 8 cluster 8 table 8 these waters were observed only in the barents sea and only in the surroundings of the spitsbergen archipelago they can be provisionally described as summer waters of the barents sea they differ from the nordkapp current waters in that the average temperature of these waters is practically lower by 3 c the salinity is lower by 0 1 psu the content of atlantic waters is lower by 2 5 the content of river waters is higher by 1 0 the median k values eq 9 in these water masses are 45 specifically the effect of meltwaters presence is stronger expressed by 1 7 on average judging from these characteristics these waters are formed by the ingress of warm atlantic waters runoff from the spitsbergen archipelago mainland and waters formed by melting sea ice table 8 5 conclusion the one of fundamental concepts in hydrology oceanography is the concept of water masses in fact water masses have always been determined using the values of temperature and salinity of sea water the use of the isotopic parameter δ18o provided an opportunity to establish a three component system of equations which allowed assessing the above listed volumes of waters in the final water mass that is what was used in many works the difference between the assessments based on two and three component systems that allows assessment of change in sea water salinity caused only by the processes of ice formation and ice melting ds however the classic three component system of equations tsc in its pure form is applicable only under the conditions of ice melting but under the conditions of ice formation it introduces overestimation of atlantic and river waters content a modified three component system tsm presented in this work allows elimination of such inaccuracies the difference between average values for the available series of observations according to tsc and tsm increases in the following order kara sea laptev sea barents sea as 3 95 1 49 1 19 atlantic waters and 1 84 0 54 0 13 river waters this means that maximum difference for atlantic waters and river waters 30 5 and 25 2 respectively has been observed for laptev sea 17 6 and 9 5 respectively for the barents sea and 16 3 for both components of the kara sea using the parameters fa faw fr frw fi and ds allows to isolate water masses using the more fundamental characteristics such as the amount of base waters included in this water mass the relations of which determine the final temperature and salinity of water the great interest is the transformation of atlantic waters moving from west to east such a study using the fa and fr parameters has already been done in the works of d bauch and co authors bauch et al 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 this paper presents the values fa faw fr frw fi and ds of four layers of atlantic waters four layers of atlantic water were examined table 9 1 atlantic water arriving in the barents sea between scandinavia and the medvezhy island 2 atlantic water enveloping the spitsbergen archipelago from the north 3 atlantic water at the border of the laptev sea and the arctic ocean with the midstream on the horizon of 300 m 4 atlantic water at the border of the laptev sea and the arctic ocean with the midstream on the horizon of 800 m salinity in the layers of atlantic water varies from 35 0 0 1 at the western boundary of the barents sea to 34 85 0 08 psu at the northern boundary of the laptev sea a reduction of the parameter δ18 o from 0 30 0 15 to 0 22 0 06psu is observed in the same areas a negative value of fi indicates an insignificant domination of ice formation processes in case of transformation of this water mass comparing the values of temperature and salinity with winter january february values of these parameters in the waters of the nordkapp current at the western boundary of the barents sea shows that the temperature of atlantic waters which reached the laptev sea decreased by approximately 4 c and the salinity by 0 1 psu the presented estimates demonstrate that the transformations of atlantic waters are caused by both the ingress of small quantities of river waters and transformations resulting from the ice formation process however at a temperature of 1 3 c the processes of ice formation cannot occur apparently moving to the east this effect is not directly connected with the processes of ice formation in the atlantic water mass but is associated with the processes of mixing with overlying layers especially during convective mixing the overlying layers where the process of ice formation takes place directly contain a rather large quantity of atlantic waters which are subjected to such transformations thus even in the summer waters of the laptev sea shelf with a water salinity of 22 3 psu the average content of atlantic waters is 65 and the waters removal for ice formation in this water mass on average is approximately 10 it means that in atlantic waters with positive water temperatures the observed effect of weak transformations caused by ice formation is explained by the convective mixing with the upper water layers which were subjected to significant transformations as a result of the direct ice formation and contained both atlantic and river waters the waters that have undergone significant transformation during ice formation are the least studied the main problem is the detection and establishment of the boundaries of these waters a good indicator of these waters is the fi parameter in the kara and the laptev seas this water mass is located within the boundaries of the polynya which is an ice factory for the seas under consideration if it is assumed that the average sea depth in places of ice formation in the laptev sea basin adjacent to the delta of the lena river in ob yenisei shallow waters of the kara sea and in the south eastern barents sea is 20 m then the thickness of the formed ice is approximately 1 m in the barents sea 1 2 m in the kara sea and from 2 to 3 5 m in the laptev sea the provided estimated values of the formed ice thicknesses possibly reflect the values of several ice formation cycles they are unique characteristics preserving a memory of the magnitudes of ice formation processes that occurred in these waters physical value of the memory is in the change of the interrelation between the content of stable isotopes 16o and 18o in the sea water this memory will last very long until as a result of advection convectional and turbulent mixing with other layers as well as a result of the reverse process ice formation ice melting the relation between stable isotopes 16o and 18o will return to the previous level or come close to it the mmedian values of the sea water salination are 0 25 psu in the barents sea 0 54 in the kara sea and up to 0 67 psu in the laptev sea the maximum salination values reached 0 85 1 27 and 2 20 psu in the barents kara and laptev seas respectively because the samples were collected during the summer autumn period which is the period of active ice melting the negative fi values demonstrate that there is not complete replacement of winter waters transformed as a result of ice formation with summer meltwaters this causes some accumulation and conservation of these waters in the folds of the sea bottom configuration which exist year round and form the so called stagnant waters semeryuk and namyatov 2018 as these waters accumulate and the processes of organic substance oxidation in them do not stop minimum concentrations of dissolved oxygen and maximum concentrations of the mineral fraction of biogenic elements like phosphorus silica and nitrogen are observed in them the observed minimum concentrations of dissolved oxygen in this area of the laptev sea was 3 3 ml l which indicates the values of approximate oxygen consumption in the range of 3 5 4 0 ml l the minimum value of saturation with dissolved oxygen was 40 which is lower than the values in the neighbouring layers by approximately 40 the observed maximum concentration of phosphate phosphorus in this water mass was 3 3 µmol l which indicates an increase in concentration during organic substance mineralisation by 2 0 2 5 µmol l similar concentrations for silica are the maximum concentration in this water mass of 33 µmol l and the value of the concentration increase during organic substance mineralisation is approximately 20 µmol l aarii 2014 based on the δ18o values the barents sea is the least researched portion of the seas under consideration fig 1 in its centre in a large water basin there are no available data according to previous research conducted in the bottom layer of the central depression of the sea 300 350 m a water mass transformed as a result of ice formation was observed which was characterised by a water temperature close to freezing and a high salinity 35 0 35 05 psu additionally it was observed that the content of na ions its normalised chlorinity value was lower compared to the relevant values in the standard sea water on average this value was 0 985 0 14 namyatov et al 1994 presumably waters with a high density high salinity and low temperature transformed as a result of ice formation movements in the bottom layer along the sea bottom configuration and accumulated in the deepest places this effect requires further study because the change of the main ions ratio in these waters corresponds to the uncertainty of the salinity definitions using the salinity chlorinity salinity conductivity equations obviously in future research if these waters are recorded by type they may be classified as shelf waters however with lower water temperature and higher salinity as well as greater distance from the coast currently the magnitude of the waters transformation as a result of ice formation is unknown the use of both classical and modified methods will allow you to study 1 long period climatic variability of water masses composition in this case the composition of water masses means the content of atlantic river and ice water ice formation and ice melting volumes 2 changed of hydrochemical parameters in the waters transformed as a result of ice formation nutrients pollutants main ions etc the fi value has an important scientific and practical significance because it is used to summarise singular cycle values and possibly several observation cycles of ice formation while also being unique maintaining the memory of the ice formation process volumes which occurred in these waters it is possible that using the value of fi it is possible to monitor formed of melted ice which will indirectly characterize climate change declaration of competing interest the authors

4950,when researching the mixing of two or more water masses and their subsequent transformation ideally the most conservative parameters are used since the 1970s the isotopic parameter δ18o has been used in various oceanological research works for example ostlund and hut 1984 j geophys res 89 6373 6381 and many others the use of the salinity value and δ18o allowed the construction of a three component system classic of equations tsc nevertheless in the work dubinina et al 2019 okeanologiya no 1 57 38 48 it was demonstrated that the application of the three component mixing to modified waters causes an overestimation of river water input a model of mixing modification which eliminated this drawback was presented in the work and the difference of estimation with the three component system may be up to 20 in the present study are also shown that the classic three component system is fully applicable only under the conditions of ice melting and under the conditions of ice formation estimates based on the three component system give overestimated results of basic waters content in the final water mass however the methodology of sea water component composition estimation in this work differs slightly from the methodology presented in the above publication a modified three component system tsm presented in this work allows elimination of such inaccuracies the difference between average values for the available series of observations according to tsc and tsm increases in the following order kara sea laptev sea barents sea and the maximum difference for atlantic waters and river waters 30 5 and 25 2 respectively was observed for laptev sea 17 6 and 9 5 respectively for the barents sea and 16 3 for both components of the kara sea to reveal newly formed water masses a method of cluster analysis was applied the composition of basic waters in the final water masses of the seas in question was obtained as well as the values of these waters modification during ice formation or ice melting general regularities of water masses formations in the discussed seas are delineated an illustration of the average values of these magnitudes in water masses clusters in the system of coordinates content of atlantic waters river water ice water for each sea had similar character but their magnitudes differed depending on the different magnitude of the river runoff and different extent of these waters modification during ice formation and ice melting it is noteworthy that the value of ice water has an important scientific and practical significance because it is used to summarise singular cycle values and possibly several observation cycles of ice formation while also being unique maintaining the memory of the ice formation process values which occurred in these waters keywords ice formation ice melting atlantic waters river water sea water ice water 1 introduction in the classic monograph of e g nikiforov and a o shpaikher nikiforov and shpaikher 1980 it has been demonstrated that atlantic waters although they serve to form significant quantities of other types of waters surface intermediate and bottom however within the boundaries of the atlantic basin and indeed the whole arctic ocean they fully preserve their individuality runoff waters of great siberian rivers are the other waters which participate during water mass formation the river water content varies from 70 in the water masses adjacent to the river mouths to 0 5 or less in the bottom of atlantic waters of the arctic seas bauch et al 2016 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 nevertheless the process of waters transformation as a result of ice formation and ice melting participates in the formation of the final water mass the maximum content of meltwater can reach 40 and desalination caused only by ice melting processes can be 0 2 0 7 psu water withdrawal for ice formation in some areas can reach 20 and the maximum value of salinization can reach 1 7 psu semeryuk and namyatov 2018 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 it causes changes in the salinity and isotopic composition of both ice and sub ice waters therefore in this case sea waters means the water formed because of the mixing of atlantic and river waters which are subject to transformation as a result of ice formation and ice melting when researching the mixing of two or more water masses and their subsequent transformation ideally the most conservative parameters are used sea water salinity is one such parameter in various works they also include total carbon content ctot dissolved silica concentration total alkalinity value alk and temperature for instance in the work of polukhin and makkaveev 2017 using the above parameters salinity total carbon content silicon content and total alkalinity a separation of fresh water in the kara sea into the water of ob yenisei and melt water was performed polukhin and makkaveev 2017 the above parameters mentioned are not adequately conservative they have significant seasonal variability especially silica concentration and water temperature which may cause errors when they are used in specific instances since the 1970s the isotopic parameter δ18o has been used in various oceanological research works it characterises the change in the content of stable isotopes 18o and 16o in sea water ferronskii et al 1978 ostlund and hut 1984 letolle et al 1993 melling and moor 1995 bauch et al 1995 2003 2005 2009 2011 2014 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 frank 1996 ekwurzel et al 2001 mueller lupp et al 2003 semeryuk and namyatov 2018 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 dubinina et al 2017 2019 these changes occur because of evaporation and are therefore reflected in the precipitation as well which accumulates in river runoffs in this case evaporation means the entry of water vapors to the atmosphere in the process of the global carry over of air masses from the west to the east when moving to the east air masses are gradually depleted of 18o compared to 16o and the reduction of the δ18o value from the west to the east takes place from the barents sea to the laptev sea it is well demonstrated in the work of letolle r with co authors letolle et al 1993 moreover the sea itself possesses a large volume and the siberian rivers possess enormous water catchment areas thus mixing of winter and summer precipitation always occurs therefore in this study same as in the studies using the classical system the seasonal trend of the δ18o value is not discussed additionally isotope fractionation occurs as a result of ice formation and consequently during ice melting the use of the salinity value and δ18o allowed the construction of a three component system of equations the three component system is discussed in more detail below its solution resulted in the estimation of atlantic ocean river and meltwater contents in addition to relative volumes of water used for ice formation ostlund and hut 1984 furthermore this three component system of equations was used in many works devoted to oceanographic research in arctic seas ostlund and hut 1984 letolle et al 1993 melling and moor 1995 bauch et al 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 and others the use of the three component system of equations also allowed the estimation of actual salinity and desalination of water masses in the laptev sea related only to the processes of ice formation and ice melting semeryuk and namyatov 2018 in the works of d bauch and co authors bauch et al 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 they obtained calculated values and measured parameters of temperature salinity phosphate phosphorus nitrate nitrogen and dissolved silica and subjected it to a cluster analysis as a result eight water masses were identified and the average values of the above parameters were calculated for the barents kara and laptev seas location diagrams of these water masses propagation boundaries were plotted in plan view and cross section nevertheless in the work of e o dubinina and co authors dubinina et al 2019 it was demonstrated that the application of the three component mixing to modified waters causes an overestimation of river water input a model of mixing modification which eliminated this drawback was presented in the work and the difference of estimation with the three component system may be up to 20 it was also shown that for waters where ice formation and removal occurred typical for the ice opening of arctic seas the mixing modification model should be used for waters desalinated by a melt component a classic model of the three component mixing can be used however in this work dubinina et al 2019 estimations only for the river component based on 100 samples collected in 2015 and 2017 table 1 are presented additionally the above mentioned work dubinina et al 2019 was methodical in the present study are also shown that the classic three component system is fully applicable only under the conditions of ice melting and under the conditions of ice formation estimates based on the three component system give overestimated results of basic waters content in the final water mass however the methodology of sea water component composition estimation in this work differs slightly from the methodology presented in the above mentioned publication the objectives of this work are as follows 1 assessment of the conditions under which the results of basic waters content in the final water mass are overestimated when the classic three component mixing model tsc three component system classic is used 2 presentation of the modified methodology tsm three component system modified which excludes such inaccuracies 3 delineation of the patterns of water mass mixing and transformation their peculiarities and their position under consideration in the arctic seas 2 materials and methods in this work the results of δ18o and salinity determinations that are available in public data bases were used these determinations of the data occurred from 1972 to 2008 and are published in the websites of nasa nasa n d and nodc nodc n d when the data warehousing was conducted data content duplicates were checked furthermore the data from 2015 and 2017 were used in this study they were obtained at the kara sea and the laptev sea dubinina et al 2017 2019 a list of used data is presented in table 1 and the diagram of station locations is shown in fig 1 for further estimations in this work a design model was used wherein it was assumed that in the seas there are only two relict or basic water masses pure atlantic and pure river waters and the rest of the water masses are the result of mixing and transformation of these two waters this model was already used in several publications ostlund and hut 1984 letolle et al 1993 melling and moor 1995 bauch et al 1995 2003 2005 2009 2011 2014 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 frank 1996 ekwurzel et al 2001 mueller lupp et al 2003 semeryuk and namyatov 2018 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 dubinina et al 2017 2019 as noted above in this case the term sea waters means the real sea waters in which mixing of atlantic and river waters took place in a certain proportion and which were subjected to the transformation as a result of ice formation or ice melting based on such prior works by knowing the values of the isotopic parameter δ18o and sea water salinity it is possible to estimate the values of atlantic river and melt waters content and the contents of water used for ice formation this study further identifies melt waters and waters used for ice formation as ice waters to estimate the values of relative volumes of atlantic river and ice waters a three component system of mixing equations was used in various prior works ostlund and hut 1984 melling and moor 1995 dubinina et al 2019 bauch et al 1995 2003 2005 2009 2011 2014 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 ekwurzel et al 2001 frank 1996 ferronskii et al

dubinina et al 2019 demonstrated that the approach with the use of negative fi values results in erroneous estimations of the share of river waters because negative values of fi require the increase of other components share to maintain the balance 1 however in that work estimations were made based on 100 samples see table 1 and only for the river component in this work a different estimation methodology for atlantic and river water content in the sub ice layer is presented in the case of sea water desalination with meltwater 3 fa f r 1 4 fi 0 if the faw and frw the content of atlantic and river waters in the sub ice layer then faw fa and frw fr the classical three component system of equations is suitable for this case for the case of sea water withdrawal ice formation 5 fi 0 6 fa f r

consists of frw the content of river water in the sub ice layer and fri the content of river water in the formed ice base waters atlantic and river during the ice formation period is both in a liquid phase sea water and in a solid phase sea ice however in the collection of only liquid phase sea water as a result of the solution using the classical three component system of equations tsc eq 1 the content of base atlantic and river water is determined which at the moment of sampling was not only in the sea water liquid phase faw and frw but also passed in the solid phase ice fai and fri in this case faw fa and frw fr the results of the classical three component system will give an overestimated result for sub ice waters by the amount of atlantic and river water on the quantity of formed ice

fractions of this component content in the sub ice water layer and the content of this component on the formed ice is obtained however fa fr and fi values calculated according to the three component system have an imperative practical significance as the unique parameters of the memory of ice formation or ice melting volumes that occurred previously physical value of the memory is in the change of the interrelation between the content of stable isotopes 16o and 18o in the sea water this memory will last very long until as a result of advection convectional and turbulent mixing with other layers as well as a result of the reverse process ice formation ice melting the relation between stable isotopes 16o and 18o will return to the previous level or come close to it to calculate the specific faw and frw values it can be assumed that ice is formed of well mixed water consisting of atlantic and river waters which are included in the ice composition in the same ratio as in the water

identified as classic tsc and a three component system after correction eqs 1 9 12 and 13 as a modified three component system tsm the differences are associated with the change of the model only in particular the addition of equations to the classical three component system eqs 1 9 12 and 13 under the condition of ice formation process domination fi 0 in case of ice melting fi 0 the classical three component system is applied eq 1 the modified system tsm presented in the article allows separating the quantity of the base water only in the liquid phase i e the sea water all the disadvantages indicative for the classical three component system are attributable to the modified system too the only difference and disadvantage are in the supposition that the relation between the river and atlantic water in the ice is the same as in the sea water from which this ice is formed this issue is not researched but it is difficult to suppose that it is not truein addition the three component model allows to estimate the values of salinity change only through ice formation and ice melting processes ds psu this value demonstrates the difference between the final salinity values which are formed as a result of simple mixing of two water masses using mamaev 1987 or a two component system the mixing of two water masses together with salination or desalination of the sea water due to the processes of ice formation or ice melting eq 1 is a three component system the minus indicates salination and the plus sign indicates desalination the calculation methodology is described

are the actual values of water salinity smeas but differ from the actual values by the water transformation values during ice formation and ice melting in this case indices 2 and 3 demonstrate that

atlantic river and ice waters are assumed as used in several other works table 2 for the barents sea the values were assumed based on the references provided in table 2 or according to fig 2 according to the methodology presented above and based on the use of measured salinity and δ18o it is possible to calculate faw frw and fi values additionally the value of sea water salinity change caused only by ice formation and ice melting was calculated as ds psu furthermore the relationships between these parameters and water salinity were researched to research the composition of water masses a set of observations for each sea was subjected to cluster analysis based on the classification by ward s method and euclidian distances ward 1963 all the input data were rated similar works using parameters of temperature salinity phosphate phosphorus nitrate nitrogen and silica as well as the calculated fr and fi values were already completed bauch et al 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 additionally in those works for the laptev sea the data only for the layer 0 150 m were used in the current work the list of input data was slightly different for faw frw fi and ds all the data up to 3 000 m were used which allowed us to distinguish the cores of the atlantic water mass which lay below 150 m depth in this case distinguishing the cores of atlantic waters is an important link in verifying the obtained results because their position was studied well nikiforov and shpaikher 1980 3 theory calculation in this work were used all the data from 1972 to 2017 presented in table 1 3 1 assessment of the difference in values of sea water composition calculated according to the classic tsc and modified three component systems tsm as demonstrated above in case of ice formation fi 0 the estimation of fa and fr values according to the three component system of equations demonstrates a sum of basic atlantic and river waters content in the sub ice layer of water and in the ice for the case of meltwater ingress this system of equations demonstrates a sum of atlantic and river waters only in the sea water fi 0 because the samples were collected in the sub ice layer for the case of ice formation it is necessary to subtract the values of atlantic and river fractions excluded for ice formation which is not implied by the classic three component system in this case both atlantic and river sub ice waters are modified by ice formation processes and the calculated fi value if it is negative shows the value of accumulated transformations of sub sea waters possibly attributed to several ice formation cycles the difference in estimations of fractions of atlantic and river waters content according to tsc and tsm are presented in table 3 for the ice formation case the highest average values of the difference in the analysis of the existing series of calculation according to tsc and tsm up to 4 for atlantic waters and up to 1 8 for river water are in the composition of the kara sea water then the laptev sea goes in descending order of these values and then the barents sea therefore the maximum difference for atlantic waters and river waters 30 5 and 25 2 respectively was observed for the laptev sea 17 6 and 9 5 respectively for barents sea and 16 3 for both components of the kara sea 3 2 main regularities in mixing and transformation of sea waters the distribution of the atlantic river and ice water content values on the surface and bottom horizons as well as on sections in the kara and laptev seas is presented in appendix a figs a1 a4 first the interrelationship between the salinity and δ18o values was discussed graphs of the relationship between salinity and δ18o for all three seas are presented in fig 2 for all water basins under consideration these relationships are close to one but they do not coincide for two reasons first river runoff has various δ18o values which results in various values of curve crossings with the axis of coordinates second the sag values of these curves are different for the barents sea the relationship is approximately linear and for the laptev sea a distinctive sag is traced it characterises the influence of the ice formation processes prevailing over the ice melting processes the results of tsm based calculations demonstrate that the equation of inter relationships among the atlantic and river waters salinity and dependence of river water content on atlantic water content have a correlation factor close to one but the interrelationships themselves differ from each other for the barents sea they are linear the nonlinearity value increases from west to east from the barents sea to the laptev sea fig 3 a b and 4a the interrelationship between the atlantic waters and river waters is inverse in nature with a correlation coefficient nearly equal to one dependencies of sea water salinity change ds on fi value for the seas in question also vary from each other for example to have the salinity increase as a result of ice formation by 0 5 psu in the laptev sea it is necessary to remove approximately 13 of water for ice formation in the laptev sea 10 in the kara sea and approximately 8 in the barents sea on the contrary for sea water desalination caused by ice melting for the same value approximately 8 of meltwater in the barents sea 12 in the kara sea and 13 in the laptev sea fig 4 a is required it is interesting to contemplate this dependence of the value of fi on salinity obviously it will have a different appearance for the period of ice formation and ice melting as all the samples were collected in the summer autumn period this dependence is only for the period of ice melting fig 3c it is noteworthy that for the whole salinity range both positive and negative fi values were observed for the barents sea a determination factor of fi dependence on salinity is equal to zero at all dependency values determinations for the kara and laptev seas are much lower than for the dependencies for atlantic and river content as discussed earlier for these seas although samples were collected during the summer autumn period the average fi values within the range of salinity values of 10 35 psu had negative values and the lowest values were observed within the range of salinity of 20 25 psu for the kara and laptev seas the average fi values for this salinity range reached 6 and 11 respectively these salination values according to equations presented in fig 4b and are equal to 0 31 and 0 44 psu respectively the highest salination value for the kara sea and the laptev sea was 1 7 psu with the salinity of the sea water equal to 21 5 and 28 psu respectively 3 3 composition of water masses the atlantic waters move eastward form new water masses and preserve their individuality for these water basins of the world oceans the process of atlantic waters mixing with the runoff of the large siberian rivers as well as the mechanisms of water modification during ice formation and ice melting represent the main mechanisms of new water mass formation to reveal newly formed water masses and to estimate the content of basic waters in these water masses a method of cluster analysis was applied as previously employed in other studies bauch et al 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 namyatov and semeryuk 2019 in the present work the method of cluster analysis was also applied to reveal the structure of water masses of the seas in question however the list of input data was different faw frw fi and ds results of the cluster analysis are presented in appendix b in the barents sea eight clusters were identified but only seven were reviewed because one of the clusters contained only two samples in the kara and laptev seas six clusters in each were reviewed in fig 5 relative positions of average values faw frw and fi are shown for each cluster in this graph the axis fr has a reverse value in relation to the axis fa because a change in these values has a differently directed nature see fig 4a additionally the trends of faw and frw values change against the fi value and are plotted in these figures they show the tendencies of these parameters differ from one another a composition of basic waters in the final water masses of the seas under consideration faw and frw are obtained and the values of these waters modification during ice formation or ice melting fi are presented the average values of these magnitudes in water masses clusters for each sea have similar characters but their magnitudes differ from one another depending on the different magnitudes of the river runoff and extents of these waters modification during ice formation and ice melting if an analogy is made with the biological environment the water masses in this case in each of the seas occupy similar ecological niches in total eight clusters were revealed in these seas cluster 2 was observed only in the kara sea and cluster 8 only in the barents sea it is noteworthy that the location of stations in the barents sea was sparse and those stations are mostly concentrated around the spitsbergen archipelago and in the south eastern part of the sea the central parts of the sea are not encompassed by such research therefore with further research encompassing the central parts of the sea including the central depression the number of revealed water masses in the barents sea may change statistical characteristics of the measured and calculated values for each cluster are presented below in fig 5 the magnitudes of the calculated standard deviations are presented as error bars however they are shown as approximate values the propagation of water masses clusters on the surface and bottom horizons and in the sections are presented in fig 6 the classification of water masses for arctic seas was made by e g nikiforov and e g shpaikher nikiforov and shpaikher 1980 their classification and names are used in this study to analyse the obtained results 4 results 4 1 cluster 1 and 2 the cluster analysis showed that river waters in the kara sea were distributed into two clusters see fig 6 which differ mainly in fi value the boundaries of cluster 1 waters propagation are confined closer to estuaries and the effect of the waters modification caused by ice melting prevail there water modifications caused by ice melting are also observed in the cluster 2 but to a lower extent in clusters 1 and 2 according to the water classification presented above the characteristics are those of summer river water masses table 4 additionally the presence of waters modified during ice formation up to 1 8 was detected in the barents sea river waters are not split in two clusters and characteristics of this water mass are close to the relevant characteristics of the cluster 1 in the kara sea conversely in the laptev sea the characteristics of waters belonging to this water mass are close to those of waters presented in cluster 2 of the kara sea where waters were modified by ice melting but waters modified during ice formations were also encountered with the maximum modification value of 10 6 areas of these waters propagation in all three seas are adjacent to the estuaries of the inflowing rivers in the barents sea the estuary is associated with the pechora river in the kara sea the estuaries are of the ob and the yenisei rivers and in the laptev sea it is the estuary of the lena river the median content of atlantic river waters in this water mass is 76 89 0 3 in the kara sea 71 14 in the barents sea and 62 27 in the laptev seathe median k values eq 9 in these water masses vary from 0 to 0 43 4 2 cluster 3 and 4 further from the estuaries there are areas of so called shelf waters fig 6 a b c d and their characteristics are described below table 5 these are waters that were subjected to the transformation because of ice formation a part of this water mass which is adjacent to river waters is more desalinated cluster 3 however these waters differ from river waters due to a higher modification degree caused by ice formation average values of atlantic river waters content in the barents kara and laptev seas are 64 2 35 7 35 9 64 0 and 49 3 50 7 respectively the median k values eq 9 in these water masses vary from 0 8 to 7 7 the median fi values are 6 2 5 5 and 16 8 in the barents kara and laptev seas respectively a part of this water mass which is in closer contact with the open sea basin cluster 4 has a relatively lower temperature due to ice formation in the barents and laptev seas however in the kara sea the modification of this water mass fraction increases due to the ice formation 4 3 cluster 5 and 6 surface water of arctic seas in winter these waters are subjected to salination as a result of ice formation cluster 5 although a degree of these waters modification caused by ice formation is much lower than that of shelf waters clearly it is due to convective mixing wherein modified water is mixed with a much larger volume of water than in the shelf water mass the median k values eq 9 in these water masses vary from 12 to 40 the average modification values caused by ice formation vary 1 7 3 7 which is much lower than in shelf waters table 6 however as these are the average fi values for a given water mass when referring these values to the averaging layer it determines the amount of ice formed from this water mass 300 m for barents sea 150 m for kara and 50 for laptev seas in this case the size of formed ice in this water mass of the barents kara and laptev seas is 4 5 m 2 6 m and 1 2 m respectively if it is assumed that the size of thick first year ice in the barents sea is 1 35 m terziev 1991 then these waters did not mix with waters containing meltwaters for at least 3 5 years the summer surface water of arctic seas cluster 6 is in the surface layer in the barents and kara seas the content of meltwaters completely grades the processes of ice formation and fi values are always positive in the laptev sea a modest manifestation of ice formation processes is observed the median k values eq 9 in these water masses vary from 10 to 45 4 4 cluster 7 atlantic waters with the current set of incoming values this cluster incorporated both direct atlantic waters and bottom waters of the arctic basin table 7 in the kara sea these water masses are not identified at implemented stations as the data presented in table 1 are not uniform and have large gaps in water temperature values which is typical for the kara and the barents seas in the barents sea the research is represented in two isolated areas therefore the cluster analysis was conducted based on the composition of incoming data allowing the maximum preservation of series continuance in a more detailed examination of the characteristics of waters in this cluster several cores of water masses can be identified in the layer of 200 400 m and 550 1000 m the bottom layers of the arctic basin are the waters which have negative temperatures and lie below the atlantic waters temperature below 0 c was observed at 1000 m below the horizon the average temperature of these waters was 0 49 0 42 c north of the spitsbergen archipelago and to 0 69 0 10 c in the laptev sea which is approximately 2 0 c below the average temperature of atlantic waters and the average water salinity is 34 92 0 02 psu which is higher than that of atlantic waters by approximately 0 07 psu the value of atlantic waters content in this water mass was 99 74 the value of river waters content is 0 21 0 12 the negative value of fi 0 23 0 16 indicates that these waters were located in the upper layers where as a result of the convective mixing there was an ingress of waters containing both river waters and waters transformed as a result of ice formation 4 5 cluster 8 cluster 8 table 8 these waters were observed only in the barents sea and only in the surroundings of the spitsbergen archipelago they can be provisionally described as summer waters of the barents sea they differ from the nordkapp current waters in that the average temperature of these waters is practically lower by 3 c the salinity is lower by 0 1 psu the content of atlantic waters is lower by 2 5 the content of river waters is higher by 1 0 the median k values eq 9 in these water masses are 45 specifically the effect of meltwaters presence is stronger expressed by 1 7 on average judging from these characteristics these waters are formed by the ingress of warm atlantic waters runoff from the spitsbergen archipelago mainland and waters formed by melting sea ice table 8 5 conclusion the one of fundamental concepts in hydrology oceanography is the concept of water masses in fact water masses have always been determined using the values of temperature and salinity of sea water the use of the isotopic parameter δ18o provided an opportunity to establish a three component system of equations which allowed assessing the above listed volumes of waters in the final water mass that is what was used in many works the difference between the assessments based on two and three component systems that allows assessment of change in sea water salinity caused only by the processes of ice formation and ice melting ds however the classic three component system of equations tsc in its pure form is applicable only under the conditions of ice melting but under the conditions of ice formation it introduces overestimation of atlantic and river waters content a modified three component system tsm presented in this work allows elimination of such inaccuracies the difference between average values for the available series of observations according to tsc and tsm increases in the following order kara sea laptev sea barents sea as 3 95 1 49 1 19 atlantic waters and 1 84 0 54 0 13 river waters this means that maximum difference for atlantic waters and river waters 30 5 and 25 2 respectively has been observed for laptev sea 17 6 and 9 5 respectively for the barents sea and 16 3 for both components of the kara sea using the parameters fa faw fr frw fi and ds allows to isolate water masses using the more fundamental characteristics such as the amount of base waters included in this water mass the relations of which determine the final temperature and salinity of water the great interest is the transformation of atlantic waters moving from west to east such a study using the fa and fr parameters has already been done in the works of d bauch and co authors bauch et al 2016 bauch and cherniavskaia 2018 this paper presents the values fa faw fr frw fi and ds of four layers of atlantic waters four layers of atlantic water were examined table 9 1 atlantic water arriving in the barents sea between scandinavia and the medvezhy island 2 atlantic water enveloping the spitsbergen archipelago from the north 3 atlantic water at the border of the laptev sea and the arctic ocean with the midstream on the horizon of 300 m 4 atlantic water at the border of the laptev sea and the arctic ocean with the midstream on the horizon of 800 m salinity in the layers of atlantic water varies from 35 0 0 1 at the western boundary of the barents sea to 34 85 0 08 psu at the northern boundary of the laptev sea a reduction of the parameter δ18 o from 0 30 0 15 to 0 22 0 06psu is observed in the same areas a negative value of fi indicates an insignificant domination of ice formation processes in case of transformation of this water mass comparing the values of temperature and salinity with winter january february values of these parameters in the waters of the nordkapp current at the western boundary of the barents sea shows that the temperature of atlantic waters which reached the laptev sea decreased by approximately 4 c and the salinity by 0 1 psu the presented estimates demonstrate that the transformations of atlantic waters are caused by both the ingress of small quantities of river waters and transformations resulting from the ice formation process however at a temperature of 1 3 c the processes of ice formation cannot occur apparently moving to the east this effect is not directly connected with the processes of ice formation in the atlantic water mass but is associated with the processes of mixing with overlying layers especially during convective mixing the overlying layers where the process of ice formation takes place directly contain a rather large quantity of atlantic waters which are subjected to such transformations thus even in the summer waters of the laptev sea shelf with a water salinity of 22 3 psu the average content of atlantic waters is 65 and the waters removal for ice formation in this water mass on average is approximately 10 it means that in atlantic waters with positive water temperatures the observed effect of weak transformations caused by ice formation is explained by the convective mixing with the upper water layers which were subjected to significant transformations as a result of the direct ice formation and contained both atlantic and river waters the waters that have undergone significant transformation during ice formation are the least studied the main problem is the detection and establishment of the boundaries of these waters a good indicator of these waters is the fi parameter in the kara and the laptev seas this water mass is located within the boundaries of the polynya which is an ice factory for the seas under consideration if it is assumed that the average sea depth in places of ice formation in the laptev sea basin adjacent to the delta of the lena river in ob yenisei shallow waters of the kara sea and in the south eastern barents sea is 20 m then the thickness of the formed ice is approximately 1 m in the barents sea 1 2 m in the kara sea and from 2 to 3 5 m in the laptev sea the provided estimated values of the formed ice thicknesses possibly reflect the values of several ice formation cycles they are unique characteristics preserving a memory of the magnitudes of ice formation processes that occurred in these waters physical value of the memory is in the change of the interrelation between the content of stable isotopes 16o and 18o in the sea water this memory will last very long until as a result of advection convectional and turbulent mixing with other layers as well as a result of the reverse process ice formation ice melting the relation between stable isotopes 16o and 18o will return to the previous level or come close to it the mmedian values of the sea water salination are 0 25 psu in the barents sea 0 54 in the kara sea and up to 0 67 psu in the laptev sea the maximum salination values reached 0 85 1 27 and 2 20 psu in the barents kara and laptev seas respectively because the samples were collected during the summer autumn period which is the period of active ice melting the negative fi values demonstrate that there is not complete replacement of winter waters transformed as a result of ice formation with summer meltwaters this causes some accumulation and conservation of these waters in the folds of the sea bottom configuration which exist year round and form the so called stagnant waters semeryuk and namyatov 2018 as these waters accumulate and the processes of organic substance oxidation in them do not stop minimum concentrations of dissolved oxygen and maximum concentrations of the mineral fraction of biogenic elements like phosphorus silica and nitrogen are observed in them the observed minimum concentrations of dissolved oxygen in this area of the laptev sea was 3 3 ml l which indicates the values of approximate oxygen consumption in the range of 3 5 4 0 ml l the minimum value of saturation with dissolved oxygen was 40 which is lower than the values in the neighbouring layers by approximately 40 the observed maximum concentration of phosphate phosphorus in this water mass was 3 3 µmol l which indicates an increase in concentration during organic substance mineralisation by 2 0 2 5 µmol l similar concentrations for silica are the maximum concentration in this water mass of 33 µmol l and the value of the concentration increase during organic substance mineralisation is approximately 20 µmol l aarii 2014 based on the δ18o values the barents sea is the least researched portion of the seas under consideration fig 1 in its centre in a large water basin there are no available data according to previous research conducted in the bottom layer of the central depression of the sea 300 350 m a water mass transformed as a result of ice formation was observed which was characterised by a water temperature close to freezing and a high salinity 35 0 35 05 psu additionally it was observed that the content of na ions its normalised chlorinity value was lower compared to the relevant values in the standard sea water on average this value was 0 985 0 14 namyatov et al 1994 presumably waters with a high density high salinity and low temperature transformed as a result of ice formation movements in the bottom layer along the sea bottom configuration and accumulated in the deepest places this effect requires further study because the change of the main ions ratio in these waters corresponds to the uncertainty of the salinity definitions using the salinity chlorinity salinity conductivity equations obviously in future research if these waters are recorded by type they may be classified as shelf waters however with lower water temperature and higher salinity as well as greater distance from the coast currently the magnitude of the waters transformation as a result of ice formation is unknown the use of both classical and modified methods will allow you to study 1 long period climatic variability of water masses composition in this case the composition of water masses means the content of atlantic river and ice water ice formation and ice melting volumes 2 changed of hydrochemical parameters in the waters transformed as a result of ice formation nutrients pollutants main ions etc the fi value has an important scientific and practical significance because it is used to summarise singular cycle values and possibly several observation cycles of ice formation while also being unique maintaining the memory of the ice formation process volumes which occurred in these waters it is possible that using the value of fi it is possible to monitor formed of melted ice which will indirectly characterize climate change declaration of competing interest the authors

changes in future under changing climate scenarios brunner et al 2019 future hydrological regime changes can be related to changes in flood and droughts characteristics and groundwater recharge middelkoop et al 2001 therefore quantification of future streamflow changes is vital as it will facilitate improved water resources management practices brunner et al 2020 to improve the understanding of future streamflow variations climatic variables need to be assessed as hydrological processes are being significantly affected by the changing climate lopez ballesteros et al 2020 kour et al 2016a changes in the temperature and rainfall alter few components of hydrological systems explicitly precipitation extremes evaporation and streamflow variations xu et al 2011 bolch et al 2012 sood et al 2013 reported reduction of up to 40 in future runoff of volta river basin west africa due to decreasing rainfall and increasing temperature by the end of 21st century a rise of 4 3 c in temperature for the entire ganges brahmaputra and meghna basin and increase in mean precipitation by 16 3 19 8 and 29 6 have resulted to increase in mean runoff by 16 2 33 1 and 39 7 in the brahmaputra ganges and meghna basin respectively masood et al 2015 maurer et al 2009 observed increase in median temperature by 1 9 c lower b1 scenario and 3 4 c mid high a2 scenario and decrease in median precipitation by 5 b1 and 10 4 a2 led to decrease in median reservoir inflow by 13 b1 and 24 a2 in rio lempa basin from 2070 to 2099 uniyal et al 2015 used twelve independent climate scenarios and indicated decrease in surface runoff from 2 5 to 11 if the temperature changes from 1 to 5 c whereas if rainfall is increased by 2 5 to 15 this will cause an increase in surface runoff by 6 67 to 43 42 from the baseline condition in the upper baitarani river basin india around the world several researchers have analyzed that climate changes are intricately interlinked with the changes in hydrological regime lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 de girolamo et al 2017 lopez ballesteros et al 2020 to monitor the impact of climate change on future runoff reliable estimates of climate projections are required so that they can be further used in the hydrological models global climate models gcms under different scenarios are most widely accepted tools for making reliable future projections de girolamo et al 2017 although gcms provide realistic representations of large scale aspects of climate their coarse resolution outputs are often inadequate to resolve significant regional scale features wilby et al 1999 xu 1999 to alleviate the uncertainty of gcms regional climate models rcms have been introduced to resolve the heterogeneity of complex geographical regions in a very efficient manner lee et al 2019 dimri et al 2013 observed that rcms performed good even over the himalayan region which is characterized by rugged terrain conditions and large variability in regional climate patterns rcms have been used by several researchers in the himalayan region viz jury et al 2020 predicted a rise of 2 m air temperature and precipitation rate connected to the indian summer monsoon by using an ensemble of 36 gcms

the use of hydrological models for future projections is associated to uncertainties kour et al 2016b clark et al 2016 uncertainties are associated mainly with the selection of hydrological model

and for future time periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 the results of their study exhibited an increase in the river discharge during winter spring and autumn and decrease during summer season

runoff was also reported for other catchments explicitly kis et al 2020 reported decrease of future streamflow in the upper tisza basin especially in july and august by making use of coherent set of advanced numerical models and regcm4 model anand et al 2017 used three rcms for ganga basin and projected a decrease in surface runoff by 50 to 10 during monsoon months while an increase of 10 to 20

seasonal discharge and extreme flows for pearl river basin china their study indicated a decrease in river discharge during dry season whereas it tends to increase in the middle and lower reaches and decreases in the upper reach of the pearl river basin during wet season therefore in the present study two rcps 4 5 low emission scenario and 8 5 high emission scenario of regional climate model

respect to observed runoff of baseline period 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area jhelum river is one of the major tributaries of the indus river and originates from chesham verinag of kashmir valley india it comprises of 24 watersheds with few watersheds on the left bank draining from the pir panjal range and the other watersheds from the right bank draining from the greater himalayan range romshoo et al 2018 jhelum river crosses indian border from uri sector and area of jhelum catchment up to indo pakistan border is 28 995 km2 fig 1 the jhelum catchment consists of moderately high hills mountain ranges and alluvial tract in jhelum catchment two main soil types are available i e silty loam to clay loam the former type is found on karewa tops and uplands with slope variant of 1 3

higher emission scenario rcp 8 5 shows more increase in case of minimum temperature as well as compared to low emission scenario rcp 4 5 maximum temperature shows more warming as compared to minimum temperature for all the time slices except 2040s and 2060s under rcp 4 5 and 2080s under rcp 8 5 where minimum temperature shows more warming this result differs from the studies who reported more warming of minimum temperature as compared to maximum temperature for the future time period rajbhandari et al 2015 ren et al 2017 rajbhandari et al 2015 reported that projected temperature progressively warms over the indus basin with minimum temperature trend slightly greater than maximum temperature trend for all the time scales viz near future middle of the twenty first century and

projections comparison between rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation and pet averaged over a period of 2020 to 2100 individually for three stations have been depicted in the figs 6 to 9 respectively maximum temperature shows more warming rate in rcp 8 5 as compared to rcp 4 5 for all the stations except ram munshi bagh station where rcp 4 5 depicts higher values for the months of may to august in fig 6 maximum temperature shows a rise of 4 39 and 8 57 c for asham station 0 12 and 0 54 c for ram munshi bagh and 2 7 and 7 4 c for sangam station with respect to baseline period under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 respectively by the end of the century fig 6 rcp 8 5 shows higher minimum temperature values for asham station relative to rcp 4 5 ram munshi bagh and sangam stations also exhibit the same trend except few months where rcp 4 5 supersedes rcp 8 5 fig 7 a rise of 3 75 and 10 17 c for asham station 0 16 and 1 51 c for ram munshi bagh station and 2 56 and 3 76 c for sangam station was projected in case of minimum temperature under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 respectively during 2020 to 2100 fig 7 among the two rcps rcp 8 5 reveal highest precipitation record

under rcp 4 5 and incline of 6 10 mm under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century for asham station on the other hand a variation of 9 68 and 14 06 mm for ram munshi bagh and 39 10 and 11 73 mm for sangam station was projected under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 respectively during 2020 to 2100 rcp 8 5 exhibits higher pet values in comparison to rcp 4 5 for both asham and ram munshi bagh stations whereas for sangam station rcp 4 5 surpassed rcp 8 5 during the months of january and september to december fig 9 3 6 river runoff variation the comparison between observed and rcps based vic simulated runoff average of three stations for the baseline period i e 1991 2016 has been shown in the fig 10 the vic model performed well under both the emission scenarios for the jhelum catchment for example minimum runoff was observed in 2001 and maximum in 2014 and simulated runoff replicated the observed runoff very well maximum runoff was observed in the year 2014 due to the occurrence of flood in the kashmir valley figs 11 and 12 show the bi decadal variation of simulated runoff of each station during baseline period and future time periods 2040s 2060s 2080s and 2100s under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 respectively as depicted in the figs 11 and 12 highest runoff was simulated during baseline period and then an abrupt decline in runoff was observed during 2040s and then it gradually increases up to 2080s and again gradually decreases in 2100s for all the three stations under both the rcp scenarios among rcps 4 5 and 8 5 rcp 8 5 shows high runoff projections for the future time period the simulated runoff of asham station shows decrease from 6900 46 cusecs during 1991 2016 to 2700 3033 11 cusecs during 2020 2040 followed by an increase i e 2878 19 3278 19 cusecs during 2040 2060 and 2919 35 3419 35 cusecs during 2060 2080 then again followed by a decrease in 2080 2100 viz 2561 97 3061 97 cusecs under rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 similarly runoff shows decrease from 5916 8 cusecs during 1991 2016 to 2500 2974 86 cusecs in 2020 2040 followed by a gradual increase i e 2600 3047 16 cusecs in 2040 2060 and 2691 54 3191 54 cusecs in 2060 2080 and again decreases 2347 26 2847 26 cusecs in 2080 2100 for ram munshi bagh under rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 similar trend of runoff was also seen for sangam station i e it decreased from 6087 84 cusecs in 1991 2016 to 2561 32 3161 32 cusecs in 2020 2040 increases to 2608 37 3208 37 cusecs during 2040 2060 and 2752 51 3352 51 cusecs during 2060 2080 finally followed by a decline viz 2587 98 2987 98 cusecs during 2080 2100 under rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 it is clearly reflected that under both the rcp emission scenarios runoff increases gradually from 2020 to 2080 and then declines during 2080 to 2100 which is accordance to the incline in precipitation projections up to 2080 and decline during 2080 to 2100 studies conducted for himalayan watersheds have also reported that increase in precipitation as well as increase in net glacier melt will result to overall increase in annual runoff immerzeel et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 3 7 snow cover area sca variation and its relationship with runoff the variation of sca over a period of 2002 to 2016 for the jhelum basin has been depicted in the fig 13 sca first increases from 2002 to 2004 then abruptly drops in 2006 and then showed an alternate trend of increase and decrease up to 2016 with minimum and maximum values for the years 2006 and 2013 respectively fig 14 shows pearson s correlation coefficient values between sca and river runoff a negative relationship was observed between sca and stream flow ranging between 0 44 to 0 88 a strong negative correlation was obtained for the year 2012 i e 0 88 followed by the year 2014 0 79 which depicts the inverse relationship between the sca and runoff 3 8 calibration and validation calibration for the period 1991 2003 and validation 2004 2016 of vic model was done using observed runoff and coefficient of determination r2 table 1 depicts the values of variable infiltration curve b infilt fraction of maximum soil moisture ds and wind speed ws used in the vic model coefficient of determination r2 was calculated between observed and simulated runoff individually for each station during calibration and validation periods under both the scenarios table 2 the r2 value of runoff for three stations i e asham ram munshi bagh and sangam during calibration and validation periods is 0 94 0 89 0 93 0 92 0 93 0 91 and 0 77 0 74 0 91 0 87 0 90 0 89 respectively under rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 table 2 overall a good agreement between the simulated and observed discharge was observed for all the stations 4 conclusion climate change is a major concern worldwide with significant effects on hydrological processes climate change has already produced and will produce pronounced effects on hydrological regime the present study has been carried out to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrological regime of jhelum catchment western himalayas to evaluate the climatic variability future projections of representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 of regional climate model version 4 regcm4 and observed datasets of three stations namely asham ram munshi bagh and sangam for the baseline period 1991 2016 were used the changes in maximum and minimum temperature pet and precipitation projections of future bi decades i e 2020 2040 2040 2060 2060 2080 and 2080 2100 were analyzed and compared with the corresponding observed baseline datasets maximum temperature depicted a rise of 1 18 c to 3 29 c under rcp 4 5 and 3 58 c to 7 22 c under rcp 8 5 from 2020 to 2100 with respect to baseline period for the entire jhelum basin minimum temperature indicated a rise from 1 30 c to 2 92 c under rcp 4 5 and 3 38 c to 6 92 c under rcp 8 5 from 2020 to 2100 high emission scenario rcp 8 5 shows more increment in maximum as well as minimum temperature relative to low emission scenario rcp 4 5 precipitation projections shows a variation of 14 34 mm 9 60 mm 4 19 mm and 15 62 mm under rcp 4 5 and 7 45 mm 12 37 mm 22 19 mm and 6 86 mm under rcp 8 5 for 2040s 2060s 2080s and 2100s respectively with respect to baseline period comparison among the precipitation projections of future bi decades show increasing trend under both the rcps from 2020 to 2080 then slightly decreases from 2080 to 2100 pet depicted a variation of 2 13 2 02 2 02 and 2 04 mm under rcp 4 5 and 1 81 1 65 1 42 and 1 43 mm under rcp 8 5 for the time spans 2040s 2060s 2080s and 2100s respectively snow cover area sca was also computed for the time period 2002 to 2016 using modissnow cover 8 day l3 global 500 m grid mod10a2 datasets minimum and maximum sca was observed during 2006 and 2013 respectively pearson s correlation coefficient shows negative relationship between sca and runoff during all the years with strong negative coefficient of 0 88 for the year 2012 vic model was implemented to simulate the future runoff under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios and observed runoff was used for the calibration 1991 2003 and validation 2004 2016 of the vic model similar trend as seen for precipitation was observed for runoff explicitly highest runoff was observed during baseline period followed by a sharp decline during 2040s and then it gradually increases up to 2080s and again declines in 2100s under both the rcp scenarios like minimum and maximum temperature highest runoff values were recorded under rcp 8 5 relative to rcp 4 5 it is clearly indicated above that both maximum and minimum temperature increases for the future time period as compared to the baseline period although increase is higher under rcp 8 5 precipitation indicated a decline for the future time under rcp 4 5 however rcp 8 5 exhibited an incline when compared with the baseline period comparison among the future bi decades indicated a rise in precipitation until 2080 and decline afterwards and this led to increase in runoff until 2080 followed by a decline by the end of the 21st century under both the emission scenarios this observation reveals that precipitation projections strongly influence river runoff of the jhelum catchment credit

4951,the changes in maximum and minimum temperature potential evapotranspiration pet and precipitation of future bi decades i e 2020 2040 2040 2060 2060 2080 and 2080 2100 with the corresponding observed baseline datasets 1991 2016 were analyzed for the jhelum catchment western himalayas using representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 of regional climate model version 4 regcm4 maximum and minimum temperature projections indicated a rise of 1 18 c to 3 29 c and 1 30 c to 2 92 c under rcp 4 5 and 3 58 c to 7 22 c and 3 38 c to 6 92 c under rcp 8 5 respectively relative to the baseline period precipitation shows a decline of 14 34 mm 9 60 mm 4 19 mm and 15 62 mm under rcp 4 5 whereas rcp 8 5 shows an incline of 7 45 mm 12 37 mm 22 19 mm and 6 86 mm during 2040s 2060s 2080s and 2100s respectively as compared to the baseline period for the months of may to september both the rcps indicated a decrease in pet values snow cover area sca computed from modissnow cover 8 day l3 global 500 m grid mod10a2 datasets over a period of 2002 to 2016 depicted a negative relationship with river runoff with strong negative coefficient of 0 88 for the year 2012 the impact of these climate change projections were computed on the hydrology of jhelum catchment using variable infiltration capacity vic model comparison among the future bi decades show increasing trend of precipitation under both the rcps from 2020 to 2080 then slightly decreases during 2080 2100 similar trend was exhibited by runoff projections viz runoff increases till 2080 and decreases afterwards under both the rcp emission scenarios temperature and runoff shows relatively higher values under rcp 8 5 than rcp 4 5 overall results indicated a strong influence of precipitation projections on runoff of jhelum catchment keywords climate change pet vic model rcps snow cover area runoff jhelum catchment 1 introduction the hydrological regimes are undergoing changes and will undergo further changes in future under changing climate scenarios brunner et al 2019 future hydrological regime changes can be related to changes in flood and droughts characteristics and groundwater recharge middelkoop et al 2001 therefore quantification of future streamflow changes is vital as it will facilitate improved water resources management practices brunner et al 2020 to improve the understanding of future streamflow variations climatic variables need to be assessed as hydrological processes are being significantly affected by the changing climate lopez ballesteros et al 2020 kour et al 2016a changes in the temperature and rainfall alter few components of hydrological systems explicitly precipitation extremes evaporation and streamflow variations xu et al 2011 bolch et al 2012 sood et al 2013 reported reduction of up to 40 in future runoff of volta river basin west africa due to decreasing rainfall and increasing temperature by the end of 21st century a rise of 4 3 c in temperature for the entire ganges brahmaputra and meghna basin and increase in mean precipitation by 16 3 19 8 and 29 6 have resulted to increase in mean runoff by 16 2 33 1 and 39 7 in the brahmaputra ganges and meghna basin respectively masood et al 2015 maurer et al 2009 observed increase in median temperature by 1 9 c lower b1 scenario and 3 4 c mid high a2 scenario and decrease in median precipitation by 5 b1 and 10 4 a2 led to decrease in median reservoir inflow by 13 b1 and 24 a2 in rio lempa basin from 2070 to 2099 uniyal et al 2015 used twelve independent climate scenarios and indicated decrease in surface runoff from 2 5 to 11 if the temperature changes from 1 to 5 c whereas if rainfall is increased by 2 5 to 15 this will cause an increase in surface runoff by 6 67 to 43 42 from the baseline condition in the upper baitarani river basin india around the world several researchers have analyzed that climate changes are intricately interlinked with the changes in hydrological regime lorenzo lacruz et al 2012 de girolamo et al 2017 lopez ballesteros et al 2020 to monitor the impact of climate change on future runoff reliable estimates of climate projections are required so that they can be further used in the hydrological models global climate models gcms under different scenarios are most widely accepted tools for making reliable future projections de girolamo et al 2017 although gcms provide realistic representations of large scale aspects of climate their coarse resolution outputs are often inadequate to resolve significant regional scale features wilby et al 1999 xu 1999 to alleviate the uncertainty of gcms regional climate models rcms have been introduced to resolve the heterogeneity of complex geographical regions in a very efficient manner lee et al 2019 dimri et al 2013 observed that rcms performed good even over the himalayan region which is characterized by rugged terrain conditions and large variability in regional climate patterns rcms have been used by several researchers in the himalayan region viz jury et al 2020 predicted a rise of 2 m air temperature and precipitation rate connected to the indian summer monsoon by using an ensemble of 36 gcms and 13 rcms for two representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for indus ganga and brahmaputra river basins menegoz et al 2013 reported that rcm underestimated precipitation at the foothills of the himalaya and in its eastern parts under high end emission scenario rcp 8 5 a change of 5 4 c during winter and 4 9 c during summer monsoon was projected by the end of 21st century in karakoram and northwestern himalaya sanjay et al 2017 although several researchers used hydrological models for quantification of future streamflow uniyal et al 2015 hakala et al 2018 wang et al 2020 the use of hydrological models for future projections is associated to uncertainties kour et al 2016b clark et al 2016 uncertainties are associated mainly with the selection of hydrological model projections of climate through the choice of the global climate model gcm the greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios downscaling method and model calibration technique fowler et al 2007 khakbaz et al 2012 kour et al 2016b several studies conducted on jhelum river basin indicated an increase in the future streamflow mahmood and jia 2016 saddique et al 2019 mahmood and jia 2016 assessed climate change impact using a2 and b2 scenarios of hadley centre coupled model version 3 hadcm3 on the trans boundary jhelum river basin pakistan and india with the help of hydrologic modeling system hec hms and for future time periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 the results of their study exhibited an increase in the river discharge during winter spring and autumn and decrease during summer season in the jhelum basin saddique et al 2019 explored climate change impacts on the jhelum basin pakistan using soil and water assessment tool swat two downscaling methods three gcms and two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for three future periods 2030s 2050s and 2090s the results suggested that both downscaling methods showed an increase in annual river discharge over the jhelum basin however decrease in future runoff was also reported for other catchments explicitly kis et al 2020 reported decrease of future streamflow in the upper tisza basin especially in july and august by making use of coherent set of advanced numerical models and regcm4 model anand et al 2017 used three rcms for ganga basin and projected a decrease in surface runoff by 50 to 10 during monsoon months while an increase of 10 to 20 during post monsoon months yan et al 2015 use variable infiltration capacity vic model driven by five different climate models under the rcps 4 5 and 8 5 to assess the impact of climate change on seasonal discharge and extreme flows for pearl river basin china their study indicated a decrease in river discharge during dry season whereas it tends to increase in the middle and lower reaches and decreases in the upper reach of the pearl river basin during wet season therefore in the present study two rcps 4 5 low emission scenario and 8 5 high emission scenario of regional climate model version 4 regcm4 and vic hydrological model have been used to accomplish the following objectives for the jhelum basin western himalayas 1 to evaluate changes in maximum and minimum temperature potential evapotranspiration pet and precipitation future projections with respect to corresponding observed baseline datasets 2 to compute snow cover area sca for the time period 2002 to 2016 using mod10a2 datasets and determine its relationship with river runoff 3 to assess the impact of climate change projections on hydrology of jhelum catchment and analyze the future river runoff changes with respect to observed runoff of baseline period 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area jhelum river is one of the major tributaries of the indus river and originates from chesham verinag of kashmir valley india it comprises of 24 watersheds with few watersheds on the left bank draining from the pir panjal range and the other watersheds from the right bank draining from the greater himalayan range romshoo et al 2018 jhelum river crosses indian border from uri sector and area of jhelum catchment up to indo pakistan border is 28 995 km2 fig 1 the jhelum catchment consists of moderately high hills mountain ranges and alluvial tract in jhelum catchment two main soil types are available i e silty loam to clay loam the former type is found on karewa tops and uplands with slope variant of 1 3

higher emission scenario rcp 8 5 shows more increase in case of minimum temperature as well as compared to low emission scenario rcp 4 5 maximum temperature shows more warming as compared to minimum temperature for all the time slices except 2040s and 2060s under rcp 4 5 and 2080s under rcp 8 5 where minimum temperature shows more warming this result differs from the studies who reported more warming of minimum temperature as compared to maximum temperature for the future time period rajbhandari et al 2015 ren et al 2017 rajbhandari et al 2015 reported that projected temperature progressively warms over the indus basin with minimum temperature trend slightly greater than maximum temperature trend for all the time scales viz near future middle of the twenty first century and

projections comparison between rcps 4 5 and 8 5 for maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation and pet averaged over a period of 2020 to 2100 individually for three stations have been depicted in the figs 6 to 9 respectively maximum temperature shows more warming rate in rcp 8 5 as compared to rcp 4 5 for all the stations except ram munshi bagh station where rcp 4 5 depicts higher values for the months of may to august in fig 6 maximum temperature shows a rise of 4 39 and 8 57 c for asham station 0 12 and 0 54 c for ram munshi bagh and 2 7 and 7 4 c for sangam station with

under rcp 4 5 and incline of 6 10 mm under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century for asham station on the other hand a variation of 9 68 and 14 06 mm for ram munshi bagh and 39 10 and 11 73 mm for sangam station was projected under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 respectively during 2020 to 2100 rcp 8 5 exhibits higher pet values in comparison to rcp 4 5 for both asham and ram munshi bagh stations whereas for sangam station rcp 4 5 surpassed rcp 8 5 during the months of january and september to december fig 9 3 6 river runoff variation the comparison between observed and rcps based vic simulated runoff average of three stations for the baseline period i e 1991 2016 has been shown in the fig 10 the vic model performed well under both the emission scenarios for the jhelum catchment for example minimum runoff was observed in 2001 and maximum in 2014 and simulated runoff replicated the observed runoff very well maximum runoff was observed in the year 2014 due to the occurrence of flood in the kashmir valley figs 11 and 12 show the bi decadal variation of simulated runoff of each station during baseline period and future time periods 2040s 2060s 2080s and 2100s under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 respectively as depicted in the figs 11 and 12 highest runoff was simulated during baseline period and then an abrupt decline in runoff was observed during 2040s and then it gradually increases up to 2080s and again gradually decreases in 2100s for all the three stations under both the rcp scenarios among rcps 4 5 and 8 5 rcp 8 5 shows high runoff projections for the future time period the simulated runoff of asham station shows decrease from 6900 46 cusecs during 1991 2016 to 2700 3033 11 cusecs during 2020 2040 followed by an increase i e 2878 19 3278 19 cusecs during 2040 2060 and 2919 35 3419 35 cusecs during 2060 2080 then again followed by a decrease in 2080 2100 viz 2561 97 3061 97 cusecs under rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 similarly runoff shows decrease from 5916 8 cusecs during 1991 2016 to 2500 2974 86 cusecs in 2020 2040 followed by a gradual increase i e 2600 3047 16 cusecs in 2040 2060 and 2691 54 3191 54 cusecs in 2060 2080 and again decreases 2347 26 2847 26 cusecs in 2080 2100 for ram munshi bagh under rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 similar trend of runoff was also seen for sangam station i e it decreased from 6087 84 cusecs in 1991 2016 to 2561 32 3161 32 cusecs in 2020 2040 increases to 2608 37 3208 37 cusecs during 2040 2060 and 2752 51 3352 51 cusecs during 2060 2080 finally followed by a decline viz 2587 98 2987 98 cusecs during 2080 2100 under rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 it is clearly reflected that under both the rcp emission scenarios runoff increases gradually from 2020 to 2080 and then declines during 2080 to 2100 which is accordance to the incline in precipitation projections up to 2080 and decline during 2080 to 2100 studies conducted for himalayan watersheds have also reported that increase in precipitation as well as increase in net glacier melt will result to overall increase in annual runoff immerzeel et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 3 7 snow cover area sca variation and its relationship with runoff the variation of sca over a period of 2002 to 2016 for the jhelum basin has been depicted in the fig 13 sca first increases from 2002 to 2004 then abruptly drops in 2006 and then showed an alternate trend of increase and decrease up to 2016 with minimum and maximum values for the years 2006 and 2013 respectively fig 14 shows pearson s correlation coefficient values between sca and river runoff a negative relationship was observed between sca and stream flow ranging between 0 44 to 0 88 a strong negative correlation was obtained for the year 2012 i e 0 88 followed by the year 2014 0 79 which depicts the inverse relationship between the sca and runoff 3 8 calibration and validation calibration for the period 1991 2003 and validation 2004 2016 of vic model was done using observed runoff and coefficient of determination r2 table 1 depicts the values of variable infiltration curve b infilt fraction of maximum soil moisture ds and wind speed ws used in the vic model coefficient of determination r2 was calculated between observed and simulated runoff individually for each station during calibration and validation periods under both the scenarios table 2 the r2 value of runoff for three stations i e asham ram munshi bagh and sangam during calibration and validation periods is 0 94 0 89 0 93 0 92 0 93 0 91 and 0 77 0 74 0 91 0 87 0 90 0 89 respectively under rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 table 2 overall a good agreement between the simulated and observed discharge was observed for all the stations 4 conclusion climate change is a major concern worldwide with significant effects on hydrological processes climate change has already produced and will produce pronounced effects on hydrological regime the present study has been carried out to assess the impact of climate change on the hydrological regime of jhelum catchment western himalayas to evaluate the climatic variability future projections of representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 of regional climate model version 4 regcm4 and observed datasets of three stations namely asham ram munshi bagh and sangam for the baseline period 1991 2016 were used the changes in maximum and minimum temperature pet and precipitation projections of future bi decades i e 2020 2040 2040 2060 2060 2080 and 2080 2100 were analyzed and compared with the corresponding observed baseline datasets maximum temperature depicted a rise of 1 18 c to 3 29 c under rcp 4 5 and 3 58 c to 7 22 c under rcp 8 5 from 2020 to 2100 with respect to baseline period for the entire jhelum basin minimum temperature indicated a rise from 1 30 c to 2 92 c under rcp 4 5 and 3 38 c to 6 92 c under rcp 8 5 from 2020 to 2100 high emission scenario rcp 8 5 shows more increment in maximum as well as minimum temperature relative to low emission scenario rcp 4 5 precipitation projections shows a variation of 14 34 mm 9 60 mm 4 19 mm and 15 62 mm under rcp 4 5 and 7 45 mm 12 37 mm 22 19 mm and 6 86 mm under rcp 8 5 for 2040s 2060s 2080s and 2100s respectively with respect to baseline period comparison among the precipitation projections of future bi decades show increasing trend under both the rcps from 2020 to 2080 then slightly decreases from 2080 to 2100 pet depicted a variation of 2 13 2 02 2 02 and 2 04 mm under rcp 4 5 and 1 81 1 65 1 42 and 1 43 mm under rcp 8 5 for the time spans 2040s 2060s 2080s and 2100s respectively snow cover area sca was also computed for the time period 2002 to 2016 using modissnow cover 8 day l3 global 500 m grid mod10a2 datasets minimum and maximum sca was observed during 2006 and 2013 respectively pearson s correlation coefficient shows negative relationship between sca and runoff during all the years with strong negative coefficient of 0 88 for the year 2012 vic model was implemented to simulate the future runoff under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 emission scenarios and observed runoff was used for the calibration 1991 2003 and validation 2004 2016 of the vic model similar trend as seen for precipitation was observed for runoff explicitly highest runoff was observed during baseline period followed by a sharp decline during 2040s and then it gradually increases up to 2080s and again declines in 2100s under both the rcp scenarios like minimum and maximum temperature highest runoff values were recorded under rcp 8 5 relative to rcp 4 5 it is clearly indicated above that both maximum and minimum temperature increases for the future time period as compared to the baseline period although increase is higher under rcp 8 5 precipitation indicated a decline for the future time under rcp 4 5 however rcp 8 5 exhibited an incline when compared with the baseline period comparison among the future bi decades indicated a rise in precipitation until 2080 and decline afterwards and this led to increase in runoff until 2080 followed by a decline by the end of the 21st century under both the emission scenarios this observation reveals that precipitation projections strongly influence river runoff of the jhelum catchment credit

4952,stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h serve as a practical tool in the understanding of regional hydrological cycle in particular where the regional water cycle is stressed by both climate change and human activities lake water in southwest china is believed to play an important role in the local hydrology and possible modification of local climate water isotopes in lake systems are influenced by both the input water isotope and surface evaporation such that they can be used as a natural tracer to evaluate these effects here we present a detailed water isotope balance study in a plateau lake fuxian lake the deepest and largest water body in yungui plateau southwest china with analogues of a steady state of water isotope equilibrium the lake water isotopes are significantly enriched in heavy isotope due to evapoconcentration during the long residence time we simulated the dual isotopes in the lake water using the craig and gordon model constrained by the observed water isotopes in lake water river water and atmospheric vapor results show consistent results for both δ18o and d excess with values of 2 6 and 9 0 at the present relative humidity and e i ratio the test simulations also demonstrate how potential change in climate and or lake water e i ratio could impact lake water isotopes and how the dual water isotope approach can unequivocally define the climatic and hydrological controls on lake water isotopes these findings may be relevant for anticipating and detecting hydrological response to future climate change and water source management e g inter basin diversion projects the results from this study highlight the potential of water isotopes in regional water cycle work paleo climate reconstruction from lacustrine record as well as human activity on water management keywords dual water isotopes lake water balance evaporation enrichment fuxian lake yungui plateau 1 introduction stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h are widely used in the understanding of regional to global hydrological cycle bowen et al 2019 pioneering work on the isotopic effects of water evaporation under different climate conditions craig and gordon 1965 gat 1995 jouzel and koster 1996 merlivat and jouzel 1979 tian et al 2008 paved the way for water isotopes application in the terrestrial water cycle in particular for open water systems lakes serve as important surface water source affecting seasonal water availability and moderating local climate yet climate change and human activities e g controlling of outflow inter basin water diversion project both can alter lake water balance water isotope methods provide an alternative approach to understand these effects where systematic monitoring data are limited or unavailable surface water become enriched in heavy isotopes during evaporation craig and gordon 1965 gibson et al 2016 and consequently this enrichment in heavy isotope can be served as a sign of the intensity of water evaporation used in the hydrodynamic study gibson et al 2002 established how the isotope based approach can be used to study the role of lakes in regional water balance in particular to estimate the residence time and throughflow index evaporation inflow of lake water since then stable isotope mass balance imb modeling had been applied to different types of lake systems with varying meteorological and hydrological assumptions e g anderson et al 2013 biggs et al 2015 brock et al 2009 brooks et al 2014 gibson et al 2016 kebede et al 2009 wen et al 2018 yi et al 2008 quite a few studies have used oxygen isotopes to simulate the lake water balance however information from dual water isotope systems δ18o and δ2h can better constrain the precision of the estimated e i ratio for example a multiple isotope tracer method was used to estimate the isotopic composition of input water to lakes in the boreal region of western canada yi et al 2008 isotopic enrichment during water evaporation results in a distinctive δ18o δ2h relationship in lake water adding the opportunity to estimate the input water isotope signature and different water sources if the local meteoric water line in local precipitation is known bowen et al 2018 yi et al 2008 deuterium excess d excess defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 was proved as an efficient signal for detecting atmospheric water recycling vallet coulomb et al 2008 and was used to estimate the e i ratio of a flow through lakes in the middle of the tibetan plateau and the results are much constrained cui et al 2017 one difficulty in estimation of lake water balance is the atmospheric vapor isotope ratio which affect the kinetic isotope fractionation in the diffusive vapor exchange within the boundary layer brooks et al 2014 atmosphere vapor isotopes are usually unavailable from measurement and were assumed to be in equilibrium with precipitation isotope gibson et al 2002 which proved untrue for regions with strong seasonal precipitation in monsoon region tian et al 2020 yungui plateau located in the southwest china is the eastwards expansion of the tibetan plateau in topography the region is fed by precipitation from indian monsoon in summer season and is also sources of quite a few large rivers the widely distributed lakes over the plateau play a critical role in hydroclimate by supplying moisture to the atmosphere and adjust the seasonal water supply specifically for the dry non monsoon season du et al 2018 xu et al 2018 however with the stress of climate warming and enhancing human activity the regional terrestrial water cycle would be affected and potentially threat eco security here we present a research work on the lake water balance using dual water isotopes in fuxian lake on yungui plateau southwest china we constrained the estimation of e i ratio by continuously monitoring the atmospheric vapor isotopes another specific of the research work is that this lake is the deepest lake in that region with the largest water storage and thus could be more of analogues of steady state of lake water few studies had addressed the isotope water cycle within the plateau lakes for fuxian lake only lake hydrodynamics and sediment accumulation trend were discussed in earlier literature wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2012 in this paper we presented dual water isotopes on different water sources in fuxian lake catchment we simulated the lake water isotope balance for both δ18o and d excess with input water isotope and climate constrains the overall goal of this manuscript is to improve our understanding of the controls on plateau lake water cycle and potentially shed light on the interpretation of lake sediment isotope record in such plateau lake 1 1 site description and

lake water residence time is estimated to be 167 years wang and dou 1998 formed along the xiaojiang fault in the late cenozoic wang et al 1998 tian and luo 2008 this lake shaped in north south direction with wide and deep water in north and narrow and shallow in south this lake is mainly fed by over 100 short rivers surrounding of which at least 56 of them are seasonal rivers due to the monsoon type precipitation the large rivers are located in the northern part of the watershed liu et al 2014 liangwang river is the largest river with a catchment area of over 30 km2 the river is 21 km long with an annual flow of 13 76 million m3 wu et al 2009 since the lake surface occupies approximately one third of the basin area the lake surface precipitation is also an important input for the lake water budget the only outflow of the lake is haikou river in the east bank the regional climate is strongly affected by summer indian monsoon with a distinct wet and dry season each year the dry season lasts from november to next april while the wet season last from may to october according to 60 years of meteorological data 1959 2018 at chengjiang meteorological station 24 40 n 102 54 e 1746 2 m in the north bank fig 2 annual average air temperature is 16 0 c and annual precipitation is 927 1 mm of which 80 90 falling in wet season 1 2 water sampling and isotope measurement three types of lake water samples were collected in fuxian lake basin fig 1 monthly in situ lake water samples were collected at 13 locations surrounding the lake from august 2018 to july 2019 lake water samples were collected slight away from the shoreline to avoid possible influence of shallow water evaporation inside lake surface water was sampled on a boat on 10 april 2019 and 30 samples were collected vertical lake water samples were collected at two sites in the lake and 17 samples were collected in this day all collected lake water samples were sealed in 15 ml plastic vials weekly river water was sampled at liangwang river the largest river in the north bank during the period from august 2018 to june 2019 and totally 42 river water samples were collected some discrete groundwater samples were also collected at the north bank as well daily precipitation samples were collected at fuxian lake plateau deep lake research station 102 91 e 24 63 n at the chinese academy of sciences on the north bank of fuxian lake using an evaporation proof collecting device rainfall samples were collected manually at 20 00 pm on every rainy day daily atmospheric vapor samples were collected at fuxian lake plateau deep lake research station we used a geocrygenic approach for atmospheric vapor sample previously used over ocean surface in polar region and over the tibetan plateau steen larsen et al 2011 tian et al 2020 uemura et al 2008 yu et al 2015 the machine is set to 85 c in the cold trap to collect daily atmospheric vapor sample all water samples were frozen in storage and were analyzed for both δ18o and δ2h using a picarro l2140 i liquid water isotope analyzer with a precision better than 0 10 δ18o and 0 4 δ2h in the institute of international river and eco security yunnan university the value of the isotopic ratio is expressed in per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow2 1 3 meteorological data meteorological data precipitation amount relative humidity air temperature wind speed and direction are available from an automatic weather station installed at fuxian lake plateau deep lake research station surface lake water temperature was recorded at 10 min intervals by a water temperature data loggers near the north bank water temperature together with meteorological data precipitation and relative humidity observed at the fuxian lake station were used as input data for the isotopic model 1 4 model description of isotopic recycling in a steady state lake lake water isotopes represent a balance between inflow water isotopes and outflow water isotopes via evaporation and liquid outflow this variation can be simulated by using a water mass and isotope mass balance model expressed respectively as follows gibson et al 2002 gibson 2002 1 d v d t i q e 2 d v δ l d t i δ i q δ q e δ e where v is the volume of the lake t is time dv is the change in volume over time interval dt i is the sum of all fluxes entering the lake where i ir ig pl ir is surface inflow ig is groundwater inflow pl is precipitation on the lake surface q is outflow including surface outflow and groundwater outflow e is evaporation from the lake δl δi δq and δe are the isotopic compositions of lake total inflow total outflow and evaporation flux respectively the isotopic composition of the flux from an evaporating water body is governed by the isotopic transfer rates during molecular diffusion and eddy diffusion turbulent transport and the evaporation flux δe is typically depleted in heavy isotopes relative to lake water δl a linear resistance model by craig and gordon 1965 can be applied to estimate the isotopic composition of the evaporation flux δe which can be calculated by krabbenhoft et al 1990 3 δ e α δ l h δ a ε 1 h 10 3

be 14 2 for oxygen and 12 5 for hydrogen gonfiantini 1986 horita et al 2008 merlivat and jouzel 1979 under stable climatic and hydrologic conditions the lake water can be considered as close to hydrologic steady state in which input water is balanced by a combination of evaporation and outflow dv dt 0 fuxian lake has large water storage and relatively small surface area therefore this lake can be considered more of a steady state lake for the relatively less change of lake water volume we assume the lake water is thoroughly mixed throughout time in this model we also assume an initial lake isotope composition δ0 equals to the input water isotope composition δi in the first step we introduce a through flow index x representing the fraction of water input lost by evaporation gibson et al 2002 a minor portion of lake water δv lost from the water surface comprised of both xδv evaporating isotope composition of δe and 1 x δv discharging by liquid outflows isotope composition of δl the residual lake water will be slightly enriched in heavy isotopes to a value of δl1 6 δ l 1 v δ o x δ v δ e 1 x δ v δ l v δ v then we assume a small portion of input water δv with δi and that the lake water will maintain the same volume but that lake water isotopes composition will change to a value of δl2 7 δ l 2 v δ v δ l 1 δ v δ i v each step will take a time τδv v where τ is the residence time of water in a steady state lake which is approximately 167 years for fuxian lake given as 8 τ v i with the subsequent repeated steps of lake water evaporation outflow and input water replenishment the model can simulate the progressive enrichment in the heavy isotopes of lake water with time the lake water isotope composition will attain a constant value of δs 2 results 2 1 fuxian lake water isotope 2 1 1 temporal variation of surface lake water δ18o and d excess lake water was sampled periodically during the period of august 2018 july 2019 the averages of these measurements indicate the seasonal change of lake water isotopes table 1 and fig 3 the temporal variations of lake water isotopes are shown in fig 3 the range of surface lake water δ18o during these surveys is small varying from 2 4 to 2 9 a seasonal signal in association with the seasonal precipitation isotope and evaporation condition the slightly higher δ18o values in spring indicate an influence of enhanced evaporation enrichment in the dry season the increasing river runoff with lower δ18o decrease the lake water isotopes in raining season d excess of surface lake water in fuxian lake ranges from 9 5 to 7 7 with a mean value of 9 0 significantly lower than that in inlet river of around 8 both large differences of water δ18o and d excess between lake water and input river water indicate a strong evaporation enrichment of heavy isotope during the long term lake water cycle the inverse change of lake water δ18o and d excess fig 3 also confirms an evaporation enrichment produced seasonal isotope signal 2 1 2 spatial and vertical variations of the lake water isotopes we used the measured lake surface water δ18o and d excess in april 2019 and made graphs showing the spatial change of surface lake water isotopes using the universal kriging interpolation fig 4 the overall spatial change of surface lake surface water δ18o varies from 3 0 to 2 4 the lower water δ18o values near shoreline are owing to the river water input with significantly lower δ18o surface lake water from inside of the lake are slightly enriched in δ18o due to subsequent evaporation enrichment relative higher δ18o values in the lake water are located in area away from direct river input surface lake water d excess shows opposite spatial pattern fig 4b direct measurement of the seasonal changes of vertical lake water temperature demonstrated that the maximum depth of the thermocline could be at over 40 m in november while only little vertical temperature change during the winter season from december to next april fu 2015 despite temperature the vertical change of dissolved ch4 also shows stratification in summer while uniform in the overturning period li et al 2020 to evaluate the effect of lake water isotope stratification we also measured the vertical profile of lake water isotopes at two sites vertical lake water δ18o varies in the range of 2 6 to 2 5 fig 5 at sampling site 1 d excess decreases from the maximum of 8 8 in surface to minimum of 9 5 at 100 m depth then rises to 9 1 at 150 m depth near bottom another vertical lake water d excess is also within this range within the large vertical sampling interval the magnitudes of vertical water isotopes variations are close to analyzing uncertainty therefore we conclude that both δ18o and d excess are consistent vertically the little variations of δ18o and d excess indicate that fuxian lake water is not stratified isotopically and roughly uniform the homogenous vertical lake water isotopes are also found in other lakes e g cona lake yamdruk tso and nam co in tibetan plateau cui et al 2017 gao et al 2017 kang et al 2017 shi et al 2017 conforming the vertical mixing of different layer of water even for very deep lake water 2 2 river water isotope the input water to the lake is composed of lake surface precipitation and lateral river flow owning to the fact that the catchment area is relatively small and the length of rivers are short and therefore the influence of surface evaporation on river water isotope is insignificant we here use the river water isotope as a proxy of input water isotopes dongda river 20 km in length and liangwang river 21 2 km in length are the two large rivers flowing into the north coast of fuxian lake weekly river samples were collected for liangwang river and river water δ18o and d excess are shown in fig 6 the isotopic composition of the liangwang river water samples ranges from 12 5 to 10 1 for δ18o 11 37 in average and from 4 1 to 10 0 for d excess 8 0 in average river water δ18o shows an increasing trend from raining season to dry season consistent with the seasonal precipitation isotopes in indian monsoon reason the temporal variation of liangwang river water d excess shows an opposite trend to δ18o changes likely a signal of enhancing evaporation enrichment of land surface water river water during the dry season in spring and early summer 2 3 fuxian lake water isotope equilibrium simulation both stream flow to the lake and precipitation over the lake surface are the income of the lake water storage while lake water loss storage by surface evaporation and outflow the input water isotopes influence the isotope balance in the lake therefore we first evaluate the initial input water isotopes for the lake water isotope modeling for fuxian lake we assume the observed river water isotope as the input to lake as δi for lake input is 11 4 for δ18o 82 9 for δ2h and 8 0 for d excess average of the liangwang river water isotopes here we use the measured atmosphere vapor isotope δa of 15 6 for δ18o 110 0 for δ2h and 14 5 for d excess average of the continuous measured water vapor to constrain the simulated lake water isotopes the measured lake surface water temperature is about 17 5 c and local relative humidity is about 60 on average from august 2018 to august 2019 with the input water isotopes and climate condition we retrieved an evaporation to inflow e i ratio of 0 45 to simulate to the observed lake water isotope in fuxian lake see later discussion the initial parameters for the isotope modeling are summarized in table 2 fig 7 is a simulated evolution of fuxian lake water isotopes by using the isotope modeling descripted above the model results show that theoretically with lake water evaporation inflow to the lake and outflow from the lake the δ18o of the residual lake water will rise and d excess will decrease due to the isotopic fractionation in the evaporation process and will eventually reach a constant value with an assumed lake surface water temperature of 17 5 c e i ratio of 0 45 an initial δi for lake input and a mean relative humidity of 60 the model produced a lake water isotope of 2 6 for δ18o 30 0 for δ2h and 9 1 for d excess these isotope values are very close to the observed lake water isotope of 2 6 for δ18o 29 7 for δ2h and 9 0 for d excess at present table 3 indicating the isotope model sufficiently captured the observation for such a deep plateau lake δ18o δ2h relation can reflect the evaporation processes in surface water therefore we also made graph showing the δ18o δ2h relation of river water and lake water fig 8 the observed lake water falls almost in one line with regression of δ2h 5 92δ18o 14 34 n 89 r2 0 96 lel local evaporation line the simulated lake water evolution as presented in result from fig 7 is almost overlapped with the observed lel indicating this isotope enrichment model well capture the isotope balance of lake water as in a steady state the lel is well below the global meteoric water line gmwl due to the evaporation effect and they meet at δ18o 11 7 δ2h 83 6 very close to the observed average river water of δ18o 11 4 δ2h 82 9 probably reveal the average isotope composition of source water gibson et al 2005 yi et al 2008 the δ18o values of input water 11 4 is very close to reported kunming precipitation isotope 11 25 in literature li et al 2017 indicating the river water and local precipitation have the similar isotope signals the slope of fuxian lake lel 5 92 is close to that of 5 83 of the lashi lake in the earlier studies shi et al 2017 indicating regional consistence in lake water evaporation enrichment 3 discussion 3 1 constraints of atmospheric vapor isotopes observation on lake water isotopes balance water stable isotopes were used to study lake balance by assuming the equilibrium fractionation between atmospheric vapor isotope and precipitation isotope in practice gat 1978 gibson 2002 zuber 1983 in this study we used the observed vapor isotope near the lake instead of estimation from precipitation isotope to simulate the dual isotopes in lake water using craig and gordon model consistent water isotope balance derived from δ18o δ2h and d excess separately implied that the isotopic model is robust in the estimation of lake water balance table 3 traditionally atmospheric vapor δa can be derived from the isotopic composition of local precipitation δp as 9 δ a δ p ε 1 10 3 ε additionally the assumption of isotopic equilibrium between atmospheric vapor and precipitation may be not justified in some regions gibson et al 2016 mayr et al 2007 recently a correction factor x was introduced to correct the isotopic non equilibrium between precipitation and atmospheric vapor gibson and reid 2014 skrzypek et al 2015 10 δ a δ p x ε 1 10 3 x ε as for the case in fuxian lake we calculated the assumed vapor isotope by the above equation and got a result of vapor isotope of 17 3 for δ18o 128 6 for δ2h these estimated vapor isotope values are significantly underestimated as compared with the measured vapor isotope of 15 6 for δ18o 110 0 for δ2h owning largely to the seasonal precipitation pattern and the representative of the annual precipitation isotope the consistence in the comparison of simulation and observation and the bias in the assumed vapor isotopes here highlight the importance of measured atmospheric vapor isotopes in constraining the isotopic lake water balance 3 2 model sensitivity test the agreement in the simulation and observation in fuxian lake discussed above allows us to give a sensitivity test for different parameters which have significant impact on the simulated lake water isotope and to evaluate their different behavior in controlling the lake water isotope in the following test for fuxian lake water isotope balance we still assume lake input δi is 11 37 for δ18o 8 0 for d excess average of the liangwang river and ambient vapor δa is 15 6 for δ18o 14 5 for d excess average of the continuous measured water vapor then we run the tests by using the lake water isotope balance model with a steady state assumption under different hydrometeorological initialization we first tested the fuxian lake water isotope with different evaporation temperature different relative humidity and different e i ratios in each test we assume only one of the three parameters varies in the reasonable range while others are constant t 17 5 c rh 0 60 or e i 0 45 the simulated lake water isotope evolutions for selected assumed values of each parameter is presented in fig 9 the modeled results show that lower lake water temperature lower relative humidity and strong evaporation will lead to a higher δ18o value in lake water fig 9 a c and e the d excess value is more negative under higher lake water temperature lower relative humidity and a strong evaporation fig 9 b d and f the simulated results in fig 9 also reveal a hydrodynamic response to the climate change and thus allows for a discussion on the perspective of paleoclimate rebuilding from isotope archives the requited time to reach a constant lake water isotope in the modeling changes with different climate parameters in particular higher relative humidity requires a shorter time to reach a new lake water isotope balance fig 9c and d for example with relative humidity of 60 fuxian lake water isotope can reach a new steady state after 680 years while it will need 420 years to reach a new isotope balance for a humidity of 80 lake water isotopes are less sensitive to reasonable temperature and e i ratio changes also we run the model with consecutive changes for individual parameter while keeps others parameters constant to evaluate the response of lake water isotopes to these changes in this test we simulated the lake water isotope reaching to a steady state with changing temperature relative humidity or e i ratio and the results are presented in fig 10 results also show that the temperature of surface lake water is not a dominant factor in influencing the lake water isotopes changes fig 10a but both the meteorological relative humidity and hydrological e i ratio variations have significant potential influences on lake water isotope changes fig 10b and 10c with consecutive changes for relative humidity range from 20 to 80 the steady lake water δ18o will change from 1 2 to 3 8 and d excess from 25 8 to 4 0 fig 10b the steady lake will change from 11 4 to 1 6 for δ18o and from 8 3 to 19 6 for d excess when the e i ratio consecutively increases from 0 to 1 fig 10 c 3 3 sensitive test of combined influence of relative humidity and e i ratio and on lake water isotopes the isotopic composition of lake waters is sensitive to long term changes in the evaporation inflow e i ratio and normalized atmospheric relative humidity rh gibson et al 2016 our sensitivity test also confirmed that the simulated fuxian lake water isotopes are mostly related to rh change and e i ratio change higher relative humidity will produce lower lake water δ18o while higher e i ratio will produce higher lake water δ18o therefore theoretically varies combination of rh and e i ratio can produce the same lake water δ18o to separate the combined hydrometeorological impact on lake water isotope we made the test for a combined changing rh and e i ratio to rebuild the observed lake water isotopes the test results for both δ18o and d excess are shown in fig 11 the results in fig 11 demonstrate that if only δ18o was used in the test there are infinite solution combined rh and e i ratio to produce the observed lake water δ18o however if we use the dual water isotopes to reproduce both the observed lake water δ18o and d excess only when rh 0 6 and e i 0 45 are satisfied where the two curves meets in fig 11 can the test result match the observed lake water δ18o and d excess this result indicates that the dual water isotopes can unequivocally define the climatic and hydrological controls on lake water isotopes our results here indicate the hydrometeorological control on the lake water isotopes and therefore the lake deposition isotope record as well with increasing measures on water source management in the yungui plateau such as inter basin water diversion dam on the upper stream overuse of water resources hydrological regime might be changed and subsequently the lake water isotope balance 4 limitations the lake water isotopes are resulted from long term isotope balance in input water and output water here we used one year observed data of water isotopes in lake water river water water vapor and made an attempt to constrain the lake water isotope balance without evaluating the influence of interannual variations of water isotope indeed precipitation isotopes and therefore river water isotopes are influenced by large regional atmospheric cycle e g enso cycle which was not considered in the paper both river water and lake water isotopes showed a seasonal signal in river water the relatively low d excess in dry season indicated a sign of surface evaporation the input water to the lake are mainly from the raining season from may to october with a slightly lower water δ18o lake water also shows slight seasonality due to seasonal river water input and seasonal lake surface evaporation however in this study we simply used the annual average data without considering the seasonal variations adding further uncertainty in the model estimation additionally hydrogeological model on lake water balance may add further evidence on the chemical budget as salt yihdego and webb 2015 fuxian lake surface accounts for approximately one third of the basin area therefore the lake surface precipitation is also an important input for the lake water budget however in this study we simply used the river water isotopes as the input water isotope and assumed the river water and local have the same isotopes to validate this assumption we interpolate the source water isotope in the basin by the interception of the local evaporation line with the gmwl in fig 8 the estimated source water isotopes δ18o 11 7 δ2h 83 6 are very close to the observed average river water of δ18o 11 4 δ2h 82 9 indicating the assumption used here are reasonable probably due to the short river channels and short residence time of river water 5 conclusion remarks we presented a dual water isotopes study in fuxian lake in yungui plateau southwest china the average lake water isotopes 2 6 for δ18o and 29 7 for δ2h are significantly higher than the input river water 11 4 for δ18o and 82 9 for δ2h indicating a significant evaporation enrichment in heavy isotopes in lake water we simulated the dual isotopes in the lake water constrained by the observed atmospheric vapor isotopes using craig and gordon model with the assumption of a steady stage of lake water owning to the huge lake water storage results show a consistent simulation results with observation both in δ18o and d excess sensitive tests show that this lake water isotopes are sensitive to relative humidity and e i ratio change while less sensitive to the water temperature variations we also made the sensitivity test for both relative humidity and outflow inflow ratio and found both simulated lake water δ18o and d excess are strongly depended on the array of relative humidity and e i ratio with the observed lake water isotope data and therefore the isotope model has the ability to identify unequivocally the specific influence of climate control and hydrological control on lake water isotope balance our results in the test analysis addressed how the climate and hydrological change influence the lake water isotope component and therefore provide the potential for understanding the isotope record as preserved in the lake sediment the work from this lake also highlights the possibility to understand the hydrological process in other lakes in that region as well credit authorship contribution statement yike li methodology investigation writing original draft lide tian conceptualization supervision writing review editing

4952,stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h serve as a practical tool in the understanding of regional hydrological cycle in particular where the regional water cycle is stressed by both climate change and human activities lake water in southwest china is believed to play an important role in the local hydrology and possible modification of local climate water isotopes in lake systems are influenced by both the input water isotope and surface evaporation such that they can be used as a natural tracer to evaluate these effects here we present a detailed water isotope balance study in a plateau lake fuxian lake the deepest and largest water body in yungui plateau southwest china with analogues of a steady state of water isotope equilibrium the lake water isotopes are significantly enriched in heavy isotope due to evapoconcentration during the long residence time we simulated the dual isotopes in the lake water using the craig and gordon model constrained by the observed water isotopes in lake water river water and atmospheric vapor results show consistent results for both δ18o and d excess with values of 2 6 and 9 0 at the present relative humidity and e i ratio the test simulations also demonstrate how potential change in climate and or lake water e i ratio could impact lake water isotopes and how the dual water isotope approach can unequivocally define the climatic and hydrological controls on lake water isotopes these findings may be relevant for anticipating and detecting hydrological response to future climate change and water source management e g inter basin diversion projects the results from this study highlight the potential of water isotopes in regional water cycle work paleo climate reconstruction from lacustrine record as well as human activity on water management keywords dual water isotopes lake water balance evaporation enrichment fuxian lake yungui plateau 1 introduction stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h are widely used in the understanding of regional to global hydrological cycle bowen et al 2019 pioneering work on the isotopic effects of water evaporation under different climate conditions craig and gordon 1965 gat 1995 jouzel and koster 1996 merlivat and jouzel 1979 tian et al 2008 paved the way for water isotopes application in the terrestrial water cycle in particular for open water systems lakes serve as important surface water source affecting seasonal water availability and moderating local climate yet climate change and human activities e g controlling of outflow inter basin water diversion project both can alter lake water balance water isotope methods provide an alternative approach to understand these effects where systematic monitoring data are limited or unavailable surface water become enriched in heavy isotopes during evaporation craig and gordon 1965 gibson et al 2016 and consequently this enrichment in heavy isotope can be served as a sign of the intensity of water evaporation used in the hydrodynamic study gibson et al 2002 established how the isotope based approach can be used to study the role of lakes in regional water balance in particular to estimate the residence time and throughflow index evaporation inflow of lake water since then stable isotope mass balance imb modeling had been applied to different types of lake systems with varying meteorological and hydrological assumptions e g anderson et al 2013 biggs et al 2015 brock et al 2009 brooks et al 2014 gibson et al 2016 kebede et al 2009 wen et al 2018 yi et al 2008 quite a few studies have used oxygen isotopes to simulate the lake water balance however information from dual water isotope systems δ18o and δ2h can better constrain the precision of the estimated e i ratio for example a multiple isotope tracer method was used to estimate the isotopic composition of input water to lakes in the boreal region of western canada yi et al 2008 isotopic enrichment during water evaporation results in a distinctive δ18o δ2h relationship in lake water adding the opportunity to estimate the input water isotope signature and different water sources if the local meteoric water line in local precipitation is known bowen et al 2018 yi et al 2008 deuterium excess d excess defined as d δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 was proved as an efficient signal for detecting atmospheric water recycling vallet coulomb et al 2008 and was used to estimate the e i ratio of a flow through lakes in the middle of the tibetan plateau and the results are much constrained cui et al 2017 one difficulty in estimation of lake water balance is the atmospheric vapor isotope ratio which affect the kinetic isotope fractionation in the diffusive vapor exchange within the boundary layer brooks et al 2014 atmosphere vapor isotopes are usually unavailable from measurement and were assumed to be in equilibrium with precipitation isotope gibson et al 2002 which proved untrue for regions with strong seasonal precipitation in monsoon region tian et al 2020 yungui plateau located in the southwest china is the eastwards expansion of the tibetan plateau in topography the region is fed by precipitation from indian monsoon in summer season and is also sources of quite a few large rivers the widely distributed lakes over the plateau play a critical role in hydroclimate by supplying moisture to the atmosphere and adjust the seasonal water supply specifically for the dry non monsoon season du et al 2018 xu et al 2018 however with the stress of climate warming and enhancing human activity the regional terrestrial water cycle would be affected and potentially threat eco security here we present a research work on the lake water balance using dual water isotopes in fuxian lake on yungui plateau southwest china we constrained the estimation of e i ratio by continuously monitoring the atmospheric vapor isotopes another specific of the research work is that this lake is the deepest lake in that region with the largest water storage and thus could be more of analogues of steady state of lake water few studies had addressed the isotope water cycle within the plateau lakes for fuxian lake only lake hydrodynamics and sediment accumulation trend were discussed in earlier literature wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2012 in this paper we presented dual water isotopes on different water sources in fuxian lake catchment we simulated the lake water isotope balance for both δ18o and d excess with input water isotope and climate constrains the overall goal of this manuscript is to improve our understanding of the controls on plateau lake water cycle and potentially shed light on the interpretation of lake sediment isotope record in such plateau lake 1 1 site description and data acquirement fuxian lake is located in the central part of yungui plateau in southwest china 102 49 102 57 e and 24 21 24 38 n and has a catchment area of 674 69 km2 fig 1 as the largest deep

types of lake water samples were collected in fuxian lake basin fig 1 monthly in situ lake water samples were collected at 13 locations surrounding the lake from august 2018 to july 2019 lake water samples were collected slight away from the shoreline to avoid possible influence of shallow water evaporation inside lake surface water was sampled on a boat on 10 april 2019 and 30 samples were collected vertical lake water samples were collected at two sites in the lake and 17 samples were collected in this day all collected lake water samples were sealed in 15 ml plastic vials weekly river water was sampled at liangwang river the largest river in the north bank during the period from august 2018 to june 2019 and totally 42 river water samples were collected some discrete groundwater samples were also collected at the north bank as well daily precipitation samples were collected at fuxian lake plateau deep lake research station 102 91 e 24 63 n at the chinese academy of sciences on the north bank of fuxian lake using an evaporation proof collecting device rainfall samples were collected manually at 20 00 pm on every rainy day daily atmospheric vapor samples were collected at fuxian lake plateau deep lake research station we used a geocrygenic approach for atmospheric vapor sample previously used over ocean surface in polar region and over the tibetan plateau steen larsen et al 2011 tian et al 2020 uemura et al 2008 yu et al 2015 the machine is set to 85 c in the cold trap to collect daily atmospheric vapor sample all water samples were frozen in storage and were analyzed for both δ18o and δ2h using a picarro l2140 i liquid water isotope analyzer with a precision better than 0 10 δ18o and 0 4 δ2h in the institute of international river and eco security yunnan university the value of the isotopic ratio is expressed in per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow2 1 3 meteorological data meteorological data precipitation amount relative humidity air temperature wind speed and direction are available from an automatic weather station installed at fuxian lake plateau deep lake research station surface lake water temperature was recorded at 10 min intervals by a water temperature data loggers near the north bank water temperature together with meteorological data precipitation and relative humidity observed at the fuxian lake station were used as input data for the isotopic model 1 4 model description of isotopic recycling in a steady state lake lake water isotopes represent a balance between inflow water isotopes and outflow water isotopes via evaporation and liquid outflow this variation can be simulated by using a water mass and isotope mass balance model expressed respectively as follows gibson et al 2002

δi δq and δe are the isotopic compositions of lake total inflow total outflow and evaporation flux respectively the isotopic composition of the flux from an evaporating water body is governed by the isotopic transfer rates during molecular diffusion and eddy diffusion turbulent transport and the evaporation flux δe is typically depleted in heavy isotopes relative to lake water δl a linear

be 14 2 for oxygen and 12 5 for hydrogen gonfiantini 1986 horita et al 2008 merlivat and jouzel 1979 under stable climatic and hydrologic conditions the lake water can be considered as close to hydrologic steady state in which input water is balanced by a combination of evaporation and outflow dv dt 0 fuxian lake has large water storage and relatively small surface area therefore this lake can be considered more of a steady state lake for the relatively less change of lake water volume we assume the lake water is thoroughly mixed throughout time in this model we also assume an initial lake isotope composition δ0 equals to the input water isotope composition δi in the first step we introduce a through flow index x representing the fraction of water input lost by evaporation gibson et al 2002 a minor portion of lake water δv lost from the water surface comprised of both xδv evaporating isotope composition of δe and 1 x δv discharging by liquid outflows isotope composition of δl the residual lake water will be slightly enriched in heavy isotopes to a value of δl1 6 δ l 1 v δ o x δ v δ e 1 x δ v δ l v δ v then we assume a small portion of input water δv with δi and that the lake water will maintain the same volume but that lake water isotopes composition will change to a value of δl2 7 δ l 2 v δ v δ l 1 δ v δ i v each step will take a time τδv v where τ is the residence time of water in a steady state lake which is approximately 167 years for fuxian lake given as 8 τ v i with the subsequent repeated steps of lake water evaporation outflow and input water replenishment the model can simulate the progressive enrichment in the heavy isotopes of lake water with time the lake water isotope composition will attain a constant value of δs 2 results 2 1 fuxian lake water isotope 2 1 1 temporal variation of surface lake water δ18o and d excess lake water was sampled periodically during the period of august 2018 july 2019 the averages of these measurements indicate the seasonal change of lake water isotopes table 1 and fig 3 the temporal variations of lake water isotopes are shown in fig 3 the range of surface lake water δ18o during these surveys is small varying from 2 4 to 2 9 a seasonal signal in association with the seasonal precipitation isotope and evaporation condition the slightly higher δ18o values in spring indicate an influence of enhanced evaporation enrichment in the dry season the increasing river runoff with lower δ18o decrease the lake water isotopes in raining season d excess of surface lake water in fuxian lake ranges from 9 5 to 7 7 with a mean value of 9 0 significantly lower than that in inlet river of around 8 both large differences of water δ18o and d excess between lake water and input river water indicate a strong evaporation enrichment of heavy isotope during the long term lake water cycle the inverse change of lake water δ18o and d excess fig 3 also confirms an evaporation enrichment produced seasonal isotope signal 2 1 2 spatial and vertical variations of the lake water isotopes we used the measured lake surface water δ18o and d excess in april 2019 and made graphs showing the spatial change of surface lake water isotopes using the universal kriging interpolation fig 4 the overall spatial change of surface lake surface water δ18o varies from 3 0 to 2 4 the lower water δ18o values near shoreline are owing to the river water input with significantly lower δ18o surface lake water from inside of the lake are slightly enriched in δ18o due to subsequent evaporation enrichment relative higher δ18o values in the lake water are located in area away from direct river input surface lake water d excess shows opposite spatial pattern fig 4b direct measurement of the seasonal changes of vertical lake water temperature demonstrated that the maximum depth of the thermocline could be at over 40 m in november while only little vertical temperature change during the winter season from december to next april fu 2015 despite temperature the vertical change of dissolved ch4 also shows stratification in summer while uniform in the overturning period li et al 2020 to evaluate the effect of lake water isotope stratification we also measured the vertical profile of lake water isotopes at two sites vertical lake water δ18o varies in the range of 2 6 to 2 5 fig 5 at sampling site 1 d excess decreases from the maximum of 8 8 in surface to minimum of 9 5 at 100 m depth then rises to 9 1 at 150 m depth near bottom another vertical lake water d excess is also within this range within the large vertical sampling interval the magnitudes of vertical water isotopes variations are close to analyzing uncertainty therefore we conclude that both δ18o and d excess are consistent vertically the little variations of δ18o and d excess indicate that fuxian lake water is not stratified isotopically and roughly uniform the homogenous vertical lake water isotopes are also found in other lakes e g cona lake yamdruk tso and nam co in tibetan plateau cui et al 2017 gao et al 2017 kang et al 2017 shi et al 2017 conforming the vertical mixing of different layer of water even for very deep lake water 2 2 river water isotope the input water to the lake is composed of lake surface precipitation and lateral river flow owning to the fact that the catchment area is relatively small and the length of rivers are short and therefore the influence of surface evaporation on river water isotope is insignificant we here use the river water isotope as a proxy of input water isotopes dongda river 20 km in length and liangwang river 21 2 km in length are the two large rivers flowing into the north coast of fuxian lake weekly river samples were collected for liangwang river and river water δ18o and d excess are shown in fig 6 the isotopic composition of the liangwang river water samples ranges from 12 5 to 10 1 for δ18o 11 37 in average and from 4 1 to 10 0 for d excess 8 0 in average river water δ18o shows an increasing trend from raining season to dry season consistent with the seasonal precipitation isotopes in indian monsoon reason the temporal variation of liangwang river water d excess shows an opposite trend to δ18o changes likely a signal of enhancing evaporation enrichment of land surface water river water during the dry season in spring and early summer 2 3 fuxian lake water isotope equilibrium simulation both stream flow to the lake and precipitation over the lake surface are the income of the lake water storage while lake water loss storage by surface evaporation and outflow the input water isotopes influence the isotope balance in the lake therefore we first evaluate the initial input water isotopes for the lake water isotope modeling for fuxian lake we assume the observed river water isotope as the input to lake as δi for lake input is 11 4 for δ18o 82 9 for δ2h and 8 0 for d excess average of the liangwang river water isotopes here we use the measured atmosphere vapor isotope δa of 15 6 for δ18o 110 0 for δ2h and 14 5 for d excess average of the continuous measured water vapor to constrain the simulated lake water isotopes the measured lake surface water temperature is about 17 5 c and local relative humidity is about 60 on average from august 2018 to august 2019 with the input water isotopes and climate condition we retrieved an evaporation to inflow e i ratio of 0 45 to simulate to the observed lake water isotope in fuxian lake see later discussion the initial parameters for the isotope modeling are summarized in table 2 fig 7 is a simulated evolution of fuxian lake water isotopes by using the isotope modeling descripted above the model results show that theoretically with lake water evaporation inflow to the lake and outflow from the lake the δ18o of the residual lake water will rise and d excess will decrease due to the isotopic fractionation in the evaporation process and will eventually reach a constant value with an assumed lake surface water temperature of 17 5 c e i ratio of 0 45 an initial δi for lake input and a mean relative humidity of 60 the model produced a lake water isotope of 2 6 for δ18o 30 0 for δ2h and 9 1 for d excess these isotope values are very close to the observed lake water isotope of 2 6 for δ18o 29 7 for δ2h and 9 0 for d excess at present table 3 indicating the isotope model sufficiently captured the observation for such a deep plateau lake δ18o δ2h relation can reflect the evaporation processes in surface water therefore we also made graph showing the δ18o δ2h relation of river water and lake water fig 8 the observed lake water falls almost in one line with regression of δ2h 5 92δ18o 14 34 n 89 r2 0 96 lel local evaporation line the simulated lake water evolution as presented in result from fig 7 is almost overlapped with the observed lel indicating this isotope enrichment model well capture the isotope balance of lake water as in a steady state the lel is well below the global meteoric water line gmwl due to the evaporation effect and they meet at δ18o 11 7 δ2h 83 6 very close to the observed average river water of δ18o 11 4 δ2h 82 9 probably reveal the average isotope composition of source water gibson et al 2005 yi et al 2008 the δ18o values of input water 11 4 is very close to reported kunming precipitation isotope 11 25 in literature li et al 2017 indicating the river water and local precipitation have the similar isotope signals the slope of fuxian lake lel 5 92 is close to that of 5 83 of the lashi lake in the earlier studies shi et al 2017 indicating regional consistence in lake water evaporation enrichment 3 discussion 3 1 constraints of atmospheric vapor isotopes observation on lake water isotopes balance water stable isotopes were used to study lake balance by assuming the equilibrium fractionation between atmospheric vapor isotope and precipitation isotope in practice gat 1978 gibson 2002 zuber 1983 in this study we used the observed vapor isotope near the lake instead of estimation from precipitation isotope to simulate the dual isotopes in lake water using craig and gordon model consistent water isotope balance derived from δ18o δ2h and d excess separately implied that the isotopic model is robust in the estimation of lake water balance table 3 traditionally atmospheric vapor δa can be derived from the isotopic composition of local precipitation δp as 9 δ a δ p ε 1 10 3 ε additionally the assumption of isotopic equilibrium between atmospheric vapor and precipitation may be not justified in some regions gibson et al 2016 mayr et al 2007 recently a correction factor x was introduced to correct the isotopic non equilibrium between precipitation and atmospheric vapor gibson and reid 2014 skrzypek et al 2015 10 δ a δ p x ε 1 10 3 x ε as for the case in fuxian lake we calculated the assumed vapor isotope by the above equation and got a result of vapor isotope of 17 3 for δ18o 128 6 for δ2h these estimated vapor isotope values are significantly underestimated as compared with the measured vapor isotope of 15 6 for δ18o 110 0 for δ2h owning largely to the seasonal precipitation pattern and the representative of the annual precipitation isotope the consistence in the comparison of simulation and observation and the bias in the assumed vapor isotopes here highlight the importance of measured atmospheric vapor isotopes in constraining the isotopic lake water balance 3 2 model sensitivity test the agreement in the simulation and observation in fuxian lake discussed above allows us to give a sensitivity test for different parameters which have significant impact on the simulated lake water isotope and to evaluate their different behavior in controlling the lake water isotope in the following test for fuxian lake water isotope balance we still assume lake input δi is 11 37 for δ18o 8 0 for d excess average of the liangwang river and ambient vapor δa is 15 6 for δ18o 14 5 for d excess average of the continuous measured water vapor then we run the tests by using the lake water isotope balance model with a steady state assumption under different hydrometeorological initialization we first tested the fuxian lake water isotope with different evaporation temperature different relative humidity and different e i ratios in each test we assume only one of the three parameters varies in the reasonable range while others are constant t 17 5 c rh 0 60 or e i 0 45 the simulated lake water isotope evolutions for selected assumed values of each parameter is presented in fig 9 the modeled results show that lower lake water temperature lower relative humidity and strong evaporation will lead to a higher δ18o value in lake water fig 9 a c and e the d excess value is more negative under higher lake water temperature lower relative humidity and a strong evaporation fig 9 b d and f the simulated results in fig 9 also reveal a hydrodynamic response to the climate change and thus allows for a discussion on the perspective of paleoclimate rebuilding from isotope archives the requited time to reach a constant lake water isotope in the modeling changes with different climate parameters in particular higher relative humidity requires a shorter time to reach a new lake water isotope balance fig 9c and d for example with relative humidity of 60 fuxian lake water isotope can reach a new steady state after 680 years while it will need 420 years to reach a new isotope balance for a humidity of 80 lake water isotopes are less sensitive to reasonable temperature and e i ratio changes also we run the model with consecutive changes for individual parameter while keeps others parameters constant to evaluate the response of lake water isotopes to these changes in this test we simulated the lake water isotope reaching to a steady state with changing temperature relative humidity or e i ratio and the results are presented in fig 10 results also show that the temperature of surface lake water is not a dominant factor in influencing the lake water isotopes changes fig 10a but both the meteorological relative humidity and hydrological e i ratio variations have significant potential influences on lake water isotope changes fig 10b and 10c with consecutive changes for relative humidity range from 20 to 80 the steady lake water δ18o will change from 1 2 to 3 8 and d excess from 25 8 to 4 0 fig 10b the steady lake will change from 11 4 to 1 6 for δ18o and from 8 3 to 19 6 for d excess when the e i ratio consecutively increases from 0 to 1 fig 10 c 3 3 sensitive test of combined influence of relative humidity and e i ratio and on lake water isotopes the isotopic composition of lake waters is sensitive to long term changes in the evaporation inflow e i ratio and normalized atmospheric relative humidity rh gibson et al 2016 our sensitivity test also confirmed that the simulated fuxian lake water isotopes are mostly related to rh change and e i ratio change higher relative humidity will produce lower lake water δ18o while higher e i ratio will produce higher lake water δ18o therefore theoretically varies combination of rh and e i ratio can produce the same lake water δ18o to separate the combined hydrometeorological impact on lake water isotope we made the test for a combined changing rh and e i ratio to rebuild the observed lake water isotopes the test results for both δ18o and d excess are shown in fig 11 the results in fig 11 demonstrate that if only δ18o was used in the test there are infinite solution combined rh and e i ratio to produce the observed lake water δ18o however if we use the dual water isotopes to reproduce both the observed lake water δ18o and d excess only when rh 0 6 and e i 0 45 are satisfied where the two curves meets in fig 11 can the test result match the observed lake water δ18o and d excess this result indicates that the dual water isotopes can unequivocally define the climatic and hydrological controls on lake water isotopes our results here indicate the hydrometeorological control on the lake water isotopes and therefore the lake deposition isotope record as well with increasing measures on water source management in the yungui plateau such as inter basin water diversion dam on the upper stream overuse of water resources hydrological regime might be changed and subsequently the lake water isotope balance 4 limitations the lake water isotopes are resulted from long term isotope balance in input water and output water here we used one year observed data of water isotopes in lake water river water water vapor and made an attempt to constrain the lake water isotope balance without evaluating the influence of interannual variations of water isotope indeed precipitation isotopes and therefore river water isotopes are influenced by large regional atmospheric cycle e g enso cycle which was not considered in the paper both river water and lake water isotopes showed a seasonal signal in river water the relatively low d excess in dry season indicated a sign of surface evaporation the input water to the lake are mainly from the raining season from may to october with a slightly lower water δ18o lake water also shows slight seasonality due to seasonal river water input and seasonal lake surface evaporation however in this study we simply used the annual average data without considering the seasonal variations adding further uncertainty in the model estimation additionally hydrogeological model on lake water balance may add further evidence on the chemical budget as salt yihdego and webb 2015 fuxian lake surface accounts for approximately one third of the basin area therefore the lake surface precipitation is also an important input for the lake water budget however in this study we simply used the river water isotopes as the input water isotope and assumed the river water and local have the same isotopes to validate this assumption we interpolate the source water isotope in the basin by the interception of the local evaporation line with the gmwl in fig 8 the estimated source water isotopes δ18o 11 7 δ2h 83 6 are very close to the observed average river water of δ18o 11 4 δ2h 82 9 indicating the assumption used here are reasonable probably due to the short river channels and short residence time of river water 5 conclusion remarks we presented a dual water isotopes study in fuxian lake in yungui plateau southwest china the average lake water isotopes 2 6 for δ18o and 29 7 for δ2h are significantly higher than the input river water 11 4 for δ18o and 82 9 for δ2h indicating a significant evaporation enrichment in heavy isotopes in lake water we simulated the dual isotopes in the lake water constrained by the observed atmospheric vapor isotopes using craig and gordon model with the assumption of a steady stage of lake water owning to the huge lake water storage results show a consistent simulation results with observation both in δ18o and d excess sensitive tests show that this lake water isotopes are sensitive to relative humidity and e i ratio change while less sensitive to the water temperature variations we also made the sensitivity test for both relative humidity and outflow inflow ratio and found both simulated lake water δ18o and d excess are strongly depended on the array of relative humidity and e i ratio with the observed lake water isotope data and therefore the isotope model has the ability to identify unequivocally the specific influence of climate control and hydrological control on lake water isotope balance our results in the test analysis addressed how the climate and hydrological change influence the lake water isotope component and therefore provide the potential for understanding the isotope record as preserved in the lake sediment the work from this lake also highlights the possibility to understand the hydrological process in other lakes in that region as well credit authorship contribution statement yike li methodology investigation writing original draft lide tian conceptualization supervision writing review editing

4953,energy extraction from subsurface reservoirs is important for addressing the increasing energy demand and environmental concerns such as global warming however the characterization of subsurface reservoirs particularly reservoirs dominated by fracture networks remains a challenge due to the lack of means to directly observe subsurface processes this study explores the feasibility and efficacy of characterizing fracture flow and transport processes in an enhanced geothermal system egs testbed through stochastic tracer modeling there are two enabling factors that allow application of stochastic modeling to characterize a subsurface reservoir first an abundance of geological and geophysical measurements enables the development of a high fidelity and well constrained fracture network model second high performance computing hpc allows running massive realizations efficiently six conservative tracer tests were stochastically modeled and produced satisfactory realizations that successfully reproduce field tracer recovery data from each tracer test the evolution of flow and transport processes in the fracture network was then analyzed from these satisfactory realizations the present study demonstrates that stochastic tracer modeling on a high fidelity fracture network model is feasible and can provide important insights regarding flow and transport characteristics in subsurface fractured reservoirs keywords fractured reservoirs characterization enhanced geothermal system tracer testing stochastic modeling 1 introduction subsurface reservoirs are widely exploited around the world for energy recovery and geological storage of industrial wastes including co2 the successful exploitation of a subsurface reservoir requires a comprehensive understanding of flow and transport characteristics in the reservoir particularly in the context of unconventional oil gas extraction middleton et al 2015 geothermal heat recovery brown et al 2012 fu et al 2016 mcclure and horne 2014 u s department of energy 2019 co2 storage fu et al 2017 sun and tong 2017 as well as radioactive and toxic industrial wastes containment cuss et al 2015 sudicky and frind 1984 sun and buscheck 2003 tang et al 1981 tsang et al 2015 quantitative characterization of flow and transport processes in subsurface reservoirs is commonly based on flow or pressure and tracer tests in conjunction with various geological and geophysical investigations such as core logging outcrop analysis and seismic and electrical imaging berkowitz 2002 goovaerts 1997 juliusson and horne 2013 karmakar et al 2016 neuman 2005 vandenbohede and lebbe 2003 the inference of spatially variable hydraulic and transport properties can be achieved by matching the measured flow and tracer data with results from either analytical or numerical models constrained by geophysical investigations bullivant and o sullivan 1989 cacas et al 1990b castagna and bellin 2009 hawkins et al 2017a 2017b 2018 radilla et al 2012 a major difficulty in flow and tracer data interpretation is that the available geological and geophysical data are generally insufficient to eliminate the many uncertainties pertaining to characterizing subsurface reservoirs especially the complex fracture networks which provide principal pathways for flow and transport processes in many subsurface reservoirs a common method to accommodate these uncertainties in subsurface analysis is stochastic modeling cacas et al 1990a geier et al 2019 moreno et al 1988 ptak et al 2004 tsang et al 1996 which aims to reproduce flow and tracer measurements from massive randomly generated realizations the efficacy of stochastic modeling is often undermined by two major challenges the first one is the difficulty in developing a high fidelity and well constrained model with appropriate reduction in model complexity based on geological and geophysical observations and measurements an over simplified stochastic model may not be able to capture the necessary complexity of the field while a complex stochastic model with a high dimensional parameter space is prone to overfitting the second challenge is that numerous realizations are required to sufficiently cover the parameter space of a stochastic model because each parameter pertaining to a subsurface reservoir can vary in a wide range most previous efforts either use analytical solutions or simplified numerical models to make stochastic modeling computationally tractable hawkins et al 2017b 2018 radilla et al 2012 or empirically estimate the values of some parameters to reduce the parameter space so that fewer realizations are required vogt et al 2012 for example to characterize fracture flow in the soultz sous forêts egs site vogt et al 2012 performed stochastic modeling of field tracer experiments with 10 000 realizations generated from a monte carlo approach each with a different 3d permeability distribution however none of these realizations could match the two measured tracer breakthrough curves btcs simultaneously indicating that some other complexities relevant to the tracer transport process such as dispersivity and porosity may not have been properly accommodated in the stochastic model vogt et al 2012 also suggested that a better fitting quality might have been possible if the realization number had been some orders of magnitude larger in the past several decades increasing subsurface activities and the demand for high fidelity predictions of subsurface processes have greatly accelerated the development of comprehensive geological geophysical monitoring techniques and high performance computing hpc capabilities which provide new opportunities to improve the methodology for subsurface reservoir characterization with these techniques and capabilities it is now possible to use the following strategy to address the aforementioned challenges first high quality geological and geophysical data are utilized to improve the understanding of subsurface fracture networks and thereby to rationally define the parameter space for stochastic modeling for certain data rich environments high fidelity models can be constrained by honoring available field observations and measurements in a holistic manner second hpc capabilities allow a massive number of realizations and enable a thorough sweeping of the parameter space of the developed high fidelity model following this strategy the present study explores using stochastic tracer modeling to characterize flow and transport processes in a subsurface fracture network in a data rich environment with hpc enhanced modeling power we use the ongoing egs collab project kneafsey et al 2019 2020 as an example to illustrate the development of a high fidelity fracture network model from comprehensive geological and geophysical data and use a stochastic approach with massive realizations to simulate the tracer transport process in the fracture network for this specific site a stochastic approach is appropriate and necessary for the following reasons 1 the developed high fidelity fracture network model has a high dimensional parameter space and uses randomly distributed fields spatial distribution of aperture which cannot be described using continuous function forms deterministic methods such as bayesian inversion may not be applicable 2 even in this data rich environment it is still likely that the viable solutions are not unique stochastic modeling allows multiple viable solutions to be retrieved and we can gain insights into the flow and transport characteristics from the commonalities among these solutions the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the egs collab experiment testbed including well configuration geological and geophysical investigations hydraulic stimulation activities and the tracer tests modeled by the current work in section 3 based on various geophysical measurements and observations we develop a fracture network model involving both natural and hydraulic fractures for subsequent stochastic modeling of the tracer tests we also present the numerical methods for flow and tracer simulation as well as the details of the stochastic framework sections 4 and 5 present modeling results and the corresponding interpretations regarding flow and transport characteristics in the fracture network model section 6 demonstrates the consistency between modeling results and additional field observations analyzes the evolution of flow and transport processes in the fracture network model and discusses the effect of tracer data quality and quantity on stochastic modeling 2 the egs collab project experiment 1 the egs collab project is an ongoing in situ experiment designed to investigate the stimulation of fractures in rock and the circulation of fluids in the stimulated fracture network at an intermediate scale tens of meters intermediate between lab and field scales for egs applications kneafsey et al 2019 white et al 2019 the project is planned to have three phases of experiments and the experiment 1 testbed is located in a predominately phyllite rock mass approximately 1478 m below ground surface on the western side of the west access drift on the 4850 level within the sanford underground research facility surf in south dakota usa in this section we briefly describe the components of this experiment that are relevant to the present study 2 1 well configuration eight wells were drilled from the drift wall into the testbed including an injection well a production well and six monitoring wells fig 1 a and b the injection well e1 i was drilled nominally in the direction of the minimum horizontal principal stress so as to generate hydraulic fractures largely perpendicular to the wellbore according to geomechanics principles hubbert and willis 1957 note that the local in situ stress orientation had been determined in an earlier experiment oldenburg et al 2017 and was verified by experiment 1 results kneafsey et al 2020 the production well e1 p was parallel to e1 i and approximately 10 m to the east of e1 i four monitoring wells e1 pdt e1 pdb e1 pst and e1 psb were drilled parallel to the expected hydraulic fracture plane and the other two monitoring wells e1 ot and e1 ob were largely orthogonal to the expected hydraulic fracture 2 2 geological and geophysical investigations the temperature conditions in the testbed was investigated through several temperature surveys in 2009 and 2017 as well as a numerical simulation dobson and salve 2009 white et al 2018 apart from of the native geothermal gradient the many decades of mining and research operations have created a largely radial temperature gradient around the west access drift into the testbed wellbore televiewer and acoustic logs were acquired and cores were retrieved throughout the eight wells approximately 467 m in total length to map the natural fracture network in the testbed multiple geophysical techniques including cross hole seismic survey continuous active source seismic monitoring cassm microseismic electrical resistivity tomography ert and distributed temperature sensing dts were used to characterize the experiment site and to monitor the evolution of the testbed particularly the evolution of the fluid conducting fracture sensors for these geophysical monitoring techniques were deployed in the six monitoring wells to obtain high resolution measurements continuously before during and after fracture stimulation to obtain high resolution measurements a sewer camera was deployed in e1 p during one of the stimulations to directly observe fluid flow into the production well and identify possible intersection s of hydraulic fracture s with e1 p 2 3 hydraulic stimulations and tracer tests multiple hydraulic stimulations have been performed at three depths in well e1 i 39 m 128 ft 43 m 142 ft and 50 m 164 ft in 2018 there was no indication of strong hydraulic interference between the fractures stimulated from these three depths this work focuses on the fracture system stimulated at the 50 m interval in e1 i a water circulation test was conducted between 24 october and 20 november 2018 by injecting into an interval between a set of straddle packers set at the 50 m depth of e1 i to characterize the stimulated fracture network the time histories of injection rate injection pressure and observed microseismic events are presented in a condensed form in fig 1 e in general an injection rate of 400 ml min was used for the majority of the test window with a few exceptions as shown in fig 1 e according to the aforementioned temperature surveys and simulations rock temperature at the 50 m interval in e1 i is approximately 30 c and the injection temperature during the water circulation test was mostly maintained at 30 c achieving a nearly isothermal condition note that the microseismic events observed between 26 and 31 october and between 2 and 6 november indicate that the stimulated fracture network may have changed during the circulation test it was observed in the field that the stimulation activities between 3 november and 8 november caused the break of grouting seal in e1 ot leading to a significant increase in the outflow rate at e1 ot during the water circulation test a series of tracer tests were conducted using different tracers including conservative tracer c dots and chlorine reactive tracer cesium lithium rhodamine b and fluorescein as well as dna tracer mattson et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2020 c dots is a nanoparticle tracer consisting of a carbon core decorated with a highly fluorescent polymer hawkins et al 2017b for each test tracers were first mixed with water and then injected into the fracture network through the 50 m depth interval serial water samples were collected for approximately 8 to 24 h from the production and monitoring wells the measurements and analysis of tracer concentrations in these water samples are detailed in mattson et al 2019a in our stochastic modeling we analyze the six c dots tracer tests as summarized in table 1 outflow rates at different wells during the six tracer tests are also shown in table 1 note that table 1 only includes the volumetric flow rates from e1 p e1 ot e1 pdt e1 pst and e1 pdb water also leaked into the mine drift from other locations including wells not monitored for flow rates and natural fractures intersecting the drift while fluid flowed out from five monitoring wells c dots were only detected at e1 p and e1 ot fig 2 within the measurement windows note that water and c dots flowed out of e1 p from two locations separated from each other using a straddle packer assembly one is the location at approximately 39 5 m deep where fluid jetting was observed during the stimulation activities in may fig 1 c and the other location is approximately 2 2 m shallower we denote these two locations as e1 phf and e1 pnf hf hydraulic fracture s nf natural fracture s as will be explained in section 3 1 respectively fig 1 b corresponding to the changes of fracture flow field due to the aforementioned stimulation activities and the leakage of e1 ot tracer breakthrough curves in fig 2 changed remarkably from 26 october to 31 october and also from 1 november to 7 november 3 model and methodology in this section we first develop a fracture network model based on the comprehensive field observations and measurements and then describe the methodology for forward modeling of fluid flow and tracer transport processes in the fracture network model including the fracture coupling strategy model parameterization and numerical implementation the last part further details the framework of the stochastic tracer modeling fig 3 provides a summary of the model and methodology in the present study 3 1 fracture network model we first analyze the natural and hydraulic fractures relevant to the current study according to geological geophysical and geochemical data including core logs wellbore images microseismic events during hydraulic stimulations and the water circulation test dts measurements in the monitoring wells microbial geochemical data of reservoir indigenous fluids and a sewer camera survey of e1 p 3 1 1 natural fractures from core logs and wellbore images 206 natural fracture traces were identified and their properties and states are quite different 130 of them are cemented fractures without apparent opening 71 of them are partially open with limited aperture and five of them are naturally flowing fractures with relatively large aperture considering the commonly recognized cubic relationship between aperture and fracture permeability the flow and transport processes in the fracture network are dominated by the five naturally flow fractures and most of the identified natural fractures actually do not or only slightly participate in the fluid flow and tracer transport processes a major natural fracture connecting e1 ot and e1 p also called ot p connector was inferred from three naturally flowing fracture traces and two partially open fracture traces fig 1 a the five natural fracture traces were found in e1 p e1 ot e1 pdt e1 pdb and e1 pst respectively and they seem to conform to the same planar structure not only in terms of locations but also in terms of local orientations fig 1 a additionally a subset of the five wells had significant natural flows bearing microbial community signatures highly similar with each other corroborating natural fracture connectivity zhang et al 2020 due to the much higher permeabilities of the five natural fracture traces compared with that of the other natural fracture traces we believe the ot p connector was the predominant natural fracture that participated in the flow and transport processes during the water circulation and tracer tests kneafsey et al 2019 3 1 2 hydraulic fracture multiple hydraulic stimulations were performed on the e1 i 50 m interval between 22 may and 25 june 2018 each stimulation lasted up to 80 min and used injection rates up to 5 5 l min the stimulated hydraulic fracture can be delineated through dts measurements microseismic events and a sewer camera survey of e1 p on 25 may 2018 dts measured temperature anomalies in e1 ot first observed on 24 may 2018 and e1 pdt first observed on 30 october 2018 as well as fluid jetting in e1 p observed on 25 may 2018 conform to a plane that is roughly perpendicular to the in situ minimum principal stress orientation and also aligns with the microseismic cloud fig 1 b consequently we believe this plane describes a stimulated hydraulic fracture a fracture network model involving a hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture fig 4 a is then developed according to the above analysis to account for the influence of other natural fractures we included two sinks on the periphery of the developed fracture network model as will be illustrated in section 3 2 2 note that the two outflow locations in e1 p denoted as e1 phf and e1 pnf in section 2 3 are intersections between e1 p and the hydraulic fracture and the natural fracture respectively fig 4 b we acknowledge that matrix diffusion is not represented due to the absence of matrix in the fracture network model nevertheless considering the low matrix porosity 0 01 matrix permeability 5 10 18 m2 and the short tracer injection durations 5 7 6 min of the c dots tracer tests in table 1 matrix diffusion is unlikely to have a significant effect on the tracer transport process becker and shapiro 2003 white et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 3 2 modeling of fluid flow and tracer transport 3 2 1 coupling of the hydraulic and natural fractures we couple the hydraulic and natural fractures by treating a segment of the intersection line between the two fractures as the connection i e a leakage interface between them fluid carrying tracer flows from the hydraulic fracture to the natural fracture through this leakage interface instead of modeling the two fractures simultaneously we model them separately in a sequential manner fig 4 b the location length and leakage rate of this leakage interface are treated as parameters to be determined for the hydraulic fracture the determined leakage parameters that fit the tracer breakthrough curves at e1 phf and e1 ot as well as the corresponding tracer concentration in the leaked fluid are then imposed as known boundary conditions for the natural fracture 3 2 2 parameter spaces for hydraulic and natural fractures the uncertainties to be constrained in the stochastic modeling include fracture extents the locations and sizes of sinks on the periphery of the two fractures the aperture distributions of the two fractures longitudinal and transverse dispersivities as well as the location length and flow rate of the leakage interface between the two fractures the parameterization of these uncertainties is explained below with the ranges of corresponding parameters listed in table 2 fracture extents there are no direct measurements to constrain the extents and shapes of the two fractures the microseismic cloud fig 1 b implies certain shape of the hydraulic fracture but events around the inferred perimeter of the fracture tend to be sparse and suffer from poor location certainty therefore we mathematically represent each fracture using an ellipse within the determined fracture plane in fig 1 for the hydraulic fracture the fracture center is estimated to be the center of the microseismic cloud and the in plane orientation of the ellipse is the overall propagation direction implied by the microseismic cloud the extents of the hydraulic fracture are described by two parameters i e the semi axis lengths a 1 and a 2 as shown in fig 4 c the ranges of a 1 and a 2 are characterized by microseismic events dts signals at e1 ot e1 pdt and fluid jetting in e1 p first the hydraulic fracture extent should intersect with e1 i e1 p and e1 ot fig 1 b but also should not extend too far beyond the area indicated by seismic events second because the hydraulic fracture was extended and intersected e1 pdt on 30 october fig 1 b the value of the hydraulic fracture extent for tracer tests between 31 october and 14 november must be increased to account for this intersection therefore the uncertainties of a 1 and a 2 for tracer tests between 31 october and 14 november are greater than those for the tracer test on 26 october table 2 the natural fracture s extent should at least cover the pentagon defined by the five intersections with wells in fig 1 a because the active flow area involving the hf nf leakage interface and e1 pnf is at the center of the pentagon the fracture area beyond the pentagon is expected to have little effect on the flow field we fix the two semi axis lengths of the natural fracture at 16 4 m and 15 2 m respectively sinks because injected fluid and tracer were not fully recovered in the six c dots tracer tests table 1 we assume a sink on the periphery of each fracture to account for fluid tracer leakage to other natural fractures that are not explicitly described in the model fig 4 c we use two parameters angular orientation and length along the perimeter θ and l for the hydraulic fracture θ and l for the natural fracture to describe the location and size of the sinks respectively fig 4 c aperture distribution fracture aperture has been widely studied in the literature moreno et al 1988 pyrak nolte and morris 2000 tsang and tsang 1989 according to the measurements of core samples and observations of well logs fracture aperture is generally spatially autocorrelated and typically follows a gamma distribution or a log normal distribution bianchi and snow 1968 gale 1987 in the present study we consider a relatively simple uniform aperture scenario as well as a spatially autocorrelated heterogeneous aperture scenario for the uniform aperture scenario the aperture distribution is described by a single parameter w and w for the hydraulic and natural fractures respectively whereas for the heterogeneous aperture scenario the aperture distribution is described by three parameters including average aperture standard deviation and correlation length w σ and cl for the hydraulic fracture w σ and cl for the natural fracture we use the spherical variogram model to generate such a random heterogeneous aperture field following a log normal distribution guo et al 2016 the ranges of parameters relevant to the aperture field are determined based on the following rationales wellbore images suggest that the aperture of the natural fracture ot p connector may be up to several millimeters a simple calculation using closed form solutions for hydraulic fracture growth mack and warpinski 2000 finds that for the rock properties and injection rates during stimulations the aperture of the hydraulic fracture would not exceed several hundred microns for the numerical models used herein the meaningful range of the correlation length is constrained by the extents of the fractures and the mesh resolution dispersivity the transverse dispersivity α t is generally smaller than the longitudinal dispersivity α l and some previous studies assume that α t 0 1α l hecht méndez et al 2013 hermans et al 2018 juliusson and horne 2013 in our stochastic modeling we adopt the same assumption and therefore only include α l in the parameter space in addition since molecular diffusion coefficient d m is much smaller than dispersion coefficient for tracer transport in fractures we assume a constant d m 3 10 9 m2 s in the model the range of α l is assumed to be 0 001 4 m based on previous studies novakowski et al 1985 vogt et al 2012 leakage interface in the stochastic modeling the geometrical intersection between the two fractures is fixed with a length of 9 m the leakage interface is a segment of the intersection and is parameterized by three numbers two describing the location and length p l and l l of the leakage interface and one for leakage rate q l from the hydraulic fracture to the natural fracture we denote the start and end points of the fracture intersection as s and s fig 4 c and p l is the distance between the leakage interface center and s the following rule applies to l l to prevent the leakage interface from extending out of the geometrical intersection if p l l l 2 0 l l 2p l if p l l l 2 9 l l 18 2p l note that the leakage rate is uniformly distributed along the leakage interface the range of the leakage rate depends on the measured outflow rates in that the leakage rate should be larger than the total outflow rates from the natural fracture sum of flow rates from e1 pnf e1 pst and e1 psb and smaller than the difference between the injection rate and the total outflow rates from the hydraulic fracture sum of flow rates from e1 ot e1 phf e1 pdt and e1 pdb 3 2 3 fluid flow and tracer transport simulation fluid flow and tracer transport process in the hydraulic and natural fractures are simulated using a multi physics simulation environment geos settgast et al 2017 a massively parallel multi physics simulation platform developed at the lawrence livermore national laboratory geos provides a thermal hydro mechanical chemical framework to simulate various physical processes occurring during reservoir stimulation and energy recovery applications include the simulation of immiscible fluid flow in fractures and rocks walsh and carroll 2013 heat recovery from geothermal reservoirs guo et al 2016 geochemical transport and reaction walsh et al 2013 hydraulic fracturing settgast et al 2017 and so on guo et al 2016 and wu et al 2019 described and verified the fluid flow and tracer transport modules in geos in this study fractures are represented by thin layers 4 mm and 20 cm thick in the mesh for the hydraulic and natural fractures respectively of porous media with the equivalent porosity ϕ w h and the equivalent permeability k w 3 12h according to the cubic law guo et al 2016 where w is the aperture and h is the thickness of the fracture grid elements both the hydraulic and natural fractures are discretized into hexahedral elements with an in plane resolution of 0 2 m 0 2 m the finite volume method fvm is used to solve eqs 1 and 2 and we use the upwind difference scheme to discretize eq 2 for tracer modeling this scheme is known to cause numerical diffusion brasseur and jacob 2017 leonard 1979 but its effects on simulated tracer transport are observed to be negligible compared with the effects of advection and physical dispersion as simulated the flow field is first solved from eq 1 and then used in eq 2 to solve for tracer concentration for fluid flow simulation the injection rate 400 ml min and the measured outflow rates listed in table 1 are used as boundary conditions for tracer transport simulations the tracer injection parameters injection concentration and duration in table 1 are also used as boundary conditions except for two sinks on the periphery of the two fractures the boundaries along the perimeters of the hydraulic and natural fractures are assumed to be impermeable to both fluid and tracer note that the effect of temperature on fluid flow and tracer transport is not considered in the simulation due to the nearly isothermal injection condition and the temperature insensitive nature of c dots 3 3 stochastic tracer modeling framework for each tracer test we first generate an ensemble of parameter sets using the latin hypercube sampling approach with each individual parameter following a uniform distribution a 1 a 2 cl cl θ θ l l p l l l and q l or a log uniform distribution w w w w σ σ and α l in its corresponding range in table 2 each parameter set corresponds to a stochastic realization of the flow system for which the following workflow applies 1 based on the aperture parameters a uniform or a spatially autocorrelated heterogeneous aperture field is generated and applied to the fracture 2 the steady state flow field in the fracture is calculated based on the aperture field and boundary conditions mentioned in section 3 2 3 3 the tracer transport process in the fracture is simulated with the flow field at steady state the resultant residence time distribution is subsequently evaluated against measured tracer btcs geos itself is a massively parallelized code but in the current study parallelization is only employed to simulate the many stochastic realization with each realization simulated using one cpu core step 2 in the workflow costs a few seconds on a single core of xeon e5 2695 v4 step 3 needs to resolve the transient tracer transport process and costs between 14 s and 3 5 h depending on the flow characteristics for the realization a fracture flow model involving 50 000 realizations costs more than 40 000 core hours necessitating hpc power for a comprehensive study involving many models we then use a rejection sampling method to analyze the stochastic tracer modeling results in terms of the 90 confidence intervals of the simulated tracer breakthrough curves and the uncertainty quantification of model parameters the procedure of the rejection sampling is described in sun and durlofsky 2017 the main steps are 1 generate a random variable p from a uniform distribution within the range 0 1 2 accept m as a posterior realization if p l m s l where m is a parameter set l m is the likelihood function and s l is the maximum of the likelihood function the likelihood function l m is defined as 1 l m c e x p 1 2 r m where c is a normalization constant r m is a function evaluating the fitness between the simulated and measured tracer breakthrough curves sun and durlofsky 2017 used the sum of the square error as r m in their analysis however in the present study we found the following function captures the most essential characteristics of the tracer btcs and therefore is used as r m in our analysis 2 r 1 σ e 2 c p sim c p mea 1 2 t sim t mea 1 2 t l sim t l mea 1 2 t r sim t r mea 1 2 where σ e is the standard deviation of measurement errors note that we assume the measurement errors to be independent identically distributed gaussian random variables for subsequent analysis σ e is assumed to be 0 3 the two superscripts sim and mea denote the results from simulation and measurement respectively cp and t are the magnitude of the peak concentration and the corresponding arrival time t l and t r are the two times before left of and after right of the peak respectively of the half peak magnitude this equation compares four parameters controlling the shape of a tracer breakthrough curve to find peaks from a simulated tracer btc we adopt the find peak function of the scipy signal processing toolbox in python scipy signal find peak which can screen out non prominent peaks jones et al 2001 as shown in fig 2 each measured tracer btc has only one peak however a simulated tracer btc may have multiple peaks we directly extend the misfit calculation method to a simulated btc with multiple peak concentrations by applying eq 2 to every peak on the simulated tracer btc and then summing the calculated misfit values together this leads to high misfit values for those realizations naturally penalizing the realizations with multiple concentration peaks also note that for the hydraulic fracture both the tracer btcs at e1 phf and e1 ot need to be quantified and we sum the misfits for e1 phf and e1 ot together as the total misfit for the natural fracture we only calculate the misfit for the tracer btc at e1 pnf we first perform stochastic modeling for the hydraulic fracture according to the aforementioned workflow the realization that yields the smallest total misfit is selected to attain the time concentration curves along the leakage interface with which we then perform the stochastic modeling for the natural fracture using the same workflow 4 results of the stochastic modeling for the hydraulic fracture 4 1 relationship between the total misfit and individual parameters we start the analysis with the relatively simple uniform aperture scenario with nine parameters for the hydraulic fracture approximately 50 000 realizations were performed for each tracer test and the scatter plots between individual parameters and the total misfit are shown in fig 5 note that only the scatter plots for w θ α l and p l are shown in fig 5 and those for the other parameters can be found in fig s1 in supplementary material the total misfit r varies in a wide range and fig 5 only shows the realizations with a total misfit smaller than 104 according to eq 4 if the differences of the four variables c p t t l and t r between simulation and measurement all equal 15 then the calculated misfit is 0 09 and the base 10 logarithm of the total misfit for the two tracer btcs e1 phf and e1 ot is 0 74 as shown in fig 5 most of the performed realizations show a total misfit much larger than 0 74 and fail to reasonably match the measured tracer btcs at e1 phf and e1 ot simultaneously the nine parameters show different effects on the total misfit we observe a strong dependence of the total misfit on aperture w sink location θ longitudinal dispersivity α l and leakage interface location p l for these parameters we are able to identify concentrated value ranges as shown by the 90 confidence intervals in the scatter plots in fig 5 according to the accepted parameter sets from the rejection sampling procedure while for the other parameters such a concentrated value range cannot be obtained from the satisfactory realizations accepted by the rejection sampling procedure we calculate the 90 confidence intervals for tracer breakthrough curves at e1 phf and e1 ot shadings in fig 5 to compare with the field tracer measurements red and blue dots in fig 5 the results of the realization with the smallest total misfit solid lines in fig 5 are also shown the comparison indicates that the measured tracer breakthrough curves at e1 phf and e1 ot are successfully reproduced simultaneously we use the parameter values from the realization with the smallest total misfit as the best estimates for these parameters table 3 4 2 sensitivities of individual parameters the sobol total sensitivity index is a measurement of the contribution of each parameter to the variance of the total misfit sobol 1993 and can be used to identify critical parameters that dominate the tracer transport process as shown in fig 6 the sobol total sensitivity indices show similar patterns for the six tracer tests the tracer transport process in the hydraulic fracture is dominated by the aperture w and sink location θ while fracture extents described by a 1 and a 2 leakage rate q l and the length of the leakage interface described by l l actually show little effects especially for the tracer tests on 26 october 1 7 8 and 14 november as a result the uncertainties in w and θ are appropriately constrained from the stochastic tracer modeling while the uncertainties in a 1 a 2 q l and l l cannot be further constrained the result of sobol sensitivity analysis is consistent with the scatter plots in fig 5 in that the more sensitive the parameter the easier it is to identify an optimal value for the parameter 4 3 heterogeneous aperture scenario previous experimental observations and theoretical studies indicate that flow channeling is a common phenomenon in fracture networks becker and shapiro 2000 fu et al 2016 guo et al 2016 moreno et al 1988 hawkins et al 2017b although the uniform aperture scenario is able to match the measured tracer breakthrough curves at e1 phf and e1 ot simultaneously it could be illuminating to further model the tracer tests under the heterogeneous aperture scenario where flow channeling is generally much stronger than that in the uniform aperture scenario here we take the tracer test on 31 october as an example for which 400 000 realizations were modeled fig 7 similarly we only show the scatter plots for aperture parameters w σ and cl longitudinal dispersivity α l sink location θ and leakage interface location p l in fig 7 a and scatter plots for other parameters are provided in fig s2 in supplementary material compared with the uniform aperture scenario the heterogeneous aperture scenario involves more parameters and a larger number of satisfactory realizations obtained from the rejection sampling procedure can match the tracer breakthrough curves at e1 phf and e1 ot simultaneously as shown in fig 7 b however the heterogeneous aperture fields for these satisfactory realizations are quite different from each other fig 7 c although the sobol total sensitivity analysis shows that the average aperture w and sink location θ are dominant parameters under the heterogeneous aperture scenario fig 8 the values of the aperture parameters w σ and cl cannot be constrained as under the uniform aperture scenario however a concentrated value range for θ can still be identified from the obtained satisfactory realizations which is consistent with the results under the uniform aperture scenario table 3 the stochastic model seems to be overfitted under the heterogeneous aperture scenario for the available tracer measurements 5 results of the stochastic modeling for the natural fracture for each tracer test we select the realization with the smallest total misfit under the uniform aperture scenario parameters listed in fig 5 to attain the necessary upper stream information to perform stochastic modeling of flow and transport processes in the natural fracture the information includes the leakage rate q l leakage interface location and length p l and l l as well as the time concentration curves for each leakage element 5 1 uniform aperture scenario similar to the modeling of the hydraulic fracture we start the analysis of the natural fracture with the uniform aperture scenario since only three parameters are involved w θ and l we performed around 15 000 realizations for each tracer test the scatter plots of the total misfit as a function of the three parameters are shown in fig s3 in supplementary material fig 9 compares the tracer breakthrough curve at e1 pnf from measurement and the realization with the smallest total misfit although the misfit results clearly favor a specific range for w the tracer breakthrough curves at e1 pnf cannot be matched to a reasonable level the modeling results for 26 october tracer test in fig 9 indicate an average aperture of 0 1 mm while the core logs retrieved from e1 p indicate that the aperture in the natural fracture is several millimeters therefore the uniform aperture scenario is unlikely to correctly simulate the tracer transport process in the natural fracture 5 2 heterogeneous aperture scenario we then assume a spatially autocorrelated heterogeneous aperture distribution in the natural fracture around 50 000 realizations were performed for each tracer test fig 10 many satisfactory realizations that match the tracer breakthrough curve at e1 pnf almost equally well are obtained from the rejection sampling procedure and the corresponding parameters in these satisfactory realizations span relatively large ranges in the parameter space as shown by the red circles in the scatter plots in fig 10 scatter plots for other parameters are provided in fig s4 in supplementary material we also show the aperture distribution in the natural fracture from one of the satisfactory realizations and more results can be found in fig s5 in supplementary material for tracer tests between 26 october and 8 november the 90 confidence interval of the tracer breakthrough curve at e1 pnf agree well with the measured tracer data however for the tracer test on 14 november due to the lack of tracer concentration measurements beyond 12 h due to field operational constraints the fitting of the tracer breakthrough curve is difficult and the corresponding 90 confidence interval indicates a large uncertainty 6 discussions 6 1 consistency of stochastic modeling results with other field observations the following field observations were not used to constrain the stochastic models however the agreement between the modeling results and these observations serves as additional validation of the modeling work 6 1 1 aperture of the natural fracture although the aperture of the natural fracture cannot be constrained from the stochastic modeling results a rough estimate of its value can be obtained from the aperture distributions in fig 10 according to the satisfactory realizations for tracer tests between 31 october and 14 november the average aperture is approximately 1 3 mm which is in agreement with the value several millimeters estimated from core segments corresponding to the five fracture intersections in fig 1 a the fact that no uniform aperture distribution in the natural fracture could fit the tracer data indicates that flow in the natural fracture is highly heterogeneous this is consistent with the observation from the five core segments in fig 1 a which show very different forms in terms of kinematic aperture and the mineral fillings 6 1 2 location of the sink on the hydraulic fracture an interesting finding from the stochastic modeling is that fluid and tracer leaked out of the hydraulic fracture from its west boundary meaning that another natural fracture that is not explicitly included in our fracture network model was likely to intersect the west boundary of the hydraulic fracture the existence of this natural fracture was confirmed in a later stimulation activity at the 43 m interval in e1 i on 20 december 2018 during which seismic events showed an apparent tendency to propagate northward and intersected the west boundary of the hydraulic fracture stimulated at the 50 m interval 6 2 inferring the evolution of fracture flow characteristics during the circulation tests direct observations of the measured outflow rates table 1 and tracer breakthrough curves fig 2 indicate that the fracture flow field changed several times during the water circulation test from 24 october to 20 november 2018 two major changes can be identified one taking place between tracer tests on 26 and 31 october and the other one between tracer tests on 1 and 7 november by assuming that fracture flow models that reasonably fit the tracer data can represent the actual states of the fracture flow system we could infer the nature of these changes from the stochastic modeling results related to the first major change the fitted aperture for the tracer test on 26 october is significantly larger than that for the five subsequent tests according to the results in table 3 both microseismic and dts temperature measurements indicated significant eastward hydraulic fracture propagation during the 800 ml min rate injection from 29 to 30 october this seems to indicate that prior to this propagation the hydraulic fracture was dilated to a larger aperture to accommodate the 400 ml min circulation rate before 29 october the hydraulic fracture propagation between 29 and 30 october enabled stronger hydraulic connection between the hydraulic fracture and the natural fracture system thereby accommodating the injection rate without requiring much dilation of the fracture the second major change was likely caused by the redistribution of outflows among production and monitoring wells resulting from stimulation induced damage to e1 ot sealing the aperture of the hydraulic fracture remained almost constant between 1 and 7 november table 3 before the damage to e1 ot fluid and tracer had a strong tendency to flow in the direction from e1 i to e1 phf due to the presence of the leaky interface and high outflow rate at e1 phf therefore tracer breakthrough was earlier and peak magnitude was larger at e1 phf than that at e1 ot on 1 november however after e1 ot was damaged by stimulation on 6 november outflow rate increased significantly at e1 ot and decreased at e1 phf and e1 pnf and fluid and tracer became easier to flow in the direction from e1 i to e1 ot as a result tracer breakthrough was earlier and peak magnitude was larger at e1 ot than that at e1 phf on 7 november although the heterogeneous aperture scenario for the natural fracture tends to over fit the tracer data and the fitting results are nonunique we could still gain critical insights into the changes in the natural fracture s flow field from the commonalities among the satisfactory fitting results the satisfactory realizations statistically suggest that the average aperture w increased from 26 october to 14 november as shown in fig 11 a particularly remarkable increase took place between 26 october and 31 october likely a result of the hydraulic fracture propagation between 29 and 30 october we could not point to a specific explanation for the increased aperture it could be caused by an expansion of the active flow area on the fracture thereby engaging more flow channels with larger apertures or some geochemical causes the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this work 6 3 effect of tracer data quality and quantity on stochastic modeling stochastic tracer modeling is inherently an inversion process to infer 3d flow and transport characteristics from time series tracer data the quality and quantity of available tracer data are essential for this inversion process based on the results of this study we analyze the effect of tracer data quality and quantity on stochastic modeling first any incompleteness in tracer breakthrough curves causes ambiguity in the interpretation of stochastic modeling results as shown in fig 5 a due to the lack of the ascending segment of the tracer breakthrough curve at e1 ot the peak arrival time and peak magnitude cannot be used to accurately evaluate the fitness between the measured and simulated tracer breakthrough curve which undoubtedly caused ambiguity in the selection of satisfactory realizations on the other hand as shown in fig 10 f the breakthrough curve at e1 pnf does not have tail data beyond 12 h as a result the stochastic modeling results show a large uncertainty in the simulated tracer breakthrough curve second sampling tracer concentrations at multiple locations in the flow network is crucial for resolving the spatial distribution of flow in the fractures in this study there are two tracer breakthrough curves e1 phf and e1 ot available for the hydraulic fracture and a satisfactory realization needs to match the two breakthrough curves simultaneously if the misfit function had only accounted for one breakthrough curve then the stochastic modeling results could no longer constrain model parameters take the tracer test on 31 october as an example had only one tracer breakthrough curve been matched either at e1 phf or e1 ot we would have obtained more than 30 satisfactory realizations fig 12 shows the results from four of these realizations among these satisfactory realizations the values of the four critical parameters w θ α l and p l vary in large ranges and cannot be constrained such as in fig 5 it is worth mentioning that although some previous studies treated c dots as a conservative tracer hawkins et al 2017b mattson et al 2019b sorption isotherm tests from the egs collab project indicated that c dots exhibited a langmuir type sorption to crushed phyllite rocks the host rock of the collab experiment 1 test bed neupane et al 2020 the sorption of c dots to surrounding rock formations during the six tracer tests modeled in this study might have been a reason for the discrepancy between the water recovery ratio and the c dots mass recovery ratio mattson et al 2019 causing inevitable uncertainties in our stochastic modeling results 7 conclusion in this study we carried out stochastic modeling for six conservative tracer tests performed during a series of circulation and fracture stimulation experiments spanning nearly one month at the egs collab experiment 1 testbed numerous realizations were performed to simulate tracer transport processes in a fracture network model realizations that successfully reproduce the measured tracer breakthrough curves were obtained to gain insight into the flow system as well as its evolution at the testbed the present study demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of stochastic tracer modeling for the characterization of fractured reservoirs in subsurface the results in this study provide important insights into the flow and transport characteristics in a hydraulically stimulated fracture network including the critical parameters interaction between hydraulic and natural fractures as well as the evolution of flow and transport processes in the fracture network in response to various experiments such knowledge for a real world reservoir can facilitate reservoir design and operation improve reservoir thermal

4953,energy extraction from subsurface reservoirs is important for addressing the increasing energy demand and environmental concerns such as global warming however the characterization of subsurface reservoirs particularly reservoirs dominated by fracture networks remains a challenge due to the lack of means to directly observe subsurface processes this study explores the feasibility and efficacy of characterizing fracture flow and transport processes in an enhanced geothermal system egs testbed through stochastic tracer modeling there are two enabling factors that allow application of stochastic modeling to characterize a subsurface reservoir first an abundance of geological and geophysical measurements enables the development of a high fidelity and well constrained fracture network model second high performance computing hpc allows running massive realizations efficiently six conservative tracer tests were stochastically modeled and produced satisfactory realizations that successfully reproduce field tracer recovery data from each tracer test the evolution of flow and transport processes in the fracture network was then analyzed from these satisfactory realizations the present study demonstrates that stochastic tracer modeling on a high fidelity fracture network model is feasible and can provide important insights regarding flow and transport characteristics in subsurface fractured reservoirs keywords fractured reservoirs characterization enhanced geothermal system tracer testing stochastic modeling 1 introduction subsurface reservoirs are widely exploited around the world for energy recovery and geological storage of industrial wastes including co2 the successful exploitation of a subsurface reservoir requires a comprehensive understanding of flow and transport characteristics in the reservoir particularly in the context of unconventional oil gas extraction middleton et al 2015 geothermal heat recovery brown et al 2012 fu et al 2016 mcclure and horne 2014 u s department of energy 2019 co2 storage fu et al 2017 sun and tong 2017 as well as radioactive and toxic industrial wastes containment cuss et al 2015 sudicky and frind 1984 sun and buscheck 2003 tang et al 1981 tsang et al 2015 quantitative characterization of flow and transport processes in subsurface reservoirs is commonly based on flow or pressure and tracer tests in conjunction with various geological and geophysical investigations such as core logging outcrop analysis and seismic and electrical imaging berkowitz 2002 goovaerts 1997 juliusson and horne 2013 karmakar et al 2016 neuman 2005 vandenbohede and lebbe 2003 the inference of spatially variable hydraulic and transport properties can be achieved by matching the measured flow and tracer data with results from either analytical or numerical models constrained by geophysical investigations bullivant and o sullivan 1989 cacas et al 1990b castagna and bellin 2009 hawkins et al 2017a 2017b 2018 radilla et al 2012 a major difficulty in flow and tracer data interpretation is that the available geological and geophysical data are generally insufficient to eliminate the many uncertainties pertaining to characterizing subsurface reservoirs especially the complex fracture networks which provide principal pathways for flow and transport processes in many subsurface reservoirs a common method to accommodate these uncertainties in subsurface analysis is stochastic modeling cacas et al 1990a geier et al 2019 moreno et al 1988 ptak et al 2004 tsang et al 1996 which aims to reproduce flow and tracer measurements from massive randomly generated realizations the efficacy of stochastic modeling is often undermined by two major challenges the first one is the difficulty in developing a high fidelity and well constrained model with appropriate reduction in model complexity based on geological and geophysical observations and measurements an over simplified stochastic model may not be able to capture the necessary complexity of the field while a complex stochastic model with a high dimensional parameter space is prone to overfitting the second challenge is that numerous realizations are required to sufficiently cover the parameter space of a stochastic model because each parameter pertaining to a subsurface reservoir can vary in a wide range most previous efforts either use analytical solutions or simplified numerical models to make stochastic modeling computationally tractable hawkins et al 2017b 2018 radilla et al 2012 or empirically estimate the values of some parameters to reduce the parameter space so that fewer realizations are required vogt et al 2012 for example to characterize fracture flow in the soultz sous forêts egs site vogt et al 2012 performed stochastic modeling of field tracer experiments with 10 000 realizations generated from a monte carlo approach each with a different 3d permeability distribution however none of these realizations could match the two measured tracer breakthrough curves btcs simultaneously indicating that some other complexities relevant to the tracer transport process such as dispersivity and porosity may not have been properly accommodated in the stochastic model vogt et al 2012 also suggested that a better fitting quality might have been possible if the realization number had been some orders of magnitude larger in the past several decades increasing subsurface activities and the demand for high fidelity predictions of subsurface processes have greatly accelerated the development of comprehensive geological geophysical monitoring techniques and high performance computing hpc capabilities which provide new opportunities to improve the methodology for subsurface reservoir characterization with these techniques and capabilities it is now possible to use the following strategy to address the aforementioned challenges first high quality geological and geophysical data are utilized to improve the understanding of subsurface fracture networks and thereby to rationally define the parameter space for stochastic modeling for certain data rich environments high fidelity models can be constrained by honoring available field observations and measurements in a holistic manner second hpc capabilities allow a massive number of realizations and enable a thorough sweeping of the parameter space of the developed high fidelity model following this strategy the present study explores using stochastic tracer modeling to characterize flow and transport processes in a subsurface fracture network in a data rich environment with hpc enhanced modeling power we use the ongoing egs collab project kneafsey et al 2019 2020 as an example to illustrate the development of a high fidelity fracture network model from comprehensive geological and geophysical data and use a stochastic approach with massive realizations to simulate the tracer transport process in the fracture network for this specific site a stochastic approach is appropriate and necessary for the following reasons 1 the developed high fidelity fracture network model has a high dimensional parameter space and uses randomly distributed fields spatial distribution of aperture which cannot be described using continuous function forms deterministic methods such as bayesian inversion may not be applicable 2 even in this data rich environment it is still likely that the viable solutions are not unique stochastic modeling allows multiple viable solutions to be retrieved and we can gain insights into the flow and transport characteristics from the commonalities among these solutions the paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly introduces the egs collab experiment testbed including well configuration geological and geophysical investigations hydraulic stimulation activities and the tracer tests modeled by the current work in section 3 based on various geophysical measurements and observations we develop a fracture network model involving both natural and hydraulic fractures for subsequent stochastic modeling of the tracer tests we also present the numerical methods for flow and tracer simulation as well as the details of the stochastic framework sections 4 and 5 present modeling results and the corresponding interpretations regarding flow and transport characteristics in the fracture network model section 6 demonstrates the consistency between modeling results and additional field observations analyzes the evolution of flow and transport processes in the fracture network model and discusses the effect of tracer data quality and quantity on stochastic modeling 2 the egs collab project experiment 1 the egs collab project is an ongoing in situ experiment designed to investigate the stimulation of fractures in rock and the circulation of fluids in the stimulated fracture network at an intermediate scale tens of meters intermediate between lab and field scales for egs applications kneafsey et al 2019 white et al 2019 the project is planned to have three phases of experiments and the experiment 1 testbed is located in a predominately phyllite rock mass approximately 1478 m below ground surface on the western side of the west access drift on the 4850 level within the sanford underground research facility surf in south dakota usa in this section we briefly describe the components of this experiment that are relevant to the present study 2 1 well configuration eight wells were drilled from the drift wall into the testbed including an injection well a production well and six monitoring wells fig 1 a and b the injection well e1 i was drilled nominally in the direction of the minimum horizontal principal stress so as to generate hydraulic fractures largely perpendicular to the wellbore according to geomechanics principles hubbert and willis 1957 note that the local in situ stress orientation had been determined in an earlier experiment oldenburg et al 2017 and was verified by experiment 1 results kneafsey et al 2020 the production well e1 p was parallel to e1 i and approximately 10 m to the east of e1 i four monitoring wells e1 pdt e1 pdb e1 pst and e1 psb were drilled parallel to the expected hydraulic fracture plane and the other two monitoring wells e1 ot and e1 ob were largely orthogonal to the expected hydraulic fracture 2 2 geological and geophysical investigations the temperature conditions in the testbed was investigated through several temperature surveys in 2009 and 2017 as well as a numerical simulation dobson and salve 2009 white et al 2018 apart from of the native geothermal gradient the many decades of mining and research operations have created a largely radial temperature gradient around the west access drift into the testbed wellbore televiewer and acoustic logs were acquired and cores were retrieved throughout the eight wells approximately 467 m in total length to map the natural fracture network in the testbed multiple geophysical techniques including cross hole seismic survey continuous active source seismic monitoring cassm microseismic electrical resistivity tomography ert and distributed temperature sensing dts were used to characterize the experiment site and to monitor the evolution of the testbed particularly the evolution of the fluid conducting fracture sensors for these geophysical monitoring techniques were deployed in the six monitoring wells to obtain high resolution measurements continuously before during and after fracture stimulation to obtain high resolution measurements a sewer camera was deployed in e1 p during one of the stimulations to directly observe fluid flow into the production well and identify possible intersection s of hydraulic fracture s with e1 p 2 3 hydraulic stimulations and tracer tests multiple hydraulic stimulations have been performed at three depths in well e1 i 39 m 128 ft 43 m 142 ft and 50 m 164 ft in 2018 there was no indication of strong hydraulic interference between the fractures stimulated from these three depths this work focuses on the fracture system stimulated at the 50 m interval in e1 i a water circulation test was conducted between 24 october and 20 november 2018 by injecting into an interval between a set of straddle packers set at the 50 m depth of e1 i to characterize the stimulated fracture network the time histories of injection rate injection pressure and observed microseismic events are presented in a condensed form in fig 1 e in general an injection rate of 400 ml min was used for the majority of the test window with a few exceptions as shown in fig 1 e according to the aforementioned temperature surveys and simulations rock temperature at the 50 m interval in e1 i is approximately 30 c and the injection temperature during the water circulation test was mostly maintained at 30 c achieving a nearly isothermal condition note that the microseismic events observed between 26 and 31 october and between 2 and 6 november indicate that the stimulated fracture network may have changed during the circulation test it was observed in the field that the stimulation activities between 3 november and 8 november caused the break of grouting seal in e1 ot leading to a significant increase in the outflow rate at e1 ot during the water circulation test a series of tracer tests were conducted using different tracers including conservative tracer c dots and chlorine reactive tracer cesium lithium rhodamine b and fluorescein as well as dna tracer mattson et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2020 c dots is a nanoparticle tracer consisting of a carbon core decorated with a highly fluorescent polymer hawkins et al 2017b for each test tracers were first mixed with water and then injected into the fracture network through the 50 m depth interval serial water samples were collected for approximately 8 to 24 h from the production and monitoring wells the measurements and analysis of tracer concentrations in these water samples are detailed in mattson et al 2019a in our stochastic modeling we analyze the six c dots tracer tests as summarized in table 1 outflow rates at different wells during the six tracer tests are also shown in table 1 note that table 1 only includes the volumetric flow rates from e1 p e1 ot e1 pdt e1 pst and e1 pdb water also leaked into the mine drift from other locations including wells not monitored for flow rates and natural fractures intersecting the drift while fluid flowed out from five monitoring wells c dots were only detected at e1 p and e1 ot fig 2 within the measurement windows note that water and c dots flowed out of e1 p from two locations separated from each other using a straddle packer assembly one is the location at approximately 39 5 m deep where fluid jetting was observed during the stimulation activities in may fig 1 c and the other location is approximately 2 2 m shallower we denote these two locations as e1 phf and e1 pnf hf hydraulic fracture s nf natural fracture s as will be explained in section 3 1 respectively fig 1 b corresponding to the changes of fracture flow field due to the aforementioned stimulation activities and the leakage of e1 ot tracer breakthrough curves in fig 2 changed remarkably from 26 october to 31 october and also from 1 november to 7 november 3 model and methodology in this section we first develop a fracture network model based on the comprehensive field observations and measurements and then describe the methodology for forward modeling of fluid flow and tracer transport processes in the fracture network model including the fracture coupling strategy model parameterization and numerical implementation the last part further details the framework of the stochastic tracer modeling fig 3 provides a summary of the model and methodology in the present study 3 1 fracture network model we first analyze the natural and hydraulic fractures relevant to the current study according to geological geophysical and geochemical data including core logs wellbore images microseismic events during hydraulic stimulations and the water circulation test dts measurements in the monitoring wells microbial geochemical data of reservoir indigenous fluids and a sewer camera survey of e1 p 3 1 1 natural fractures from core logs and wellbore images 206 natural fracture traces were identified and their properties and states are quite different 130 of them are cemented fractures without apparent opening 71 of them are partially open with limited aperture and five of them are naturally flowing fractures with relatively large aperture considering the commonly recognized cubic relationship between aperture and fracture permeability the flow and transport processes in the fracture network are dominated by the five naturally flow fractures and most of the identified natural fractures actually do not or only slightly participate in the fluid flow and tracer transport processes a major natural fracture connecting e1 ot and e1 p also called ot p connector was inferred from three naturally flowing fracture traces and two partially open fracture traces fig 1 a the five natural fracture traces were found in e1 p e1 ot e1 pdt e1 pdb and e1 pst respectively and they seem to conform to the same planar structure not only in terms of locations but also in terms of local orientations fig 1 a additionally a subset of the five wells had significant natural flows bearing microbial community signatures highly similar with each other corroborating natural fracture connectivity zhang et al 2020 due to the much higher permeabilities of the five natural fracture traces compared with that of the other natural fracture traces we believe the ot p connector was the predominant natural fracture that participated in the flow and transport processes during the water circulation and tracer tests kneafsey et al 2019 3 1 2 hydraulic fracture multiple hydraulic stimulations were performed on the e1 i 50 m interval between 22 may and 25 june 2018 each stimulation lasted up to 80 min and used injection rates up to 5 5 l min the stimulated hydraulic fracture can be delineated through dts measurements microseismic events and a sewer camera survey of e1 p on 25 may 2018 dts measured temperature anomalies in e1 ot first observed on 24 may 2018 and e1 pdt first observed on 30 october 2018 as well as fluid jetting in e1 p observed on 25 may 2018 conform to a plane that is roughly perpendicular to the in situ minimum principal stress orientation and also aligns with the microseismic cloud fig 1 b consequently we believe this plane describes a stimulated hydraulic fracture a fracture network model involving a hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture fig 4 a is then developed according to the above analysis to account for the influence of other natural fractures we included two sinks on the periphery of the developed fracture network model as will be illustrated in section 3 2 2 note that the two outflow locations in e1 p denoted as e1 phf and e1 pnf in section 2 3 are intersections between e1 p and the hydraulic fracture and the natural fracture respectively fig 4 b we acknowledge that matrix diffusion is not represented due to the absence of matrix in the fracture network model nevertheless considering the low matrix porosity 0 01 matrix permeability 5 10 18 m2 and the short tracer injection durations 5 7 6 min of the c dots tracer tests in table 1 matrix diffusion is unlikely to have a significant effect on the tracer transport process becker and shapiro 2003 white et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 3 2 modeling of fluid flow and tracer transport 3 2 1 coupling of the hydraulic and natural fractures we couple the hydraulic and natural fractures by treating a segment of the intersection line between the two fractures as the connection i e a leakage interface between them fluid carrying tracer flows from the hydraulic fracture to the natural fracture through this leakage interface instead of modeling the two fractures simultaneously we model them separately in a sequential manner fig 4 b the location length and leakage rate of this leakage interface are treated as parameters to be determined for the hydraulic fracture the determined leakage parameters that fit the tracer breakthrough curves at e1 phf and e1 ot as well as the corresponding tracer concentration in the leaked fluid are then imposed as known boundary conditions for the natural fracture 3 2 2 parameter spaces for hydraulic and natural fractures the uncertainties to be constrained in the stochastic modeling include fracture extents the locations and sizes of sinks on the periphery of the two fractures the aperture distributions of the two fractures longitudinal and transverse dispersivities as well as the location length and flow rate of the leakage interface between the two fractures the parameterization of these uncertainties is explained below with the ranges of corresponding parameters listed in table 2 fracture extents there are no direct measurements to constrain the extents and shapes of the two fractures the microseismic cloud fig 1 b implies certain shape of the hydraulic fracture but events around the inferred perimeter of the fracture tend to be sparse and suffer from poor location certainty therefore we mathematically represent each fracture using an ellipse within the determined fracture plane in fig 1 for the hydraulic fracture the fracture center is estimated to be the center of the microseismic cloud and the in plane orientation of the ellipse is the overall propagation direction implied by the microseismic cloud the extents of the hydraulic fracture are described by two parameters i e the semi axis lengths a 1 and a 2 as shown in fig 4 c the ranges of a 1 and a 2 are characterized by microseismic events dts signals at e1 ot e1 pdt and fluid jetting in e1 p first the hydraulic fracture extent should intersect with e1 i e1 p and e1 ot fig 1 b but also should not extend too far beyond the area indicated by seismic events second because the hydraulic fracture was extended and intersected e1 pdt on 30 october fig 1 b the value of the hydraulic fracture extent for tracer tests between 31 october and 14 november must be increased to account for this intersection therefore the uncertainties of a 1 and a 2 for tracer tests between 31 october and 14 november are greater than those for the tracer test on 26 october table 2 the natural fracture s extent should at least cover the pentagon defined by the five intersections with wells in fig 1 a because the active flow area involving the hf nf leakage interface and e1 pnf is at the center of the pentagon the fracture area beyond the pentagon is expected to have little effect on the flow field we fix the two semi axis lengths of the natural fracture at 16 4 m and 15 2 m respectively sinks because injected fluid and tracer were not fully recovered in the six c dots tracer tests table 1 we assume a sink on the periphery of each fracture to account for fluid tracer leakage to other natural fractures that are not explicitly described in the model fig 4 c we use two parameters angular orientation and length along the perimeter θ and l for the hydraulic fracture θ and l for the natural fracture to describe the location and size of the sinks respectively fig 4 c aperture distribution fracture aperture has been widely studied in the literature moreno et al 1988 pyrak nolte and morris 2000 tsang and tsang 1989 according to the measurements of core samples and observations of well logs fracture aperture is generally spatially autocorrelated and typically follows a gamma distribution or a log normal distribution bianchi and snow 1968 gale 1987 in the present study we consider a relatively simple uniform aperture scenario as well as a spatially autocorrelated heterogeneous aperture scenario for the uniform aperture scenario the aperture distribution is described by a single parameter w and w for the hydraulic and natural fractures respectively whereas for the heterogeneous aperture scenario the aperture distribution is described by three parameters including average aperture standard deviation and correlation length w σ and cl for the hydraulic fracture w σ and cl for the natural fracture we use the spherical variogram model to generate such a random heterogeneous aperture field following a log normal distribution guo et al 2016 the ranges of parameters relevant to the aperture field are determined based on the following rationales wellbore images suggest that the aperture of the natural fracture ot p connector may be up to several millimeters a simple calculation using closed form solutions for hydraulic fracture growth mack and warpinski 2000 finds that for the rock properties and injection rates during stimulations the aperture of the hydraulic fracture would not exceed several hundred microns for the numerical models used herein the meaningful range of the correlation length is constrained by the extents of the fractures and the mesh resolution dispersivity the transverse dispersivity α t is generally smaller than the longitudinal dispersivity α l and some previous studies assume that α t 0 1α l hecht méndez et al 2013 hermans et al 2018 juliusson and horne 2013 in our stochastic modeling we adopt the same assumption and therefore only include α l in the parameter space in addition since molecular diffusion coefficient d m is much smaller than dispersion coefficient for tracer transport in fractures we assume a constant d m 3 10 9 m2 s in the model the range of α l is assumed to be 0 001 4 m based on previous studies novakowski et al 1985 vogt et al 2012 leakage interface in the stochastic modeling the geometrical intersection between the two fractures is fixed with a length of 9 m the leakage interface is a segment of the intersection and is parameterized by three numbers two describing the location and length p l and l l of the leakage interface and one for leakage rate q l from the hydraulic fracture to the natural fracture we denote the start and end points of the fracture intersection as s and s fig 4 c and p l is the distance between the leakage interface center and s the following rule applies to l l to prevent the leakage interface from extending out of the geometrical intersection if p l l l 2 0 l l 2p l if p l l l 2 9 l l 18 2p l note that the leakage rate is uniformly distributed along the leakage interface the range of the leakage rate depends on the measured outflow rates in that the leakage rate should be larger than the total outflow rates from the natural fracture sum of flow rates from e1 pnf e1 pst and e1 psb and smaller than the difference between the injection rate and the total outflow rates from the hydraulic fracture sum of flow rates from e1 ot e1 phf e1 pdt and e1 pdb 3 2 3 fluid flow and tracer transport simulation fluid flow and tracer transport process in the hydraulic and natural fractures are simulated using a multi physics simulation environment geos settgast et al 2017 a massively parallel multi physics simulation platform developed at the lawrence livermore national laboratory geos provides a thermal hydro mechanical chemical framework to simulate various physical processes occurring during reservoir stimulation and energy recovery applications include the simulation of immiscible fluid flow in fractures and rocks walsh and carroll 2013 heat recovery from geothermal reservoirs guo et al 2016 geochemical transport and reaction walsh et al 2013 hydraulic fracturing settgast et al 2017 and so on guo et al 2016 and wu et al 2019 described and verified the fluid flow and tracer transport modules in geos in this study fractures are represented by thin layers 4 mm and 20 cm thick in the mesh for the hydraulic and natural fractures respectively of porous media with the equivalent porosity ϕ w h and the equivalent permeability k w 3 12h according to the cubic law guo et al 2016 where w is the aperture and h is the thickness of the fracture grid elements both the hydraulic and natural fractures are discretized into hexahedral elements with an in plane resolution of 0 2 m 0 2 m the finite volume method fvm is used to solve eqs 1 and 2 and we use the upwind difference scheme to discretize eq 2 for tracer modeling this scheme is known to cause numerical diffusion brasseur and jacob 2017 leonard 1979 but its effects on simulated tracer transport are observed to be negligible compared with the effects of advection and physical dispersion as simulated the flow field is first solved from eq 1 and then used in eq 2 to solve for tracer concentration for fluid flow simulation the injection rate 400 ml min and the measured outflow rates listed in table 1 are used as boundary conditions for tracer transport simulations the tracer injection parameters injection concentration and duration in table 1 are also used as boundary conditions except for two sinks on the periphery of the two fractures the boundaries along the perimeters of the hydraulic and natural fractures are assumed to be impermeable to both fluid and tracer note that the effect of temperature on fluid flow and tracer transport is not considered in the simulation due to the nearly isothermal injection condition and the temperature insensitive nature of c dots 3 3 stochastic tracer modeling framework for each tracer test we first generate an ensemble of parameter sets using the latin hypercube sampling approach with each individual parameter following a uniform distribution a 1 a 2 cl cl θ θ l l p l l l and q l or a log uniform distribution w w w w σ σ and α l in its corresponding range in table 2 each parameter set corresponds to a stochastic realization of the flow system for which the following workflow applies 1 based on the aperture parameters a uniform or a spatially autocorrelated heterogeneous aperture field is generated and applied to the fracture 2 the steady state flow field in the fracture is calculated based on the aperture field and boundary conditions mentioned in section 3 2 3 3 the tracer transport process in the fracture is simulated with the flow field at steady state the resultant residence time distribution is subsequently evaluated against measured tracer btcs geos itself is a massively parallelized code but in the current study parallelization is only employed to simulate the many stochastic realization with each realization simulated using one cpu core step 2 in the workflow costs a few seconds on a single core of xeon e5 2695 v4 step 3 needs to resolve the transient tracer transport process and costs between 14 s and 3 5 h depending on the flow characteristics for the realization a fracture flow model involving 50 000 realizations costs more than 40 000 core hours necessitating hpc power for a comprehensive study involving many models we then use a rejection sampling method to analyze the stochastic tracer modeling results in terms of the 90 confidence intervals of the simulated tracer breakthrough curves and the uncertainty quantification of model parameters the procedure of the rejection sampling is described in sun and durlofsky 2017 the main steps are 1 generate a random variable p from a uniform distribution within the range 0 1 2 accept m as a posterior realization if p l m s l where m is a parameter set l m is the likelihood function and s l is the maximum of the likelihood function the likelihood function l m is defined as 1 l m c e x p 1 2 r m where c is a normalization constant r m is a function evaluating the fitness between the simulated and measured tracer breakthrough curves sun and durlofsky 2017 used the sum of the square error as r m in their analysis however in the present study we found the following function captures the most essential characteristics of the tracer btcs and therefore is used as r m in our analysis 2 r 1 σ e 2 c p sim c p mea 1 2 t sim t mea 1 2 t l sim t l mea 1 2 t r sim t r mea 1 2 where σ e is the standard deviation of measurement errors note that we assume the measurement errors to be independent identically distributed gaussian random variables for subsequent analysis σ e is assumed to be 0 3 the two superscripts sim and mea denote the results from simulation and measurement respectively cp and t are the magnitude of the peak concentration and the corresponding arrival time t l and t r are the two times before left of and after right of the peak respectively of the half peak magnitude this equation compares four parameters controlling the shape of a tracer breakthrough curve to find peaks from a simulated tracer btc we adopt the find peak function of the scipy signal processing toolbox in python scipy signal find peak which can screen out non prominent peaks jones et al 2001 as shown in fig 2 each measured tracer btc has only one peak however a simulated tracer btc may have multiple peaks we directly extend the misfit calculation method to a simulated btc with multiple peak concentrations by applying eq 2 to every peak on the simulated tracer btc and then summing the calculated misfit values together this leads to high misfit values for those realizations naturally penalizing the realizations with multiple concentration peaks also note that for the hydraulic fracture both the tracer btcs at e1 phf and e1 ot need to be quantified and we sum the misfits for e1 phf and e1 ot together as the total misfit for the natural fracture we only calculate the misfit for the tracer btc at e1 pnf we first perform stochastic modeling for the hydraulic fracture according to the aforementioned workflow the realization that yields the smallest total misfit is selected to attain the time concentration curves along the leakage interface with which we then perform the stochastic modeling for the natural fracture using the same workflow 4 results of the stochastic modeling for the hydraulic fracture 4 1 relationship between the total misfit and individual parameters we start the analysis with the relatively simple uniform aperture scenario with nine parameters for the hydraulic fracture approximately 50 000 realizations were performed for each tracer test and the scatter plots between individual parameters and the total misfit are shown in fig 5 note that only the scatter plots for w θ α l and p l are shown in fig 5 and those for the other parameters can be found in fig s1 in supplementary material the total misfit r varies in a wide range and fig 5 only shows the realizations with a total misfit smaller than 104 according to eq 4 if the differences of the four variables c p t t l and t r between simulation and measurement all equal 15 then the calculated misfit is 0 09 and the base 10 logarithm of the total misfit for the two tracer btcs e1 phf and e1 ot is 0 74 as shown in fig 5 most of the performed realizations show a total misfit much larger than 0 74 and fail to reasonably match the measured tracer btcs at e1 phf and e1 ot simultaneously the nine parameters show different effects on the total misfit we observe a strong dependence of the total misfit on aperture w sink location θ longitudinal dispersivity α l and leakage interface location p l for these parameters we are able to identify concentrated value ranges as shown by the 90 confidence intervals in the scatter plots in fig 5 according to the accepted parameter sets from the rejection sampling procedure while for the other parameters such a concentrated value range cannot be obtained from the satisfactory realizations accepted by the rejection sampling procedure we calculate the 90 confidence intervals for tracer breakthrough curves at e1 phf and e1 ot shadings in fig 5 to compare with the field tracer measurements red and blue dots in fig 5 the results of the realization with the smallest total misfit solid lines in fig 5 are also shown the comparison indicates that the measured tracer breakthrough curves at e1 phf and e1 ot are successfully reproduced simultaneously we use the parameter values from the realization with the smallest total misfit as the best estimates for these parameters table 3 4 2 sensitivities of individual parameters the sobol total sensitivity index is a measurement of the contribution of each parameter to the variance of the total misfit sobol 1993 and can be used to identify critical parameters that dominate the tracer transport process as shown in fig 6 the sobol total sensitivity indices show similar patterns for the six tracer tests the tracer transport process in the hydraulic fracture is dominated by the aperture w and sink location θ while fracture extents described by a 1 and a 2 leakage rate q l and the length of the leakage interface described by l l actually show little effects especially for the tracer tests on 26 october 1 7 8 and 14 november as a result the uncertainties in w and θ are appropriately constrained from the stochastic tracer modeling while the uncertainties in a 1 a 2 q l and l l cannot be further constrained the result of sobol sensitivity analysis is consistent with the scatter plots in fig 5 in that the more sensitive the parameter the easier it is to identify an optimal value for the parameter 4 3 heterogeneous aperture scenario previous experimental observations and theoretical studies indicate that flow channeling is a common phenomenon in fracture networks becker and shapiro 2000 fu et al 2016 guo et al 2016 moreno et al 1988 hawkins et al 2017b although the uniform aperture scenario is able to match the measured tracer breakthrough curves at e1 phf and e1 ot simultaneously it could be illuminating to further model the tracer tests under the heterogeneous aperture scenario where flow channeling is generally much stronger than that in the uniform aperture scenario here we take the tracer test on 31 october as an example for which 400 000 realizations were modeled fig 7 similarly we only show the scatter plots for aperture parameters w σ and cl longitudinal dispersivity α l sink location θ and leakage interface location p l in fig 7 a and scatter plots for other parameters are provided in fig s2 in supplementary material compared with the uniform aperture scenario the heterogeneous aperture scenario involves more parameters and a larger number of satisfactory realizations obtained from the rejection sampling procedure can match the tracer breakthrough curves at e1 phf and e1 ot simultaneously as shown in fig 7 b however the heterogeneous aperture fields for these satisfactory realizations are quite different from each other fig 7 c although the sobol total sensitivity analysis shows that the average aperture w and sink location θ are dominant parameters under the heterogeneous aperture scenario fig 8 the values of the aperture parameters w σ and cl cannot be constrained as under the uniform aperture scenario however a concentrated value range for θ can still be identified from the obtained satisfactory realizations which is consistent with the results under the uniform aperture scenario table 3 the stochastic model seems to be overfitted under the heterogeneous aperture scenario for the available tracer measurements 5 results of the stochastic modeling for the natural fracture for each tracer test we select the realization with the smallest total misfit under the uniform aperture scenario parameters listed in fig 5 to attain the necessary upper stream information to perform stochastic modeling of flow and transport processes in the natural fracture the information includes the leakage rate q l leakage interface location and length p l and l l as well as the time concentration curves for each leakage element 5 1 uniform aperture scenario similar to the modeling of the hydraulic fracture we start the analysis of the natural fracture with the uniform aperture scenario since only three parameters are involved w θ and l we performed around 15 000 realizations for each tracer test the scatter plots of the total misfit as a function of the three parameters are shown in fig s3 in supplementary material fig 9 compares the tracer breakthrough curve at e1 pnf from measurement and the realization with the smallest total misfit although the misfit results clearly favor a specific range for w the tracer breakthrough curves at e1 pnf cannot be matched to a reasonable level the modeling results for 26 october tracer test in fig 9 indicate an average aperture of 0 1 mm while the core logs retrieved from e1 p indicate that the aperture in the natural fracture is several millimeters therefore the uniform aperture scenario is unlikely to correctly simulate the tracer transport process in the natural fracture 5 2 heterogeneous aperture scenario we then assume a spatially autocorrelated heterogeneous aperture distribution in the natural fracture around 50 000 realizations were performed for each tracer test fig 10 many satisfactory realizations that match the tracer breakthrough curve at e1 pnf almost equally well are obtained from the rejection sampling procedure and the corresponding parameters in these satisfactory realizations span relatively large ranges in the parameter space as shown by the red circles in the scatter plots in fig 10 scatter plots for other parameters are provided in fig s4 in supplementary material we also show the aperture distribution in the natural fracture from one of the satisfactory realizations and more results can be found in fig s5 in supplementary material for tracer tests between 26 october and 8 november the 90 confidence interval of the tracer breakthrough curve at e1 pnf agree well with the measured tracer data however for the tracer test on 14 november due to the lack of tracer concentration measurements beyond 12 h due to field operational constraints the fitting of the tracer breakthrough curve is difficult and the corresponding 90 confidence interval indicates a large uncertainty 6 discussions 6 1 consistency of stochastic modeling results with other field observations the following field observations were not used to constrain the stochastic models however the agreement between the modeling results and these observations serves as additional validation of the modeling work 6 1 1 aperture of the natural fracture although the aperture of the natural fracture cannot be constrained from the stochastic modeling results a rough estimate of its value can be obtained from the aperture distributions in fig 10 according to the satisfactory realizations for tracer tests between 31 october and 14 november the average aperture is approximately 1 3 mm which is in agreement with the value several millimeters estimated from core segments corresponding to the five fracture intersections in fig 1 a the fact that no uniform aperture distribution in the natural fracture could fit the tracer data indicates that flow in the natural fracture is highly heterogeneous this is consistent with the observation from the five core segments in fig 1 a which show very different forms in terms of kinematic aperture and the mineral fillings 6 1 2 location of the sink on the hydraulic fracture an interesting finding from the stochastic modeling is that fluid and tracer leaked out of the hydraulic fracture from its west boundary meaning that another natural fracture that is not explicitly included in our fracture network model was likely to intersect the west boundary of the hydraulic fracture the existence of this natural fracture was confirmed in a later stimulation activity at the 43 m interval in e1 i on 20 december 2018 during which seismic events showed an apparent tendency to propagate northward and intersected the west boundary of the hydraulic fracture stimulated at the 50 m interval 6 2 inferring the evolution of fracture flow characteristics during the circulation tests direct observations of the measured outflow rates table 1 and tracer breakthrough curves fig 2 indicate that the fracture flow field changed several times during the water circulation test from 24 october to 20 november 2018 two major changes can be identified one taking place between tracer tests on 26 and 31 october and the other one between tracer tests on 1 and 7 november by assuming that fracture flow models that reasonably fit the tracer data can represent the actual states of the fracture flow system we could infer the nature of these changes from the stochastic modeling results related to the first major change the fitted aperture for the tracer test on 26 october is significantly larger than that for the five subsequent tests according to the results in table 3 both microseismic and dts temperature measurements indicated significant eastward hydraulic fracture propagation during the 800 ml min rate injection from 29 to 30 october this seems to indicate that prior to this propagation the hydraulic fracture was dilated to a larger aperture to accommodate the 400 ml min circulation rate before 29 october the hydraulic fracture propagation between 29 and 30 october enabled stronger hydraulic connection between the hydraulic fracture and the natural fracture system thereby accommodating the injection rate without requiring much dilation of the fracture the second major change was likely caused by the redistribution of outflows among production and monitoring wells resulting from stimulation induced damage to e1 ot sealing the aperture of the hydraulic fracture remained almost constant between 1 and 7 november table 3 before the damage to e1 ot fluid and tracer had a strong tendency to flow in the direction from e1 i to e1 phf due to the presence of the leaky interface and high outflow rate at e1 phf therefore tracer breakthrough was earlier and peak magnitude was larger at e1 phf than that at e1 ot on 1 november however after e1 ot was damaged by stimulation on 6 november outflow rate increased significantly at e1 ot and decreased at e1 phf and e1 pnf and fluid and tracer became easier to flow in the direction from e1 i to e1 ot as a result tracer breakthrough was earlier and peak magnitude was larger at e1 ot than that at e1 phf on 7 november although the heterogeneous aperture scenario for the natural fracture tends to over fit the tracer data and the fitting results are nonunique we could still gain critical insights into the changes in the natural fracture s flow field from the commonalities among the satisfactory fitting results the satisfactory realizations statistically suggest that the average aperture w increased from 26 october to 14 november as shown in fig 11 a particularly remarkable increase took place between 26 october and 31 october likely a result of the hydraulic fracture propagation between 29 and 30 october we could not point to a specific explanation for the increased aperture it could be caused by an expansion of the active flow area on the fracture thereby engaging more flow channels with larger apertures or some geochemical causes the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this work 6 3 effect of tracer data quality and quantity on stochastic modeling stochastic tracer modeling is inherently an inversion process to infer 3d flow and transport characteristics from time series tracer data the quality and quantity of available tracer data are essential for this inversion process based on the results of this study we analyze the effect of tracer data quality and quantity on stochastic modeling first any incompleteness in tracer breakthrough curves causes ambiguity in the interpretation of stochastic modeling results as shown in fig 5 a due to the lack of the ascending segment of the tracer breakthrough curve at e1 ot the peak arrival time and peak magnitude cannot be used to accurately evaluate the fitness between the measured and simulated tracer breakthrough curve which undoubtedly caused ambiguity in the selection of satisfactory realizations on the other hand as shown in fig 10 f the breakthrough curve at e1 pnf does not have tail data beyond 12 h as a result the stochastic modeling results show a large uncertainty in the simulated tracer breakthrough curve second sampling tracer concentrations at multiple locations in the flow network is crucial for resolving the spatial distribution of flow in the fractures in this study there are two tracer breakthrough curves e1 phf and e1 ot available for the hydraulic fracture and a satisfactory realization needs to match the two breakthrough curves simultaneously if the misfit function had only accounted for one breakthrough curve then the stochastic modeling results could no longer constrain model parameters take the tracer test on 31 october as an example had only one tracer breakthrough curve been matched either at e1 phf or e1 ot we would have obtained more than 30 satisfactory realizations fig 12 shows the results from four of these realizations among these satisfactory realizations the values of the four critical parameters w θ α l and p l vary in large ranges and cannot be constrained such as in fig 5 it is worth mentioning that although some previous studies treated c dots as a conservative tracer hawkins et al 2017b mattson et al 2019b sorption isotherm tests from the egs collab project indicated that c dots exhibited a langmuir type sorption to crushed phyllite rocks the host rock of the collab experiment 1 test bed neupane et al 2020 the sorption of c dots to surrounding rock formations during the six tracer tests modeled in this study might have been a reason for the discrepancy between the water recovery ratio and the c dots mass recovery ratio mattson et al 2019 causing inevitable uncertainties in our stochastic modeling results 7 conclusion in this study we carried out stochastic modeling for six conservative tracer tests performed during a series of circulation and fracture stimulation experiments spanning nearly one month at the egs collab experiment 1 testbed numerous realizations were performed to simulate tracer transport processes in a fracture network model realizations that successfully reproduce the measured tracer breakthrough curves were obtained to gain insight into the flow system as well as its evolution at the testbed the present study demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of stochastic tracer modeling for the characterization of fractured reservoirs in subsurface the results in this study provide important insights into the flow and transport characteristics in a hydraulically stimulated fracture network including the critical parameters interaction between hydraulic and natural fractures as well as the evolution of flow and transport processes in the fracture network in response to various experiments such knowledge for a real world reservoir can facilitate reservoir design and operation improve reservoir thermal

4954,runoff in many locations within the canadian prairies is dominated by intermittent fill and spill between depressions as a result many basins have varying fractions of their areas connected to their outlets due to changing depressional storage the objective of this research is to determine the causes of the relationships between water storage and the connected fraction of depression dominated prairie basins it is hypothesized that the shapes of the relationship curves are influenced by both the spatial and frequency distributions of depressional storage three sets of numerical experiments are presented to test the hypothesis the first set of experiments demonstrates that where the number of depressions is small their size and spatial distributions are important in controlling the relationship between the volume of depressional storage and the connected fraction of a basin as the number of depressions is increased the areal fractions of the largest depressions decrease which reduces the importance of the spatial distribution of depressions the second set of experiments demonstrates that the curve enveloping the connected fraction of a basin can be derived from the frequency distribution of depression areas and scaling relationships between the area volume and catchment area of the depressions when the area of the largest depression is no greater than approximately 5 of the total the third set of experiments demonstrates that the presence of a single large depression can strongly influence the relationship between the depressional storage and the connected fraction of a basin depending on the relative size of the large depression and its location within the basin a single depression containing 30 of the total depressional area located near the outlet was shown to cause a basin to be nearly endorheic a similar depression near the top of a basin was demonstrated not to fill and was therefore unable to contribute flows the implications of the findings for developing hydrological models of large prairie drainage basins are discussed keywords fill and spill runoff depressional storage wetlands hysteresis contributing area canadian prairies 1 introduction the prairie pothole region ppr of the canadian prairies and northern us great plains mann 1974 is characterized by the presence of millions of depressions locally known as wetlands sloughs or potholes which store water from direct precipitation surface runoff and the melt of trapped windblown snow the extent of the ppr is shown in fig 1 when the depressions are filled with water they can connect and conduct water overland and may eventually connect to a stream channel in canada much of this region is designated as including non effective areas for streamflow implying that it does not contribute flow to a stream channel for events with return periods of two years or shorter government of government of canada 2013 the spatial distribution of the non effective region is mapped in fig 1 regions designated as non contributing in the usa baker 2011 are not plotted because they are defined differently prior research has demonstrated that the connected fractions of basins in this region which are dominated by depressional storage i e the basin fractions which are connected to the outlet and can therefore contribute flow are variable and depend on the state of water storage in the depressions shaw et al 2012b stichling and blackwell 1957 this is a form of hydrological connectivity bracken and croke 2007 and is related to other forms of hydrological connectivity as discussed by bracken et al 2013 unlike the hydrological connectivities of hillslopes which are difficult to observe mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 and therefore to model the hydrological connectivities of prairie basins dominated by depressional storage can be inferred directly from the states of water in individual depressions any successful hydrological model of the region must be able to simulate the behaviours of complexes of prairie depressions to model their effects on the fractions of basins contributing flow the simulation of prairie depressions is further complicated and made more necessary by the effects of artificial drainage and climate change which are changing the responses of basins in the region dumanski et al 2015 1 1 terminology this paper follows the terminology of van der kamp et al 2016 the term depression refers to any local topographic minimum capable of holding water whether it contains water or not the depressions are similar to geographically isolated wetlands giws which are also depressions surrounded by uplands tiner 2003 although the use of the term geographically isolated for prairie potholes has been questioned mushet et al 2015 furthermore prairie depressions are not necessarily wetlands which are defined by van der kamp et al 2016 to be persistent and stable landscape features often denoted by the presence of hydric soils the water within a depression is referred to as the pond each pond has a maximum possible volume area and depth which occur when the depression is completely filled as discussed by leibowitz et al 2016 when water is added to a region with depressions the ponds may merge together in this paper depressions are designated by simulating their filling with water therefore two or more ponds which merge are considered to be as single pond filling a single depression the maximum area and volume of water in a pond are therefore equal to the area and volume respectively of the depression which contains it the contributing fraction of a river or lake drainage basin is that fraction of the basin s area which is actively contributing flow to an outlet at a given instant the connected fraction of a basin is the fraction of the basin for which connections exist to the outlet whether or not water is actively flowing both cases require connectivity all the way to the outlet i e all of the depressions on a path to the outlet must be completely filled because this research is concerned with the representing the states of basins it is the connected fractions of the basin which are simulated herein a model of the connected fraction may be incorporated within a hydrological model which by calculating runoff is then able to simulate the actively contributing fraction of a basin this paper also uses the terminology of shook et al 2015 for runoff which is defined as water movement as overland or shallow interflow which may or may not reach a drainage system rather than the more common definition as an areal depth of stream discharge the two uses are synonymous only when all of the depressions in a basin are connected to the outlet i e when the connected fraction is 1 and all runoff can reach the basin outlet the region which can contribute runoff directly to a given depression without passing through any other depression is defined as that depression s catchment the connected area of a depression dominated drainage basin is comprised of the areas of the connected depressions and of their catchments this paper frequently references the basin fractions of depressional storage connected area and largest pond area to normalize their values the fractional depressional storage is the total volume of water stored in basin ponds at any time divided by the maximum possible volume of storage in the basin which is the total volume of the depressions the fractional connected area is the area of the basin connected to the outlet divided by the basin area the areal fraction of the largest depression is the area of the largest depression in a basin divided by the sum of all of the depressional areas 1 2 hysteresis in prairie basin state variables much of the modelling of the effects of depressional storage on hydrology has used models which combine the storages of individual depressions into a single unit usually by modelling them as a frequency distributions of storage evenson et al 2015 golden et al 2014 hossain 2017 mann 1974 although lumped methods can give good modelling results they do not give any information about the effects of individual depressions particularly their spatial distribution more seriously such methods cannot incorporate the effects of hysteresis between basin state variables hysteresis has been well documented in hydrological processes at all scales o kane and flynn 2007 spence 2010 the connected area fractions of depression dominated prairie basins have been shown to be non linearly and hysteretically related to water storage shook et al 2015 shook et al 2013 shook and pomeroy 2011 it has also been demonstrated that the relationship between the total volume of water stored within a basin and its surface area is also hysteretic shook and pomeroy 2011 the fundamental cause of the observed hysteresis in the basin scale state variables connected fraction and water surface area is the existence of thousands of states i e the storages of water in the depressions within each basin apart from the end states when all depressions are empty or filled any total storage of water can be the sum of an infinite number of individual states of the water in the ponds the processes which affect the storage of water behave very differently in positive additive and negative subtractive directions additions of water may come from direct precipitation melting of windblown snow drifts and runoff from uplands adjacent to a depression as well as by water transfer from other depressions through surface or shallow subsurface flows substantial deep groundwater inflows to or discharges from depressions are uncommon in most prairie basins hayashi et al 2016 due to the presence of aquitards caused by heavy clay till sub soil deposits woo and rowsell 1993 and as evidenced by the common lack of base flows in prairie streams niazi et al 2017 found the average recharge of a small watershed at the western extreme of the canadian ppr to be 5 3 mm y by chloride mass balance and 5 15 mm y from baseflow estimates which are very small fractions of the mean annual precipitation of 483 mm it should be noted that these recharge depths would actually be considered to be quite large in much of the ppr that the basin in question was not completely underlain by glacial till and that the depth of the surficial till was very shallow in many parts of the basin hayashi and farrow 2014 removals of water from depressions are primarily caused by open water evaporation transpiration from the surrounding vegetation and surface outflows when the depressions are filled as well as having very different magnitudes the additive and subtractive fluxes act upon very different areas of the basin whilst evaporation and direct precipitation act on the pond surfaces runoff originates from the uplands surrounding the depression and blowing snow may be transported from outside of the depression catchment as snow can be blown over drainage divides furthermore addition of water causes ponds to enlarge and to merge whilst removal of water causes ponds to disintegrate and for the smaller ponds to disappear shook et al 2013 and zhang et al 2009 demonstrated that the frequency distributions of pond areas change differently when water is added and removed therefore the fluxes are not reversible nor are their effects on the spatial and frequency distributions of pond volumes and areas shook et al 2015 demonstrated that the hysteresis between the storages of water and the connected fractions of prairie basins was instrumental in affecting the shapes of the probability distribution functions of stream flows it is evident that as soon as the elevation of the pond is below that of its depression s outlet the depression is disconnected as are all depressions upstream because evaporation affects all of the ponds in a basin it is also evident that all depressions will become disconnected at approximately the same time i e as soon as there is evaporation following a runoff event causing the basin connected fraction to become zero some of the first modelling of the variable connected fractions of prairie basins was done by shaw 2009 however only very small numbers of ponds were examined and only the increase in the contributing fraction with increasing storage was simulated shaw et al 2012b examined the increase in contributing area at st denis during a runoff event shaw et al 2012a extended the work to larger numbers of ponds again for increases in storage and contributing fractions shook and pomeroy 2011 and shook et al 2013 extended the work to use many more ponds and larger basins as well as decreasing storage situations 1 3 research objectives the variable connected fractions are defining state properties of prairie basins and strongly influence the runoff response to snow melt and precipitation and overall hydrology of the region prior modelling research has often been concerned with quantifying the effects of changes in depressional storage on the hydrological responses of canadian prairie basins ameli and creed 2019 pomeroy et al 2014 the objective of this research is to determine the cause of the shapes of the connected fraction depression storage volume relationships it is hypothesized that the relationships are influenced by both the spatial and frequency distributions of depressional storage the intent is to quantify the effects of both three sets of analyses are presented the first analyses are to determine the effects of the spatial arrangement of depressions on the rising limb of the hysteresis curves the second analyses determine the influence of the frequency distributions of depressional areas on the curve shape the third analyses examine the combined effects of the size and location of large depressions 2 materials and methods 2 1 research locations the simulations in this study are based on two instrumented and intensively studied prairie pothole basins in saskatchewan st denis research basin sdrb and smith creek research basin scrb whose locations are shown in fig 1 the basins have very different topographies and histories and so represent the variability of drainage basins within the ppr the areas of the sub basins and the number of depressions areas 25 m2 are given in table 1 maps of the basins are shown in fig 2 sdrb is located near saskatoon sk and has been studied intensively for more than 30 years the basin has relatively high relief for the ppr as it is a knob and kettle moraine with slopes varying from 10 to 15 miller et al 1985 the basin has never undergone artificial drainage the basin is ungauged which is not surprising as there is no permanent natural drainage system although some ephemeral channels do exist brannen et al 2015 the entire sdrb lies within the non effective regions plotted in fig 1 and has never been known to discharge flows during the period of study the area of sdrb is approximately 22 km2 a lidar based digital elevation model dem is available for the basin fig 2a shows the depression areas plotted in blue which were determined using the wetland dem ponding model shook and pomeroy 2011 which is described below sub basins may be defined based on the regions draining into the depressions sdrb drains from north to south the larger of the two sub basins considered in this study is defined as draining into pond 90 and was studied and modelled by mann 1974 this sub basin has an area of 10 3 km2 and drains from the overall basin surface divide to a point just above a very large depression the smallest basin was studied by brannen 2015 and brannen et al 2015 so it is designated as brannen basin the total area of the sub basin is approximately 1 2 km2 brannen et al 2015 brannen basin differs from the other two basins as it does not include the headwaters and therefore can receive discharges from upstream note that the outlet of brannen basin is the same as that of the basin draining into pond 90 scrb is a low relief basin in southeastern saskatchewan with a gross drainage area of approximately is 400 km2 and slopes between 2 and 5 pomeroy et al 2014 unlike sdrb scrb has a conventional drainage system with a stream gauge operated by the water service of canada wsc 05me007 smith creek near marchwell which has been operational since 1975 approximately 87 of the basin was classified as being non effective by the prairie farm rehabilitation administration pfra government of government of canada 2013 scrb has been drained very extensively since at least 1958 dumanski et al 2015 and has been studied extensively and modelled by the centre for hydrology since 2008 brunet and westbrook 2012 fang et al 2010 minke and westbrook 2010 minke et al 2010 pomeroy et al 2014 shook et al 2013 lidar taken in 2008 showed more than 10 000 depressions having areas greater than 100 m2 although the number and sizes of the depressions have since been reduced by drainage fig 2b shows the arrangement of sub basins within the basin as well as the depression areas determined from the lidar dem using arcgis as described by pomeroy et al 2014 because the execution time was too large wdpm described below was not run for sub basin 1 although the model was run successfully for sub basins 2 through 5 the basin drains from north west to south east i e from sub basin 1 to sub basin 5 2 2 models two models the wetland digital elevation model dem ponding model wdpm and the pothole cascade model pcm are used in this study in this study the models apply spatially uniform fluxes of water to representations of depressional storage in prairie basins although actual fluxes greatly vary in both space and time the intent of the study is to determine the how the geometry of depressional storage affects the responses of prairie basins 2 2 1 the wetland digital elevation model dem ponding model wdpm shook and pomeroy 2011 and shook et al 2013 developed the wdpm which applies water to a dem and routes the flow overland using the algorithm of shapiro and westervelt 1992 the wdpm source code is available at https github com centreforhydrology wdpm compiled versions of the model and more supporting documentation are available at https research groups usask ca hydrology modelling wdpm php the model has been used by several researchers other than the authors to simulate the variable spatial distributions of water within prairie basins kiss 2018 schellenberg 2017 thapa et al 2019 wdpm can be used to estimate the connected fraction of a basin having any state of distribution of water a small depth of water 1 mm is added and the basin is drained the fraction of the applied depth of water which exits the model is therefore the fraction of the basin which is connected to the outlet as shown in fig 3 when run repeatedly for a prairie basin wdpm produces hysteresis loops between the connected fraction and the volume of water storage the plotted loops are for complete filling of the storage from the initially empty state followed by complete removal of water the hysteresis loops could not be verified experimentally but the changes in the frequency distributions of water areas produced by the model have been validated against remotely sensed water areas by shook et al 2013 and armstrong et al 2013 wdpm was used to determine the sizes of depressions in all of the sub basins examined by repeatedly adding simulated water until the basins were filled in all cases lidar derived dems with resolutions of 5 m were used wdpm simulations showed that sdrb has approximately 126 depression per km2 the mean value for scrb is 216 given that the total areal fraction of all depressions is slightly greater in sdrb the mean depression area is also greater in sdrb than in scrb table 1 also shows the depressional area fraction i e the fraction of each basin within depressions st denis basin has a much greater fraction of its area 0 272 as depressions than any other basin 2 2 2 the pothole cascade model pcm because wdpm is too slow and inflexible it cannot easily simulate changes in drainage to be a component of a hydrological model the simplified conceptual pcm was developed the pcm source code and documentation are available at https github com centreforhydrology pcm pcm applies spatially uniform fluxes to a set of model depressions which are selected to have similar volume area scaling properties frequency distributions and patterns of connection to those in the basin being simulated shook et al 2013 pcm is similar to the model of shaw 2009 which also applies fluxes to simulated depressions however pcm is much faster allowing the use of much larger numbers of depressions and also simulates the removal of water from the depressions although pcm cannot reproduce the aggregation and disaggregation of ponds it does simulate the connection and disconnection of depressional areas and produced connected fraction volume fraction hysteresis loops with shapes similar to those produced by wdpm as are shown in fig 3 the addition of the pcm algorithm to a physically based hydrological model of scrb was shown to dramatically improve the model s performance pomeroy et al 2014 unfortunately the pcm algorithm is difficult to use in practice as pcm requires each pond to be represented it dramatically increases the number of parameters and state variables required by a model mapping the connectivities of large numbers of depressions in a basin is very difficult pomeroy et al 2014 simplified this task by only using a small number of depressions 46 to represent all of the depressions in each sub basin of scrb the effects of using small numbers of simulated depressions were identified by shook and pomeroy 2011 but were not well quantified pcm is used in this research to investigate the effects of the arrangement of depressional storage on the hysteresis between water storage and the fraction of the basin which is connected to the outlet the model s parametric requirements are modest consisting of simple text files listing a the volume b the area and c the connectivity i e the draining destination of each depression the catchment area of each depression is computed from the depressional area as described below the area ap m2 and volume vp m3 of each pond are modelled as paraboloids using the relationships of hayashi and van der kamp 2000 1 a p sh 2 p where s p constants h pond maximum depth m therefore the volume of a pond is function of its surface area 2 v p a p h 1 2 p hayashi and van der kamp 2000 found great variation in the values of s and p among depressions in several prairie basins all pcm simulations used values of p 1 72 for ponds with depressions smaller than 10 000 m2 and p 3 33 for the larger ones which were used by pomeroy et al 2014 and were derived for scrb although these values provide some representation of the effect of depression area on p and therefore h they do not reproduce all of the scaling nor the natural variability in the parameters based on the assigned value of p and the depression area and volume the values of s and h were computed for each depression by iteratively solving eqs 1 and 2 the depression areas were determined by gis analyses of smith creek sub basin 5 as described in pomeroy et al 2014 shook et al 2013 found power law relationships between the areas of depressions ad m2 and their catchments ac m2 3 a c aa d b where a and b are constants the magnitudes of b being less than 1 for the three prairie basins examined for smith creek sub basin 5 a 31 3 b 0 738 this relationship was used to calculate the catchment area for each depression simulated the depression volumes vd m3 at scrb were found to fit a power law relationship with the depression areas as was also described in pomeroy et al 2014 4 v d ca d d where d 1 211 as the volume and catchment area of a given depression are functions of its area it is usually easier to estimate the relative size and therefore importance of a depression from its area than from the volume therefore areas provide a convenient way of categorizing depressions because the exponent of eq 4 is greater than 1 and that of eq 3 is less than 1 the depression volume increases more rapidly than does the area while the catchment area increases more slowly the implications of these scaling relationships are discussed below the model forcings are spatially uniform additions and removal of water pcm uses a constant factor in this case set to 1 so as to give the maximum possible connected fractions to calculate the runoff from the depression and its catchment each addition of water is applied to all the depressions when a depression is filled any excess water is routed to the specified connecting depression and to all subsequent connected depressions when a depression is not full the connection with the downstream depression is broken so no water is routed as with wdpm the connected fractions of the simulated basins were determined by adding 1 mm of water and calculating the fraction of water exiting the model each execution of pcm only applies a single depth of water addition or removal to the set of depressions as is discussed below the pcm simulations required many executions of the

methods of quantifying it phillips et al 2011 used network analyses to map the connectivity of lakes in northern canada which share some similarity with the ppr in that both regions are flat and poorly drained rains et al 2015 used network graphing to describe the arrangement of giws herein network graphs are plotted of the arrangement of depressions as shown in fig 4 with the depressions as the vertices and the potential overland flow connections as the edges all network graphs in this paper are plotted using the r package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 the outlet from a given basin is represented by the red vertex in each plot the spatial arrangement of depressional storage was quantified using a variation of the basin width function which quantifies the number of tributary streams as a function of the flow distance from the outlet the basin width function has been linked to the shape of basin hydrographs by researchers since kirkby 1976 when applied to depressional storage the width function is simply the histogram of the number of depressions vertices versus their distance in edges from the outlet in a basin where many depressions are located near the outlet i e where water does not have to flow through many depressions to reach it the width function will be skewed rightward if many depressions are located near the outer reaches of the basin the function will be skewed leftward if many depressions are located in the middle of the basin with few near the outlet and in the outer reaches of the basin then the width function will be heap shaped to allow comparison among basins with varying numbers of depressions the widths are converted to densities by dividing by the total numbers of depressions in the basins the graph of the depressions at brannen basin sdrb is plotted in fig 4a their arrangement appears to be quite random as shown by shook and pomeroy 2011 the depressions in each sub basin at scrb are arranged in tributaries that drain in parallel to the stream channel therefore all tributary sets of depressions in this basin can be regarded as draining directly to the outlet it is believed that the structured arrangement of the tributaries is due in part to the high degree of artificial drainage in the basin dumanski et al 2015 the minimum number of depressions that could represent the connectivity estimated for this basin is 46 as described in pomeroy et al 2014 arranged as shown in fig 4b as discussed by phillips et al 2011 in the context of lakes in northern canada large depressions act as gatekeepers preventing upstream flows from contributing to the outlet until the large depressions are filled the filling curve for brannen basin plotted in fig 3a strongly resembles the filling curve plotted by shaw et al 2012a in their fig 6 c which shows a small sub basin dominated by the gatekeeping of a single large depression at the outlet the network width function of brannen basin plotted in fig 4c indicates that the largest fractions of depressions are located near the middle of the basin however the spatial distribution of depressional maximum water areas plotted in fig 5 a shows that there are several large depressions located very close to the outlet which cause the gatekeeping function seen in the plots in fig 3a where the connected area fraction is zero until approximately 75 of the depressional storage has been filled apart from these large depressions there does not appear to be any relationship between the sizes and the network locations of the depressions the network width function of scrb sub basin 5 plotted in fig 4d shows that most of the depressions are located far from the outlet as would be expected from a branching arrangement the plot of depressional area vs network distance for scrb in fig 5b show little relationship between the size of a depression and its location within the basin the location is essentially random in this case the depression locations are indexed by the horton strahler order of an overlaid drainage network as described in pomeroy et al 2014 which is another measure of the network distance the horton strahler order was used because of the difficulty in identifying the connectivities of a very large number of depressions the filling curves for scrb sub basin 5 plotted in fig 2b are very linear rather than showing the stair step arrangement of the curves in fig 6 of shaw et al 2012a the number of depressions used in a pcm simulation has been demonstrated to strongly affect the smoothness of the filling curve shook et al 2013 therefore it is very likely that some of the difference between the shapes of the filling curves at sdrb and scrb is due to the difference in the numbers of depressions in the basins 2 3 1 modelling the effects of depression arrangement the effects of the frequency and spatial distributions of depressions on the shapes of the filling curves were investigated by generating synthetic networks of depressions and then using pcm to find the connected fractions as the networks were filled synthetic networks allow the depressions to be in any desired arrangement allowing realistic or completely artificial networks the effects of the number and spatial distribution of depressions on the shapes of the filling curves were investigated by generating synthetic networks of depressions and then using pcm to find the connected fractions as the networks were filled networks were created with 46 92 184 368 and 736 depressions i e 1 2 4 8 and 16 sets of 46 depressions as was used by the original pcm model for scrb for each of the network arrangements each set of 46 depressions was connected separately to the outlet giving the complete set the same width function as the original 46 depressions three types of storage network graphs were simulated 1 deterministic 2 random and 3 direct the deterministic graphs use sets of 46 depressions in 4 tree based arrangements shown in fig 6a d the network width functions of these basins plotted in fig 7 a through d place the depressions at varying distances from the outlet the tree1 network is distributed very similarly to the scrb network with the depression density rapidly increasing with network distance the density plots of networks tree2 and tree4 show that these networks are intermediate between the distributions of the scrb sub basin5 and brannen basin the tree3 network was created as a test of an extreme example of gatekeeping it is not intended to be realistic representation of a prairie basin the random graphs were generated using the r igraph package function sample pa varying the power parameter of the function allows the creation of graphs of varying sizes with very similar network width functions fig 6e plots the network generated for 46 depressions as plotted in fig 7e the network width density indicates that this method places a large fraction of the depressions adjacent to the middle of the basin similar to the distribution of brannen basin the direct network plotted in fig 6f connects each depression directly to the outlet there are no connections among the depressions so no depression can perform gatekeeping of upstream depressions therefore as plotted in fig 7f all of the depressions other than the outlet have the same distance from the outlet as the spatial distributions of depression areas at sdrb and scrb are generally random as shown in fig 5 the depression volumes and areas were distributed randomly among the networks twenty realizations were created for each of the networks i e the same set of depression parameters was assigned randomly over each model network 20 times the sequence of operations for modelling was 1 a set of depressions was selected with either 46 92 184 368 or 736 depressions i e with 1 2 4 8 or 16 sets of 46 depressions 2 an arrangement pattern was selected from the 6 depressional arrangement patterns tree1 tree2 tree3 tree4 random and direct 3 the depressions were assigned randomly to all positions in the arrangement 4 a small depth of water was added to the depressions and all of their catchments and allowed to run into the depressions or to exit the model 5 an additional 1 mm of water was added to the model and the fraction of the applied depth exiting the model was recorded as the connected fraction 6 steps 4 and 5 were repeated until all of the model depressions were filled and the connected fraction of the simulated basin was 1 together 118 additions of water were made additions of 1 through 10 mm were added by 1 mm followed by additions of 20 through 500 mm by 10 mm for a total of 59 additions followed by 59 additions of 1 mm 7 steps 3 through 6 were repeated with 20 different realizations of the random arrangement of the model depressions 8 steps 2 though 7 were repeated for all 6 depressional arrangement patterns 9 steps 1 through 8 were repeated for all 5 numbers of depressions steps 4 and 5 were performed by pcm all of the other steps were performed by r scripts which called the pcm model in total 70 800 pcm runs were made 118 additions of water 5 sets of depressions 6 arrangement patterns 20 realizations 2 4 frequency distributions of depression areas as described above it is believed that the frequency distribution of depression areas and therefore of their volumes and catchment areas influences the shapes of the connected fraction curves it would appear that the area frequency distribution within a given basin has two important components a the frequency distributions of all depressions and b the relative sizes of the largest depressions which strongly gatekeep it is therefore important to determine the effects of both components several researchers have found that pond areas and therefore presumably depression areas can be approximated by power law frequency distributions liu and schwartz 2011 shook et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 which is common in objects such as depressions which are fractals bertassello et al 2018 minke et al 2010 mekonnen et al 2014 demonstrated that integration of an assumed power law distribution of depressional volumes could produce single valued exponential curves for the contributing fractions of prairie basins when the algorithm pdmrof was employed for basins within the canadian ppr it improved the performance of the hydrological models mekonnen et al 2014 mengistu and spence 2016 however pdmrof does not explain the shapes of the hysteretic curves plotted in fig 3 as it produces a single valued function and pdmrof uses calibrated parameters rather than actual frequency distributions pdmrof also uses an assumed continuous distribution rather than discrete depressions most importantly pdmrof does not use a relationship between pond areas and volumes nor a relationship between the depression and catchment areas pareto ii distributions were fitted to all of the to all of the sdrb and sdrb depressional areas using the r package cosmos papalexiou and serinaldi 2020 papalexiou et al 2020 which is available at https cran r project org package cosmos sets of between 10 and 20 000 depressions with 10 000 realizations of each set were generated from the fitted distributions realizations resulting in maximum fractional depression areas greater than the maxima of the values for sdrb and scrb were eliminated in all cases more than 8 900 realizations were used for each set of depressions the areal fractions of the largest depressions are plotted against the number of depressions in each set in fig 8 for all of the sub basins at sdrb and scrb for both basins the median areal fraction decreases rapidly becoming fairly flat for sets of more than 5000 depressions with the scrb median values being consistently smaller than the sdrb values the measured values of the largest depression areal fractions plotted as red dots are much greater at sdrb than at scrb this is only partly due to the small numbers of depressions at sdrb sdrb has more depressions than scrb sub basin 5 as is shown in table 1 evidently the size distribution of depression areas at sdrb also results in relatively large values of the areal fractions therefore the relative area of the largest depression will depend on the size of the basin and the overall frequency distribution of depression areas as well as random chance 2 4 1 modelling the effects of the depression area frequency distribution the cause of the near linear rising limb connected area curves plotted in fig 3b for sub basin 5 scrb were investigated by filling sets of simulated depressions with similar properties in these simulations the filling of each set of depressions was effected by an r script which iteratively applied depths of water to the depressions and their catchments until all of the depressions were filled the simulation was therefore very similar to those of the direct pcm simulations in that each depression was assumed to be connected to the outlet as soon as it was filled as demonstrated by eq 3 the relationships between the areas of depressions and their catchments can be described by power laws although shook et al 2013 showed that the relationships have considerable scatter particularly for small depressions depression basins were modelled by generating a bivarate copula from the fitted marginal distributions of the areas of the depressions and their catchments using the r packages copula hofert et al 2018 and vinecopula nagler et al 2019 using the copula for scrb sub basin 5 10 000 sets of 1 000 random depressions were drawn each set was selected to have the same maximum and minimum depression sizes as the original scrb sub basin 5 depressions and the total depressional area fraction was limited to that of the sub basin the volumes of the ponds were estimated from their areas using eq 4 thus each set of simulated depressions and their catchments represents a random realization of a basin the median value of the areal fraction of the largest depression for each set of depressions was 0 053 2 5 simulating depression frequencies and arrangements to quantify the combined effects of the depression area and location on gatekeeping a set of pcm models was executed which incorporated both variables each model consisted of 2 944 depressions arranged in 4 branches of 736 depressions each branch using the tree1 arrangement for each model run a single large depression was generated with an area between 0 02 and 0 3 of the total depressional area the largest depression was sited within the network so that between 0 125 and all of the total basin area other than that of the depression was located above it 3 results 3 1 depression arrangement simulations as described above sets of depressions were connected in the 6 arrangements plotted in fig 6 each set of depressions was filled from the initially empty state to the completely filled state using pcm the first set of pcm model runs as plotted in fig 9 was for sets of 46 depressions the filling curves for the networks of 46 depressions all show strong signs of stair steps much of this effect is due to gatekeeping as the sizes and locations of the steps vary among the networks the strongest effects being for the tree3 and tree4 networks however the plot for the direct network which does not have downstream gatekeeping also shows stair steps in this case the stair steps are due to the filling of large depressions which only perform gatekeeping for themselves there is considerable variability among the curves in fig 9 for each network except for the direct network where all runs produce the same curve because the network location is always the same for all depressions in all runs note that two of the curves for the tree4 network are similar to the filling curve for brannen basin plotted in fig 3a showing zero connected fraction until a large fraction of the total depressional storage was filled the filling curves for the set of pcm model runs using sets of 736 depressions plotted in fig 10 show greatly reduced stair steps and the curves are much more similar to each other both within a given network type and between network types than are the 46 depression curves as with the 46 depression curves the direct network produces a single curve regardless of the assignment of depressions the cause of the reduced magnitudes of the stair steps is undoubtedly that the fraction of the total depressional storage held in any single depression is reduced as the number of depressions is increased the 736 depression filling curves approach 1 1 lines regardless of the shape of the network similar to the plots for scrb sub basin5 in fig 3b the differences in between the filling curves and a 1 1 line were quantified by computing the root mean squared difference rmsd between the each filling curve and the 1 1 line fig 11 a plots the median value averaged over all realizations of rmsd for each network type for 46 92 184 368 and 736 depressions the shaded regions represent the upper and lower quartiles of rmsd for the 20 realizations the plot shows that the median value of rmsd decreases for all network types as the number of depressions increases in all cases the median rmsd value was smallest for the direct network type and was the largest for the tree3 network type as would be expected although the variability in rmsd is influenced by the network structure it appears that the number of depressions has a much greater effect fig 11b plots the fraction of the total depressional area contained by the largest depression vs the number of depressions the value of the area fraction decreases with increasing numbers of depressions in a very similar way to the rmsd and very similarly to the results of the simulations plotted in fig 8 3 2 depression area frequency distribution simulations fig 12 plots the curves of fractional connected area vs fractional depressional storage for all of the realizations in gray the median value is plotted in black a 1 1 line is plotted in red although there is considerable scatter the realization curves lie close to the 1 1 line the median curve is slightly sigmoidal rather than being as linear in the curves in fig 3b or the simulations in fig 10f as both sets of simulations used the same relationships for determining pond areas and volumes it is believed that the cause of the deviation of the curves in fig 12 lies in a the use of a fitted distribution for the depression areas and b in the use of the very simple scaling relationship of eq 4 for the depressional volumes as well as the use of only 2 values for the parameter p by the second set of simulations as the curves in fig 12 were generated from only the frequency distributions of depression and catchment areas and the relationship between depression volumes and areas it is concluded that the shape of the rising limb of the linear filling curves in fig 3b is primarily due to these relationships 3 3 combined effects of depression size and location fig 13 plots the results of the pcm simulations of a single large depression of varying size located at varying locations within a depression network when the areal fraction of the largest depression is very small its gatekeeping is also small and therefore its location within the basin is unimportant as the depression s areal fraction is increased the effects of gatekeeping are seen most dramatically when it is located at the bottom of the basin where it causes an initial pause in the connected fraction as the depression s areal fraction reaches 0 3 of the total area the pause length increases until the system becomes very nearly endorheic as the large depression is moved farther up the basin its effect on the connected fraction curve changes the initial pause in connected fraction is shifted upward from the x axis as the region downstream of the largest depression becomes connected before the large depression is filled the rate of filling the downstream depressions is also reduced by the gatekeeping action of the large depression when the fraction of the basin area above the large depression is 0 15 or less the large depression is unable to fill even with the addition of 700 mm of water because of the very small fraction of the basin above the contributing inflow as was described above the drainage area of a depression is a power law function of the maximum water area with scaling exponents smaller than 1 shook et al 2013 therefore the ratio of the catchment area to depression area decreases as the depression area increases reducing the depths of runoff inflows when the areal fraction of the largest depression was 0 3 the volume fraction of the depression exceeded 0 5 of the total so it is able to trap almost all of the water being produced upstream when it is located near the bottom of the basin however the catchment area fraction was less than 0 1 of its depression s area therefore it is difficult for a large depression to fill when it is located near the top of the basin as it receives water from a small area it should be noted that the results above are only for a single set of depressions using a single large depression and a particular arrangement tree1 as scaling eqs 3 and 4 are functions of the depression area the gatekeeping of the maximum depression area will depend on the size of the largest depression as well as its fraction of the total depressional area because only 736 depressions were used on each branch the simulation likely exaggerates the gatekeeping for small maximum depression areal fractions as other depressions have similar areas to the largest depression 4 conclusions numerical experiments on the fill and spill runoff response for the hydrology of prairie basins with differing networks of depressions show the role of these networks in governing basin hydrological responses for basins with small numbers of depressions the sizes and the spatial arrangement of the depressions are very important in governing the gatekeeping and therefore the connected fraction of the basin for basins with large numbers of depressions provided that the largest depressions are fairly small the spatial arrangement of the depressions is relatively unimportant where there is a single large depression i e a lake near the outlet of the basin the basin may effectively be endorheic i e unable to ever contribute flow downstream a single large depression near the top of a basin may never contribute flow to the rest of the basin the frequency distributions of depression areas in a basin depends on the topography as well as the existence of artificial drainage artificial drainage may also influence the connectivity of the depressions the convergence of the basin connected fraction curves toward 1 1 lines indicates that the gatekeeping effects of small ponds are also small the shape of connected fraction curve is largely due to the frequency distribution of depression areas the relationship between depression area and volume and the relationship between the depression areas and the areas of their catchments small basins where the arrangement of the depressions is important and where the depressional area is most concentrated in a single depression will require detailed modelling using models like wdpm or pcm large basins due to the simplifying effects of scale may be amenable to representation by simplified models of their connected fractions even when they contain a few very large depressions in such a model the set of small depressions which is hysteretic in its relationship between water storage and connected fraction but does not show much gatekeeping could be modelled as a single unit the close alignment of the connected fraction curves with 1 1 lines on the rising limb indicate that it may be possible to approximate the hysteretic behaviour of the small depressions with linear relationship where there are large depressions i e with areas more than a few percent of the total they would need to be simulated this would not be the case in all basins large depressions are strong gatekeepers but need not display hysteresis in their connected fractions if they are modelled individually this would require determining the basin area and the location in the overall basin of each of the large depressions the large depressions would receive runoff from the combined small depressions in proportion to the large depressions basin areas when if the large depressions fill they would permit flows to be contributed to the basin outlet such models would require only a few state variables i e of the volume of water stored in the combined small depressions and in each of the large depressions although the two basins used as the bases for the analyses in this study sdrb and scrb differ in many respects they cannot represent all of the diversity of landscapes within the ppr the development of a conceptual model separating gatekeeping and hysteresis and its incorporation within physically based hydrological models would allow the conceptual model to be tested in other locations and would also allow the assessment of the effects of physical processes and their spatio temporal variabilities on the variability of connected contributing areal fractions of prairie

4954,runoff in many locations within the canadian prairies is dominated by intermittent fill and spill between depressions as a result many basins have varying fractions of their areas connected to their outlets due to changing depressional storage the objective of this research is to determine the causes of the relationships between water storage and the connected fraction of depression dominated prairie basins it is hypothesized that the shapes of the relationship curves are influenced by both the spatial and frequency distributions of depressional storage three sets of numerical experiments are presented to test the hypothesis the first set of experiments demonstrates that where the number of depressions is small their size and spatial distributions are important in controlling the relationship between the volume of depressional storage and the connected fraction of a basin as the number of depressions is increased the areal fractions of the largest depressions decrease which reduces the importance of the spatial distribution of depressions the second set of experiments demonstrates that the curve enveloping the connected fraction of a basin can be derived from the frequency distribution of depression areas and scaling relationships between the area volume and catchment area of the depressions when the area of the largest depression is no greater than approximately 5 of the total the third set of experiments demonstrates that the presence of a single large depression can strongly influence the relationship between the depressional storage and the connected fraction of a basin depending on the relative size of the large depression and its location within the basin a single depression containing 30 of the total depressional area located near the outlet was shown to cause a basin to be nearly endorheic a similar depression near the top of a basin was demonstrated not to fill and was therefore unable to contribute flows the implications of the findings for developing hydrological models of large prairie drainage basins are discussed keywords fill and spill runoff depressional storage wetlands hysteresis contributing area canadian prairies 1 introduction the prairie pothole region ppr of the canadian prairies and northern us great plains mann 1974 is characterized by the presence of millions of depressions locally known as wetlands sloughs or potholes which store water from direct precipitation surface runoff and the melt of trapped windblown snow the extent of the ppr is shown in fig 1 when the depressions are filled with water they can connect and conduct water overland and may eventually connect to a stream channel in canada much of this region is designated as including non effective areas for streamflow implying that it does not contribute flow to a stream channel for events with return periods of two years or shorter government of government of canada 2013 the spatial distribution of the non effective region is mapped in fig 1 regions designated as non contributing in the usa baker 2011 are not plotted because they are defined differently prior research has demonstrated that the connected fractions of basins in this region which are dominated by depressional storage i e the basin fractions which are connected to the outlet and can therefore contribute flow are variable and depend on the state of water storage in the depressions shaw et al 2012b stichling and blackwell 1957 this is a form of hydrological connectivity bracken and croke 2007 and is related to other forms of hydrological connectivity as discussed by bracken et al 2013 unlike the hydrological connectivities of hillslopes which are difficult to observe mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 and therefore to model the hydrological connectivities of prairie basins dominated by depressional storage can be inferred directly from the states of water in individual depressions any successful hydrological model of the region must be able to simulate the behaviours of complexes of prairie depressions to model their effects on the fractions of basins contributing flow the simulation of prairie depressions is further complicated and made more necessary by the effects of artificial drainage and climate change which are changing the responses of basins in the region dumanski et al 2015 1 1 terminology this paper follows the terminology of van der kamp et al 2016 the term depression refers to any local topographic minimum capable of holding water whether it contains water or not the depressions are similar to geographically isolated wetlands giws which are also depressions surrounded by uplands tiner 2003 although the use of the term geographically isolated for prairie potholes has been questioned mushet et al 2015 furthermore prairie depressions are not necessarily wetlands which are defined by van der kamp et al 2016 to be persistent and stable landscape features often denoted by the presence of hydric soils the water within a depression is referred to as the pond each pond has a maximum possible volume area and depth which occur when the depression is completely filled as discussed by leibowitz et al 2016 when water is added to a region with depressions the ponds may merge together in this paper depressions are designated by simulating their filling with water therefore two or more ponds which merge are considered to be as single pond filling a single depression the maximum area and volume of water in a pond are therefore equal to the area and volume respectively of the depression which contains it the contributing fraction of a river or lake drainage basin is that fraction of the basin s area which is actively contributing flow to an outlet at a given instant the connected fraction of a basin is the fraction of the basin for which connections exist to the outlet whether or not water is actively flowing both cases require connectivity all the way to the outlet i e all of the depressions on a path to the outlet must be completely filled because this research is concerned with the representing the states of basins it is the connected fractions of the basin which are simulated herein a model of the connected fraction may be incorporated within a hydrological model which by calculating runoff is then able to simulate the actively contributing fraction of a basin this paper also uses the terminology of shook et al 2015 for runoff which is defined as water movement as overland or shallow interflow which may or may not reach a drainage system rather than the more common definition as an areal depth of stream discharge the two uses are synonymous only when all of the depressions in a basin are connected to the outlet i e when the connected fraction is 1 and all runoff can reach the basin outlet the region which can contribute runoff directly to a given depression without passing through any other depression is defined as that depression s catchment the connected area of a depression dominated drainage basin is comprised of the areas of the connected depressions and of their catchments this paper frequently references the basin fractions of depressional storage connected area and largest pond area to normalize their values the fractional depressional storage is the total volume of water stored in basin ponds at any time divided by the maximum possible volume of storage in the basin which is the total volume of the depressions the fractional connected area is the area of the basin connected to the outlet divided by the basin area the areal fraction of the largest depression is the area of the largest depression in a basin divided by the sum of all of the depressional areas 1 2 hysteresis in prairie basin state variables much of the modelling of the effects of depressional storage on hydrology has used models which combine the storages of individual depressions into a single unit usually by modelling them as a frequency distributions of storage evenson et al 2015 golden et al 2014 hossain 2017 mann 1974 although lumped methods can give good modelling results they do not give any information about the effects of individual depressions particularly their spatial distribution more seriously such methods cannot incorporate the effects of hysteresis between basin state variables hysteresis has been well documented in hydrological processes at all scales o kane and flynn 2007 spence 2010 the connected area fractions of depression dominated prairie basins have been shown to be non linearly and hysteretically related to water storage shook et al 2015 shook et al 2013 shook and pomeroy 2011 it has also been demonstrated that the relationship between the total volume of water stored within a basin and its surface area is also hysteretic shook and pomeroy 2011 the fundamental cause of the observed hysteresis in the basin scale state variables connected fraction and water surface area is the existence of thousands of states i e the storages of water in the depressions within each basin apart from the end states when all depressions are empty or filled any total storage of water can be the sum of an infinite number of individual states of the water in the ponds the processes which affect the storage of water behave very differently in positive additive and negative subtractive directions additions of water may come from direct precipitation melting of windblown snow drifts and runoff from uplands adjacent to a depression as well as by water transfer from other depressions through surface or shallow subsurface flows substantial deep groundwater inflows to or discharges from depressions are uncommon in most prairie basins hayashi et al 2016 due to the presence of aquitards caused by heavy clay till sub soil deposits woo and rowsell 1993 and as evidenced by the common lack of base flows in prairie streams niazi et al 2017 found the average recharge of a small watershed at the western extreme of the canadian ppr to be 5 3 mm y by chloride mass balance and 5 15 mm y from baseflow estimates which are very small fractions of the mean annual precipitation of 483 mm it should be noted that these recharge depths would actually be considered to be quite large in much of the ppr that the basin in question was not completely underlain by glacial till and that the depth of the surficial till was very shallow in many parts of the basin hayashi and farrow 2014 removals of water from depressions are primarily caused by open water evaporation transpiration from the surrounding vegetation and surface outflows when the depressions are filled as well as having very different magnitudes the additive and subtractive fluxes act upon very different areas of the basin whilst evaporation and direct precipitation act on the pond surfaces runoff originates from the uplands surrounding the depression and blowing snow may be transported from outside of the depression catchment as snow can be blown over drainage divides furthermore addition of water causes ponds to enlarge and to merge whilst removal of water causes ponds to disintegrate and for the smaller ponds to disappear shook et al 2013 and zhang et al 2009 demonstrated that the frequency distributions of pond areas change differently when water is added and removed therefore the fluxes are not reversible nor are their effects on the spatial and frequency distributions of pond volumes and areas shook et al 2015 demonstrated that the hysteresis between the storages of water and the connected fractions of prairie basins was instrumental in affecting the shapes of the probability distribution functions of stream flows it is evident that as soon as the elevation of the pond is below that of its depression s outlet the depression is disconnected as are all depressions upstream because evaporation affects all of the ponds in a basin it is also evident that all depressions will become disconnected at approximately the same time i e as soon as there is evaporation following a runoff event causing the basin connected fraction to become zero some of the first modelling of the variable connected fractions of prairie basins was done by shaw 2009 however only very small numbers of ponds were examined and only the increase in the contributing fraction with increasing storage was simulated shaw et al 2012b examined the increase in contributing area at st denis during a runoff event shaw et al 2012a extended the work to larger numbers of ponds again for increases in storage and contributing fractions shook and pomeroy 2011 and shook et al 2013 extended the work to use many more ponds and larger basins as well as decreasing storage situations 1 3 research objectives the variable connected fractions are defining state properties of prairie basins and strongly influence the runoff response to snow melt and precipitation and overall hydrology of the region prior modelling research has often been concerned with quantifying the effects of changes in depressional storage on the hydrological responses of canadian prairie basins ameli and creed 2019 pomeroy et al 2014 the objective of this research is to determine the cause of the shapes of the connected fraction depression storage volume relationships it is hypothesized that the relationships are influenced by both the spatial and frequency distributions of depressional storage the intent is to quantify the effects of both three sets of analyses are presented the first analyses are to determine the effects of the spatial arrangement of depressions on the rising limb of the hysteresis curves the second analyses determine the influence of the frequency distributions of depressional areas on the curve shape the third analyses examine the combined effects of the size and location of large depressions 2 materials and methods 2 1 research locations the simulations in this study are based on two instrumented and intensively studied prairie pothole basins in saskatchewan st denis research basin sdrb and smith creek research basin scrb whose locations are shown in fig 1 the basins have very different topographies and histories and so represent the variability of drainage basins within the ppr the areas of the sub basins and the number of depressions areas 25 m2 are given in table 1 maps of the basins are shown in fig 2 sdrb is located near saskatoon sk and has been studied intensively for more than 30 years the basin has relatively high relief for the ppr as it is a knob and kettle moraine with slopes varying from 10 to 15 miller et al 1985 the basin has never undergone artificial drainage the basin is ungauged which is not surprising as there is no permanent natural drainage system although some ephemeral channels do exist brannen et al 2015 the entire sdrb lies within the non effective regions plotted in fig 1 and has never been known to discharge flows during the period of study the area of sdrb is approximately 22 km2 a lidar based digital elevation model dem is available for the basin fig 2a shows the depression areas plotted in blue which were determined using the wetland dem ponding model shook and pomeroy 2011 which is described below sub basins may be defined based on the regions draining into the depressions sdrb drains from north to south the larger of the two sub basins considered in this study is defined as draining into pond 90 and was studied and modelled by mann 1974 this sub basin has an area of 10 3 km2 and drains from the overall basin surface divide to a point just above a very large depression the smallest basin was studied by brannen 2015 and brannen et al 2015 so it is designated as brannen basin the total area of the sub basin is approximately 1 2 km2 brannen et al 2015 brannen basin differs from the other two basins as it does not include the headwaters and therefore can receive discharges from upstream note that the outlet of brannen basin is the same as that of the basin draining into pond 90 scrb is a low relief basin in southeastern saskatchewan with a gross drainage area of approximately is 400 km2 and slopes between 2 and 5 pomeroy et al 2014 unlike sdrb scrb has a conventional drainage system with a stream gauge operated by the water service of canada wsc 05me007 smith creek near marchwell which has been operational since 1975 approximately 87 of the basin was classified as being non effective by the prairie farm rehabilitation administration pfra government of government of canada 2013 scrb has been drained very extensively since at least 1958 dumanski et al 2015 and has been studied extensively and modelled by the centre for hydrology since 2008 brunet and westbrook 2012 fang et al 2010 minke and westbrook 2010 minke et al 2010 pomeroy et al 2014 shook et al 2013 lidar taken in 2008 showed more than 10 000 depressions having areas greater than 100 m2 although the number and sizes of the depressions have since been reduced by drainage fig 2b shows the arrangement of sub basins within the basin as well as the depression areas determined from the lidar dem using arcgis as described by pomeroy et al 2014 because the execution time was too large wdpm described below was not run for sub basin 1 although the model was run successfully for sub basins 2 through 5 the basin drains from north west to south east i e from sub basin 1 to sub basin 5 2 2 models two models the wetland digital elevation model dem ponding model wdpm and the pothole cascade model pcm are used in this study in this study the models apply spatially uniform fluxes of water to representations of depressional storage in prairie basins although actual fluxes greatly vary in both space and time the intent of the study is to determine the how the geometry of depressional storage affects the responses of prairie basins 2 2 1 the wetland digital elevation model dem ponding model wdpm shook and pomeroy 2011 and shook et al 2013 developed the wdpm which applies water to a dem and routes the flow overland using the algorithm of shapiro and westervelt 1992 the wdpm source code is available at https github com centreforhydrology wdpm compiled versions of the model and more supporting documentation are available at https research groups usask ca hydrology modelling wdpm php the model has been used by several researchers other than the authors to simulate the variable spatial distributions of water within prairie basins kiss 2018 schellenberg 2017 thapa et al 2019 wdpm can be used to estimate the connected fraction of a basin having any state of distribution of water a small depth of water 1 mm is added and the basin is drained the fraction of the applied depth of water which exits the model is therefore the fraction of the basin which is connected to the outlet as shown in fig 3 when run repeatedly for a prairie basin wdpm produces hysteresis loops between the connected fraction and the volume of water storage the plotted loops are for complete filling of the storage from the initially empty state followed by complete removal of water the hysteresis loops could not be verified experimentally but the changes in the frequency distributions of water areas produced by the model have been validated against remotely sensed water areas by shook et al 2013 and armstrong et al 2013 wdpm was used to determine the sizes of depressions in all of the sub basins examined by repeatedly adding simulated water until the basins were filled in all cases lidar derived dems with resolutions of 5 m were used wdpm simulations showed that sdrb has approximately 126 depression per km2 the mean value for scrb is 216 given that the total areal fraction of all depressions is slightly greater in sdrb the mean depression area is also greater in sdrb than in scrb table 1 also shows the depressional area fraction i e the fraction of each basin within depressions st denis basin has a much greater fraction of its area 0 272 as depressions than any other basin 2 2 2 the pothole cascade model pcm because wdpm is too slow and inflexible it cannot easily simulate changes in drainage to be a component of a hydrological model the simplified conceptual pcm was developed the pcm source code and documentation are available at https github com centreforhydrology pcm pcm applies spatially uniform fluxes to a set of model depressions which are selected to have similar volume area scaling properties frequency distributions and patterns of connection to those in the basin being simulated shook et al 2013 pcm is similar to the model of shaw 2009 which also applies fluxes to simulated depressions however pcm is much faster allowing the use of much larger numbers of depressions and also simulates the removal of water from the depressions although pcm cannot reproduce the aggregation and disaggregation of ponds it does simulate the connection and disconnection of depressional areas and produced connected fraction volume fraction hysteresis loops with shapes similar to those produced by wdpm as are shown in fig 3 the addition of the pcm algorithm to a physically based hydrological model of scrb was shown to dramatically improve the model s performance pomeroy et al 2014 unfortunately the pcm algorithm is difficult to use in practice as pcm requires each pond to be represented it dramatically increases the number of parameters and state variables required by a model mapping the connectivities of large numbers of depressions in a basin is very difficult pomeroy et al 2014 simplified this task by only using a small number of depressions 46 to represent all of the depressions in each sub basin of scrb the effects of using small numbers of simulated depressions were identified by shook and pomeroy 2011 but were not well quantified pcm is used in this research to investigate the effects of the arrangement of depressional storage on the hysteresis between water storage and the fraction of the basin which is connected to the outlet the model s parametric requirements are modest consisting of simple text files listing a the volume b the area and c the connectivity i e the draining destination of each depression the catchment area of each depression is computed from the depressional area as described below the area ap m2 and volume vp m3 of each pond are modelled as paraboloids using the relationships of hayashi and van der kamp 2000 1 a p sh 2 p where s p constants h pond maximum depth m therefore the volume of a pond is function of its surface area 2 v p a p h 1 2 p hayashi and van der kamp 2000 found great variation in the values of s and p among depressions in several prairie basins all pcm simulations used values of p 1 72 for ponds with depressions smaller than 10 000 m2 and p 3 33 for the larger ones which were used by pomeroy et al 2014 and were derived for scrb although these values provide some representation of the effect of depression area on p and therefore h they do not reproduce all of the scaling nor the natural variability in the parameters based on the assigned value of p and the depression area and volume the values of s and h were computed for each depression by iteratively solving eqs 1 and 2 the depression areas were determined by gis analyses of smith creek sub basin 5 as described in pomeroy et al 2014 shook et al 2013 found power law relationships between the areas of depressions ad m2 and their catchments ac m2 3 a c aa d b where a and b are constants the magnitudes of b being less than 1 for the three prairie basins examined for smith creek sub basin 5 a 31 3 b 0 738 this relationship was used to calculate the catchment area for each depression simulated the depression volumes vd m3 at scrb were found to fit a power law relationship with the depression areas as was also described in pomeroy et al 2014 4 v d ca d d where d 1 211 as the volume and catchment area of a given depression are functions of its area it is usually easier to estimate the relative size and therefore importance of a depression from its area than from the volume therefore areas provide a convenient way of categorizing depressions because the exponent of eq 4 is greater than 1 and that of eq 3 is less than 1 the depression volume increases more rapidly than does the area while the catchment area increases more slowly the implications of these scaling relationships are discussed below the model forcings are spatially uniform additions and removal of water pcm uses a constant factor in this case set to 1 so as to give the maximum possible connected fractions to calculate the runoff from the depression and its catchment each addition of water is applied to all the depressions when a depression is filled any excess water is routed to the specified connecting depression and to all subsequent connected depressions when a depression is not full the connection with the downstream depression is broken so no water is routed as with wdpm the connected fractions of the simulated basins were determined by adding 1 mm of water and calculating the fraction of water exiting the model each execution of pcm only applies a single depth of water addition or removal to the set of depressions as is discussed below the pcm simulations required many executions of the program scripts written in the language r r core team 2013 were used to create the parameter files and to repeatedly call the pcm executable all the r scripts and associated data files used in this document are available through zenodo https zenodo org record 3964953 x n6z3vuev6 2 3 mapping depressional spatial distributions determining the effects of the spatial distribution of storage requires methods of quantifying it phillips et al 2011 used network analyses to map the connectivity of lakes in northern canada which share some similarity with the ppr in that both regions are flat and poorly drained rains et al 2015 used network graphing to describe the arrangement of giws herein network graphs are plotted of the arrangement of depressions as shown in fig 4 with the depressions as the vertices and the potential overland flow connections as the edges all network graphs in this paper are plotted using the r package igraph csardi and nepusz 2006 the outlet from a given basin is represented by the red vertex in each plot the spatial arrangement of depressional storage was quantified using a variation of the basin width function which quantifies the number of tributary streams as a function of the flow distance from the outlet the basin width function has been linked to the shape of basin hydrographs by researchers since kirkby 1976 when applied to depressional storage the width function is simply the histogram of the number of depressions vertices versus their distance in edges from the outlet in a basin where many depressions are located near the outlet i e where water does not have to flow through many depressions to reach it the width function will be skewed rightward if many depressions are located near the outer reaches of the basin the function will be skewed leftward if many depressions are located in the middle of the basin with few near the outlet and in the outer reaches of the basin then the width function will be heap shaped to allow comparison among basins with varying numbers of depressions the widths are converted to densities by dividing by the total numbers of depressions in the basins the graph of the depressions at brannen basin sdrb is plotted in fig 4a their arrangement appears to be quite random as shown by shook and pomeroy 2011 the depressions in each sub basin at scrb are arranged in tributaries that drain in parallel to the stream channel therefore all tributary sets of depressions in this basin can be regarded as draining directly to the outlet it is believed that the structured arrangement of the tributaries is due in part to the high degree of artificial drainage in the basin dumanski et al 2015 the minimum number of depressions that could represent the connectivity estimated for this basin is 46 as described in pomeroy et al 2014 arranged as shown in fig 4b as discussed by phillips et al 2011 in the context of lakes in northern canada large depressions act as gatekeepers preventing upstream flows from contributing to the outlet until the large depressions are filled the filling curve for brannen basin plotted in fig 3a strongly resembles the filling curve plotted by shaw et al 2012a in their fig 6 c which shows a small sub basin dominated by the gatekeeping of a single large depression at the outlet the network width function of brannen basin plotted in fig 4c indicates that the largest fractions of depressions are located near the middle of the basin however the spatial distribution of depressional maximum water areas plotted in fig 5 a shows that there are several large depressions located very close to the outlet which cause the gatekeeping function seen in the plots in fig 3a where the connected area fraction is zero until approximately 75 of the depressional storage has been filled apart from these large depressions there does not appear to be any relationship between the sizes and the network locations of the depressions the network width function of scrb sub basin 5 plotted in fig 4d shows that most of the depressions are located far from the outlet as would be expected from a branching arrangement the plot of depressional area vs network distance for scrb in fig 5b show little relationship between the size of a depression and its location within the basin the location is essentially random in this case the depression locations are indexed by the horton strahler order of an overlaid drainage network as described in pomeroy et al 2014 which is another measure of the network distance the horton strahler order was used because of the difficulty in identifying the connectivities of a very large number of depressions the filling curves for scrb sub basin 5 plotted in fig 2b are very linear rather than showing the stair step arrangement of the curves in fig 6 of shaw et al 2012a the number of depressions used in a pcm simulation has been demonstrated to strongly affect the smoothness of the filling curve shook et al 2013 therefore it is very likely that some of the difference between the shapes of the filling curves at sdrb and scrb is due to the difference in the numbers of depressions in the basins 2 3 1 modelling the effects of depression arrangement the effects of the frequency and spatial distributions of depressions on the shapes of the filling curves were investigated by generating synthetic networks of depressions and then using pcm to find the connected fractions as the networks were filled synthetic networks allow the depressions to be in any desired arrangement allowing realistic or completely artificial networks the effects of the number and spatial distribution of depressions on the shapes of the filling curves were investigated by generating synthetic networks of depressions and then using pcm to find the connected fractions as the networks were filled networks were created with 46 92 184 368 and 736 depressions i e 1 2 4 8 and 16 sets of 46 depressions as was used by the original pcm model for scrb for each of the network arrangements each set of 46 depressions was connected separately to the outlet giving the complete set the same width function as the original 46 depressions three types of storage network graphs were simulated 1 deterministic 2 random and 3 direct the deterministic graphs use sets of 46 depressions in 4 tree based arrangements shown in fig 6a d the network width functions of these basins plotted in fig 7 a through d place the depressions at varying distances from the outlet the tree1 network is distributed very similarly to the scrb network with the depression density rapidly increasing with network distance the density plots of networks tree2 and tree4 show that these networks are intermediate between the distributions of the scrb sub basin5 and brannen basin the tree3 network was created as a test of an extreme example of gatekeeping it is not intended to be realistic representation of a prairie basin the random graphs were generated using the r igraph package function sample pa varying the power parameter of the function allows the creation of graphs of varying sizes with very similar network width functions fig 6e plots the network generated for 46 depressions as plotted in fig 7e the network width density indicates that this method places a large fraction of the depressions adjacent to the middle of the basin similar to the distribution of brannen basin the direct network plotted in fig 6f connects each depression directly to the outlet there are no connections among the depressions so no depression can perform gatekeeping of upstream depressions therefore as plotted in fig 7f all of the depressions other than the outlet have the same distance from the outlet as the spatial distributions of depression areas at sdrb and scrb are generally random as shown in fig 5 the depression volumes and areas were distributed randomly among the networks twenty realizations were created for each of the networks i e the same set of depression parameters was assigned randomly over each model network 20 times the sequence of operations for modelling was 1 a set of depressions was selected with either 46 92 184 368 or 736 depressions i e with 1 2 4 8 or 16 sets of 46 depressions 2 an arrangement pattern was selected from the 6 depressional arrangement patterns tree1 tree2 tree3 tree4 random and direct 3 the depressions were assigned randomly to all positions in the arrangement 4 a small depth of water was added to the depressions and all of their catchments and allowed to run into the depressions or to exit the model 5 an additional 1 mm of water was added to the model and the fraction of the applied depth exiting the model was recorded as the connected fraction 6 steps 4 and 5 were repeated until all of the model depressions were filled and the connected fraction of the simulated basin was 1 together 118 additions of water were made additions of 1 through 10 mm were added by 1 mm followed by additions of 20 through 500 mm by 10 mm for a total of 59 additions followed by 59 additions of 1 mm 7 steps 3 through 6 were repeated with 20 different realizations of the random arrangement of the model depressions 8 steps 2 though 7 were repeated for all 6 depressional arrangement patterns 9 steps 1 through 8 were repeated for all 5 numbers of depressions steps 4 and 5 were performed by pcm all of the other steps were performed by r scripts which called the pcm model in total 70 800 pcm runs were made 118 additions of water 5 sets of depressions 6 arrangement patterns 20 realizations 2 4 frequency distributions of depression areas as described above it is believed that the frequency distribution of depression areas and therefore of their volumes and catchment areas influences the shapes of the connected fraction curves it would appear that the area frequency distribution within a given basin has two important components a the frequency distributions of all depressions and b the relative sizes of the largest depressions which strongly gatekeep it is therefore important to determine the effects of both components several researchers have found that pond areas and therefore presumably depression areas can be approximated by power law frequency distributions liu and schwartz 2011 shook et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 which is common in objects such as depressions which are fractals bertassello et al 2018 minke et al 2010 mekonnen et al 2014 demonstrated that integration of an assumed power law distribution of depressional volumes could produce single valued exponential curves for the contributing fractions of prairie basins when the algorithm pdmrof was employed for basins within the canadian ppr it improved the performance of the hydrological models mekonnen et al 2014 mengistu and spence 2016 however pdmrof does not explain the shapes of the hysteretic curves plotted in fig 3 as it produces a single valued function and pdmrof uses calibrated parameters rather than actual frequency distributions pdmrof also uses an assumed continuous distribution rather than discrete depressions most importantly pdmrof does not use a relationship between pond areas and volumes nor a relationship between the depression and catchment areas pareto ii distributions were fitted to all of the to all of the sdrb and sdrb depressional areas using the r package cosmos papalexiou and serinaldi 2020 papalexiou et al 2020 which is available at https cran r project org package cosmos sets of between 10 and 20 000 depressions with 10 000 realizations of each set were generated from the fitted distributions realizations resulting in maximum fractional depression areas greater than the maxima of the values for sdrb and scrb were eliminated in all cases more than 8 900 realizations were used for each set of depressions the areal fractions of the largest depressions are plotted against the number of depressions in each set in fig 8 for all of the sub basins at sdrb and scrb for both basins the median areal fraction decreases rapidly becoming fairly flat for sets of more than 5000 depressions with the scrb median values being consistently smaller than the sdrb values the measured values of the largest depression areal fractions plotted as red dots are much greater at sdrb than at scrb this is only partly due to the small numbers of depressions at sdrb sdrb has more depressions than scrb sub basin 5 as is shown in table 1 evidently the size distribution of depression areas at sdrb also results in relatively large values of the areal fractions therefore the relative area of the largest depression will depend on the size of the basin and the overall frequency distribution of depression areas as well as random chance 2 4 1 modelling the effects of the depression area frequency distribution the cause of the near linear rising limb connected area curves plotted in fig 3b for sub basin 5 scrb were investigated by filling sets of simulated depressions with similar properties in these simulations the filling of each set of depressions was effected by an r script which iteratively applied depths of water to the depressions and their catchments until all of the depressions were filled the simulation was therefore very similar to those of the direct pcm simulations in that each depression was assumed to be connected to the outlet as soon as it was filled as demonstrated by eq 3 the relationships between the areas of depressions and their catchments can be described by power laws although shook et al 2013 showed that the relationships have considerable scatter particularly for small depressions depression basins were modelled by generating a bivarate copula from the fitted marginal distributions of the areas of the depressions and their catchments using the r packages copula hofert et al 2018 and vinecopula nagler et al 2019 using the copula for scrb sub basin 5 10 000 sets of 1 000 random depressions were drawn each set was selected to have the same maximum and minimum depression sizes as the original scrb sub basin 5 depressions and the total depressional area fraction was limited to that of the sub basin the volumes of the ponds were estimated from their areas using eq 4 thus each set of simulated depressions and their catchments represents a random realization of a basin the median value of the areal fraction of the largest depression for each set of depressions was 0 053 2 5 simulating depression frequencies and arrangements to quantify the combined effects of the depression area and location on gatekeeping a set of pcm models was executed which incorporated both variables each model consisted of 2 944 depressions arranged in 4 branches of 736 depressions each branch using the tree1 arrangement for each model run a single large depression was generated with an area between 0 02 and 0 3 of the total depressional area the largest depression was sited within the network so that between 0 125 and all of the total basin area other than that of the depression was located above it 3 results 3 1 depression arrangement simulations as described above sets of depressions were connected in the 6 arrangements plotted in fig 6 each set of depressions was filled from the initially empty state to the completely filled state using pcm the first set of pcm model runs as plotted in fig 9 was for sets of 46 depressions the filling curves for the networks of 46 depressions all show strong signs of stair steps much of this effect is due to gatekeeping as the sizes and locations of the steps vary among the networks the strongest effects being for the tree3 and tree4 networks however the plot for the direct network which does not have downstream gatekeeping also shows stair steps in this case the stair steps are due to the filling of large depressions which only perform gatekeeping for themselves there is considerable variability among the curves in fig 9 for each network except for the direct network where all runs produce the same curve because the network location is always the same for all depressions in all runs note that two of the curves for the tree4 network are similar to the filling curve for brannen basin plotted in fig 3a showing zero connected fraction until a large fraction of the total depressional storage was filled the filling curves for the set of pcm model runs using sets of 736 depressions plotted in fig 10 show greatly reduced stair steps and the curves are much more similar to each other both within a given network type and between network types than are the 46 depression curves as with the 46 depression curves the direct network produces a single curve regardless of the assignment of depressions the cause of the reduced magnitudes of the stair steps is undoubtedly that the fraction of the total depressional storage held in any single depression is reduced as the number of depressions is increased the 736 depression filling curves approach 1 1 lines regardless of the shape of the network similar to the plots for scrb sub basin5 in fig 3b the differences in between the filling curves and a 1 1 line were quantified by computing the root mean squared difference rmsd between the each filling curve and the 1 1 line fig 11 a plots the median value averaged over all realizations of rmsd for each network type for 46 92 184 368 and 736 depressions the shaded regions represent the upper and lower quartiles of rmsd for the 20 realizations the plot shows that the median value of rmsd decreases for all network types as the number of depressions increases in all cases the median rmsd value was smallest for the direct network type and was the largest for the tree3 network type as would be expected although the variability in rmsd is influenced by the network structure it appears that the number of depressions has a much greater effect fig 11b plots the fraction of the total depressional area contained by the largest depression vs the number of depressions the value of the area fraction decreases with increasing numbers of depressions in a very similar way to the rmsd and very similarly to the results of the simulations plotted in fig 8 3 2 depression area frequency distribution simulations fig 12 plots the curves of fractional connected area vs fractional depressional storage for all of the realizations in gray the median value is plotted in black a 1 1 line is plotted in red although there is considerable scatter the realization curves lie close to the 1 1 line the median curve is slightly sigmoidal rather than being as linear in the curves in fig 3b or the simulations in fig 10f as both sets of simulations used the same relationships for determining pond areas and volumes it is believed that the cause of the deviation of the curves in fig 12 lies in a the use of a fitted distribution for the depression areas and b in the use of the very simple scaling relationship of eq 4 for the depressional volumes as well as the use of only 2 values for the parameter p by the second set of simulations as the curves in fig 12 were generated from only the frequency distributions of depression and catchment areas and the relationship between depression volumes and areas it is concluded that the shape of the rising limb of the linear filling curves in fig 3b is primarily due to these relationships 3 3 combined effects of depression size and location fig 13 plots the results of the pcm simulations of a single large depression of varying size located at varying locations within a depression network when the areal fraction of the largest depression is very small its gatekeeping is also small and therefore its location within the basin is unimportant as the depression s areal fraction is increased the effects of gatekeeping are seen most dramatically when it is located at the bottom of the basin where it causes an initial pause in the connected fraction as the depression s areal fraction reaches 0 3 of the total area the pause length increases until the system becomes very nearly endorheic as the large depression is moved farther up the basin its effect on the connected fraction curve changes the initial pause in connected fraction is shifted upward from the x axis as the region downstream of the largest depression becomes connected before the large depression is filled the rate of filling the downstream depressions is also reduced by the gatekeeping action of the large depression when the fraction of the basin area above the large depression is 0 15 or less the large depression is unable to fill even with the addition of 700 mm of water because of the very small fraction of the basin above the contributing inflow as was described above the drainage area of a depression is a power law function of the maximum water area with scaling exponents smaller than 1 shook et al 2013 therefore the ratio of the catchment area to depression area decreases as the depression area increases reducing the depths of runoff inflows when the areal fraction of the largest depression was 0 3 the volume fraction of the depression exceeded 0 5 of the total so it is able to trap almost all of the water being produced upstream when it is located near the bottom of the basin however the catchment area fraction was less than 0 1 of its depression s area therefore it is difficult for a large depression to fill when it is located near the top of the basin as it receives water from a small area it should be noted that the results above are only for a single set of depressions using a single large depression and a particular arrangement tree1 as scaling eqs 3 and 4 are functions of the depression area the gatekeeping of the maximum depression area will depend on the size of the largest depression as well as its fraction of the total depressional area because only 736 depressions were used on each branch the simulation likely exaggerates the gatekeeping for small maximum depression areal fractions as other depressions have similar areas to the largest depression 4 conclusions numerical experiments on the fill and spill runoff response for the hydrology of prairie basins with differing networks of depressions show the role of these networks in governing basin hydrological responses for basins with small numbers of depressions the sizes and the spatial arrangement of the depressions are very important in governing the gatekeeping and therefore the connected fraction of the basin for basins with large numbers of depressions provided that the largest depressions are fairly small the spatial arrangement of the depressions is relatively unimportant where there is a single large depression i e a lake near the outlet of the basin the basin may effectively be endorheic i e unable to ever contribute flow downstream a single large depression near the top of a basin may never contribute flow to the rest of the basin the frequency distributions of depression areas in a basin depends on the topography as well as the existence of artificial drainage artificial drainage may also influence the connectivity of the depressions the convergence of the basin connected fraction curves toward 1 1 lines indicates that the gatekeeping effects of small ponds are also small the shape of connected fraction curve is largely due to the frequency distribution of depression areas the relationship between depression area and volume and the relationship between the depression areas and the areas of their catchments small basins where the arrangement of the depressions is important and where the depressional area is most concentrated in a single depression will require detailed modelling using models like wdpm or pcm large basins due to the simplifying effects of scale may be amenable to representation by simplified models of their connected fractions even when they contain a few very large depressions in such a model the set of small depressions which is hysteretic in its relationship between water storage and connected fraction but does not show much gatekeeping could be modelled as a single unit the close alignment of the connected fraction curves with 1 1 lines on the rising limb indicate that it may be possible to approximate the hysteretic behaviour of the small depressions with linear relationship where there are large depressions i e with areas more than a few percent of the total they would need to be simulated this would not be the case in all basins large depressions are strong gatekeepers but need not display hysteresis in their connected fractions if they are modelled individually this would require determining the basin area and the location in the overall basin of each of the large depressions the large depressions would receive runoff from the combined small depressions in proportion to the large depressions basin areas when if the large depressions fill they would permit flows to be contributed to the basin outlet such models would require only a few state variables i e of the volume of water stored in the combined small depressions and in each of the large depressions although the two basins used as the bases for the analyses in this study sdrb and scrb differ in many respects they cannot represent all of the diversity of landscapes within the ppr the development of a conceptual model separating gatekeeping and hysteresis and its incorporation within physically based hydrological models would allow the conceptual model to be tested in other locations and would also allow the assessment of the effects of physical processes and their spatio temporal variabilities on the variability of connected contributing areal fractions of prairie
