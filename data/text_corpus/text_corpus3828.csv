19140,a light weight granular mixed quartz sand denoted as l gqs combined with stirring assisted bubble column reactor was firstly applied in catalytic ozonation of atrazine the l gqs with a density of 2 36 g cm 3 and average diameter of ca of 4 mm was readily churned up and uniformly distributed within the solution in the reactor the introduction of l gqs was found to exhibit enhanced catalytic ozonation of atrazine with the increase in degradation rate and the dissolved organic carbon doc removal being more than 2 fold for the catalytic process l gqs dosage 5 g l 1 atrazine 0 50 μm o3 25 mg l 1 gas flow 0 2 l min 1 at ph 7 0 and 293 k the l gqs settled at the bottom of the reactor after experimentation allowing its easy separation from the solution a complete characterization of the material xrd xps ftir fe sem eds bet and phpzc revealed that l gqs consisted of α quartz β cristobalite anorthoclase and small amount of iron oxy hydroxides hydroxyl groups bronsted acid sites and lewis acid sites on the surface of l gqs all contributed to the atrazine adsorption ozone decomposition and oh generation the l gqs catalyzed ozonation exhibited superior atrazine degradation and mineralization rates in a wide range of ph 3 0 9 0 and reaction temperatures 278 k 293 k also an enhancement of doc abatement was observed both in presence of natural organic matter isolates and natural water matrices river water when l gqs was used finally the degradation mechanism was proposed based on the intermediates and by products formation analyzed by lc qtof ms ms and ionic chromatography our results indicate that the l gqs combined with stirring assisted bubble column reactor could be utilized as an enhancement of ozone based advanced oxidation processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords catalytic ozonation mixed quartz sand atrazine hydroxyl radical heterogeneous catalysis 1 introduction over the last decades the environmental pollution issue by recalcitrant compounds and especially those of synthetic organic nature has become a worldwide challenging problem as new chemicals are being continuously manufactured and discharged into the aquatic environment among these substances we find pesticides herbicides and fungicides which are frequently utilized synthetic organics responding to the need of improving agricultural productivity sprayed in agricultural fields they usually enter the aquatic environment readily in the form of diffuse contamination via further surface run off leaching and or erosion rodriguez mozaz et al 2004 so far more than 1200 kinds of herbicides and 2200 kinds of fungicides are in active use according to the national pesticide information center npic npic 2018 atrazine is an herbicide which has been extensively and commonly employed for more than 60 years hence it has been frequently detected in drinking water in the us eu and china in the past decades loos et al 2010 although atrazine was banned in eu in 2003 it is still widely used in other countries thus it is typically detected in surface waters basfar et al 2009 therefore specific treatment methods are called for its elimination especially the advanced oxidation processes aops which offer remarkable treatment efficiency taking on particular significance on its elimination prior dissemination to natural water bodies hydroxyl radical oh based aops have gained significant attention providing an effective solution towards the degradation of refractory pollutants in aquatic environments it is demonstrated that oh are highly active e oh h2o 2 73 v but short lived so they can only be generated in situ and react instantaneously while unselectively with various compounds gligorovski et al 2015 currently oh based aops such as fenton process tio2 photo catalysis uv o3 uv h2o2 and catalytic ozonation have been investigated for enhancing the production of oh during treatment in past studies gallard et al reported an excellent oxidation ability of atrazine by the fe iii h2o2 process but the ph conditions were very low ph 1 3 gallard and de laat 2000 rosenfeldt et al 2006 used atrazine as model compound to compare the efficiency of oh formation during o3 o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 and the results revealed that ozone based aops were more energy efficient than the uv h2o2 process under neutral ph conditions the results of these studies indicated that ozone based aops were suitable technologies for refractory contaminants destruction and especially atrazine heterogeneous catalytic ozonation an efficient ozone based aop obtains superior capacity for degradation and mineralization of atrazine due to the introduction of solid catalysts wang et al 2018 it is believed that the heterogeneous surface is able to promote ozone decomposition and further generate reactive oxygen species ros mainly oh 1o2 or o2 bing et al 2017 minerals are among the commonly used catalysts for catalytic ozonation natural minerals are abundantly distributed in the earth s crust easily accessible non toxic easy to recycle and cost effective when compared with synthetic metal oxides metal supported compounds and carbonaceous matters nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 zhang et al 2008 several minerals have been studied as potential catalysts of the ozonation process such as perovskite zhao et al 2013 zeolite amin et al 2010 brucite he et al 2008 and bauxite qi et al 2009 the main components of these minerals were al2o3 sio2 mgo fe2o3 and some other oxides contained na k and ca in the majority of the mineral related catalytic ozonation studies the target pollutants were degraded by oh which is generated from ozone decomposition on the surface of the minerals dong et al 2007 wang et al 2018 amin et al 2010 qi et al 2009 evidently the surface active sites and chemical properties of the minerals played key roles on contaminants destruction so far only a few studies reported the engineering applications of natural mineral related catalytic ozonation he et al 2008 qi et al 2009 in our previous work a cylindrical ceramic honeycomb 50 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length has been reported as an efficient mineral based material for catalytic ozonation zhao et al 2008a further doping metallic elements such as cu zhao et al 2009a 2009b and mn zhao et al 2008b 2010 on ceramic honeycomb achieved higher pollutants mineralization however the used of ceramic honeycomb which is an industrial product would increase the cost of water treatment the pores of the ceramic honeycomb were also easy to clog hence these limitations need to be addressed it is still necessary to select appropriate natural minerals as efficient catalysts to expand the practical applications of mineral related catalytic ozonation in these materials we encounter silica a group of minerals which exists naturally as sand quartz and flint are earth abundant due to its main component of two most abundant elements in earth s crust silicon and oxygen grant and long 1981 because of their ease of fabrication low cost and resistance to chemical attacks the granular quartz sands or micro silica particles are widely used as cement additives refractory materials or oil well drilling mud otero gonzález et al 2015 in this study a new kind of light weight granular mixed quartz sand hereon l gqs was applied for the first time as a novel heterogeneous catalyst for the ozonation process the buoyant l gqs could mix with solution uniformity under an adequate ozone gas velocity in a stirring assisted bubble column reactor detail will be shown in experimental section the l gqs was characterized in detail and atrazine was chosen as the model refractory contaminant to evaluate the catalytic ability of the process this manuscript is focused on the function of l gqs surface characteristics and the parameters of the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of atrazine to address the need for higher catalytic efficiency in a lower cost in particular the effect of key factors affecting catalytic process such as ph temperature particle sizes agitation speed natural organic matter nom and reactive species are analyzed

method gomes et al 2012 the stirring speed and superficial gas velocity in this study was measured as 200 rpm and 0 2 m s 1 which is adequate to churn up the l gqs driven by buoyancy of the gas fig 1 the gas stream outlet at the top of the reactor was disposed by an uv based ozone destruction unit the ozone destruction unit was a lab made quartz reaction vessel which has an internal diameter of 10

equipped with vents for ozone gas inlet and outlet and it was also covered by aluminum foil to avoid uv light escaping to the surroundings the determination of atrazine concentration was as follows samples were collected at predetermined intervals with a syringe from the top of the reactor and immediately purged with pure n2 gas to remove the residual ozone gas followed by filtering with either

20 48 s each scan 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalysts fig 2 shows the xrd results of the fresh and used l gqs samples it was found that the xrd peaks of the fresh l gqs sample in the 2θ range of 20 80 could be well indexed as the mixture of standard samples of α quartz jcpds no 85 1054 β cristobalite jcpds no 89 3607 and anorthoclase jcpds no 10 0361 all of which belong to the space group p3221 with hexagonal structure p213 with cubic structure and p 1 with anorthic structure respectively the characteristic diffraction peaks which are observed at 2θ of 20 86 26 64 36 54 39 47 42 45 50 14 60 00 68 14 and 68 31 are in good agreement with the 100 011 110 102 200 112 121 203 and 031 crystal planes of α quartz moreover the peaks appeared at 2θ of 21 76 28 20 35 90 and 56 71 correspond to the β cristobalite 111 012 220 and 331 crystal planes the rest of the peaks located at 23 68 27 55 and 27 82 were well consistent with the 1 30 202 and 002 plane of the anorthoclase standard pattern no other impurity peaks were observed from the xrd patterns as such α quartz and β cristobalite were the major ingredients of l gqs while the proportion of anorthoclase in l gqs was quite low according to the peak intensities of xrd patterns following the xrd pattern for l gqs after 10 successive reuse cycles of catalytic ozonation is also presented in fig 2 the fresh and used l gqs were almost identical in crystalline and peaks intensities indicating that the crystal structure of l gqs remained unchanged during the catalytic ozonation process the morphology of l gqs is presented in the fe sem picture see supplementary fig s1 a the l gqs has a porous surface and the l gqs granules consist of irregular particles with average diameter of 100 200 nm the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of l gqs are shown in the supplementary fig s2 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of l gqs exhibited the character of type iv with type h4 hysteresis loops according to the iupac classification indicating the capillary condensation taking place in a typical mesoporous structure sing et al 1985 thommes et al 2015 the bet surface area mesopore volumes and average pore diameter of l gqs were measured as 58 m2 g 1 0 344 cm3 g 1 and 12 7 nm this result suggests that l gqs possess a large surface area and high pore volume which is beneficial towards achieving superior catalytic performance in the catalytic ozonation system the chemical components and chemical states of l gqs were clarified by edx and xps analysis edx elemental mapping images supplementary fig s3 reveals the chemical components of l gqs the l gqs mainly consisted of o 59 and si 23 which confirmed the result of xrd stating that l gqs was mainly composed of α quartz sio2 and β cristobalite sio2 besides o and si small amount of al 8 na 2 k 2 fe 2 ca 2 and c 2 formed anorthoclase k na alsi3o8 and other related oxides were found all these elements are homogeneously dispersed in the matrix of l gqs supplementary fig s3 illustrating its component uniformity the structure of α quartz β cristobalite and anorthoclase are shown in supplementary fig s4 the wide survey of xps spectrum supplementary fig s5 confirmed that si and o are major elements in l gqs while trace amounts of c al fe k ca and na have been also confirmed additionally high resolution xps spectra of si o al and fe are shown in fig 3 the spectrum of si fig 3 a was deconvoluted into two components the binding energy at 103 4 ev could be attributed to si o bonds in sio2 α quartz and β cristobalite whereas the peak at 102 6 ev is characteristic of si o bonds for silicate compound anorthoclase garcia guinea et al 2017 the o1 s spectrum of l gqs fig 3 b shows three fitted peaks at 530 3 531 5 and 532 5 ev which are attributed to surface lattice oxygen bridging hydroxyl group bridging oh and terminal hydroxyl group terminal oh respectively yu et al 2017 it should be noted here that the peak intensities of bridging oh and terminal oh are much higher than lattice oxygen this means that the majority of oxygen on the l gqs surface exists as hydroxyl group which is very important for catalytic activity furthermore the peak of al 2p in fig 3 c centered at 74 1 ev is generally accepted as al3 ellis et al 2016 fig 3 d obtains the spectrum of fe 2p with relative high intensity background noise due to its trace amount the two peaks centered at 711 9 and 725 1 ev could be assigned to the core levels of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively with splitting energy of 13 2 ev revealing the characterization of the oxidation state of fe3 according to previously research this is the characteristic splitting energy of iron oxy hydroxides structure was shown in the supplementary fig s4 d probably goethite katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 in addition a satellite peak of fe 2p3 2 could also be observed at 719 0 ev in fig 3 d ftir spectrum and pyridine ftir were used to investigate the surface groups of l gqs and the results are presented in fig 4 ftir study fig 4 a shows that the l gqs exhibits a broad band in the range of 3200 3700 cm 1 which relates to both the vibrations of surface bonded oh group from water h oh and surface silanols si oh zhou et al 2018 the absorption band at 1636 cm 1 corresponds to the bending mode of oh groups which can interact through hydrogen bonds with surface si oh the bands at 1086 and 810 cm 1 belong to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of si o si respectively the band at 463 cm 1 assigns to si o stretching vibrations as well the very low band near 691 cm 1 related to al o indicating the existence of trace amount of surface aluminum related groups arshadi et al 2017 hence the ftir results clearly reveal that hydroxyl groups si oh or h oh exist widely on l gqs surface fig 4 b illustrates the pyridine ftir over l gqs at 423 k and 623 k pyridine discriminates i strong and medium lewis acid sites ii weak lewis acid sites and iii bronsted acid sites since they interact with pyridine by electron pair donation hydrogen bonding and hydroxyl groups respectively jentys et al 1996 the obvious ir bands at around 1450 and 1620 cm 1 are the characteristic bands of strong lewis acid while band at 1490 cm 1 corresponds to pyridine adsorbed onto both lewis and bronsted acid sites the characteristic absorption peak of pyridine can be assigned to bronsted acid sites at the wave number of 1545 cm 1 according to previous study the amounts and categories of acid sites could be calculated by the pyridine ftir curves at 423 k and 623 k emeis 1993 the total amount of acid sites on the l gqs surface was 175 0 μmol g 1 155 7 μmol g 1 ca 89 of which were surface lewis acid sites and the others were bronsted acid sites ca 11 the bronsted acid sites were predominately contributed to the surface hydroxyl groups mainly si oh groups considering the results presented by xps analysis ward 1967 the surface lewis acid sites could be further divided into two categories the surface strong and medium lewis acid sites were 33 5 μmol g 1 ca 21 5 while the weak lewis acid sites were 122 2 μmol g 1 ca 78 5 the weak lewis acid sites were attributed to perturbed si oh vibrations due to hydrogen bonding of pyridine to hydroxyl groups whereas the strong and medium lewis acid sites were attributed to the coordinated aluminum oxide species and iron oxy hydroxides jentys et al 1996 ward 1967 bing et al 2015 3 2 catalytic ozonation mediated degradation of atrazine parameters and degradation mechanisms 3 2 1 effect of catalyst loading and process conditions the catalytic activity of l gqs with various dosages was evaluated by the degradation of atrazine 50 μm with ozone at an initial ph of 7 0 adsorption experiments were first carried out and quantification of the adsorbed atrazine amounts was performed by hplc to determine the appropriate adsorption time with an agitation speed of 200 rpm as shown in the supplementary fig s6 6 8 14 1 and 20 4 of atrazine were adsorbed on l gqs surface after 30 min when the dosages of l gqs were 5 g l 1 10 g l 1 and 15 g l 1 respectively prolongation of adsorption time up to 90 min did not change the adsorption amount significantly indicating that 30 min was a suitable time for adsorption process at an agitation speed of 200 rpm compared with the catalytic ozonation process in the following 30 min presented in fig 5 the contribution of atrazine removed by adsorption was not dominant ozonation alone achieved 89 degradation measured by hplc after 30 min and 25 0 mineralization measured by toc after 60 min respectively fig 5 a and b introducing l gqs significantly enhanced both atrazine degradation and mineralization at various l gqs dosages for instance catalytic ozonation with 5 g l 1 l gqs lead to almost complete atrazine degradation after 20 min and 54 3 mineralization was subsequently achieved after 60 min although increasing l gqs dosages from 10 g l 1 to 15 g l 1 barely improved the atrazine degradation rate the mineralization rate was further enhanced by 10 2 reaching a total of 77 2 since the rate constant between o3 and atrazine is very low k o3 atz 6 0 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2000 it is obvious that other more potent ros were generated during the catalytic ozonation process it has been widely reported that ozone could decompose into oh in the presence of a catalyst in the reaction and the generated oh can react rapidly with atrazine k oh atz 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2018 ma and graham 2000 in order to detect the role of oh tba was used as a strong radical scavenger which reacts rapidly with oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 but not significantly with ozone 3 0 10 3 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig 5 a the presence of tba markedly inhibited the degradation of atrazine in both ozone alone and l gqs catalyzed ozonation processes indicating that oh was the dominant ros the degradation efficiency of atrazine significantly decreased from 89 to 42 after 30 min with the addition of tba during the sole ozonation process proving eventually direct ozonation of atrazine also accounted for a considerable part of the degradation compared with ozonation alone the degradation of atrazine was less inhibited in the presence of the same amount of tba but in presence of the l gqs catalyst this is mainly because tba can only scavenge the oh in the solution but was unable to suppress the oh generated on the surface of l gqs such oh was able to react with the adsorbed atrazine nearby directly before scavenged by tba these results suggest that the surface of l gqs was mainly responsible for ozone decomposition oh generation and atrazine degradation it should be pointed out that the catalyst dosages 5 15 g l 1 in this study is quite large compared with some other previous studies 0 1 1 g l 1 bai et al 2016 he et al 2012 that is because the l gqs used in this study are granules with average diameter of 4 mm see supplementary fig s7 instead of nano sized or micron sized small particles compare with other commonly used catalysts such as feooh density 4 30 g cm 3 lemaire et al 2004 mno2 4 80 g cm 3 fischer et al 2007 and tio2 3 89 4 25 g cm 3 armstrong et al 2006 the density of l gqs was only 2 36 g cm 3 during the catalytic ozonation processes the l gqs catalyst was churned with the assist of stirrer and bubbles coming well in contact with the ozone and atrazine in solution additionally the presence of l gqs could disturb the rising paths of ozone bubbles and adsorb some ozone molecules due to the rich silanols content of its surface to prevent ozone escaping from the solution too fast however with an average diameter of 4 mm the l gqs related phenomena may be limited by mass transfer in order to determine the effect of particle sizes of l gqs small l gqs particles were first prepared by mechanical disruption of granular l gqs and then passed through a series of sieves to isolate size fractions finally three l gqs with average particle sizes of 1 mm between 16 and 18 mesh 500 μm between 30 and 35 mesh and 100 μm between 140 and 170 mesh were achieved and their ability for catalytic atrazine removal during ozonation processes were also investigated as shown in the supplementary fig s8 a decreasing the particle size of l gqs significantly leads to higher atrazine adsorption in the first 30 min and more rapid atrazine degradation in the rest of 20 min when the particle size of l gqs decreased from 4 mm to 100 μm the adsorption amount of atrazine increased ca 6 9 fold and the total atrazine removal time was also reduced by more than 10 min the doc abatement rates for the l gqs with different particle sizes follow the same trends as their atrazine degradation performance illustrated in supplementary fig s8 b these results suggest that lower particle sizes significantly decrease the mass transfer resistances which is in agreement with other studies beltrán et al 2009 aguinaco et al 2011 however the synchronicity between the particle size and catalytic ability of the catalyst poses a dilemma since lower particle size is not conducive to the separation of l gqs from solution after treatment while larger particle size will cause serious mass transfer resistances in an effort to balance the opposing phenomena l gqs with diameter of 4 mm was chosen as the appropriate catalyst in this study since the ozone bubble and agitation could also reduce the mass transfer resistances after the reaction the apparatus stopped stirring and the 4 mm l gqs settled to the bottom of the reactor in which was separated easily from reaction solution therefore l gqs can be a potential catalyst for industrial catalytic ozonation processes 3 2 2 ph dependence of the catalytic ozonation performance the atrazine degradation by l gqs catalyzed ozonation was found to be highly dependent on the solution ph value which affected the decomposition rate of ozone and surface properties of catalysts as shown in supplementary fig s9 a both the atrazine adsorption amount and degradation rate were strongly influenced by the change of solution ph only 5 0 and 6 8 of atrazine was adsorbed by 5 g l 1 of l gqs at ph 9 0 and 7 0 when the initial ph was adjusted to 5 0 and 3 0 the adsorption of atrazine increased to 13 1 and 28 2 these observations can be better understood considering both the speciation of atrazine pk a and the surface charge of the l gqs with respect to solution ph and catalyst phpzc since the phpzc of l gqs was measured as 2 0 supplementary fig s10 the surface of l gqs is 90 negative charged deprotonated form at ph 3 0 and almost all negative charged at ph 5 0 and above on the other hand ca 3 9 of atrazine pk a 1 6 was still in protonated form at ph 3 0 and almost all of the atrazine was in neutral form above ph 5 0 therefore the affinity of l gqs for atrazine under low ph conditions was strengthened explaining the increase in atrazine adsorption capacity in addition the doc removal of atrazine during the adsorption period see supplementary fig s11 a was correlated with the atrazine removal shown in supplementary fig s9 a indicating that this part of atrazine was removed by the adsorption on l gqs instead of direct degradation during the catalytic ozonation process a significant decrease of the atrazine degradation was observed with the ph decreased from 9 0 to 3 0 fig s9 a oh acted as an initiator to induce ozone decomposition yielding oh especially at alkaline condition yan et al 2016 under these conditions the atrazine degradation kinetics were fitted to a pseudo first order reaction the fitting and calculation processes for reaction order and rate constant k are shown in supplementary text s1 and results were shown in supplementary fig s9 b the k at ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were 0 0524 min 1 0 0894 min 1 0 1407 min 1 and 0 2538 min 1 respectively supplementary fig s9 b the doc removal supplementary fig s11 a revealed the same trend but the influence of ph is not as pronounced as atrazine degradation in the presence of l gqs the values of the pseudo first order k for the doc removal of atrazine were determined to be 0 0054 min 1 0 0076 min 1 0 0085 min 1 and 0 0113 min 1 at ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively supplementary fig s11 b considering both catalysts adsorption ability at low ph and oh induced oh generation at high ph l gqs catalytic ozonation could always achieve satisfactory atrazine degradation rate furthermore the k for atrazine degradation at ph 9 0 boosted ca 4 84 fold compared with ph 3 0 while the k for doc removal only increased ca 2 09 fold indicating that the mineralization was mainly achieved by oh generated on the surface of l gqs rather than induced by oh in solution it seems that the l gqs surface not only accelerated ozone decomposition and oh generation but also provided active sites for atrazine and intermediates adsorption and reaction with oxidants o3 or oh besides it is interesting to note that the apparent atrazine desorption was monitored at ph 3 0 supplementary fig s11 a these experimental results suggest that the surface adsorbed atrazine would be replaced by ozone and the atrazine degradation intermediates would desorb from l gqs surface rapidly the typical surface catalyzed ozonation suggests that three steps would happen on the surface of catalysts involving i ozone and target compounds adsorption ii surface reaction and iii intermediates desorption faria et al 2008 according to our experimental results the l gqs catalytic ozonation also followed these steps 3 2 3 effect of temperature atrazine degradations in presence absence of the l gqs catalyst the atrazine degradation combined with doc removal by ozonation with and without the presence of l gqs as a function of the reaction temperature from 278 k to 293 k was studied shown in supplementary fig s12 and fig s13 respectively a slight decrease in the adsorption capacity of l gqs was observed when temperature decreases fig s12 a the reduced adsorption capacity could be attributed to the declining in intraparticle diffusion at low temperature since diffusion is an endothermic process akhtar et al 2011 on the other hand a decrease in temperature might make atrazine more difficult to overcome the boundary layer resistance of l gqs surface since the boundary layer would become thinner liu et al 2015a njoku and hameed 2011 bulut and aydin 2006 these two forces were presumed to be relatively strong at low temperatures considering the potential mass transfer resistances induced by the 4 mm diameter of l gqs the agitation speed may reduce this negative effect as presented in fig s6 a series of experiments were carried out by varying the agitation speed 0 rpm 50 rpm 100 rpm 200 rpm and 400 rpm while keeping all other factors constant the atrazine adsorption on l gqs surface clearly increased from 6 5 to 24 5 in 90 min when increasing agitation speed from 0 to 450 rpm on the other hand the adsorption time decreased with the increasing agitation speed these phenomena appear commonly in heterogeneous aops especially at the ones utilizing porous catalysts yagub et al 2012 gupta et al 2011 confirming that the adsorption behavior of atrazine on l gqs was strongly influenced by mass transfer in addition the adsorption time and total adsorption amount changed slightly when the agitation speed increased from 200 rpm to 400 rpm suggesting that 200 rpm could be the suitable agitation speed in this study the k for atrazine degradation followed pseudo first order at various temperatures as given in supplementary fig s12 b at different temperatures catalytic ozonation always revealed higher k than sole ozonation the change of temperature did not have significant effect on atrazine degradation in the presence of l gqs these trends were more noticeable during the doc removal see supplementary fig s13 a more specifically i the pseudo first order k of l gqs catalyzed ozonation was almost unchanged after the reaction temperature decreased from 293 k to 278 k while that of ozone alone decreased ca 4 fold shown in supplementary fig s13 b and ii as depicted in supplementary fig s13 a the addition of l gqs enhanced the k of atrazine degradation by ca 3 6 fold at 278 k 3 4 fold at 283 k and 2 0 fold at 293 k respectively these results indicated that both atrazine and doc removal strongly rely on the catalytic ability of l gqs especially under low temperature condition 3 3 assessing the feasibility of the catalytic ozonation process in natural waters nom is widely present in natural waters and its concentration varies in different kinds of water bodies river creek lake and groundwater liu et al 2015b since nom has a significant effect on the ozonation process it is therefore of great importance to study their impact on catalytic ozonation in the presence of l gqs in this study suwanee river natural organic matter srnom was used as the model nom and the suva254 value of srnom was 3 9 l mg 1 m 1 fig 6 a presents the atrazine degradation in presence of various concentrations of srnom from 0 mg l 1 doc to 5 mg l 1 doc for both sole and catalytic ozonation introducing nom into the solution accelerate the atrazine degradation process especially for the plain ozonation process the degradation efficiency of atrazine was 69 2 after 10 min ozonation time in the presence of 1 mg l 1 doc of srnom and increased to 94 4 at the same reaction time in the presence of 5 mg l 1 doc of srnom also when the concentrations of srnom increased the rapid atrazine degradation stages during the first 1 min of reactions appeared more clearly during the ozonation processes without l gqs literature has not reached a consensus concerning the effect of nom during ozonation intuitively one would assume that nom has an inhibitory effect several studies reported that introducing nom or humic acid would retard the target compounds degradation efficiency however other works revealed that nom or humic acid could enhance the degradation rate and in others to show no effect ikhlaq et al 2014 2015 gracia et al 2000 under our experimental conditions the added srnom did not act as the competitor for atrazine degradation to consuming ozone and oh the function of the added srnom was more of a promoter for radical chain reactions which played an important role in accelerating ozone decomposition and hence radical formation the aromatic moieties and aliphatic unsaturated constituents in srnom components could be easily oxidized by molecular ozone and spark the radical chain reactions generating more oh von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for the catalytic ozonation in the presence of srnom the increase of atrazine degradation rate was not as profound compared with the absence of srnom the presence of 5 mg l 1 doc of srnom increased the atrazine degradation efficiency by only about 21 within 10 min this is mainly because the l gqs has already provided potent oh generation thus the effect of nom was not significant concerning doc removal although the presence of nom for sole ozonation enhanced the degradation rate of atrazine the doc removal ability decreased gradually following the increase concentrations of added srnom shown in fig 6 b although the enhanced atrazine depletion rate revealed the ability of srnom to initial the radical chain reactions the generated oh was insufficient to reduce the increased doc amount provided by srnom themselves due to the fact that srnom has limited amount of electron rich moieties phenols amines olefins etc which could readily react with ozone the oh generation ability of srnom was restricted and the radical chain reactions were most likely soon terminated by the lack of these functional groups liu et al 2015b the opposite effect was observed for catalytic ozonation process where the oh was provided continuously by the active sites on the surface of l gqs through ozone decomposition combined with the increasing amount of initial total doc concentration and the radical chain initiation ability provided by the introducing srnom the doc removal rates increased gradually with the increasing srnom in the solution the catalytic ozonation performance experiments for l gqs and atrazine in a natural water matrix were also investigated using sh river water as the tested water source as can be seen in fig 7 both atrazine degradation and doc removal rate were enhanced in sh river water compared with those in control experiment using di water as water source the depletion of atrazine was almost identical in sh river water for both catalyzed and non catalyzed ozonation process achieving nearly 100 atrazine degradation after 20 min reaction although the doc abatement efficiencies were quite different changing water source to sh river water significantly reduced the doc removal from 25 0 to 8 9 at 60 min for non catalyzed ozonation process but achieved slight enhancement from 54 3 to 58 8 at 60 min for catalytic ozonation with l gqs these results were very similar to those presented in the ozonation process with srnom fig 6 however although the sh river water also contains the similar amount of doc 5 4 mg l 1 as 5 mg l 1 doc of srnom the atrazine degradation and doc removal for catalyzed ozonation seems reduced in sh river water in addition to the advantages of nom in both srnom and sh river water mentioned in the last paragraph the different component of the nom and the inorganic matters co3 2 hco3 cl and po4 3 may also effect the catalytic ozonation process in some extent during aops treatment processes co3 2 hco3 and cl were commonly considered as the radical scavengers which could retard the organic compounds abatement atrazine and nom by consuming oh and generating less reactivity carbonate radical co3 and chlorine radical cl luo et al 2015 and phosphate is a well known radical scavenger which could not only consume the generated oh but also block the active sites of catalyst resulting in reducing the oh produce ability of l gqs wang et al 2018 nevertheless the overall net effect shows an improvement hence the use of the process in an actual contaminated water source is highly possible since no inhibition is observed 3 4 catalyst stability and re use potential the catalytic stability and reusability are important parameters to consider in a potential application as they directly influence the process costs the reusability of l gqs was investigated by reusing the same catalyst batch in ten consequent catalytic ozonation cycles the adsorption processes were performed for 30 min before each cycle of experiments and the data are presented as the points at 0 min during the first five successive processes the l gqs catalyst kept in the reactor without any purification and only the treated solution was changed for each cycle as shown in fig 8 the doc removal abilities of atrazine decreased successively from 54 3 for the 1st run to 40 2 for the 5th run meanwhile the adsorption capacity of l gqs decreased more rapidly from 7 for the 1st run to less than 1 for the 5th run this might be due to the adsorption of intermediates formed during the ozonation processes after the first five successive processes l gqs catalyst was collected regenerated washed with di water 3 times then dried in an oven at 60 c overnight after the regeneration process both the atrazine adsorption capacity 6 and doc removal ability 53 of l gqs obtained in 6th cycle was recovered almost to the original state 1st run although a decreasing trend was seen in the following 4 cycles more than 38 of doc removal were still achieved within 60 min reaction for each run the xrd results of used catalyst seen in fig 2 after 10 runs which was identical to that of the raw l gqs revealed good stability of l gqs the fe sem image of the used l gqs after 10 times reuse is shown in fig s1 b the surface morphology of the l gqs did not considerably change even after the 10 reusing processes the surface of the l gqs was still composed of the irregular particles with average diameters of 100 200 nm indicating that these irregular particles were bound each other tightly to form the macroscopic l gqs with average diameters of 4 mm it is also the main reason why l gqs was porous and observed in low density in conclusion the l gqs is an efficient catalyst for repetitive catalytic ozonation process with regenerative capacity 3 5 intermediates analysis and dechlorination of atrazine samples corresponding to degradation times of 0 5 10 20 30 45 and 60 min were retrieved to detect atrazine oxidation intermediates and to assess their quantitative evolution with reaction time fig 10 five different compounds retaining their s triazine ring structure during removal were found by means of lc qtof ms ms and the dechlorination of atrazine during ozonation was quantified by ic the structures molecular weights abbreviations and full names of atrazine and the identified s triazine compounds are presented in fig s14 ceat deisopropylatrazine and cait deethylatrazine were previously reported to be the primary intermediates of atrazine formed in majority of the aops acero et al 2000 khan et al 2014 sacco et al 2015 here fig 10 a depicted the degradation of atrazine and the evolution of ceat and cait as well as the molar balance although ceat and cait were the primary degradation products for both sole and catalytic ozonation their concentrations as a function of time were quite different for ozone alone ceat and cait generated immediately at the very initial stage and kept increasing to 11 46 μm and 15 7 μm at 45 min then decreased gradually to 9 84 μm and 13 2 μm at 60 min the accumulation of these primary degradation products during the sole ozonation process showed that ozone and the generated oh mainly attacked atrazine which underwent the de alkylation process and the degradation of ceat and cait only occurred at the very late stage however with the presence of catalyst l gqs the concentration of ceat and cait peaked at 5 min then decreased rapidly to undetectable levels within 60 min the rapid primary intermediates degradation rate shows that more oh generated through l gqs induced ozone decomposition participated in the reaction and accelerated the whole intermediates transformation process lutze et al 2015 reported that different molar ratio of cait ceat was observed during the degradation of atrazine by different ros where the molar ratio of cait ceat can be calculated to be ca 3 for oh based oxidations product yields depicted in fig 10 a indicated that the molar ratios of cait ceat for sole ozonation and l gqs catalyzed ozonation process were 1 34 1 46 and 2 41 3 44 respectively indicating that the atrazine degradation was mainly induced by oh for the l gqs catalyzed ozonation process on the other hand the low molar ratios of cait ceat for the sole ozonation process also suggested and verified our previous hypothesis that molecule ozone contributed significantly to atrazine degradation since the sole ozonation process could not generate an adequate amount of oh the secondary intermediates it generated were less than that in catalytic ozonation process the molecule fragmentation is suggested to be less intense hence the smaller number of detected intermediates more specifically as shown in fig 10 b the concentration of oait for l gqs catalyzed ozonation achieved the maximum of 1 15 μm at the reaction time of 15 min and then decreased to 0 48 μm at 60 min verifying its further transformation independently the concentration of oait reached the peak of 0 68 μm at the very initial stage of reaction then decreased in the following 60 min indicating that they were most probably generated by oh attack which were generated due to the initiators in solution at the first few minutes very small amount of oeit below 0 1 μm was also detected in both sole ozonation and catalytic ozonation the generation of oeit can be explained by oh attack toward the chloro group through dechlorination hydroxylation process since oh preferred to attack the ethyl and isopropyl groups than chloro group the concentration of oeit was quite low compared with that of cait and ceat the final products such as caat and oaat were undetectable for sole ozonation whereas the degradation of atrazine with l gqs led to their formation fig 10 b the concentration of oaat increased rapidly in the whole catalytic ozonation process and finally reached 1 54 μm at 60 min the accumulation of oaat suggested that ring opening reaction is difficult to happen during the atrazine degradation due to the stability of piperazine ring structure the relatively low concentration of caat compared with oaat also proved that dechlorination was achieved during the intermediates transformation the molar balance in then presented in fig 10 b the molar balance during ozonation slowly decreased to 46 of initial atrazine concentration after 60 min while for the l gqs catalyzed ozonation process the molar balance rapidly decreased to 8 6 of initial atrazine concentration after 30 min and to 4 2 after 60 min because of the rapid transformation of the primary intermediates such as cait and ceat with the rapid degradation of the primary intermediates for catalytic ozonation more unidentified degradation intermediates were formed and higher loss of molar balance than that for ozonation alone was obtained the doc mass balance presented in fig 10 c also followed the same trend as molar balance for the same reason dechlorination is an important process during atrazine degradation because the undechlorinated intermediates were considered as ecotoxic as atrazine sharing the same toxicology belfroid et al 1998 to evaluate the ecotoxicology of atrazine degradation products the concentration of chloride ions cl was carried out by ic and presented in fig 10 d only 16 8 μm of cl was generated after 60 min reaction for ozonation alone the degradation of atrazine by l gqs catalyzed ozonation lead to the formation of more dechlorinated intermediates 37 8 μm of cl were obtained after 60 min with the attack of adequate oh we can conclude from the result that catalytic ozonation in the presence of l gqs not only enhanced the mineralization of atrazine but may also reduce the toxicity of atrazine intermediates due to the dechlorination process 3 6 integrated proposal of atrazine degradation mechanism the atrazine degradation results demonstrated that adding the l gqs would promote ozone decomposition effectively during the ozonation process previous studies revealed that most of the catalysts decomposed ozone into various ros including oh superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 while the rest proceeded through nonradical pathways zhang et al 2011 since the tba inhibition experiment shown in fig 5 a illustrated oh was the main l gqs ros generated during the reaction epr technique combined with dmpo spin trapping agent was used for gaining a better understanding of the mechanism of l gqs catalyzed ozonation as shown in fig 9 both sole and catalytic ozonation demonstrated strong epr signal of dmpo oh adduct at the initial reaction stage 1 min but the signal of ozone alone was weaker than that of l gqs catalyzed ozonation the formation of the dmpo oh adduct could be explained by the rapid reaction ability of initiator with ozone and the enhanced signal of dmpo oh adduct was attributed to the ozone decomposition induced capacity provided by l gqs after sole ozonation of atrazine for 5 min mixing the withdrawn sample with dmpo spin trapping agent obtained nearly invisible dmpo oh adduct signal while the signal of catalytic ozonation still remained clearly identifiable under the same experimental conditions therefore the oh for atrazine degradation after the initial stage was mainly produced from ozone decomposition on the surface of l gqs combining the experimental data with the characterization results of xps ftir and pyridine ftir we proposed that the hydroxyl groups the bronsted acid sites and the lewis acid sites on the surface of l gqs all contribute to the atrazine adsorption ozone decomposition and oh generation based on the experimental and characterization results as well as the results from relevant studies in literature gallard and de laat 2000 bing et al 2015 2017 the possible integrated mechanism is hereby formulated and presented in scheme 1 in the reaction solution with ph ranging from 3 0 to 9 0 the surface hydroxyl groups of l gqs were predominately existed as deprotonated form o due to the relatively low phpzc 2 0 of l gqs when molecular ozone in solution contacted with the neighboring l gqs they could be readily captured by surface bronsted acid sites 19 3 μmol g 1 and weak lewis acid sites 122 2 μmol g 1 on the surface of l gqs the adsorption ability of l gqs for ozone was mainly contributed to the surface silanols si oh bronsted acid sites and tri coordinated silicon atoms weak lewis acid sites with the assistance of these surface groups the ozone readily gathered on the surface of l gqs since the bronsted acid sites and weak lewis acid sites are unable to induce direct ozone decomposition fujita et al 2004 the gathered ozone on the surface of l gqs with the assistance of these surface groups would be further decomposed by strong and medium lewis acid sites 33 5 μmol g 1 thanks to the coordinated aluminum oxide species and the iron oxy hydroxides the strong and medium lewis acid sites could rapidly decompose molecular ozone into oxygen and active oxygen species then these active oxygen species could react with other molecular ozone molecular or dissociated water and finally generate oh zhu et al 2017 in addition the adsorption experiments presented in supplementary fig s9 a exhibited the ability of l gqs for atrazine adsorption from ph 3 0 to 9 0 the generated oh was able to attack the adsorbed atrazine readily and timely since the lifetime of oh was extremely short li et al 2016 finally the proposed activity is suggested to be continued towards the degradation of the formed intermediates 4 conclusions in this study the enhanced catalytic activities of l gqs catalyst for improvement of the ozonation of atrazine were investigated l gqs can be churned up in the stirring assisted bubble column reactor with appropriate stirring speed and superficial gas velocity the detailed material characterization techniques applied here elucidated the crystal phases element components surface hydroxyl groups as well as the surface bronsted acid sites and lewis acid sites of l gqs this allowed postulating the atrazine degradation mechanism based on the surface properties of l gqs epr measurements confirmed that the surface oh generated from catalytic decomposition of ozone was the dominant ros in the reaction system compared with sole ozonation l gqs catalyzed ozonation not only presented more efficient atrazine degradation and doc removal rates but also may reduce the potential toxicity effects of atrazine degradation by products according to analysis of ic and lc qtof ms ms a similar enhancing effect of doc abatement was also observed in natural water despite the presence of nom since the l gqs exhibited wide application range and could be easily separated from the solution the l gqs based stirring assisted bubble column reactor provided a useful basis for further work on the application of heterogeneous ozone based oxidation treatment declaration of interests the authors declare that

19140,a light weight granular mixed quartz sand denoted as l gqs combined with stirring assisted bubble column reactor was firstly applied in catalytic ozonation of atrazine the l gqs with a density of 2 36 g cm 3 and average diameter of ca of 4 mm was readily churned up and uniformly distributed within the solution in the reactor the introduction of l gqs was found to exhibit enhanced catalytic ozonation of atrazine with the increase in degradation rate and the dissolved organic carbon doc removal being more than 2 fold for the catalytic process l gqs dosage 5 g l 1 atrazine 0 50 μm o3 25 mg

material xrd xps ftir fe sem eds bet and phpzc revealed that l gqs consisted of α quartz β cristobalite anorthoclase and small amount of iron oxy hydroxides hydroxyl groups bronsted acid sites and lewis acid sites on the surface of l gqs all contributed to the atrazine adsorption ozone decomposition and oh generation the l gqs catalyzed ozonation exhibited superior atrazine degradation and mineralization rates in a wide range of ph 3 0 9 0 and reaction temperatures 278 k 293 k also an enhancement of doc abatement was observed both in presence of natural organic matter isolates and natural water matrices river water when l gqs was used finally the degradation mechanism was proposed based on the intermediates and by products formation analyzed by lc qtof ms ms and ionic chromatography our results indicate that the l gqs combined with stirring assisted bubble column reactor could be utilized as an enhancement of ozone based advanced oxidation processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords catalytic ozonation mixed quartz sand atrazine hydroxyl radical heterogeneous catalysis 1 introduction over the last decades the environmental pollution issue by recalcitrant compounds and especially those of synthetic organic nature has become a worldwide challenging problem as new chemicals are being continuously manufactured and discharged into the aquatic environment among these substances we find pesticides herbicides and fungicides which are frequently utilized synthetic organics responding to the need of improving agricultural productivity sprayed in agricultural fields they usually enter the aquatic environment readily in the form of diffuse contamination via further surface run off leaching and or erosion rodriguez mozaz et al 2004 so far more than 1200 kinds of herbicides and 2200 kinds of fungicides are in active use according to the national pesticide information center npic npic 2018 atrazine is an herbicide which has been extensively and commonly employed for more than 60 years hence it has been frequently detected in drinking water in the us eu and china in the past decades loos et al 2010 although atrazine was banned in eu in 2003 it is still widely used in other countries thus it is typically detected in surface waters basfar et al 2009 therefore specific treatment methods are called for its elimination especially the advanced oxidation processes aops which offer remarkable treatment efficiency taking on particular significance on its elimination prior dissemination to natural water bodies hydroxyl radical oh based aops have gained significant attention providing an effective solution towards the degradation of refractory pollutants in aquatic environments it is demonstrated that oh are highly active e oh h2o 2 73 v but short lived so they can only be generated in situ and react instantaneously while unselectively with various compounds gligorovski et al 2015 currently oh based aops such as fenton process tio2 photo catalysis uv o3 uv h2o2 and catalytic ozonation have been investigated for enhancing the production of oh during treatment in past studies gallard et al reported an excellent oxidation ability of atrazine by the fe iii h2o2 process but the ph conditions were very low ph 1 3 gallard and de laat 2000 rosenfeldt et al 2006 used atrazine as model compound to compare the efficiency of oh formation during o3 o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 and the results revealed that ozone based aops were more energy efficient than the uv h2o2 process under neutral ph conditions the results of these studies indicated that ozone based aops were suitable technologies for refractory contaminants destruction and especially atrazine heterogeneous catalytic ozonation an efficient ozone based aop obtains superior capacity for degradation and mineralization of atrazine due to the introduction of solid catalysts wang et al 2018 it is believed that the heterogeneous surface is able to promote ozone decomposition and further generate reactive oxygen species ros mainly oh 1o2 or o2 bing et al 2017 minerals are among the commonly used catalysts for catalytic ozonation natural minerals are abundantly distributed in the earth s crust easily accessible non toxic easy to recycle and cost effective when compared with synthetic metal oxides metal supported compounds and carbonaceous matters nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 zhang et al 2008 several minerals have been studied as potential catalysts of the ozonation process such as perovskite zhao et al 2013 zeolite amin et al 2010 brucite he et al 2008 and bauxite qi et al 2009 the main components of these minerals were al2o3 sio2 mgo fe2o3 and some other oxides contained na k and ca in the majority of the mineral related catalytic ozonation studies the target pollutants were degraded by oh which is generated from ozone decomposition on the surface of the minerals dong et al 2007 wang et al 2018 amin et al 2010 qi et al 2009 evidently the surface active sites and chemical properties of the minerals played key roles on contaminants destruction so far only a few studies reported the engineering applications of natural mineral related catalytic ozonation he et al 2008 qi et al 2009 in our previous work a cylindrical ceramic honeycomb 50 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length has been reported as an efficient mineral based material for catalytic ozonation zhao et al 2008a further doping metallic elements such as cu zhao et al 2009a 2009b and mn zhao et al 2008b 2010 on ceramic honeycomb achieved higher pollutants mineralization however the used of ceramic honeycomb which is an industrial product would increase the cost of water treatment the pores of the ceramic honeycomb were also easy to clog hence these limitations need to be addressed it is still necessary to select appropriate natural minerals as efficient catalysts to expand the practical applications of mineral related catalytic ozonation in these materials we encounter silica a group of minerals which exists naturally as sand quartz and flint are earth abundant due to its main component of two most abundant elements in earth s crust silicon and oxygen grant and long 1981 because of their ease of fabrication low cost and resistance to chemical attacks the granular quartz sands or micro silica particles are widely used as cement additives refractory materials or oil well drilling mud otero gonzález et al 2015 in this study a new kind of light weight granular mixed quartz sand hereon l gqs was applied for the first time as a novel heterogeneous catalyst for the ozonation process the buoyant l gqs could mix with solution uniformity under an adequate ozone gas velocity in a stirring assisted bubble column reactor detail will be shown in experimental section the l gqs was characterized in detail and atrazine was chosen as the model refractory contaminant to evaluate the catalytic ability of the process this manuscript is focused on the function of l gqs surface characteristics and the parameters of the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of atrazine to address the need for higher catalytic efficiency in a lower cost in particular the effect of key factors affecting catalytic process such as ph temperature particle sizes agitation speed natural organic matter nom and reactive species are analyzed

obtained under the following conditions x field sweep with sweep width of 80 00 g center field 3475 00 g frequency 9 76 ghz power 40 50 mw the sample was scanned with signals accumulated for 10 times 20 48 s each scan 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of catalysts fig 2 shows the xrd results of the fresh and used l gqs samples it was found that the xrd peaks of the fresh l gqs sample in the 2θ range of 20 80 could be well indexed as the mixture of standard samples of α quartz jcpds no 85 1054 β cristobalite jcpds no 89 3607 and anorthoclase jcpds no 10 0361 all of which belong to the space group p3221 with hexagonal structure p213 with cubic structure and p 1 with anorthic structure respectively the characteristic diffraction peaks which are observed at 2θ of 20 86 26 64 36 54 39 47 42 45 50 14 60 00 68 14 and 68 31 are in good agreement with the 100 011 110 102 200 112 121 203 and 031 crystal planes of α quartz moreover the peaks appeared at 2θ of 21 76 28 20 35 90 and 56 71 correspond to the β cristobalite 111 012 220 and 331 crystal planes the rest of the peaks located at 23 68 27 55 and 27 82 were well consistent with the 1 30 202 and 002 plane of the anorthoclase standard pattern no other impurity peaks were observed from the xrd patterns as such α quartz and β cristobalite were the major ingredients of l gqs while the proportion of anorthoclase in l gqs was quite low according to the peak intensities of xrd patterns following the xrd pattern for l gqs after 10 successive reuse cycles of catalytic ozonation is also presented in fig 2 the fresh and used l gqs were almost identical in crystalline and peaks intensities indicating that the crystal structure of l gqs remained unchanged during the catalytic ozonation process the morphology of l gqs is presented in the fe sem picture see supplementary fig s1 a the l gqs has a porous surface and the l gqs granules consist of irregular particles with average diameter of 100 200 nm the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curves of l gqs are shown in the supplementary fig s2 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of l gqs exhibited the character of type iv with type h4 hysteresis loops according to the iupac classification indicating the capillary condensation taking place in a typical mesoporous structure sing et al 1985 thommes et al 2015 the bet surface area mesopore volumes and average pore diameter of l gqs were measured as 58 m2 g 1 0 344 cm3 g 1 and 12 7 nm this result suggests that l gqs possess a large surface area and high pore volume which is beneficial towards achieving superior catalytic performance in the catalytic ozonation system the chemical components and chemical states of l gqs were clarified by edx and xps analysis edx elemental mapping images supplementary fig s3 reveals the chemical components of l gqs the l gqs mainly consisted of o 59 and si 23 which confirmed the result of xrd stating that l gqs was mainly composed of α quartz sio2 and β cristobalite sio2 besides o and si small amount of al 8 na 2 k 2 fe 2 ca 2 and c 2 formed anorthoclase k na alsi3o8 and other related oxides were found all these elements are homogeneously dispersed in the matrix of l gqs supplementary fig s3 illustrating its component uniformity the structure of α quartz β cristobalite and anorthoclase are shown in supplementary fig s4 the wide survey of xps spectrum supplementary fig s5 confirmed that si and o are major elements in l gqs while trace amounts of c al fe k ca and na have been also confirmed additionally high resolution xps spectra of si o al and fe are shown in fig 3 the spectrum of si fig 3 a was deconvoluted into two components the binding energy at 103 4 ev could be attributed to si o bonds in sio2 α quartz and β cristobalite whereas the peak at 102 6 ev is characteristic of si o bonds for silicate compound anorthoclase garcia guinea et al 2017 the o1 s spectrum of l gqs fig 3 b shows three fitted peaks at 530 3 531 5 and 532 5 ev which are attributed to surface lattice oxygen bridging hydroxyl group bridging oh and terminal hydroxyl group terminal oh respectively yu et al 2017 it should be noted here that the peak intensities of bridging oh and terminal oh are much higher than lattice oxygen this means that the majority of oxygen on the l gqs surface exists as hydroxyl group which is very important for catalytic activity furthermore the peak of al 2p in fig 3 c centered at 74 1 ev is generally accepted as al3 ellis et al 2016 fig 3 d obtains the spectrum of fe 2p with relative high intensity background noise due to its trace amount the two peaks centered at 711 9 and 725 1 ev could be assigned to the core levels of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively with splitting energy of 13 2 ev revealing the characterization of the oxidation state of fe3 according to previously research this is the characteristic splitting energy of iron oxy hydroxides structure was shown in the supplementary fig s4 d probably goethite katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 in addition a satellite peak of fe 2p3 2 could also be observed at 719 0 ev in fig 3 d ftir spectrum and pyridine ftir were used to investigate the surface groups of l gqs and the results are presented in fig 4 ftir study fig 4 a shows that the l gqs exhibits a broad band in the range of 3200 3700 cm 1 which relates to both the vibrations of surface bonded oh group from water h oh and surface silanols si oh zhou et al 2018 the absorption band at 1636 cm 1 corresponds to the bending mode of oh groups which can interact through hydrogen bonds with surface si oh the bands at 1086 and 810 cm 1 belong to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of si o si respectively the band at 463 cm 1 assigns to si o stretching vibrations as well the very low band near 691 cm 1 related to al o indicating the existence of trace amount of surface aluminum related groups arshadi et al 2017 hence the ftir results clearly reveal that hydroxyl groups si oh or h oh exist widely on l gqs surface fig 4 b illustrates the pyridine ftir over l gqs at 423 k and 623 k pyridine discriminates i strong and medium lewis acid sites ii weak lewis acid sites and iii bronsted acid sites since they interact with pyridine by electron pair donation hydrogen bonding and hydroxyl groups respectively jentys et al 1996 the obvious ir bands at around 1450 and 1620 cm 1 are the characteristic bands of strong lewis acid while band at 1490 cm 1 corresponds to pyridine adsorbed onto both lewis and bronsted acid sites the characteristic absorption peak of pyridine can be assigned to bronsted acid sites at the wave number of 1545 cm 1 according to previous study the amounts and categories of acid sites could be calculated by the pyridine ftir curves at 423 k and 623 k emeis 1993 the total amount of acid sites on the l gqs surface was 175 0 μmol g 1 155 7 μmol g 1 ca 89 of which were surface lewis acid sites and the others were bronsted acid sites ca 11 the bronsted acid sites were predominately contributed to the surface hydroxyl groups mainly si oh groups considering the results presented by xps analysis ward 1967 the surface lewis acid sites could be further divided into two categories the surface strong and medium lewis acid sites were 33 5 μmol g 1 ca 21 5 while the weak lewis acid sites were 122 2 μmol g 1 ca 78 5 the weak lewis acid sites were attributed to perturbed si oh vibrations due to hydrogen bonding of pyridine to hydroxyl groups whereas the strong and medium lewis acid sites were attributed to the coordinated aluminum oxide species and iron oxy hydroxides jentys et al 1996 ward 1967 bing et al 2015 3 2 catalytic ozonation mediated degradation of atrazine parameters and degradation mechanisms 3 2 1 effect of catalyst loading and process conditions the catalytic activity of l gqs with various dosages was evaluated by the degradation of atrazine 50 μm with ozone at an initial ph of 7 0 adsorption experiments were first carried out and quantification of the adsorbed atrazine amounts was performed by hplc to determine the appropriate adsorption time with an agitation speed of 200 rpm as shown in the supplementary fig s6 6 8 14 1 and 20 4 of atrazine were adsorbed on l gqs surface after 30 min when the dosages of l gqs were 5 g l 1 10 g l 1 and 15 g l 1 respectively prolongation of adsorption time up to 90 min did not change the adsorption amount significantly indicating that 30 min was a suitable time for adsorption process at an agitation speed of 200 rpm compared with the catalytic ozonation process in the following 30 min presented in fig 5 the contribution of atrazine removed by adsorption was not dominant ozonation alone achieved 89 degradation measured by hplc after 30 min and 25 0 mineralization measured by toc after 60 min respectively fig 5 a and b introducing l gqs significantly enhanced both atrazine degradation and mineralization at various l gqs dosages for instance catalytic ozonation with 5 g l 1 l gqs lead to almost complete atrazine degradation after 20 min and 54 3 mineralization was subsequently achieved after 60 min although increasing l gqs dosages from 10 g l 1 to 15 g l 1 barely improved the atrazine degradation rate the mineralization rate was further enhanced by 10 2 reaching a total of 77 2 since the rate constant between o3 and atrazine is very low k o3 atz 6 0 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2000 it is obvious that other more potent ros were generated during the catalytic ozonation process it has been widely reported that ozone could decompose into oh in the presence of a catalyst in the reaction and the generated oh can react rapidly with atrazine k oh atz 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2018 ma and graham 2000 in order to detect the role of oh tba was used as a strong radical scavenger which reacts rapidly with oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 but not significantly with ozone 3 0 10 3 m 1 s 1 as shown in fig 5 a the presence of tba markedly inhibited the degradation of atrazine in both ozone alone and l gqs catalyzed ozonation processes indicating that oh was the dominant ros the degradation efficiency of atrazine significantly decreased from 89 to 42 after 30 min with the addition of tba during the sole ozonation process proving eventually direct ozonation of atrazine also accounted for a considerable part of the degradation compared with ozonation alone the degradation of atrazine was less inhibited in the presence of the same amount of tba but in presence of the l gqs catalyst this is mainly because tba can only scavenge the oh in the solution but was unable to suppress the oh generated on the surface of l gqs such oh was able to react with the adsorbed atrazine nearby directly before scavenged by tba these results suggest that the surface of l gqs was mainly responsible for ozone decomposition oh generation and atrazine degradation it should be pointed out that the catalyst dosages 5 15 g l 1 in this study is quite large compared with some other previous studies 0 1 1 g l 1 bai et al 2016 he et al 2012 that is because the l gqs used in this study are granules with average diameter of 4 mm see supplementary fig s7 instead of nano sized or micron sized small particles compare with other commonly used catalysts such as feooh density 4 30 g cm 3 lemaire et al 2004 mno2 4 80 g cm 3 fischer et al 2007 and tio2 3 89 4 25 g cm 3 armstrong et al 2006 the density of l gqs was only 2 36 g cm 3 during the catalytic ozonation processes the l gqs catalyst was churned with the assist of stirrer and bubbles coming well in contact with the ozone and atrazine in solution additionally the presence of l gqs could disturb the rising paths of ozone bubbles and adsorb some ozone molecules due to the rich silanols content of its surface to prevent ozone escaping from the solution too fast however with an average diameter of 4 mm the l gqs related phenomena may be limited by mass transfer in order to determine the effect of particle sizes of l gqs small l gqs particles were first prepared by mechanical disruption of granular l gqs and then passed through a series of sieves to isolate size fractions finally three l gqs with average particle sizes of 1 mm between 16 and 18 mesh 500 μm between 30 and 35 mesh and 100 μm between 140 and 170 mesh were achieved and their ability for catalytic atrazine removal during ozonation processes were also investigated as shown in the supplementary fig s8 a decreasing the particle size of l gqs significantly leads to higher atrazine adsorption in the first 30 min and more rapid atrazine degradation in the rest of 20 min when the particle size of l gqs decreased from 4 mm to 100 μm the adsorption amount of atrazine increased ca 6 9 fold and the total atrazine removal time was also reduced by more than 10 min the doc abatement rates for the l gqs with different particle sizes follow the same trends as their atrazine degradation performance illustrated in supplementary fig s8 b these results suggest that lower particle sizes significantly decrease the mass transfer resistances which is in agreement with other studies beltrán et al 2009 aguinaco et al 2011 however the synchronicity between the particle size and catalytic ability of the catalyst poses a dilemma since lower particle size is not conducive to the separation of l gqs from solution after treatment while larger particle size will cause serious mass transfer resistances in an effort to balance the opposing phenomena l gqs with diameter of 4 mm was chosen as the appropriate catalyst in this study since the ozone bubble and agitation could also reduce the mass transfer resistances after the reaction the apparatus stopped stirring and the 4 mm l gqs settled to the bottom of the reactor in which was separated easily from reaction solution therefore l gqs can be a potential catalyst for industrial catalytic ozonation processes 3 2 2 ph dependence of the catalytic ozonation performance the atrazine degradation by l gqs catalyzed ozonation was found to be highly dependent on the solution ph value which affected the decomposition rate of ozone and surface properties of catalysts as shown in supplementary fig s9 a both the atrazine adsorption amount and degradation rate were strongly influenced by the change of solution ph only 5 0 and 6 8 of atrazine was adsorbed by 5 g l 1 of l gqs at ph 9 0 and 7 0 when the initial ph was adjusted to 5 0 and 3 0 the adsorption of atrazine increased to 13 1 and 28 2 these observations can be better understood considering both the speciation of atrazine pk a and the surface charge of the l gqs with respect to solution ph and catalyst phpzc since the phpzc of l gqs was measured as 2 0 supplementary fig s10 the surface of l gqs is 90 negative charged deprotonated form at ph 3 0 and almost all negative charged at ph 5 0 and above on the other hand ca 3 9 of atrazine pk a 1 6 was still in protonated form at ph 3 0 and almost all of the atrazine was in neutral form above ph 5 0 therefore the affinity of l gqs for atrazine under low ph conditions was strengthened explaining the increase in atrazine adsorption capacity in addition the doc removal of atrazine during the adsorption period see supplementary fig s11 a was correlated with the atrazine removal shown in supplementary fig s9 a indicating that this part of atrazine was removed by the adsorption on l gqs instead of direct degradation during the catalytic ozonation process a significant decrease of the atrazine degradation was observed with the ph decreased from 9 0 to 3 0 fig s9 a oh acted as an initiator to induce ozone decomposition yielding oh especially at alkaline condition yan et al 2016 under these conditions the atrazine degradation kinetics were fitted to a pseudo first order reaction the fitting and calculation processes for reaction order and rate constant k are shown in supplementary text s1 and results were shown in supplementary fig s9 b the k at ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were 0 0524 min 1 0 0894 min 1 0 1407 min 1 and 0 2538 min 1 respectively supplementary fig s9 b the doc removal supplementary fig s11 a revealed the same trend but the influence of ph is not as pronounced as atrazine degradation in the presence of l gqs the values of the pseudo first order k for the doc removal of atrazine were determined to be 0 0054 min 1 0 0076 min 1 0 0085 min 1 and 0 0113 min 1 at ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively supplementary fig s11 b considering both catalysts adsorption ability at low ph and oh induced oh generation at high ph l gqs catalytic ozonation could always achieve satisfactory atrazine degradation rate furthermore the k for atrazine degradation at ph 9 0 boosted ca 4 84 fold compared with ph 3 0 while the k for doc removal only increased ca 2 09 fold indicating that the mineralization was mainly achieved by oh generated on the surface of l gqs rather than induced by oh in solution it seems that the l gqs surface not only accelerated ozone decomposition and oh generation but also provided active sites for atrazine and intermediates adsorption and reaction with oxidants o3 or oh besides it is interesting to note that the apparent atrazine desorption was monitored at ph 3 0 supplementary fig s11 a these experimental results suggest that the surface adsorbed atrazine would be replaced by ozone and the atrazine degradation intermediates would desorb from l gqs surface rapidly the typical surface catalyzed ozonation suggests that three steps would happen on the surface of catalysts involving i ozone and target compounds adsorption ii surface reaction and iii intermediates desorption faria et al 2008 according to our experimental results the l gqs catalytic ozonation also followed these steps 3 2 3 effect of temperature atrazine degradations in presence absence of the l gqs catalyst the atrazine degradation combined with doc removal by ozonation with and without the presence of l gqs as a function of the reaction temperature from 278 k to 293 k was studied shown in supplementary fig s12 and fig s13 respectively a slight decrease in the adsorption capacity of l gqs was observed when temperature decreases fig s12 a the reduced adsorption capacity could be attributed to the declining in intraparticle diffusion at low temperature since diffusion is an endothermic process akhtar et al 2011 on the other hand a decrease in temperature might make atrazine more difficult to overcome the boundary layer resistance of l gqs surface since the boundary layer would become thinner liu et al 2015a njoku and hameed 2011 bulut and aydin 2006 these two forces were presumed to be relatively strong at low temperatures considering the potential mass transfer resistances induced by the 4 mm diameter of l gqs the agitation speed may reduce this negative effect as presented in fig s6 a series of experiments were carried out by varying the agitation speed 0 rpm 50 rpm 100 rpm 200 rpm and 400 rpm while keeping all other factors constant the atrazine adsorption on l gqs surface clearly increased from 6 5 to 24 5 in 90 min when increasing agitation speed from 0 to 450 rpm on the other hand the adsorption time decreased with the increasing agitation speed these phenomena appear commonly in heterogeneous aops especially at the ones utilizing porous catalysts yagub et al 2012 gupta et al 2011 confirming that the adsorption behavior of atrazine on l gqs was strongly influenced by mass transfer in addition the adsorption time and total adsorption amount changed slightly when the agitation speed increased from 200 rpm to 400 rpm suggesting that 200 rpm could be the suitable agitation speed in this study the k for atrazine degradation followed pseudo first order at various temperatures as given in supplementary fig s12 b at different temperatures catalytic ozonation always revealed higher k than sole ozonation the change of temperature did not have significant effect on atrazine degradation in the presence of l gqs these trends were more noticeable during the doc removal see supplementary fig s13 a more specifically i the pseudo first order k of l gqs catalyzed ozonation was almost unchanged after the reaction temperature decreased from 293 k to 278 k while that of ozone alone decreased ca 4 fold shown in supplementary fig s13 b and ii as depicted in supplementary fig s13 a the addition of l gqs enhanced the k of atrazine degradation by ca 3 6 fold at 278 k 3 4 fold at 283 k and 2 0 fold at 293 k respectively these results indicated that both atrazine and doc removal strongly rely on the catalytic ability of l gqs especially under low temperature condition 3 3 assessing the feasibility of the catalytic ozonation process in natural waters nom is widely present in natural waters and its concentration varies in different kinds of water bodies river creek lake and groundwater liu et al 2015b since nom has a significant effect on the ozonation process it is therefore of great importance to study their impact on catalytic ozonation in the presence of l gqs in this study suwanee river natural organic matter srnom was used as the model nom and the suva254 value of srnom was 3 9 l mg 1 m 1 fig 6 a presents the atrazine degradation in presence of various concentrations of srnom from 0 mg l 1 doc to 5 mg l 1 doc for both sole and catalytic ozonation introducing nom into the solution accelerate the atrazine degradation process especially for the plain ozonation process the degradation efficiency of atrazine was 69 2 after 10 min ozonation time in the presence of 1 mg l 1 doc of srnom and increased to 94 4 at the same reaction time in the presence of 5 mg l 1 doc of srnom also when the concentrations of srnom increased the rapid atrazine degradation stages during the first 1 min of reactions appeared more clearly during the ozonation processes without l gqs literature has not reached a consensus concerning the effect of nom during ozonation intuitively one would assume that nom has an inhibitory effect several studies reported that introducing nom or humic acid would retard the target compounds degradation efficiency however other works revealed that nom or humic acid could enhance the degradation rate and in others to show no effect ikhlaq et al 2014 2015 gracia et al 2000 under our experimental conditions the added srnom did not act as the competitor for atrazine degradation to consuming ozone and oh the function of the added srnom was more of a promoter for radical chain reactions which played an important role in accelerating ozone decomposition and hence radical formation the aromatic moieties and aliphatic unsaturated constituents in srnom components could be easily oxidized by molecular ozone and spark the radical chain reactions generating more oh von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for the catalytic ozonation in the presence of srnom the increase of atrazine degradation rate was not as profound compared with the absence of srnom the presence of 5 mg l 1 doc of srnom increased the atrazine degradation efficiency by only about 21 within 10 min this is mainly because the l gqs has already provided potent oh generation thus the effect of nom was not significant concerning doc removal although the presence of nom for sole ozonation enhanced the degradation rate of atrazine the doc removal ability decreased gradually following the increase concentrations of added srnom shown in fig 6 b although the enhanced atrazine depletion rate revealed the ability of srnom to initial the radical chain reactions the generated oh was insufficient to reduce the increased doc amount provided by srnom themselves due to the fact that srnom has limited amount of electron rich moieties phenols amines olefins etc which could readily react with ozone the oh generation ability of srnom was restricted and the radical chain reactions were most likely soon terminated by the lack of these functional groups liu et al 2015b the opposite effect was observed for catalytic ozonation process where the oh was provided continuously by the active sites on the surface of l gqs through ozone decomposition combined with the increasing amount of initial total doc concentration and the radical chain initiation ability provided by the introducing srnom the doc removal rates increased gradually with the increasing srnom in the solution the catalytic ozonation performance experiments for l gqs and atrazine in a natural water matrix were also investigated using sh river water as the tested water source as can be seen in fig 7 both atrazine degradation and doc removal rate were enhanced in sh river water compared with those in control experiment using di water as water source the depletion of atrazine was almost identical in sh river water for both catalyzed and non catalyzed ozonation process achieving nearly 100 atrazine degradation after 20 min reaction although the doc abatement efficiencies were quite different changing water source to sh river water significantly reduced the doc removal from 25 0 to 8 9 at 60 min for non catalyzed ozonation process but achieved slight enhancement from 54 3 to 58 8 at 60 min for catalytic ozonation with l gqs these results were very similar to those presented in the ozonation process with srnom fig 6 however although the sh river water also contains the similar amount of doc 5 4 mg l 1 as 5 mg l 1 doc of srnom the atrazine degradation and doc removal for catalyzed ozonation seems reduced in sh river water in addition to the advantages of nom in both srnom and sh river water mentioned in the last paragraph the different component of the nom and the inorganic matters co3 2 hco3 cl and po4 3 may also effect the catalytic ozonation process in some extent during aops treatment processes co3 2 hco3 and cl were commonly considered as the radical scavengers which could retard the organic compounds abatement atrazine and nom by consuming oh and generating less reactivity carbonate radical co3 and chlorine radical cl luo et al 2015 and phosphate is a well known radical scavenger which could not only consume the generated oh but also block the active sites of catalyst resulting in reducing the oh produce ability of l gqs wang et al 2018 nevertheless the overall net effect shows an improvement hence the use of the process in an actual contaminated water source is highly possible since no inhibition is observed 3 4 catalyst stability and re use potential the catalytic stability and reusability are important parameters to consider in a potential application as they directly influence the process costs the reusability of l gqs was investigated by reusing the same catalyst batch in ten consequent catalytic ozonation cycles the adsorption processes were performed for 30 min before each cycle of experiments and the data are presented as the points at 0 min during the first five successive processes the l gqs catalyst kept in the reactor without any purification and only the treated solution was changed for each cycle as shown in fig 8 the doc removal abilities of atrazine decreased successively from 54 3 for the 1st run to 40 2 for the 5th run meanwhile the adsorption capacity of l gqs decreased more rapidly from 7 for the 1st run to less than 1 for the 5th run this might be due to the adsorption of intermediates formed during the ozonation processes after the first five successive processes l gqs catalyst was collected regenerated washed with di water 3 times then dried in an oven at 60 c overnight after the regeneration process both the atrazine adsorption capacity 6 and doc removal ability 53 of l gqs obtained in 6th cycle was recovered almost to the original state 1st run although a decreasing trend was seen in the following 4 cycles more than 38 of doc removal were still achieved within 60 min reaction for each run the xrd results of used catalyst seen in fig 2 after 10 runs which was identical to that of the raw l gqs revealed good stability of l gqs the fe sem image of the used l gqs after 10 times reuse is shown in fig s1 b the surface morphology of the l gqs did not considerably change even after the 10 reusing processes the surface of the l gqs was still composed of the irregular particles with average diameters of 100 200 nm indicating that these irregular particles were bound each other tightly to form the macroscopic l gqs with average diameters of 4 mm it is also the main reason why l gqs was porous and observed in low density in conclusion the l gqs is an efficient catalyst for repetitive catalytic ozonation process with regenerative capacity 3 5 intermediates analysis and dechlorination of atrazine samples corresponding to degradation times of 0 5 10 20 30 45 and 60 min were retrieved to detect atrazine oxidation intermediates and to assess their quantitative evolution with reaction time fig 10 five different compounds retaining their s triazine ring structure during removal were found by means of lc qtof ms ms and the dechlorination of atrazine during ozonation was quantified by ic the structures molecular weights abbreviations and full names of atrazine and the identified s triazine compounds are presented in fig s14 ceat deisopropylatrazine and cait deethylatrazine were previously reported to be the primary intermediates of atrazine formed in majority of the aops acero et al 2000 khan et al 2014 sacco et al 2015 here fig 10 a depicted the degradation of atrazine and the evolution of ceat and cait as well as the molar balance although ceat and cait were the primary degradation products for both sole and catalytic ozonation their concentrations as a function of time were quite different for ozone alone ceat and cait generated immediately at the very initial stage and kept increasing to 11 46 μm and 15 7 μm at 45 min then decreased gradually to 9 84 μm and 13 2 μm at 60 min the accumulation of these primary degradation products during the sole ozonation process showed that ozone and the generated oh mainly attacked atrazine which underwent the de alkylation process and the degradation of ceat and cait only occurred at the very late stage however with the presence of catalyst l gqs the concentration of ceat and cait peaked at 5 min then decreased rapidly to undetectable levels within 60 min the rapid primary intermediates degradation rate shows that more oh generated through l gqs induced ozone decomposition participated in the reaction and accelerated the whole intermediates transformation process lutze et al 2015 reported that different molar ratio of cait ceat was observed during the degradation of atrazine by different ros where the molar ratio of cait ceat can be calculated to be ca 3 for oh based oxidations product yields depicted in fig 10 a indicated that the molar ratios of cait ceat for sole ozonation and l gqs catalyzed ozonation process were 1 34 1 46 and 2 41 3 44 respectively indicating that the atrazine degradation was mainly induced by oh for the l gqs catalyzed ozonation process on the other hand the low molar ratios of cait ceat for the sole ozonation process also suggested and verified our previous hypothesis that molecule ozone contributed significantly to atrazine degradation since the sole ozonation process could not generate an adequate amount of oh the secondary intermediates it generated were less than that in catalytic ozonation process the molecule fragmentation is suggested to be less intense hence the smaller number of detected intermediates more specifically as shown in fig 10 b the concentration of oait for l gqs catalyzed ozonation achieved the maximum of 1 15 μm at the reaction time of 15 min and then decreased to 0 48 μm at 60 min verifying its further transformation independently the concentration of oait reached the peak of 0 68 μm at the very initial stage of reaction then decreased in the following 60 min indicating that they were most probably generated by oh attack which were generated due to the initiators in solution at the first few minutes very small amount of oeit below 0 1 μm was also detected in both sole ozonation and catalytic ozonation the generation of oeit can be explained by oh attack toward the chloro group through dechlorination hydroxylation process since oh preferred to attack the ethyl and isopropyl groups than chloro group the concentration of oeit was quite low compared with that of cait and ceat the final products such as caat and oaat were undetectable for sole ozonation whereas the degradation of atrazine with l gqs led to their formation fig 10 b the concentration of oaat increased rapidly in the whole catalytic ozonation process and finally reached 1 54 μm at 60 min the accumulation of oaat suggested that ring opening reaction is difficult to happen during the atrazine degradation due to the stability of piperazine ring structure the relatively low concentration of caat compared with oaat also proved that dechlorination was achieved during the intermediates transformation the molar balance in then presented in fig 10 b the molar balance during ozonation slowly decreased to 46 of initial atrazine concentration after 60 min while for the l gqs catalyzed ozonation process the molar balance rapidly decreased to 8 6 of initial atrazine concentration after 30 min and to 4 2 after 60 min because of the rapid transformation of the primary intermediates such as cait and ceat with the rapid degradation of the primary intermediates for catalytic ozonation more unidentified degradation intermediates were formed and higher loss of molar balance than that for ozonation alone was obtained the doc mass balance presented in fig 10 c also followed the same trend as molar balance for the same reason dechlorination is an important process during atrazine degradation because the undechlorinated intermediates were considered as ecotoxic as atrazine sharing the same toxicology belfroid et al 1998 to evaluate the ecotoxicology of atrazine degradation products the concentration of chloride ions cl was carried out by ic and presented in fig 10 d only 16 8 μm of cl was generated after 60 min reaction for ozonation alone the degradation of atrazine by l gqs catalyzed ozonation lead to the formation of more dechlorinated intermediates 37 8 μm of cl were obtained after 60 min with the attack of adequate oh we can conclude from the result that catalytic ozonation in the presence of l gqs not only enhanced the mineralization of atrazine but may also reduce the toxicity of atrazine intermediates due to the dechlorination process 3 6 integrated proposal of atrazine degradation mechanism the atrazine degradation results demonstrated that adding the l gqs would promote ozone decomposition effectively during the ozonation process previous studies revealed that most of the catalysts decomposed ozone into various ros including oh superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 while the rest proceeded through nonradical pathways zhang et al 2011 since the tba inhibition experiment shown in fig 5 a illustrated oh was the main l gqs ros generated during the reaction epr technique combined with dmpo spin trapping agent was used for gaining a better understanding of the mechanism of l gqs catalyzed ozonation as shown in fig 9 both sole and catalytic ozonation demonstrated strong epr signal of dmpo oh adduct at the initial reaction stage 1 min but the signal of ozone alone was weaker than that of l gqs catalyzed ozonation the formation of the dmpo oh adduct could be explained by the rapid reaction ability of initiator with ozone and the enhanced signal of dmpo oh adduct was attributed to the ozone decomposition induced capacity provided by l gqs after sole ozonation of atrazine for 5 min mixing the withdrawn sample with dmpo spin trapping agent obtained nearly invisible dmpo oh adduct signal while the signal of catalytic ozonation still remained clearly identifiable under the same experimental conditions therefore the oh for atrazine degradation after the initial stage was mainly produced from ozone decomposition on the surface of l gqs combining the experimental data with the characterization results of xps ftir and pyridine ftir we proposed that the hydroxyl groups the bronsted acid sites and the lewis acid sites on the surface of l gqs all contribute to the atrazine adsorption ozone decomposition and oh generation based on the experimental and characterization results as well as the results from relevant studies in literature gallard and de laat 2000 bing et al 2015 2017 the possible integrated mechanism is hereby formulated and presented in scheme 1 in the reaction solution with ph ranging from 3 0 to 9 0 the surface hydroxyl groups of l gqs were predominately existed as deprotonated form o due to the relatively low phpzc 2 0 of l gqs when molecular ozone in solution contacted with the neighboring l gqs they could be readily captured by surface bronsted acid sites 19 3 μmol g 1 and weak lewis acid sites 122 2 μmol g 1 on the surface of l gqs the adsorption ability of l gqs for ozone was mainly contributed to the surface silanols si oh bronsted acid sites and tri coordinated silicon atoms weak lewis acid sites with the assistance of these surface groups the ozone readily gathered on the surface of l gqs since the bronsted acid sites and weak lewis acid sites are unable to induce direct ozone decomposition fujita et al 2004 the gathered ozone on the surface of l gqs with the assistance of these surface groups would be further decomposed by strong and medium lewis acid sites 33 5 μmol g 1 thanks to the coordinated aluminum oxide species and the iron oxy hydroxides the strong and medium lewis acid sites could rapidly decompose molecular ozone into oxygen and active oxygen species then these active oxygen species could react with other molecular ozone molecular or dissociated water and finally generate oh zhu et al 2017 in addition the adsorption experiments presented in supplementary fig s9 a exhibited the ability of l gqs for atrazine adsorption from ph 3 0 to 9 0 the generated oh was able to attack the adsorbed atrazine readily and timely since the lifetime of oh was extremely short li et al 2016 finally the proposed activity is suggested to be continued towards the degradation of the formed intermediates 4 conclusions in this study the enhanced catalytic activities of l gqs catalyst for improvement of the ozonation of atrazine were investigated l gqs can be churned up in the stirring assisted bubble column reactor with appropriate stirring speed and superficial gas velocity the detailed material characterization techniques applied here elucidated the crystal phases element components surface hydroxyl groups as well as the surface bronsted acid sites and lewis acid sites of l gqs this allowed postulating the atrazine degradation mechanism based on the surface properties of l gqs epr measurements confirmed that the surface oh generated from catalytic decomposition of ozone was the dominant ros in the reaction system compared with sole ozonation l gqs catalyzed ozonation not only presented more efficient atrazine degradation and doc removal rates but also may reduce the potential toxicity effects of atrazine degradation by products according to analysis of ic and lc qtof ms ms a similar enhancing effect of doc abatement was also observed in natural water despite the presence of nom since the l gqs exhibited wide application range and could be easily separated from the solution the l gqs based stirring assisted bubble column reactor provided a useful basis for further work on the application of heterogeneous ozone based oxidation treatment declaration of interests the authors declare that

19141,this work studied simultaneous bromate bro3 reduction and adsorption of perchlorate clo4 by fecl3 impregnated granular activated carbon fe gac and the mutual co solute effects we report that bro3 reduction by fe gac was coupled with enhanced adsorption of clo4 by the material the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity for clo4 by fe gac was increased from 0 179 mmol g 1 without bro3 to 0 256 mmol g 1 in the presence of 0 2 mmol l 1 of bro3 a 43 increase at ph 6 0 while the activated carbon alone was able simultaneously remove both bro3 and clo4 fe gac offered much greater removal efficacy and synergistic effect likely because the immobilized fe3 acted as a catalyst and provided a local acidic environment both being in favor of accelerated bro3 reduction mechanistic analyses revealed that bro3 removal was through a two step process ion exchange with oh and cl on fe gac and then fe catalyzed reduction of bro3 to br by carbon the carbon bro3 redox reaction generated more fe o and c o groups on the material surface which can bind with clo4 by surface complexation and electrostatic interactions to our knowledge this is the first report that metal modified activated carbon may facilitate synergistic removal of both bro3 and clo4 which are common co solutes in contaminated waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords perchlorate bromate reduction adsorption reaction enhanced adsorption water treatment disinfection by product 1 introduction perchlorate clo4 is an oxyanion and poses potential health risks li et al 2001 wolff 1998 as of 2009 perchlorate has been detected in 45 u s states and washington d c with maximum concentrations ranging from 4 to 2 6 μg l gao 2005 to mitigate human exposure the u s environmental protection agency has adopted a drinking water equivalent level of 24 5 μg l 1 bromate bro3 is a common by product upon ozonation of water or wastewater containing bromide br haag and hoigne 1983 krasner et al 1993 and is a potential human carcinogen moore and chen 2006 bromate can also be formed when chlorinated water is exposed to sunlight or when water is treated with concentrated hypochlorite weinberg et al 2003 in the u s bromate was found in both groundwater and surface waters and at 0 02 1 6 μmol l chairez et al 2010 to mitigate human exposure the world health organization has recommended a maximum contaminant level of 0 078 μmol l for bromate in drinking water weinberg et al 2003 perchlorate and bromate often coexist in contaminated waters liu et al 2002 therefore simultaneous removal of perchlorate and bromate in aqueous media is often required reduction of perchlorate requires to overcome an unusually high activation energy barrier xiong et al 2007 moreover clo4 is the least hydrophilic inorganic ion with a hydration energy of 205 kj mol 1 various materials have been studied for perchlorate removal such as crystalline akaganeite beta feooh xu et al 2004 iron impregnated granular activated carbon fe gac xu et al 2013 gac rekha et al 2017 xu et al 2013 mg al layered double hydroxides lin et al 2014 and ferric hydroxide kumar et al 2010 like perchlorate bromate is also a mono valent oxyanion often times the same kind of materials used for perchlorate adsorption are effective for bromate such as ferric hydroxide bhatnagar et al 2009 however bromate is much easier to be reduced for instance while gac and fe gac can only adsorb perchlorate they can adsorb and reduce bromate to bromide kirisits et al 2000 siddiqui et al 1996 xu et al 2015 researchers have studied simultaneous removal of contaminant mixtures for example jang et al 2009 tested simultaneous removal of perchlorate and arsenate by iron hydr oxides and surfactant tailored gac hristovski et al 2008 studied removal of arsenate and perchlorate using ion exchange media in general coexisting oxyanions tend to compete for the adsorption sites for instance chen et al 2012 tested effect of perchlorate on adsorption of bromate by surfactant modified gac and observed that bromate uptake was decreased by 35 at a clo4 bro3 molar ratio of 100 1 on the other hand removal of one contaminant may be enhanced upon chemical transformation of another co contaminant for example reduction of nitrate by iron zero valent iron zvi enhanced bromate reduction though the underlying mechanism is unknown xie and shang 2007 recently a novel fe gac was developed through thermal hydrolysis of iron salts fecl2 and fecl3 and gac xu et al 2013 2015 fe gac has shown effective for perchlorate adsorption or bromate reduction in single solute systems where fe3 in fe gac was found to act as a catalyst to accelerate the electron transfer between bro3 and carbon xu et al 2015 yet there has been no information available on simultaneous removal of bromate and perchlorate by fe gac the overall goal of this study was to investigate the performance of fe gac for simultaneous removal of bromate and perchlorate and explore mutual impacts of the co solutes the specific objectives were to 1 test the effectiveness of fe gac for reductive removal of bro3 and simultaneous adsorption of clo4 when various concentrations of clo4 or bro3 are co present 2 evaluate the mutual influences clo4 and bro3 and 3 explore the underlying mechanisms governing the co solute effects 2 experimental section 2 1 chemical reagents ferric chloride fecl3 7h2o sodium perchlorate naclo4 sigma sodium bromate nabro3 sigma sodium hydroxide naoh hydrochloric acid hcl and a coal based gac with grain sizes of 0 45 0 90 mm were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent shanghai china all the chemical reagents were of analytical grade or higher and all solutions were prepared using milli q water q h2o millipore corp 2 2 synthesis of fe gac fe gac was prepared through the hydrothermal treatment of fecl3 and the gac following the approach reported in our prior work xu et al 2013 in brief gac was first washed under ultrasound irradiation then 1 5 g of fecl3 7h2o and 2 5 g gac were mixed in 50 ml di water in a 100 ml glass flask and subjected to thermal hydrolysis at about 100 110 c after 24 h hydrolysis the solids were washed with di water three times to remove impurities and dried at about 45 c for 4 6 h 2 3 characterization field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jsm 6701f was used to determine the surface morphology of fe gac the bet based specific surface area sabet was measured using a brunauer emmett teller bet n2 analyzer pore sizes were calculated following the barrett joyner halenda bjh n2 adsorption desorption isotherm method x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis of gac fe gac before and fe gac after reaction with bro3 was carried out on a bruker d8 advanced x ray diffractometer to this end the materials were grounded into powder and then scanned from 10 to 80 2θ angles at a step size of 0 02 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy analysis was carried out to identify the functional groups in this regard the material was first ground and palletized with kbr at an fe gac to kbr mass ratio of 1 10 ftir spectra were then recorded in the wave number range of 400 4000 cm 1 using a nicolet 5700 ftir spectrometer to identify the iron valence and the change of oxygen forms of fe gac before and after the reaction x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was performed on a rbd upgraded phi 5000c esca system perkin elmer usa with mg kɑ radiation hν 1253 6 ev xps spectra were obtained at 90 and 35 relative to the sample surface plane binding energies were calibrated by using the contaminated carbon c1s 284 6 ev zeta potential was measured using a zeta potential analyzer els 8000 phonal yokosuka alec to this end 0 05 g of fe gac or gac was added into 100 ml of a solution containing 0 or 0 2 mm bro3 and shaken at 25 c for 36 h the reacted fe gac and gac were then collected dried and ground into powder and then added into a series of flasks each containing 50 ml of a 0 01 m nacl solution the solution ph was adjusted to 2 0 to 12 0 with 0 01 m hcl or naoh solution then sealed and shaken at 25 c for 4 h and subsequently measured for zeta potential 2 4 batch equilibrium and kinetic experiments simultaneous removal and mutual co solute effects of bromate and perchlorate were first tested through batch equilibrium removal experiments where the concentration of the primary solute was fixed at 0 1 mmol l 1 whereas that for the co solute was varied from 0 to 1 2 mmol l 1 the ph value of the solution was not adjusted during the experiments phinitial 4 6 0 1 or 6 0 0 1 the tests were initiated by addition of 0 05 g of fe gac or gac to each of the reactors containing 100 ml of bromate perchlorate solutions the reactors were placed on a rotary shaker operated at 200 rpm to ensure complete mixing and equilibrated for 36 h at room temperature 25 1 c then each 5 ml samples were collected filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters mixed cellulose and then analyzed for clo4 and bro3 to test the ph effect on the adsorption of clo4 the adsorption tests of clo4 by fe gac or gac were carried out at initial ph spanning from 3 0 through 11 0 and at an initial clo4 of 0 1 mmol l 1 in the presence or absence of 0 1 mmol l 1 bro3 kinetic tests of clo4 or bro3 removal at various concentrations were carried out in 250 ml conical flasks containing 200 ml of 0 1 mmol l 1 of a primary solute and in the presence of 0 or 0 1 mmol l 1 of the co solute the reaction was initiated by addition of 0 1 g of fe gac or gac to each of the reactors containing the co solute solution then each 5 ml samples were collected at predetermined times filtered through the 0 22 μm membrane filters and then analyzed for clo4 bro3 and br adsorption isotherms for clo4 were obtained through equilibrium tests where 0 05 g of fe gac or gac was added in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of a solution with 0 1 0 6 mmol l 1 of clo4 and 0 or 0 2 mmol l 1 bro3 the same experimental protocol as in the kinetic tests was followed and the equilibrium time was 46 h control tests were carried out without the materials but under otherwise identical conditions and the results indicated no detectable loss of the solutes in the experimental systems or during the sample handling all tests were duplicated to assure data quality in this paper data are plotted based on the means with error bars indicating the reproducibility calculated as relative deviation from the mean 2 5 analytical methods bro3 clo4 and br were analyzed using a dionex ion chromatograph dx 120 equipped with a suppressed conductivity detector and a 250 ml sample loop clo4 and br were analyzed using an as20 column and an ag20 guard column a degassed 35 mmol l 1 koh solution was used as the eluent and the suppressor current was set at 87 ma bro3 was analyzed using an as19 column and an ag19 guard column a degassed 20 mmol l 1 koh solution was used as the eluent and the suppressor current was set at 75 ma the eluent flow rate was set at 1 0 ml min 1 the detection limits were 10 ppb for bro3 clo4 or br the iron concentration in water was determined by a spectro genesis inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes statistical analyses were conducted to examine the existence of significant differences via t test and or following the one way analysis of variance anova of spss at the 95 confidence level 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterizations fig 1 shows the sem images edx spectra of fe gac before and after reaction with bro3 fig 1a displays a smooth surface of the gac which is covered with random shaped well dispersed nanoparticles of 10 20 nm according to the edx data fig 1c the surface contained 0 11 of iron table 1 indicating successful immobilization of iron hydr oxides on gac fig 1b shows that after reaction with bro3 the flat surface of fe gac became potholed and the carbon was broken into irregular pieces furthermore the iron hydr oxide nanoparticles turned smaller and round shaped table 1 gives the atomic percentages of iron carbon oxygen and chlorine before and after reaction with bro3 according to the edx data the contents of carbon and chlorine decreased from 90 53 to 0 29 before reaction to 80 44 and 0 11 after reaction respectively this observation suggests that bromate reduction consumed carbon and bromate removal occurred through ion exchange with chloride conversely the content of oxygen increased from 9 05 to 15 10 after reaction indicating bromate reduction by fe gac increased the surface oxygen content partially due to the loss of carbon lastly despite the shape changes of the nanoparticles the surface iron content remained at 0 11 0 12 indicating the redox reactions did not dissolve any of the loaded nanoparticles fig s1 in supporting information si shows the xrd spectra of gac fe gac and fe gac before and after reaction with 0 2 mmol l 1 bro3 fe gac 0 2bro3 for gac the characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 20 6 26 4 36 4 42 5 and 49 9 correspond to the 100 101 110 200 and 112 planes of sio2 jcpds 65 0466 for virgin fe gac the loading of iron hydr oxides resulted in several new weak peaks at 2θ values of 27 6 35 4 36 3 and 59 8 which correspond to the 110 101 110 200 and 310 planes of feooh jcpds 26 0792 respectively in the meanwhile the weak peaks of sio2 from gac disappeared upon the iron loading except the main peaks at 2θ of 26 4 and 36 4 upon reaction with bro3 however all the peaks of sio2 reappeared and were stronger than those in gac indicating that the reaction between carbon and bro3 not only removed the blurring effect of iron hydr oxides but enhanced the crystallinity of sio2 in fe gac in addition the peaks of feooh were shifted to 2θ values of 42 2 44 8 and 59 8 corresponding to the 210 120 and 310 planes indicating that the reaction with bro3 changed the crystalline formation of feooh which is consistent with xps analysis in section 3 6 fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of gac or fe gac before and after reaction with clo4 or bro3 based on a previous study kang and xing 2007 the asymmetric vascoo 1547 1560 cm 1 and symmetric bands at 1558 and 1401 cm 1 are ascribed to the carboxylates on fe gac the broad band at 3401 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching of o h groups associated with the interlayer water molecules the bands at 1079 1095 cm 1 are assigned to the c o and si o groups al ghouti et al 2017 in fe gac the si o groups are from sio2 in the gac and the observation is consistent with the results based on analysis of xrd xu et al 2016 the c o band of fe gac after reaction with bro3 shifted from 1095 cm 1 fe gac cl to 1087 5 cm 1 indicating that fe gac after reaction with bro3 has greater electrostatic attraction potential hong et al 2016 which is beneficial for the adsorption of clo4 furthermore the intensities of the c o and carboxylate functional groups after reactions with bro3 and clo4 were increased suggesting that the contents of these groups were increased which is consistent with the data in table 1 equation 1 depicts the redox reaction between carbon and bro3 1 bro3 c br c o or c ooh fang et al 2014 found that these oxygen containing organic groups on hydrophobic surfaces can greatly enhance adsorption of perchlorate via enhanced hydrogen bonding the bands at 2854 and 2929 cm 1 are assigned to symmetric and asymmetric c h bands which were also intensified after reaction with bro3 the other peaks of fe gac after reaction with bro3 remained unchanged adsorption of clo4 alone only slightly increased the peak of c o with others remaining the same table 2 gives the bet based characterization results of virgin gac and fe gac before and after reaction with bro3 in all cases the change in the bet surface area and pore volumes was less than 6 3 2 perchlorate removal in the presence of various concentrations of bromate fig 3 displays the final clo4 removal percentiles by 0 05 g l 1 fe gac or virgin gac at a fixed concentration 0 1 mmol l 1 of clo4 and in the presence of a range concentration of bro3 0 1 2 mmol l 1 the initial solution ph was 4 6 0 1 for the systems with fe gac due to the acidic nature of the iron salt fecl3 to facilitate a fair comparison the initial ph for the neat gac system was also adjusted to the same level fig 3 shows that the clo4 removal without bro3 was 58 by fe gac and 31 by gac and the clo4 removal increased with increasing bro3 concentration and reached the maximum of 66 for fe gac with 0 2 mmol l 1 of bro3 and 35 for gac with 0 1 mmol l 1 of bro3 statistical analyses confirmed the significant differences among the data p 0 022 for fe gac at bro3 0 0 2 mm per anova and p 0 015 for gac at bro3 0 0 1 mm per t test further increasing bro3 resulted in decreased removal of clo4 p 0 007 for fe gac at bro3 0 2 1 2 mm and p 0 000 for gac at bro3 0 1 1 2 mm per anova however the inhibitive effect was much confined for fe gac than gac for instance at bro3 1 2 mmol l 1 the clo4 removal was lowered by 15 for fe gac but 37 for gac compared to the maximum removals the results showed that while low concentrations of bro3 0 2 mmol l 1 for fe gac and 0 1 mmol l 1 for gac enhanced adsorption of clo4 by both fe gac and gac higher concentrations of bro3 may inhibit clo4 adsorption details on the underlying mechanisms are illustrated in section 3 6 fig 4 compares clo4 removal percentages by fe gac or gac at various concentrations of clo4 0 05 0 6 mm and bro3 clo4 molar ratios 0 1 1 3 or 1 1 at ph 4 6 0 1 fig 4a indicates that the presence of bro3 promoted clo4 removal by fe gac in all cases though the enhancement was less significant at bro3 clo4 1 3 statistical analyses anova indicated that the differences among the 3 bars for each group i e at each perchlorate concentration were significant p 0 014 for fe gac table s1 in si fig 4b indicates that the presence of bro3 significantly p 0 026 promoted clo4 removal by gac at clo4 concentration 0 1 mmol l 1 but had insignificant effect at higher clo4 concentrations p 0 833 table s1 3 3 effect of initial ph in a prior work we found that adsorption of clo4 onto fe gac or gac in single solute systems was dependent on the solution ph xu et al 2015 fig 5 a shows that the effect of initial solution ph on clo4 adsorption by fe gac or gac in the presence or absence of 0 1 mmol l 1 of bro3 as seen in fig 5a the clo4 uptake by gac sharply and progressively decreased when the initial ph was increased from 3 to 11 while the clo4 uptake by fe gac remained high in the initial ph range from 3 to 7 2 and then decreased at alkaline ph again the presence of 0 1 mm of bro3 not only enhanced the update of clo4 from 0 118 to 0 150 mmol g 1 for fe gac but also extended the optimal ph range to 4 7 2 the effect of bro3 on the uptake of clo4 by both fe gac and gac was statistically significant over a broad ph range e g p 0 001 at ph 3 7 though to a greater extent for fe gac fig 5b shows the relationship between initial and final ph and it is evident that fe gac was able to keep the final ph at a much lower level up to 1 8 ph units than gac especially in the initial ph range of 5 9 with or without 0 1 mmol l 1 bro3 evidently fe gac was able to maintain an acidic environment which was conducive to the bro3 reduction to br and more bro3 reduction in turn enhanced clo4 uptake this important attribute of fe gac is due to the ability of fe as a lewis acid to bind with oh bro3 showed stronger promoting effect on the adsorption of clo4 by fe gac at neutral or acidic ph though the effect faded at ph 9 0 furthermore the effect of bro3 was more on fe gac than on gac siddiqui et al 1996 reported that more bro3 reduction by gac was observed as the solution ph was decreased moreover although low concentrations 1 2 and 0 2 mg l of dissolved iron were detected after the tests at ph 2 80 and 10 88 respectively no fe was detected in the ph range of 3 0 9 0 indicating that fe gac is very stable 3 4 kinetics of simultaneous bromate reduction and perchlorate adsorption fig 6 shows the kinetics of clo4 adsorption by fe gac or gac in the presence of 0 or 0 1 mmol l 1 of bro3 table 3 presents the best fitted kinetic model parameters for the pseudo second order model 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where q e and q t are the amounts of clo4 adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k 2 h g mmol 1 is the adsorption rate constant as shown in fig 6 the kinetics displayed a two phase profile i e a fast initial phase followed by a gradual phase with 90 removal occurred within the first 5 h for both materials the presence of 0 1 mmol l 1 bro3 increased the uptake of clo4 by fe gac by 23 and 14 at ph 4 6 and 6 0 respectively but had statistically insignificant effect p 0 05 on the adsorption by gac bro3 showed a slightly inhibitive effect 5 h but then a profoundly promoting effect on the adsorption rate of clo4 in the initial stage bro3 and clo4 were competitively adsorbed as a result less clo4 was adsorbed compared to the case without the competing co solute later as more bro3 was reduced to br more sites became available for clo4 in addition as reduction of bro3 was coupled with oxidation of gac significant modifications of the carbon surface occurred which is in favor of enhanced clo4 adsorption further discussed in section 3 6 in all cases the pseudo second order kinetic model was able to adequately fit the experimental data r2 0 96 table 3 for fe gac the rate constants were 9 90 and 9 46 mmol 1 h 1 at ph 4 6 or 6 0 respectively in the absence of bro3 these values were decreased to 3 36 and 3 66 g mmol 1 h 1 in the presence of 0 1 mmol l 1 of bro3 indicating that more complex reaction adsorption processes are operative fig 7 shows the transient concentrations of bro3 remaining and corresponding br production rate at an initial bro3 concentration of 0 1 mmol l 1 and in the presence or absence of 0 1 mmol l 1 of clo4 by fe gac or gac at ph 4 6 it is evident from fig 7 that the reduction of bro3 was stoichiometrically coupled with the production of br by fe gac and the bro3 removal rate by fe gac was lowered after the initial 3 h in the presence of clo4 which can be attributed to the competitive adsorption of clo4 the adsorption of clo4 rendered initially adsorbed bro3 available for the redox reactions with carbon resulting in increased br production rate in the presence of 0 1 mmol l 1 clo4 for both fe gac and gac when fe gac fig 7a and gac fig 7b are compared the bro3 reduction rate by fe gac was much faster than that by gac this can be due to the binding of h by fe gac which resulted in a more acidic local environment that is conducive to bro3 reduction in addition this observation supports the prior finding that fe3 in fegac may act as a catalyst facilitating the electron transfer between bro3 and carbon xu et al 2015 in the end of the experiments fe gac was able to completely remove the aqueous phase bro3 while gac removed only 45 3 5 perchlorate adsorption isotherms in the presence or absence of bromate fig 8 shows clo4 adsorption isotherms for fe gac or gac in the presence or absence of 0 2 mmol l 1 of co existing bro3 at a final ph 4 6 or 6 0 the experimental isotherm data were fitted with the classic langmuir eq 3 and freundlich eq 4 models 3 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where q max is the maximum solid phase concentration corresponding to a complete monolayer coverage of the adsorption sites k l is a constant related to the free energy of adsorption and k f and n are the freundlich model parameters related to the adsorption capacity and intensity respectively table 4 lists the best fitted isotherm model parameters the langmuir model better fitted the experimental data than the freundlich model based on the coefficient of determination and it fitted the fe gac isotherm data in the presence of 0 2 mmol l 1 of bro3 better than in the absence of bro3 suggesting that the reaction with bro3 rendered more uniform site energy in accord with the premise of the langmuir model the isotherm data confirmed that fe gac offers much greater adsorption capacities for clo4 adsorption than pristine gac at both ph levels and the presence of bro3 facilitated the adsorption by fe gac but had no effect on gac for instance the q max for fe gac 0 256 mmol g 1 in the presence of 0 2 mmol l 1 of bro3 at ph 6 0 was 1 43 times higher than that without bro3 0 179 mmol g 1 moreover the promoting effect of bro3 was higher at ph 6 0 than that at ph 4 6 1 25 times furthermore the values of k l for fe gac without bro3 22 46 or 29 08 at ph 4 6 or 6 0 were higher than those 18 24 or 15 55 with bro3 indicating that the reaction of bro3 indeed altered the free energy of adsorption for clo4 3 6 mechanisms for bromate reduction enhanced adsorption of perchlorate to understand the underlying mechanisms for bro3 and clo4 removal the reaction products in the solution were determined fig s2 in si shows the change of the peak area of cl so4 2 with varying clo4 or bro3 concentration the peak area kept stable when the clo4 concentration was increased from 0 1 to 0 6 mmol l 1 while increased almost linearly when the bro3 concentration was increased from 0 1 to 0 6 mmol l 1 the phenomena indicate that cl so4 2 from fecl3 and gac containing so4 2 can be exchanged with bro3 but not with clo4 the result is consistent with other works reported bhatnagar et al 2009 hong et al 2016 kumar et al 2010 mahmudov and huang 2010 indicating that ion exchange is the main mechanism for bro3 adsorption and in contrast specific interactions between perchlorate and surface functional groups in combination with electrostatic forces are responsible for perchlorate adsorption mahmudov and huang 2010 furthermore the peak area of cl so4 2 of fe gac was larger than that of gac which is due to the higher ion exchange capacity and that more chloride ions were introduced into the fe gac during the material synthesis fig s3 in si shows the change of br production rates by fe gac or gac in the presence of 0 2 mmol l 1 bro3 with the clo4 concentration 0 1 0 6 mmol l 1 the br production rate by fe gac or gac decreased when clo4 concentrations was increased from 0 1 to 0 6 mmol l 1 indicating that clo4 at elevated concentrations inhibited the reduction of bro3 note that the presence of clo4 at 0 1 mmol l 1 promoted the reaction fig 7 moreover the br production rate by fe gac was much higher than that by gac confirming again the important role of fe3 in fe gac as a catalyst in addition to its ph buffering capability xu et al 2015 it should be noted that the changes 1 2 in the bet surface area after the reaction with bro3 may not fully account for the 1 43 times higher adsorption of clo4 by fe gac in the presence of bro3 fig s4 in si shows the zeta potential of the solution after reaction with fe gac or gac in the presence or absence of bro3 the zeta potential of fe gac in the presence of bro3 and in the acidic ph range was more positive than that without bro3 reaching a peak at ph 4 0 4 5 indicating that bro3 reduction may have demolished some of the negatively charged moieties on the material surface moreover the surface of fe gac was much more positive than that of gac in the acidic ph range in addition the ph of point of zero charge phpzc of fe gac 5 8 was higher than that of gac 4 5 therefore the surface potential and phpzc played an important role in adsorption of bromate and perchlorate xps has been widely used to detect surface functional groups of reactive materials based on xps analysis hong et al 2016 observed that bro3 reduction by polypyrrole tailored ac increased the oxygen containing functional groups and mahmudov and huang 2010 reported that perchlorate adsorption occurs through specific interactions with surface functional groups on activated carbon to acquire further insights into the mechanisms for bro3 reduction and the reaction facilitated clo4 adsorption by fe gac fe gac before and after clo4 adsorption and bro3 reduction were investigated by xps and the results were shown in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows the high resolution xps spectra of fe 2s deconvolution of fe gac before and after reaction with 0 1 mmol l 1 of bro3 the peak of iron before the reaction occurred at binding energy 711 8 ev fig 9a confirming that the existence of fe3 on the surface of fe gac after reacting with bro3 the peak shifted to 711 5 ev fig 9b fig 10 shows xps spectra of o 1s deconvolution of virgin fe gac and fe gac after reaction with 0 1 mm clo4 and or bro3 the o 1s region of fe gac could be deconvoluted into four partially overlapped peaks at 529 7 531 0 531 9 and 533 4 ev corresponding to fe o oxide and fe oh of lattice structure oxygen and fe ohads and h2oads of adsorbed oxygen according to fig 10 the content of the hydroxyl groups decreased from 47 8 to 42 8 after reaction with clo4 to 33 5 after reaction with bro3 and to 35 after the simultaneous removal of clo4 and bro3 indicating that the surface hydroxyl groups were exchanged with bro3 but not with clo4 especially when bro3 is co present which is consistent with the change of ph during fe gac reaction with bro3 as stated in section 3 3 fig 10 also shows that the content of fe o increased from 9 3 to 18 8 when the concentration of bro3 was increased from 0 to 0 1 mmol l 1 indicating the reduction of bro3 can generate more fe o functional groups on fe gac which could result from fe3 reactions with carbon and bro3 furthermore according to the ftir and edx analyses fig 2 and table 1 the reaction also generated more c o groups on gac researchers have reported that electrostatic attraction and complexation were the main mechanisms for clo4 adsorption mahmudov and huang 2010 and the complexation was associated with the oxygen groups on gac therefore more fe o and c o groups on gac are more favorable for clo4 adsorption consequently the bromate reduction enhanced clo4 uptake by fe gac is attributed to both enhanced electrostatic interactions due to the more positive zeta potential and the elevated functionalities in contrast the adsorption of bro3 by fe gac was mainly anion exchange with cl and so4 2 and electrostatic interactions fig s5 in si presents a schematic diagram for bro3 reduction and the reaction enhanced adsorption of clo4 first bro3 and clo4 are co adsorbed by fe gac through ion exchange and surface complexation second adsorbed bro3 reacts with gac through redox reaction resulting in likely more uniform site energy better site accessibility and more functionalities for clo4 adsorption as bro3 is more reactive at acidic ph and fe gac can hold the ph in the acidic range the reduction of bro3 was more favored at acidic ph by fe gac moreover iron hydr oxides on fe gac can catalyze the bro3 reduction to br 4 conclusions in the study we found that bromate reduction to br by fecl3 impregnated gac can simultaneously enhance perchlorate adsorption the major research findings are recapped as follows 1 reduction of bromate enhanced perchlorate adsorption by fe gac when the bro3 clo4 molar ratio was below 4 however higher bro3 may inhibit the clo4 adsorption due to competitive adsorption 2 acidic ph favored bro3 reduction and resulted in greater clo4 uptake by fe gac the buffering capacity of fe gac rendered a broader optimum ph range of 4 7 2 for the simultaneous removal of bro3 and clo4 than that of virgin gac 3 the maximum langmuir capacity for clo4 by fe gac in the presence of 0 2 mmol l 1 of bro3 was 0 256 mol g 1 at ph 6 0 which is 1 43 times higher than that without bro3 0 179 mmol g 1 the reaction facilitated adsorption of perchlorate is attributed to the ph buffering ability of fe gac and the role of immobilized iron hydr oxides that may act a catalyst for reduction of bro3 the former maintained a local acidic environment whereas the latter created more functional groups resulting in enhanced adsorption of clo4 4 the pseudo second order kinetic model and the langmuir isotherm model adequately fit the experimental kinetic data and isotherms of clo4 by fe gac or gac in the presence or absence of bro3 and the langmuir model better fit the adsorption isotherms in the presence of bro3 than without bro3 5 bro3 was removed through a two stage process ion exchange on fe gac and then reduction by carbon which resulted in more fe o and c o groups the reaction also rendered a more positive zeta potential on fe gac resulting in more favorable surface conditions for enhanced clo4 adsorption by complexation and electrostatic attraction the results indicate that the new material fe gac may serve a useful alternative for simultaneous removal of clo4 and bro3 and the same idea may be extended for developing novel reactive materials for synergistic removal of mixed contaminants in water declaration of interests the authors declare

19141,this work studied simultaneous bromate bro3 reduction and adsorption of perchlorate clo4 by fecl3 impregnated granular activated carbon fe gac and the mutual co solute effects we report that bro3 reduction by fe gac was coupled with enhanced adsorption of clo4 by the material the langmuir maximum adsorption capacity for clo4 by fe gac was increased from 0 179 mmol g 1 without bro3 to 0 256 mmol g 1 in the presence of 0 2 mmol l 1 of bro3 a 43 increase at ph 6 0 while the activated carbon alone was able simultaneously remove both bro3 and clo4 fe gac offered much greater removal efficacy and synergistic effect likely because the immobilized fe3 acted as a catalyst and provided a local acidic environment both being in favor of accelerated bro3 reduction mechanistic analyses revealed that bro3 removal was through a two step process ion exchange with oh and cl on fe gac and then fe catalyzed reduction of bro3 to br by carbon the carbon bro3 redox reaction generated more fe o and c o groups on the material surface which can bind with clo4 by surface complexation and electrostatic interactions to our knowledge this is the first report that metal modified activated carbon may facilitate synergistic removal of both bro3 and clo4 which are common co solutes in contaminated waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords perchlorate bromate reduction adsorption reaction enhanced adsorption water treatment disinfection by product 1 introduction perchlorate clo4 is an oxyanion and poses potential health risks li et al 2001 wolff 1998 as of 2009 perchlorate has been detected in 45 u s states and washington d c with maximum concentrations ranging from 4 to 2 6 μg l gao 2005 to mitigate human exposure the u s environmental protection agency has adopted a drinking water equivalent level of 24 5 μg l 1 bromate bro3 is a common by product upon ozonation of water or wastewater containing bromide br haag and hoigne 1983 krasner et al 1993 and is a potential human carcinogen moore and chen 2006 bromate can also be formed when chlorinated water is exposed to sunlight or when water is treated with concentrated hypochlorite weinberg et al 2003 in the u s bromate was found in both groundwater and surface waters and at 0 02 1 6 μmol l chairez et al 2010 to mitigate human exposure the world health organization has recommended a maximum contaminant level of 0 078 μmol l for bromate in drinking water weinberg et al 2003 perchlorate and bromate often coexist in contaminated waters liu et al 2002 therefore simultaneous removal of perchlorate and bromate in aqueous media is often required reduction of perchlorate requires to overcome an unusually high activation energy barrier xiong et al 2007 moreover clo4 is the least hydrophilic inorganic ion with a hydration energy of 205 kj mol 1 various materials have been studied for perchlorate removal such as crystalline akaganeite beta feooh xu et al 2004 iron impregnated granular activated carbon fe gac xu et al 2013 gac rekha et al 2017 xu et al 2013 mg al layered double hydroxides lin et al 2014 and ferric hydroxide kumar et al 2010 like perchlorate bromate is also a mono valent oxyanion often times the same kind of materials used for perchlorate adsorption are effective for bromate such as ferric hydroxide bhatnagar et al 2009 however bromate is much easier to be reduced for instance while gac and fe gac can only adsorb perchlorate they can adsorb and reduce bromate to bromide kirisits et al 2000 siddiqui et al 1996 xu et al 2015 researchers have studied simultaneous removal of contaminant mixtures for example jang et al 2009 tested simultaneous removal of perchlorate and arsenate by iron hydr oxides and surfactant tailored gac hristovski et al 2008 studied removal of arsenate and perchlorate using ion exchange media in general coexisting oxyanions tend to compete for the adsorption sites for instance chen et al 2012 tested effect of perchlorate on adsorption of bromate by surfactant modified gac and observed that bromate uptake was decreased by 35 at a clo4 bro3 molar ratio of 100 1 on the other hand removal of one contaminant may be enhanced upon chemical transformation of another co contaminant for example reduction of nitrate by iron zero valent iron zvi enhanced bromate reduction though the underlying mechanism is unknown xie and shang 2007 recently a novel fe gac was developed through thermal hydrolysis of iron salts fecl2 and fecl3 and gac xu et al 2013 2015 fe gac has shown effective for perchlorate adsorption or bromate reduction in single solute systems where fe3 in fe gac was found to act as a catalyst to accelerate the electron transfer between bro3 and carbon xu et al 2015 yet there has been no information available on simultaneous removal of bromate and perchlorate by fe gac the overall goal of this study was to investigate the performance of fe gac for simultaneous removal of bromate and perchlorate and explore mutual impacts of the co solutes the specific objectives were to 1 test the effectiveness of fe gac for reductive removal of bro3 and simultaneous adsorption of clo4 when various concentrations of clo4 or bro3 are co present 2 evaluate the mutual influences clo4 and bro3 and 3 explore the underlying mechanisms governing the co solute effects 2 experimental section 2 1 chemical reagents ferric chloride fecl3 7h2o sodium perchlorate naclo4 sigma sodium bromate nabro3 sigma sodium hydroxide naoh hydrochloric acid hcl and a coal based gac with grain sizes of 0 45 0 90 mm were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent shanghai china all the chemical reagents were of analytical grade or higher and all solutions were prepared using milli q water q h2o millipore corp 2 2 synthesis of fe gac fe gac was prepared through the hydrothermal treatment of fecl3 and the gac following the approach reported in our prior work xu et al 2013 in brief gac was first washed under ultrasound irradiation then 1 5 g of fecl3 7h2o and 2 5 g gac were mixed in 50 ml di water in a 100 ml glass flask and subjected to thermal hydrolysis at about 100 110 c after 24 h hydrolysis the solids were washed with di water three times to remove impurities and dried at about 45 c for 4 6 h 2 3 characterization field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jsm 6701f was used to determine the surface morphology of fe gac the bet based specific surface area sabet was measured using a brunauer emmett teller bet n2 analyzer pore sizes were calculated following the barrett joyner halenda bjh n2 adsorption desorption isotherm method x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis of gac fe gac before and fe gac after reaction with bro3 was carried out on a bruker d8 advanced x ray diffractometer to this end the materials were grounded into powder and then scanned from 10 to 80 2θ angles at a step size of 0 02 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy analysis was carried out to identify the functional groups in this regard the material was first ground and palletized with kbr at an fe gac to kbr mass ratio of 1 10 ftir spectra were then recorded in the wave number range of 400 4000 cm 1 using a nicolet 5700 ftir spectrometer to identify the iron valence and the change of oxygen forms of fe gac before and after the reaction x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was performed on a rbd upgraded phi 5000c esca system perkin elmer usa with mg kɑ radiation hν 1253 6 ev xps spectra were obtained at 90 and 35 relative to the sample surface plane binding energies were calibrated by using the contaminated carbon c1s 284 6 ev zeta potential was measured using a zeta potential analyzer els 8000 phonal yokosuka alec to this end 0 05 g of fe gac or gac was added into 100 ml of a solution containing 0 or 0 2 mm bro3 and shaken at 25 c for 36 h the reacted fe gac and gac were then collected dried and ground into powder and then added into a series of flasks each containing 50 ml of a 0 01 m nacl solution the solution ph was adjusted to 2 0 to 12 0 with 0 01 m hcl or naoh solution then sealed and shaken at 25 c for 4 h and subsequently measured for zeta potential 2 4 batch equilibrium and kinetic experiments simultaneous removal and mutual co solute effects of bromate and perchlorate were first tested through batch equilibrium removal experiments where the concentration of the primary solute was fixed at 0 1 mmol l 1 whereas that for the co solute was varied from 0 to 1 2 mmol l 1 the ph value of the solution was not adjusted during the experiments phinitial 4 6 0 1 or 6 0 0 1 the tests were initiated by addition of 0 05 g of fe gac or gac to each of the reactors containing 100 ml of bromate perchlorate solutions the reactors were placed on a rotary shaker operated at 200 rpm to ensure complete mixing and equilibrated for 36 h at room temperature 25 1 c then each 5 ml samples were collected filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters mixed cellulose and then analyzed for clo4 and bro3 to test the ph effect on the adsorption of clo4 the adsorption tests of clo4 by fe gac or gac were carried out at initial ph spanning from 3 0 through 11 0 and at an initial clo4 of 0 1 mmol l 1 in the presence or absence of 0 1 mmol l 1 bro3 kinetic tests of clo4 or bro3 removal at various concentrations were carried out in 250 ml conical flasks containing 200 ml of 0 1 mmol l 1 of a primary solute and in the presence of 0 or 0 1 mmol l 1 of the co solute the reaction was initiated by addition of 0 1 g of fe gac or gac to each of the reactors containing the co solute solution then each 5 ml samples were collected at predetermined times filtered through the 0 22 μm membrane filters and then analyzed for clo4 bro3 and br adsorption isotherms for clo4 were obtained through equilibrium tests where 0 05 g of fe gac or gac was added in 250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml of a solution with 0 1 0 6 mmol l 1 of clo4 and 0 or 0 2 mmol l 1 bro3 the same experimental protocol as in the kinetic tests was followed and the equilibrium time was 46 h control tests were carried out without the materials but under otherwise identical conditions and the results indicated no detectable loss of the solutes in the experimental systems or during the sample handling all tests were duplicated to assure data quality in this paper data are plotted based on the means with error bars indicating the reproducibility calculated as relative deviation from the mean 2 5 analytical methods bro3 clo4 and br were analyzed using a dionex ion chromatograph dx 120 equipped with a suppressed conductivity detector and a 250 ml sample loop clo4 and br were analyzed using an as20 column and an ag20 guard column a degassed 35 mmol l 1 koh solution was used as the eluent and the suppressor current was set at 87 ma bro3 was analyzed using an as19 column and an ag19 guard column a degassed 20 mmol l 1 koh solution was used as the eluent and the suppressor current was set at 75 ma the eluent flow rate was set at 1 0 ml min 1 the detection limits were 10 ppb for bro3 clo4 or br the iron concentration in water was determined by a spectro genesis inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes statistical analyses were conducted to examine the existence of significant differences via t test and or following the one way analysis of variance anova of spss at the 95 confidence level 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterizations fig 1 shows the sem images edx spectra of fe gac before and after reaction with bro3 fig 1a displays a smooth surface of the gac which is covered with random shaped well dispersed nanoparticles of 10 20 nm according to the edx data fig 1c the surface contained 0 11 of iron table 1 indicating successful immobilization of iron hydr oxides on gac fig 1b shows that after reaction with bro3 the flat surface of fe gac became potholed and the carbon was broken into irregular pieces furthermore the iron hydr oxide nanoparticles turned smaller and round shaped table 1 gives the atomic percentages of iron carbon oxygen and chlorine before and after reaction with bro3 according to the edx data the contents of carbon and chlorine decreased from 90 53 to 0 29 before reaction to 80 44 and 0 11 after reaction respectively this observation suggests that bromate reduction consumed carbon and bromate removal occurred through ion exchange with chloride conversely the content of oxygen increased from 9 05 to 15 10 after reaction indicating bromate reduction by fe gac increased the surface oxygen content partially due to the loss of carbon lastly despite the shape changes of the nanoparticles the surface iron content remained at 0 11 0 12 indicating the redox reactions did not dissolve any of the loaded nanoparticles fig s1 in supporting information si shows the xrd spectra of gac fe gac and fe gac before and after reaction with 0 2 mmol l 1 bro3 fe gac 0 2bro3 for gac the characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 20 6 26 4 36 4 42 5 and 49 9 correspond to the 100 101 110 200 and 112 planes of sio2 jcpds 65 0466 for virgin fe gac the loading of iron hydr oxides resulted in several new weak peaks at 2θ values of 27 6 35 4 36 3 and 59 8 which correspond to the 110 101 110 200 and 310 planes of feooh jcpds 26 0792 respectively in the meanwhile the weak peaks of sio2 from gac disappeared upon the iron loading except the main peaks at 2θ of 26 4 and 36 4 upon reaction with bro3 however all the peaks of sio2 reappeared and were stronger than those in gac indicating that the reaction between carbon and bro3 not only removed the blurring effect of iron hydr oxides but enhanced the crystallinity of sio2 in fe gac in addition the peaks of feooh were shifted to 2θ values of 42 2 44 8 and 59 8 corresponding to the 210 120 and 310 planes indicating that the reaction with bro3 changed the crystalline formation of feooh which is consistent with xps analysis in section 3 6 fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of gac or fe gac before and after reaction with clo4 or bro3 based on a previous study kang and xing 2007 the asymmetric vascoo 1547 1560 cm 1 and symmetric bands at 1558 and 1401 cm 1 are ascribed to the carboxylates on fe gac the broad band at 3401 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching of o h groups associated with the interlayer water molecules the bands at 1079 1095 cm 1 are assigned to the c o and si o groups al ghouti et al 2017 in fe gac the si o groups are from sio2 in the gac and the observation is consistent with the results based on analysis of xrd xu et al 2016 the c o band of fe gac after reaction with bro3 shifted from 1095 cm 1 fe gac cl to 1087 5 cm 1 indicating that fe gac after reaction with bro3 has greater electrostatic attraction potential hong et al 2016 which is beneficial for the adsorption of clo4 furthermore the intensities of the c o and carboxylate functional groups after reactions with bro3 and clo4 were increased suggesting that the contents of these groups were increased which is consistent with the data in table 1 equation 1 depicts the redox reaction between carbon and bro3 1 bro3 c br c o or c ooh fang et al 2014 found that these oxygen containing organic groups on hydrophobic surfaces can greatly enhance adsorption of perchlorate via enhanced hydrogen bonding the bands at 2854 and 2929 cm 1 are assigned to symmetric and asymmetric c h bands which were also intensified after reaction with bro3 the other peaks of fe gac after reaction with bro3 remained unchanged adsorption of clo4 alone only slightly increased the peak of c o with others remaining the same table 2 gives the bet based characterization results of virgin gac and fe gac before and after reaction with bro3 in all cases the change in the bet surface area and pore volumes was less than 6 3 2 perchlorate removal in the presence of various concentrations of bromate fig 3 displays the final clo4 removal percentiles by 0 05 g l 1 fe gac or virgin gac at a fixed concentration 0 1 mmol l 1 of clo4 and in the presence of a range concentration of bro3 0 1 2 mmol l 1 the initial solution ph was 4 6 0 1 for the systems with fe gac due to the acidic nature of the iron salt fecl3 to facilitate a fair comparison the initial ph for the neat gac system was also adjusted to the same level fig 3 shows that the clo4 removal without bro3 was 58 by fe gac and 31 by gac and the clo4 removal increased with increasing bro3 concentration and reached the maximum of 66 for fe gac with 0 2 mmol l 1 of bro3 and 35 for gac with 0 1 mmol l 1 of bro3 statistical analyses confirmed the significant differences among the data p 0 022 for fe gac at bro3 0 0 2 mm per anova and p 0 015 for gac at bro3 0 0 1 mm per t test further increasing bro3 resulted in decreased removal of clo4 p 0 007 for fe gac at bro3 0 2 1 2 mm and p 0 000 for gac at bro3 0 1 1 2 mm per anova however the inhibitive effect was much confined for fe gac than gac for instance at bro3 1 2 mmol l 1 the clo4 removal was lowered by 15 for fe gac but 37 for gac compared to the maximum removals the results showed that while low concentrations of bro3 0 2 mmol l 1 for fe gac and 0 1 mmol l 1 for gac enhanced adsorption of clo4 by both fe gac and gac higher concentrations of bro3 may inhibit clo4 adsorption details on the underlying mechanisms are illustrated in section 3 6 fig 4 compares clo4 removal percentages by fe gac or gac at various concentrations of clo4 0 05 0 6 mm and bro3 clo4 molar ratios 0 1 1 3 or 1 1 at ph 4 6 0 1 fig 4a indicates that the presence of bro3 promoted clo4 removal by fe gac in all cases though the enhancement was less significant at bro3 clo4 1 3 statistical analyses anova indicated that the differences among the 3 bars for each group i e at each perchlorate concentration were significant p 0 014 for fe gac table s1 in si fig 4b indicates that the presence of bro3 significantly p 0 026 promoted clo4 removal by gac at clo4 concentration 0 1 mmol l 1 but had insignificant effect at higher clo4 concentrations p 0 833 table s1 3 3 effect of initial ph in a prior work we found that adsorption of clo4 onto fe gac or gac in single solute systems was dependent on the solution ph xu et al 2015 fig 5 a shows that the effect of initial solution ph on clo4 adsorption by fe gac or gac in the presence or absence of 0 1 mmol l 1 of bro3 as seen in fig 5a the clo4 uptake by gac sharply and progressively decreased when the initial ph was increased from 3 to 11 while the clo4 uptake by fe gac remained high in the initial ph range from 3 to 7 2 and then decreased at alkaline ph again the presence of 0 1 mm of bro3 not only enhanced the update of clo4 from 0 118 to 0 150 mmol g 1 for fe gac but also extended the optimal ph range to 4 7 2 the effect of bro3 on the uptake of clo4 by both fe gac and gac was statistically significant over a broad ph range e g p 0 001 at ph 3 7 though to a greater extent for fe gac fig 5b shows the relationship between initial and final ph and it is evident that fe gac was able to keep the final ph at a much lower level up to 1 8 ph units than gac especially in the initial ph range of 5 9 with or without 0 1 mmol l 1 bro3 evidently fe gac was able to maintain an acidic environment which was conducive to the bro3 reduction to br and more bro3 reduction in turn enhanced clo4 uptake this important attribute of fe gac is due to the ability of fe as a lewis acid to bind with oh bro3 showed stronger promoting effect on the adsorption of clo4 by fe gac at neutral or acidic ph though the effect faded at ph 9 0 furthermore the effect of bro3 was more on fe gac than on gac siddiqui et al 1996 reported that more bro3 reduction by gac was observed as the solution ph was decreased moreover although low concentrations 1 2 and 0 2 mg l of dissolved iron were detected after the tests at ph 2 80 and 10 88 respectively no fe was detected in the ph range of 3 0 9 0 indicating that fe gac is very stable 3 4 kinetics of simultaneous bromate reduction and perchlorate adsorption fig 6 shows the kinetics of clo4 adsorption by fe gac or gac in the presence of 0 or 0 1 mmol l 1 of bro3 table 3 presents the best fitted kinetic model parameters for the pseudo second order model 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where q e and q t are the amounts of clo4 adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t respectively and k 2 h g mmol 1 is the adsorption rate constant as shown in fig 6 the kinetics displayed a two phase profile i e a fast initial phase followed by a gradual phase with 90 removal occurred within the first 5 h for both materials the presence of 0 1 mmol l 1 bro3 increased the uptake of clo4 by fe gac by 23 and 14 at ph 4 6 and 6 0 respectively but had statistically insignificant effect p 0 05 on the adsorption by gac bro3 showed a slightly inhibitive effect 5 h but then a profoundly promoting effect on the adsorption rate of clo4 in the initial stage bro3 and clo4 were competitively adsorbed as a result less clo4 was adsorbed compared to the case without the competing co solute later as more bro3 was reduced to br more sites became available for clo4 in addition as reduction of bro3 was coupled with oxidation of gac significant modifications of the carbon surface occurred which is in favor of enhanced clo4 adsorption further discussed in section 3 6 in all cases the pseudo second order kinetic model was able to adequately fit the experimental data r2 0 96 table 3 for fe gac the rate constants were 9 90 and 9 46 mmol 1 h 1 at ph 4 6 or 6 0 respectively in the absence of bro3 these values were decreased to 3 36 and 3 66 g mmol 1 h 1 in the presence of 0 1 mmol l 1 of bro3 indicating that more complex reaction adsorption processes are operative fig 7 shows the transient concentrations of bro3 remaining and corresponding br production rate at an initial bro3 concentration of 0 1 mmol l 1 and in the presence or absence of 0 1 mmol l 1 of clo4 by fe gac or gac at ph 4 6 it is evident from fig 7 that the reduction of bro3 was stoichiometrically coupled with the production of br by fe gac and the bro3 removal rate by fe gac was lowered after the initial 3 h in the presence of clo4 which can be attributed to the competitive adsorption of clo4 the adsorption of clo4 rendered initially adsorbed bro3 available for the redox reactions with carbon resulting in increased br production rate in the presence of 0 1 mmol l 1 clo4 for both fe gac and gac when fe gac fig 7a and gac fig 7b are compared the bro3 reduction rate by fe gac was much faster than that by gac this can be due to the binding of h by fe gac which resulted in a more acidic local environment that is conducive to bro3 reduction in addition this observation supports the prior finding that fe3 in fegac may act as a catalyst facilitating the electron transfer between bro3 and carbon xu et al 2015 in the end of the experiments fe gac was able to completely remove the aqueous phase bro3 while gac removed only 45 3 5 perchlorate adsorption isotherms in the presence or absence of bromate fig 8 shows clo4 adsorption isotherms for fe gac or gac in the presence or absence of 0 2 mmol l 1 of co existing bro3 at a final ph 4 6 or 6 0 the experimental isotherm data were fitted with the classic langmuir eq 3 and freundlich eq 4 models 3 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where q max is the maximum solid phase concentration corresponding to a complete monolayer coverage of the adsorption sites k l is a constant related to the free energy of adsorption and k f and n are the freundlich model parameters related to the adsorption capacity and intensity respectively table 4 lists the best fitted isotherm model parameters the langmuir model better fitted the experimental data than the freundlich model based on the coefficient of determination and it fitted the fe gac isotherm data in the presence of 0 2 mmol l 1 of bro3 better than in the absence of bro3 suggesting that the reaction with bro3 rendered more uniform site energy in accord with the premise of the langmuir model the isotherm data confirmed that fe gac offers much greater adsorption capacities for clo4 adsorption than pristine gac at both ph levels and the presence of bro3 facilitated the adsorption by fe gac but had no effect on gac for instance the q max for fe gac 0 256 mmol g 1 in the presence of 0 2 mmol l 1 of bro3 at ph 6 0 was 1 43 times higher than that without bro3 0 179 mmol g 1 moreover the promoting effect of bro3 was higher at ph 6 0 than that at ph 4 6 1 25 times furthermore the values of k l for fe gac without bro3 22 46 or 29 08 at ph 4 6 or 6 0 were higher than those 18 24 or 15 55 with bro3 indicating that the reaction of bro3 indeed altered the free energy of adsorption for clo4 3 6 mechanisms for bromate reduction enhanced adsorption of perchlorate to understand the underlying mechanisms for bro3 and clo4 removal the reaction products in the solution were determined fig s2 in si shows the change of the peak area of cl so4 2 with varying clo4 or bro3 concentration the peak area kept stable when the clo4 concentration was increased from 0 1 to 0 6 mmol l 1 while increased almost linearly when the bro3 concentration was increased from 0 1 to 0 6 mmol l 1 the phenomena indicate that cl so4 2 from fecl3 and gac containing so4 2 can be exchanged with bro3 but not with clo4 the result is consistent with other works reported bhatnagar et al 2009 hong et al 2016 kumar et al 2010 mahmudov and huang 2010 indicating that ion exchange is the main mechanism for bro3 adsorption and in contrast specific interactions between perchlorate and surface functional groups in combination with electrostatic forces are responsible for perchlorate adsorption mahmudov and huang 2010 furthermore the peak area of cl so4 2 of fe gac was larger than that of gac which is due to the higher ion exchange capacity and that more chloride ions were introduced into the fe gac during the material synthesis fig s3 in si shows the change of br production rates by fe gac or gac in the presence of 0 2 mmol l 1 bro3 with the clo4 concentration 0 1 0 6 mmol l 1 the br production rate by fe gac or gac decreased when clo4 concentrations was increased from 0 1 to 0 6 mmol l 1 indicating that clo4 at elevated concentrations inhibited the reduction of bro3 note that the presence of clo4 at 0 1 mmol l 1 promoted the reaction fig 7 moreover the br production rate by fe gac was much higher than that by gac confirming again the important role of fe3 in fe gac as a catalyst in addition to its ph buffering capability xu et al 2015 it should be noted that the changes 1 2 in the bet surface area after the reaction with bro3 may not fully account for the 1 43 times higher adsorption of clo4 by fe gac in the presence of bro3 fig s4 in si shows the zeta potential of the solution after reaction with fe gac or gac in the presence or absence of bro3 the zeta potential of fe gac in the presence of bro3 and in the acidic ph range was more positive than that without bro3 reaching a peak at ph 4 0 4 5 indicating that bro3 reduction may have demolished some of the negatively charged moieties on the material surface moreover the surface of fe gac was much more positive than that of gac in the acidic ph range in addition the ph of point of zero charge phpzc of fe gac 5 8 was higher than that of gac 4 5 therefore the surface potential and phpzc played an important role in adsorption of bromate and perchlorate xps has been widely used to detect surface functional groups of reactive materials based on xps analysis hong et al 2016 observed that bro3 reduction by polypyrrole tailored ac increased the oxygen containing functional groups and mahmudov and huang 2010 reported that perchlorate adsorption occurs through specific interactions with surface functional groups on activated carbon to acquire further insights into the mechanisms for bro3 reduction and the reaction facilitated clo4 adsorption by fe gac fe gac before and after clo4 adsorption and bro3 reduction were investigated by xps and the results were shown in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows the high resolution xps spectra of fe 2s deconvolution of fe gac before and after reaction with 0 1 mmol l 1 of bro3 the peak of iron before the reaction occurred at binding energy 711 8 ev fig 9a confirming that the existence of fe3 on the surface of fe gac after reacting with bro3 the peak shifted to 711 5 ev fig 9b fig 10 shows xps spectra of o 1s deconvolution of virgin fe gac and fe gac after reaction with 0 1 mm clo4 and or bro3 the o 1s region of fe gac could be deconvoluted into four partially overlapped peaks at 529 7 531 0 531 9 and 533 4 ev corresponding to fe o oxide and fe oh of lattice structure oxygen and fe ohads and h2oads of adsorbed oxygen according to fig 10 the content of the hydroxyl groups decreased from 47 8 to 42 8 after reaction with clo4 to 33 5 after reaction with bro3 and to 35 after the simultaneous removal of clo4 and bro3 indicating that the surface hydroxyl groups were exchanged with bro3 but not with clo4 especially when bro3 is co present which is consistent with the change of ph during fe gac reaction with bro3 as stated in section 3 3 fig 10 also shows that the content of fe o increased from 9 3 to 18 8 when the concentration of bro3 was increased from 0 to 0 1 mmol l 1 indicating the reduction of bro3 can generate more fe o functional groups on fe gac which could result from fe3 reactions with carbon and bro3 furthermore according to the ftir and edx analyses fig 2 and table 1 the reaction also generated more c o groups on gac researchers have reported that electrostatic attraction and complexation were the main mechanisms for clo4 adsorption mahmudov and huang 2010 and the complexation was associated with the oxygen groups on gac therefore more fe o and c o groups on gac are more favorable for clo4 adsorption consequently the bromate reduction enhanced clo4 uptake by fe gac is attributed to both enhanced electrostatic interactions due to the more positive zeta potential and the elevated functionalities in contrast the adsorption of bro3 by fe gac was mainly anion exchange with cl and so4 2 and electrostatic interactions fig s5 in si presents a schematic diagram for bro3 reduction and the reaction enhanced adsorption of clo4 first bro3 and clo4 are co adsorbed by fe gac through ion exchange and surface complexation second adsorbed bro3 reacts with gac through redox reaction resulting in likely more uniform site energy better site accessibility and more functionalities for clo4 adsorption as bro3 is more reactive at acidic ph and fe gac can hold the ph in the acidic range the reduction of bro3 was more favored at acidic ph by fe gac moreover iron hydr oxides on fe gac can catalyze the bro3 reduction to br 4 conclusions in the study we found that bromate reduction to br by fecl3 impregnated gac can simultaneously enhance perchlorate adsorption the major research findings are recapped as follows 1 reduction of bromate enhanced perchlorate adsorption by fe gac when the bro3 clo4 molar ratio was below 4 however higher bro3 may inhibit the clo4 adsorption due to competitive adsorption 2 acidic ph favored bro3 reduction and resulted in greater clo4 uptake by fe gac the buffering capacity of fe gac rendered a broader optimum ph range of 4 7 2 for the simultaneous removal of bro3 and clo4 than that of virgin gac 3 the maximum langmuir capacity for clo4 by fe gac in the presence of 0 2 mmol l 1 of bro3 was 0 256 mol g 1 at ph 6 0 which is 1 43 times higher than that without bro3 0 179 mmol g 1 the reaction facilitated adsorption of perchlorate is attributed to the ph buffering ability of fe gac and the role of immobilized iron hydr oxides that may act a catalyst for reduction of bro3 the former maintained a local acidic environment whereas the latter created more functional groups resulting in enhanced adsorption of clo4 4 the pseudo second order kinetic model and the langmuir isotherm model adequately fit the experimental kinetic data and isotherms of clo4 by fe gac or gac in the presence or absence of bro3 and the langmuir model better fit the adsorption isotherms in the presence of bro3 than without bro3 5 bro3 was removed through a two stage process ion exchange on fe gac and then reduction by carbon which resulted in more fe o and c o groups the reaction also rendered a more positive zeta potential on fe gac resulting in more favorable surface conditions for enhanced clo4 adsorption by complexation and electrostatic attraction the results indicate that the new material fe gac may serve a useful alternative for simultaneous removal of clo4 and bro3 and the same idea may be extended for developing novel reactive materials for synergistic removal of mixed contaminants in water declaration of interests the authors declare

19142,a novel granulation strategy by applying the low intensity direct current dc electric field via reactive iron anode into the aerobic granular sludge ags system was systematically investigated in this study three identical sequencing batch reactors sbrs namely r1 r2 and r3 were operated for 100 days comparatively the r1 and r3 were continuously subjected to the 1 0 v dc electric field via a reactive fe anode and an inert ti ir rh anode respectively while the r2 without dc exposure the results showed that the sludge granulation processes were accelerated in order as follows r2 r3 r1 and the properties of mature granules were improved in order as follows r3 r2 r1 interestingly at the end of experiment total phosphorus tp removal efficiency in r1 dramatically increased to 80 52 which was 2 15 and 1 96 folds than that in r2 and r3 respectively further investigations revealed that this novel strategy could simultaneously improve the secretion of eps and the release of iron ions in r1 which cooperatively enhanced the granulation process moreover in r1 mineral precipitation of phosphate remarkably improved the capability of phosphorus removal the observed effective and stable performance highlights the feasibility and potential of this novel strategy for the rapid start up and stable operation of ags system graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granulation phosphorus removal reactive iron anode mineral precipitation cations distribution 1 introduction aerobic granule sludge ags which could be cultured through self immobilization of microorganisms under well controlled operation conditions exhibits compact and three dimensional structure embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps adav et al 2008 benefiting from these unique properties aerobic granulation technology has been extensively investigated over the past two decades ranging from lab scale researches to development of commercial brands nereda franca et al 2018 inocencio et al 2013 however long start up periods and instability of prolonged operation are still critical issues that hinder broader application of this promising technology zhang et al 2016a both of issues have been extensively investigated through the examination of various factors including environmental factors dissolved oxygen do ph temperature etc as well as operation parameters substrate composition organic loading rate olr feeding strategy and so on franca et al 2018 jafari and yuan 2017 unfortunately most of the controlled reactors could rapidly achieve aerobic granulation but gradually lose stability during the prolonged operation liu and tay 2008 zheng et al 2006 for instance with the overstressed olr of 12 g cod l d the visible granules appeared within 24 h while the compact granules turned into fluffy after two weeks leading to the biomass washout and the collapse of reactor operation liu and tay 2015 recently a few novel strategies which have been proposed for the enhancement of aerobic granulation could not only shorten the start up periods but also assist reactors in sustaining the stability these strategies could be divided into two major categories including the introduction of physical fields illumination electric and magnetic field etc huang et al 2014 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 as well as the addition of exogenous substances carriers chemical agents and so on liang et al 2017 tao et al 2017 specifically most of the abovementioned strategies suggested that the stability of prolonged operation was closely associated with the extracellular polymeric substance eps composition and the accumulation of cations inside granules in other words the related studies provide insights into how to maintain the ags stability electric field has been utilized to stimulate microbial metabolism for over 60 years and the outcomes of application are depended on the current intensity ranging from lethal to minor metabolic modifications thrash and coates 2008 recent studies have demonstrated that the application of low intensity electric field can enhance extracellular substance production and secretion due to changes in cell membrane permeability velasco alvarez et al 2017 except for the pure culture some attempts have been tried by applying the electric field into aerobic and anaerobic granular sludge processes resulting in the remarkable improvements of granulation rates and nutrients removal efficiencies huang et al 2014 liu et al 2011 moreover iron based chemical agents iron salts zero valent iron magnetic nanoparticles etc were also widely used as ideal additions to create the beneficial environment for mixed sludge processes due to their good biocompatibility and stability in physiological conditions and low cytotoxicity kong et al 2014 liang et al 2017 it was reported that divalent and trivalent cations such as ca2 mg2 fe2 and fe3 could contribute to the aggregation of bioflocs through charge neutralization and double layer compression and then the formation of mineral precipitates enhanced the structural integrity of ags franca et al 2018 in response to the utilization of electrical stimulation on microbial metabolism and physiochemical properties of iron ions fe2 and fe3 it was speculated that the application of low intensity direct current dc electric field via reactive iron anode into the ags system was likely to accelerate the granulation process and intensify the strength of granules similarly the joint effects of electric field force and the electrically released cations have been documented on the membrane bioreactor mbr for fouling suppression zhang et al 2015 and the anammox process for the nitrogen removal zhang et al 2012 however to the best of our knowledge the above mentioned assumption was not systematically investigated on the ags system which may provide a new insight into the aerobic granulation in this study a novel granulation strategy by applying the low intensity dc electric field via reactive iron anode into the ags system was proposed and systematically investigated in r1 the r2 was without electrodes as a control the r3 was equipped with inert electrodes and the intensity of electric field was identical with r1 to achieve the goal of the rapid start up and stable operation of ags system the feasibility and effectiveness of this strategy were evaluated in terms of the granules physicochemical characteristics and the reactors performance on cod and nutrients removal efficiencies moreover eps fractionation of sludge micro characteristics of mature aerobic granules and microbial community dynamics were investigated to explore the potential mechanism of this strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 1 6 l φ60 mm 700 mm was inserted with a pair of iron titanium electrodes to investigate the feasibility of this granulation strategy hereafter referred to as r1 whose configuration is illustrated in fig a 1 in brief an iron rod φ3mm 750 mm was fixed in the center of r1 as the reactive anode meanwhile a spiral shaped titanium wire wire diameter 3 mm spiral diameter 54 mm and spiral height 750 mm was closely surrounded in the internal wall of r1 as the inert cathode moreover the control experiments were conducted in another two sbrs one of them was a common reactor hereafter referred to as r2 that was the same as r1 but without the electrodes to clarify the influence of sole electric field on aerobic granulation under this experimental condition another control reactor hereafter referred to as r3 was operated in parallel whose configuration was the same as r1 except for the rod shaped ti ir inert anode φ3mm 750 mm instead of the reactive iron anode all of the electrodes were soaked in 1 naoh solution for 24 h and then washed with dilute hcl and deionized water to clean their surfaces afterwards the electrodes were inserted into reactors and connected to a regulated dc power source fps 325d shenzhen zhaoxin electronic co ltd china 2 2 inoculum sludge and synthetic wastewater fresh activated sludge was collected from the secondary clarifier of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant in harbin china and then cultivated with synthetic domestic wastewater in an aeration tank to assist the biomass in adapting variation of nutrient substances afterwards each reactor was inoculated 0 8 l of the acclimated activated sludge resulting in the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration was 3 6 g l with sludge volume index svi30 of 78 4 ml g and mlvss mlss of 0 49 in all three reactors the synthetic domestic wastewater was prepared according to the following composition 600 mg l cod ch3coona 60 mg l nh4 n nh4 2so4 10 mg l of po4 3 p kh2po4 k2hpo4 12 mg l of mg2 mgso4 7h2o 20 mg l ca2 cacl2 and 1 0 m props value literpattern l trace element solution the trace element solution consisted of the following compounds per liter 1 5 g of fecl3 6h2o 0 15 g of h3bo3 0 03 g of cuso4 5h2o 0 18 g of ki 0 12 g of mncl2 4h2o 0 06 g of na2moo4 2h2o 0 12 g of znso4 7h2o 0 15 g of cocl2 6h2o and 0 04 g of edta kishida et al 2006 2 3 reactor operation all of the reactors were operated in successive cycles with each cycle lasting 4 h one cycle consisted of four successive phases 5 min feeding 210 225 min aeration 5 20 min settling and 5 min effluent discharge with volumetric exchange ratio of 37 5 resulting in a hydraulic retention time of 10 7 h with the improvement of sludge settling ability settling time was gradually decreased from 20 min to 5 min to prevent biomass washout at first and intensify microbial selection pressure afterwards moreover after 60 days operation a certain amount of mixed liquor was termly withdrawn at the end of aeration phase in order to maintain a steady mlss concentration with solid retention time srt of approximately 20 days uniform air bubbles for aeration and mixing were supplied through an air sparger at the bottom of the reactor with an air flow rate of 1 2 cm s and the dissolved oxygen do maintained between 6 0 and 7 0 mg l during aeration phase our preliminary electrochemical experiment showed that when the voltage of 1 0 v was applied into reactors pure electrochemical reaction without inoculum sludge did not result in any cod and nutrients removal and the fluctuation of physicochemical properties ph t and do of synthetic wastewater moreover taking into account the effects of electric field on microbial metabolism thrash and coates 2008 the voltage of 1 0 v was finally determined and constantly supplied to r1 and r3 during the whole operation period moreover the corresponding current densities of r1 and r3 gradually decreased from 2 1 to 0 3 a m2 and 1 3 to 0 2 a m2 respectively which were in accordance with the related researches ibeid et al 2013 liu et al 2015 2 4 analytical methods the influent and effluent concentration of cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n and total phosphorus tp mixed liquor volatile suspended solids ml v ss and sludge volume index svi30 were regularly measured in accordance with standard method apha 2005 do and ph of bulk liquid were detected with do and ph meters hach usa respectively it showed that ph and do of bulk liquid fluctuated between 7 0 and 9 0 as well as 6 0 and 7 0 mg l respectively which were harmless for bacteria franca et al 2018 therefore the two parameters in all three reactors were not intentionally controlled by extra methods the granules were consistently sampled at the end of the aeration phase the micro physicochemical properties of the granules were evaluated through particle size distribution observation of morphology and identification of ash substance particle size distribution was measured by a laser particle size analysis system mastersizer 2000 morphology characteristics of granules collected on day 100 were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem sigma 500 zeiss according to the published method yang et al 2014 x ray diffraction xrd analysis of granules collected on day 100 were performed using a d8 advance diffractometer bruker axs germany with a cobalt tube scattering from 5 to 75 in 2 θ the sludge samples used for xrd analysis were previously rinsed with deionized water lyophilized and incinerated in an oven at 500 cfor 2 h in order to remove organic fractions lin et al 2013 moreover the intracellular reactive oxygen species ros production of granular sludge on day 100 was also measured according to the instructions of ros kit beyotime institute of biotechnology china the ros production was qualitatively analyzed by fluorescence microscopic bx51 olympus as well as quantitatively read at 488 nm for excitation and 525 nm for emission with a microplate reader m200 pro tecan the detailed experimental method was described in supporting information a standard procedure for eps fractionation of sludge was employed in accordance with the previously published research li et al 2014 according to this method the sludge samples were separated into four fractions bulk solution loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps and pellet furthermore the investigation found that the major components of extracted eps in this study were protein pn and polysaccharides ps which accounted for 75 90 of the total eps as reported by tsuneda et al 2003 therefore contents of pn and ps in the extracted eps were quantified by the bradford method with bovine serum albumin bsa as standard bradford 1976 and the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as standard dubois et al 1956 respectively meanwhile the concentrations of cations distributed in the four fractions of sludge samples were respectively measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp aes optima 5300 dv perkin elmer the pellet was digested following the standard method usepa method 3051a before analysis 2 5 high throughput sequencing to analyze the dynamics of bacterial community structures during aerobic granulation bacterial community compositions of the inoculum sludge and the three ags samples on day 100 were investigated using high throughput sequencing technology the bacterial dna was extracted using the e z n a soil dna extraction kit omega usa according to the manufacturer s protocol the quality and quantity of the extracted dna was assessed by a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified using the universal primers 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 the detailed experimental and analytical methods were described in supporting information 3 results 3 1 reactor performance 3 1 1 aerobic granulation process to investigate the aerobic granulation process ml v ss svi 30 and particle size of sludge samples were regularly measured in all three reactors table 1 the acclimated inoculum sludge had a fluffy and irregular structure with svi30 of 78 ml g and average particle diameter of 90 μm during the initiation phase i days 0 20 settling time was progressively reduced for separating fast settling biological aggregates from poorly settling sludge whereas the concentrations of mlss in r1 r2 and r3 sharply decreased from the initial 3 6 g l to 1 9 1 5 and 1 8 g l respectively the svi30 decreased to 41 55 and 42 ml g in r1 r2 and r3 respectively implying the slightly better settling ability of sludge in r1 and r3 moreover as shown in fig 1 particle average diameters in r1 and r3 increased to 200 μm within the 20 days while that in r2 until day 25 the multiplication phase ii days 20 60 continued until the day of a nearly null variation in the size distribution of granules namely the periods of stability which was achieved for all three reactors after 60 days of operation fig 1 specifically particle average diameter of r1 r2 and r3 stabilized at 1 23 1 28 mm 0 78 0 83 mm and 0 64 0 68 mm respectively the multiplication phase was characterized by a significant increase in the concentration of mlss afterwards the biomass wasting strategy was implemented at the end of aeration phase to maintain a stable mlss concentration with the srt of 20 days at the stabilization phase iii days 60 100 comparatively mature granules in r1 exhibited the largest critical size 1 2 1 3 mm the highest mlss concentration 4 5 g l and the lowest svi30 34 ml g indicating the enhanced aerobic granulation it is worthy of noting that although the r1 and r3 had similar granulation rates before the 40 days of operation mlss and particle average diameter in r3 gradually decreased to the smallest values afterwards namely 2 5 g l and 0 68 mm respectively compared to those in r1 and r2 this result indicated that the r3 operated under the exposure of electric field via inert electrodes could rapidly form aerobic granules but failed to maintain long term stability of granules structure 3 1 2 overall performance on cod and nutrients removal compared to conventional activated sludge process ags has a remarkable capability of simultaneous cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal in an individual reactor under the operating mode of sequencing batch wang et al 2017 during the whole operation overall performance on cod and nutrients removal was determined and the results are presented in fig 2 there were slight fluctuations in the cod removal efficiencies especially at initial 40 days operation possibly due to biomass washout fig 2a afterwards average removal efficiency of cod in r1 reached a stable value of 97 12 which was higher than that in r2 95 19 and in r3 95 09 moreover all of the reactors could maintain a similar cod effluent concentration of approximate 30 mg l date not shown indicating that acetate as a sole carbon source could be well degraded by bacteria in the ags system fig 2b illustrates the tp removal profile in all three reactors at the end of experiment tp removal efficiency in r1 dramatically increased to 80 52 which was 2 15 and 1 96 folds than that in r2 37 46 and r3 41 06 respectively in addition with regard to r1 variation tendency of tp removal efficiency was similar to that of granular size growth fig 1a whereas this phenomenon was not clearly observed in another two reactors thus the improved capability of tp removal in r1 may be related to the characteristics of mature aerobic granules which would be further investigated in this study as shown in fig 2c the tn removal efficiencies manifested slight differences among all three reactors specifically tn removal efficiencies of 68 05 51 28 and 51 65 were respectively achieved in r1 r2 and r3 at the end of experiment moreover the nitrogen species nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were also simultaneously monitored to further distinguish the nitrification and denitrification performance the ammonia removal efficiencies of approximate 99 0 were achieved in all three reactors from the initial period until the end of experiment the nitrite transformed from ammonia was detected whose concentration was negligible and lower than 0 5 mg l data not shown the nitrate which is a final product from biological nitrification process was largely accumulated in the system as shown in fig 2d effluent concentration of nitrate in r1 was 19 99 mg l lower than that in r2 29 95 mg l and in r3 29 85 mg l whereas it did not reach an environmental friendly concentration of discharge therefore although r1 exhibited the better tn removal performance than other reactors the capability of denitrification i e no3 n n2 was not sufficient which need to be further optimized in the ongoing research 3 2 characteristics of mature aerobic granules 3 2 1 observation of micro morphology the inoculum sludge was characterized of a dark brown in color and irregular structure the mature aerobic granules in all three reactors exhibited various appearances which were visually recorded by digital camera optical microscopy and sem fig a2 digital and optical microscopic images of aerobic granules taken from r1 clearly revealed a uniformly spherical structure with the core of mineral like precipitates and interconnected channels sem images captured in low magnification revealed that the structure of mature granules in r1 was clear cut rigid and compact while that in other reactors showed a rough irregular and loose surface especially in r3 moreover sem images of high magnification showed that cocci and rod shaped bacteria bacilli shaped bacteria and cross linked cocci shaped bacteria prevailed the surfaces of granules in r1 r2 and r3 respectively these images further revealed the unique structure of granules in r1 which was in agreement with the excellent and stable performance of r1 3 2 2 identification of mineral precipitates aerobic granules in r1 had a compacter structure a lower mlvss mlss and a mineral like precipitates core table 1 and fig a2b compared to that in other reactors thus xrd analysis an efficient tool for distinguishing crystalline minerals from those of amorphous structure was also employed on mature aerobic granules sampled on day 100 interestingly the significant diffractogram was just found in the granule samples from r1 while not from r2 and r3 a recent research found that the precipitation of calcium carbonate was dependent on aerobic granule size liu et al 2016 which may give an explanation that the absence of mineral precipitates in r2 and r3 was also due to their smaller particle diameter than that in r1 to further estimate other possible mineral precipitates in granules their saturation index si were also calculated using the software of visual miniteq ver 3 1 table a1 based on average concentrations of major ions and ph of supernatant liquor from the samples of digested mature granules as illustrated in fig 3 major peaks in the diffractogram were coincident with those of hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh pattern and calcium iron phosphate ca9fe po4 7 pattern by comparison with portable document format standard card 2004 based on software of jade 6 0 table a1 shows that the hydroxyapatite and the vivianite were major minerals in all three reactors especially a higher si obtained in r1 however according to the portable document format standard cards the observed xrd peaks did not match with those of vivianite pattern possibly due to the instability of vivianite when incinerated in an oven at 500 c for 2 h gadgil and kulshreshtha 1994 to the best of our knowledge calcium iron phosphate ca9fe po4 7 one of the iron phosphate compounds containing calcium atom lazoryak et al 2003 was firstly found in this study whereas its formation mechanism is still not clear in the biological wastewater treatment system 3 3 eps fractionation of sludge 3 3 1 variation of pn and ps contents eps secreted by bacteria plays a significant role in the aerobic granulation and the maintenance of structural integrity of ags franca et al 2018 sheng et al 2010 different eps fractions of sludge possess the distinct characteristics of organic matters and cations which determine the function of microbial aggregates shi et al 2017 thus eps fractionation of sludge was employed as described in 2 4 and the results are illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5 at the end of experiment in all three reactors the pn contents of lb eps and tb eps of granular sludge dramatically increased fig 4 specifically in the fraction of lb eps the pn concentration in r1 r2 and r3 was up to 61 56 50 34 and 88 46 mg gvss which was 8 42 6 89 and 12 10 folds than that in the inoculum sludge 7 31 mg gvss respectively in the fraction of tb eps the pn concentration in r1 r2 and r3 was up to 101 92 72 66 and 108 86 mg gvss which was 4 23 3 01 and 4 52 folds than that in the inoculum sludge 24 11 mg gvss respectively however the ps concentration nearly kept constant in all of the eps fractions implying that the variation of pn content was more closely related to the granulation process and structural stability of ags during the whole measurement contents of pn extracted from the lb and tb eps fractions in r2 were consistently lower than that in r1 and r3 indicating the electric field may stimulate bacteria to secrete more eps the results were in somewhat agreement with previous related studies huang et al 2014 liu et al 2011 moreover although r1 and r3 were exposed to the electric field of identical intensity there existed the distinct differences in the variation tendency of pn contents extracted from different eps fractions specifically pn content in r1 was firstly increased in the all eps fractions but then slightly decreased and increased in the fraction of lb eps and tb eps respectively fig 4a by contrast pn content in r3 consistently kept a tendency of increase in all of the eps fractions fig 4c this observation indicated that the pn in r1 was inclined to distribute in the fraction of tb eps which was in accordance with the compact structure of granules 3 3 2 cations distribution of different fractions a number of studies has documented that the sludge granulation was related to the accumulation of multivalent cations especially three metal ions iron calcium and magnesium extensively reported kończak et al 2014 li et al 2014 sajjad and kim 2015 fig 5 illustrates the cations distribution of different fractions of granular sludge on day 100 with regard to r1 although iron ions were continuously released into the mixed liquor from the surface of reactive iron anode a majority of iron ions were accumulated in the fraction of pellet resulting in the effluent concentration of total iron of lower 0 2 mg l data not shown moreover in r2 and r3 iron ions originating from trace element solution of synthetic wastewater also distributed in the fraction of pellet whereas calcium and magnesium ions nearly distributed in all of the fractions which was in agreement with a previous related report kończak et al 2014 interestingly although the influent concentrations of calcium and magnesium from synthetic wastewater were identical for all three rectors mature granules in r1 contained more amount of calcium and magnesium which were 0 51 and 0 39 folds 0 45 and 0 30 folds higher than those in r2 and r3 respectively this results indicated that the presence of iron ions perhaps be beneficial to retain more other divalent cations into the sludge which jointly contributed to the formation of compact granules 3 3 3 microbial community dynamics high throughput sequencing technology was also employed to explore the microbial community structure of inoculum sludge and three ags samples on day 100 from r1 r2 and r3 respectively as shown in table a 2 effective sequences for samples r1 r2 and r3 were divided into 3091 2567 and 3032 operational taxonomic units otus respectively based on the similarity of the domain value 0 97 four other indexes including the ace and the chao for the community richness the shannon and the simpson for the community diversity were also calculated for evaluating the differences of alpha diversity of microbial communities among the three ags samples at the end of experiment the result showed that the richness and diversities of microbial communities enriched in the different reactors were almost identical moreover microbial community structures of the inoculum sludge and the three ags samples were further analyzed at the phyla and genus level fig 6 a shows that all of the sludge samples were dominated by the phyla proteobacteria and bacteroidetes whose relative abundances were dramatically increased during the granulation process especially that in r1 and r3 moreover relative abundance of the phylum planctomycetes decreased to 3 97 r1 8 15 r2 and 1 77 r3 respectively compared to 11 45 of the inoculum sludge on the contrary relative abundance of the phylum verrucomicrobia increased to 4 23 r1 14 38 r2 and 4 21 r3 respectively compared to 2 28 of the inoculum sludge in terms of the phyla level microbial communities of the ags in r1 and r3 were similar possibly due to the influence of electric field of identical intensity the heat map of the genus level illustrates that the prevailing genera in the three ags samples were obviously different from that in the inoculum sludge fig 6b the dominant genera shared by all of the ags samples were gemmobacter zoogloea and flavobacterium which were typically microbes from the aerobic granules in terms of previous researches he et al 2016 liu et al 2014 in addition the genera of azoarcus and thauera were exclusively enriched in r1 accounting for 10 65 and 3 53 respectively it is noteworthy that although a certain amount of iron was electrochemically released into the mixed liquor and accumulated inside granules the acknowledged sequences affiliated to iron reducing bacteria and iron oxidizing bacteria shi et al 2016 were not detected in the ags sample from r1 these results also implied that the enhanced performance of r1 did not simply result from the enrichment of certain functional bacteria but the synergistic cooperation of multiple factors 4 discussion 4 1 synergistic cooperation enhancing aerobic granulation aerobic granules in r1 could not only be rapidly formed within 10 days but also manifested a uniformly spherical structure with the core of mineral precipitates the observed effective and stable performance highlights the feasibility and potential of this novel strategy for the rapid start up and stable operation of ags system in the bio electrochemical system bes if the potential difference between the anode and cathode is set beyond 1 2 v vs normal hydrogen electrode oxidative electrolysis of water and reduction of protons will occur thrash and coates 2008 zhang et al 2016b thereby under the exposure of 1 0 v 1 2 v low intensity dc electric field the major effects were just played on the two parts namely microorganisms and reactive iron anode as shown in fig a3 based on quantitative and quantitative analysis it revealed that ros production of mature granular sludge in r1 and r3 were 1 05 and 1 14 folds than that in r2 respectively suggesting that 1 0 v electric field maybe induced an extent of oxidative stress in the cells moreover at the end of experiment it was observed that reactive iron anode was covered with a certain thickness of biofilms and its diameter decreased by 5 due to the dissolution of iron ions fig a4 thus the possible synergistic mechanism responsible for the enhanced aerobic granulation in r1 was proposed and illustrated in fig 7 fig 7 depicts that this novel strategy possibly profits from the two independent effects including the electrical stimulation of microorganisms and the electrical release of iron ions to identify the role of the former the r3 was operated under the exposure of sole electric field via inert electrodes as shown in figs 1 and 4 the visible granules in r1 and r3 simultaneously appeared and sooner than r2 similarly eps contents especially the pn in r1 and r3 dramatically increased by a nearly identical extent which was obviously higher than that in r2 these results suggested that the electric field may stimulate bacteria to secret a large amount of eps and then accelerate the granulation process this effect of electric field on the eps secretion has been observed and utilized in the sludge granulation processes hoseinzadeh et al 2017 huang et al 2014 some studies have documented that the application of electric field could enhance the permeability of bacterial membrane through inducing physiochemical reactions of membrane lipid composition including the reorientation of aliphatic lipid and the peroxidation of unsaturated lipid velasco alvarez et al 2017 the enhancement of membrane permeability may result in a large amount of eps secretion in addition the presence of low intensity electric field could promote the bacterial transport by hampering the initial microbial adhesion on the solid surface qin et al 2015 taken together it was inferred that the electric field played a positive role in the granulation process which was benefited from the increased bacterial collision probability and the largely improved eps secretion moreover the iron rod was used as the anode from which ferrous ions would be gradually released into the mixed liquor via anodic oxidation it was expected that the electrically released ions would enhance the bacteria gathering whereas the clear granules in r1 and r3 simultaneously appeared within 20 days during the multiplication phase ii days 20 60 the properties of aerobic granules were improved in order as follows r3 r2 r1 in terms of the average diameter and the compactness the results suggested that the electrically released iron ions played a crucial role in the multiplication phase of aerobic granules as shown in fig 7 firstly the ferrous ions were electrochemically released into the mixed liquor from the surface of reactive iron anode and then oxidized to ferric ions at the aeration phase of r1 next the functional groups of eps amide i coo etc acted as electron shuttles to bind the multivalent cations such as iron calcium and magnesium ions jin and guan 2014 finally as shown in fig 5 a majority of iron ions were accumulated in the core of granules due to the high affinity of iron ions with the bacterial surface kończak et al 2014 whereas the calcium and magnesium ions nearly distributed in all of the eps fractions in addition the above mentioned developmental process could be further confirmed by the variation tendencies of pn ps in the different eps fractions as illustrated in fig 4 during the whole experiment in r1 the ratio of pn to ps in the fraction of tb eps was constantly higher to that in the fractions of lb eps suggesting that the iron ions accumulated inside granules could assist more protein predominantly distributing in the core region of granules furthermore the higher pn content and pn ps could effectively reduce the sludge surface charge which favors the microbial aggregation and stability of granules structure zhu et al 2012 konczak et al also found that three dimensional polysaccharide network of aerobic granules could be well developed in presence of divalent cations ca2 or mg2 while more compact granules formed by the addition of all cations ca2 mg2 fe3 to the reactors kończak et al 2014 by contrast in r3 more protein was located in the fraction of lb eps without the assistance of adequate iron ions consequently the excessive eps in the form of lb eps deteriorated sludge settling ability and weakened granules structure of r3 basuvaraj et al 2015 4 2 mineral precipitation improving phosphorus removal aerobic granules cultivated in r1 possessed more excellent cod and nutrients removal capability than that in r2 and r3 especially on the tp removal fig 2 with the maturation of aerobic granules the tp removal efficiency in r1 was gradually improved and then stabilized indicating that the capability of phosphorous removal depended on the characteristics of aerobic granules in other words in r1 the enhanced granules structure may contribute to the improved phosphorous removal it is acknowledged that the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process mainly relies on the ability of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos to take up transform and store excess amount of phosphorus inside the cells however the dominant genera shared by all of the three reactors manifested the slight differences implying that the biological phosphorus removal by paos was not the only phosphorus route in r1 moreover as illustrated in fig 3 hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh and calcium iron phosphate ca9fe po4 7 were identified as the major phosphorous minerals inside granules in r1 their formation could provide the r1 with a potential phosphorus removal route because the phosphate was one major component of hydroxyapatite and calcium iron phosphate afterwards a certain amount of mixed liquor must be termly withdrawn from a reactor in order to thoroughly remove phosphorus the mineral precipitation that contribute to phosphorus removal have been widely observed in the biological wastewater treatment system angela et al 2011 huang et al 2015 in the calcium phosphate mineral family hydroxyapatite has been widely reported and considered as the most stable and insoluble one huang et al 2015 angela et al confirmed that hydroxyapatite was the major biologically induced mineral precipitates which was responsible for 45 of the overall phosphorus removal angela et al 2011 interestingly except for the acknowledged hydroxyapatite calcium iron phosphate ca9fe po4 7 was firstly identified by xrd analysis which could be synthesized from stoichiometric mixtures mixed of fe2o3 ca2p2o7 and caco3 by the solid state method at 1300 k for 150 h ground every 30 h in alumina crucibles lazoryak et al 2003 taking into account the pretreatment method of sludge samples used for xrd analysis 500 c incineration for 2 h it was inferred that the acquirement of calcium iron phosphate was not due to the transition of other mineral precipitates thereby it may be another mineral precipitate that was induced by an undiscovered biological process and it is worthy of in depth research in the future except for the contribution to phosphorus removal the mineral precipitation seemed to be closely related to the enhancement of ags stability firstly due to phosphate release by paos in the anaerobic part of granules concentrations of a higher local phosphate and cations bridged with eps might reach an equilibrium state and encourage mineral precipitation secondly the enriched genera of azoarcus and thauera fig 6b often occur together and are functionally important denitrifying bacteria in activated sludge qiao et al 2015 hence an increased alkalinity preventing dissolution of mineral precipitates high ph increases si of phosphate precipitation in general mineral precipitation provided one more route of phosphorus removal for aerobic granules with enriched cations iron calcium and magnesium whose formation and accumulation in the core of granules profited the long term stability of r1 as well 5 conclusions a novel strategy by applying the 1 0 v dc electric field via reactive iron anode into the ags system was systematically investigated in this study the results demonstrated that this strategy could effectively accelerate the rate of granulation and maintain the integrity of granular structure 1 by comparison aerobic granules in r1 rapidly grew and reached a steady state particle size distribution spreading around the critical size of 1 2 1 3 mm which also exhibited a compact structure with the core of mineral precipitates and interconnected channels 2 xrd analysis and si calculation demonstrated that hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh and calcium iron phosphate ca9fe po4 7 were the major phosphorus minerals inside granules of r1 3 under the manipulation of this strategy the electrical stimulation on eps secretion and the electrically released iron ions synergistically enhanced the granulation process furthermore the formation and accumulation of mineral precipitates inside granules improved the capability of phosphorus removal meanwhile maintained the long term stability of r1 acknowledgements the research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51778172 state key

19142,a novel granulation strategy by applying the low intensity direct current dc electric field via reactive iron anode into the aerobic granular sludge ags system was systematically investigated in this study three identical sequencing batch reactors sbrs namely r1 r2 and r3 were operated for 100 days comparatively the r1 and r3 were continuously subjected to the 1 0 v dc electric field via a reactive fe anode and an inert ti ir rh anode respectively while the r2 without dc exposure the results showed that the sludge granulation processes were accelerated in order as follows r2 r3 r1 and the properties of mature granules were improved in order as follows r3 r2 r1 interestingly at the end of experiment total phosphorus tp removal efficiency in r1 dramatically increased to 80 52 which was 2 15 and 1 96 folds than that in r2 and r3 respectively further investigations revealed that this novel strategy could simultaneously improve the secretion of eps and the release of iron ions in r1 which cooperatively enhanced the granulation process moreover in r1 mineral precipitation of phosphate remarkably improved the capability of phosphorus removal the observed effective and stable performance highlights the feasibility and potential of this novel strategy for the rapid start up and stable operation of ags system graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granulation phosphorus removal reactive iron anode mineral precipitation cations distribution 1 introduction aerobic granule sludge ags which could be cultured through self immobilization of microorganisms under well controlled operation conditions exhibits compact and three dimensional structure embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps adav et al 2008 benefiting from these unique properties aerobic granulation technology has been extensively investigated over the past two decades ranging from lab scale researches to development of commercial brands nereda franca et al 2018 inocencio et al 2013 however long start up periods and instability of prolonged operation are still critical issues that hinder broader application of this promising technology zhang et al 2016a both of issues have been extensively investigated through the examination of various factors including environmental factors dissolved oxygen do ph temperature etc as well as operation parameters substrate composition organic loading rate olr feeding strategy and so on franca et al 2018 jafari and yuan 2017 unfortunately most of the controlled reactors could rapidly achieve aerobic granulation but gradually lose stability during the prolonged operation liu and tay 2008 zheng et al 2006 for instance with the overstressed olr of 12 g cod l d the visible granules appeared within 24 h while the compact granules turned into fluffy after two weeks leading to the biomass washout and the collapse of reactor operation liu and tay 2015 recently a few novel strategies which have been proposed for the enhancement of aerobic granulation could not only shorten the start up periods but also assist reactors in sustaining the stability these strategies could be divided into two major categories including the introduction of physical fields illumination electric and magnetic field etc huang et al 2014 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 as well as the addition of exogenous substances carriers chemical agents and so on liang et al 2017 tao et al 2017 specifically most of the abovementioned strategies suggested that the stability of prolonged operation was closely associated with the extracellular polymeric substance eps composition and the accumulation of cations inside granules in other words the related studies provide insights into how to maintain the ags stability electric field has been utilized to stimulate microbial metabolism for over 60 years and the outcomes of application are depended on the current intensity ranging from lethal to minor metabolic modifications thrash and coates 2008 recent studies have demonstrated that the application of low intensity electric field can enhance extracellular substance production and secretion due to changes in cell membrane permeability velasco alvarez et al 2017 except for the pure culture some attempts have been tried by applying the electric field into aerobic and anaerobic granular sludge processes resulting in the remarkable improvements of granulation rates and nutrients removal efficiencies huang et al 2014 liu et al 2011 moreover iron based chemical agents iron salts zero valent iron magnetic nanoparticles etc were also widely used as ideal additions to create the beneficial environment for mixed sludge processes due to their good biocompatibility and stability in physiological conditions and low cytotoxicity kong et al 2014 liang et al 2017 it was reported that divalent and trivalent cations such as ca2 mg2 fe2 and fe3 could contribute to the aggregation of bioflocs through charge neutralization and double layer compression and then the formation of mineral precipitates enhanced the structural integrity of ags franca et al 2018 in response to the utilization of electrical stimulation on microbial metabolism and physiochemical properties of iron ions fe2 and fe3 it was speculated that the application of low intensity direct current dc electric field via reactive iron anode into the ags system was likely to accelerate the granulation process and intensify the strength of granules similarly the joint effects of electric field force and the electrically released cations have been documented on the membrane bioreactor mbr for fouling suppression zhang et al 2015 and the anammox process for the nitrogen removal zhang et al 2012 however to the best of our knowledge the above mentioned assumption was not systematically investigated on the ags system which may provide a new insight into the aerobic granulation in this study a novel granulation strategy by applying the low intensity dc electric field via reactive iron anode into the ags system was proposed and systematically investigated in r1 the r2 was without electrodes as a control the r3 was equipped with inert electrodes and the intensity of electric field was identical with r1 to achieve the goal of the rapid start up and stable operation of ags system the feasibility and effectiveness of this strategy were evaluated in terms of the granules physicochemical characteristics and the reactors performance on cod and nutrients removal efficiencies moreover eps fractionation of sludge micro characteristics of mature aerobic granules and microbial community dynamics were investigated to explore the potential mechanism of this strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 1 6 l φ60 mm 700 mm was inserted with a pair of iron titanium electrodes to investigate the feasibility of this granulation strategy hereafter referred to as r1 whose configuration is illustrated in fig a 1 in brief an iron rod φ3mm 750 mm was fixed in the center of r1 as the reactive anode meanwhile a spiral shaped titanium wire wire diameter 3 mm spiral diameter 54 mm and spiral height 750 mm was closely surrounded in the internal wall of r1 as the inert cathode moreover the control experiments were conducted in another two sbrs one of them was a common reactor hereafter referred to as r2 that was the same as r1 but without the electrodes to clarify the influence of sole electric field on aerobic granulation under this experimental condition another control reactor hereafter referred to as r3 was operated in parallel whose configuration was the same as r1 except for the rod shaped ti ir inert anode φ3mm 750 mm instead of the reactive iron anode all of the electrodes were soaked in 1 naoh solution for 24 h and then washed with dilute hcl and deionized water to clean their surfaces afterwards the electrodes were inserted into reactors and connected to a regulated dc power source fps 325d shenzhen zhaoxin electronic co ltd china 2 2 inoculum sludge and synthetic wastewater fresh activated sludge was collected from the secondary clarifier of a local municipal wastewater treatment plant in harbin china and then cultivated with synthetic domestic wastewater in an aeration tank to assist the biomass in adapting variation of nutrient substances afterwards each reactor was inoculated 0 8 l of the acclimated activated sludge resulting in the initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration was 3 6 g l with sludge volume index svi30 of 78 4 ml g and mlvss mlss of 0 49 in all three reactors the synthetic domestic wastewater was prepared according to the following composition 600 mg l cod ch3coona 60 mg l nh4 n nh4 2so4 10 mg l of po4 3 p kh2po4 k2hpo4 12 mg l of mg2 mgso4 7h2o 20 mg l ca2 cacl2 and 1 0 m props value literpattern l trace element solution the trace element solution consisted of the following compounds per liter 1 5 g of fecl3 6h2o 0 15 g of h3bo3 0 03 g of cuso4 5h2o 0 18 g of ki 0 12 g of mncl2 4h2o 0 06 g of na2moo4 2h2o 0 12 g of znso4 7h2o 0 15 g of cocl2 6h2o and 0 04 g of edta kishida et al 2006 2 3 reactor operation all of the reactors were operated in successive cycles with each cycle lasting 4 h one cycle consisted of four successive phases 5 min feeding 210 225 min aeration 5 20 min settling and 5 min effluent discharge with volumetric exchange ratio of 37 5 resulting in a hydraulic retention time of 10 7 h with the improvement of sludge settling ability settling time was gradually decreased from 20 min to 5 min to prevent biomass washout at first and intensify microbial selection pressure afterwards moreover after 60 days operation a certain amount of mixed liquor was termly withdrawn at the end of aeration phase in order to maintain a steady mlss concentration with solid retention time srt of approximately 20 days uniform air bubbles for aeration and mixing were supplied through an air sparger at the bottom of the reactor with an air flow rate of 1 2 cm s and the dissolved oxygen do maintained between 6 0 and 7 0 mg l during aeration phase our preliminary electrochemical experiment showed that when the voltage of 1 0 v was applied into reactors pure electrochemical reaction without inoculum sludge did not result in any cod and nutrients removal and the fluctuation of physicochemical properties ph t and do of synthetic wastewater moreover taking into account the effects of electric field on microbial metabolism thrash and coates 2008 the voltage of 1 0 v was finally determined and constantly supplied to r1 and r3 during the whole operation period moreover the corresponding current densities of r1 and r3 gradually decreased from 2 1 to 0 3 a m2 and 1 3 to 0 2 a m2 respectively which were in accordance with the related researches ibeid et al 2013 liu et al 2015 2 4 analytical methods the influent and effluent concentration of cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n and total phosphorus tp mixed liquor volatile suspended solids ml v ss and sludge volume index svi30 were regularly measured in accordance with standard method apha 2005 do and ph of bulk liquid were detected with do and ph meters hach usa respectively it showed that ph and do of bulk liquid fluctuated between 7 0 and 9 0 as well as 6 0 and 7 0 mg l respectively which were harmless for bacteria franca et al 2018 therefore the two parameters in all three reactors were not intentionally controlled by extra methods the granules were consistently sampled at the end of the aeration phase the micro physicochemical properties of the granules were evaluated through particle size distribution observation of morphology and identification of ash substance particle size distribution was measured by a laser particle size analysis system mastersizer 2000 morphology characteristics of granules collected on day 100 were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem sigma 500 zeiss according to the published method yang et al 2014 x ray diffraction xrd analysis of granules collected on day 100 were performed using a d8 advance diffractometer bruker axs germany with a cobalt tube scattering from 5 to 75 in 2 θ the sludge samples used for xrd analysis were previously rinsed with deionized water lyophilized and incinerated in an oven at 500 cfor 2 h in order to remove organic fractions lin et al 2013 moreover the intracellular reactive oxygen species ros production of granular sludge on day 100 was also measured according to the instructions of ros kit beyotime institute of biotechnology china the ros production was qualitatively analyzed by fluorescence microscopic bx51 olympus as well as quantitatively read at 488 nm for excitation and 525 nm for emission with a microplate reader m200 pro tecan the detailed experimental method was described in supporting information a standard procedure for eps fractionation of sludge was employed in accordance with the previously published research li et al 2014 according to this method the sludge samples were separated into four fractions bulk solution loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps and pellet furthermore the investigation found that the major components of extracted eps in this study were protein pn and polysaccharides ps which accounted for 75 90 of the total eps as reported by tsuneda et al 2003 therefore contents of pn and ps in the extracted eps were quantified by the bradford method with bovine serum albumin bsa as standard bradford 1976 and the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as standard dubois et al 1956 respectively meanwhile the concentrations of cations distributed in the four fractions of sludge samples were respectively measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp aes optima 5300 dv perkin elmer the pellet was digested following the standard method usepa method 3051a before analysis 2 5 high throughput sequencing to analyze the dynamics of bacterial community structures during aerobic granulation bacterial community compositions of the inoculum sludge and the three ags samples on day 100 were investigated using high throughput sequencing technology the bacterial dna was extracted using the e z n a soil dna extraction kit omega usa according to the manufacturer s protocol the quality and quantity of the extracted dna was assessed by a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified using the universal primers 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 the detailed experimental and analytical methods were described in supporting information 3 results 3 1 reactor performance 3 1 1 aerobic granulation process to investigate the aerobic granulation process ml v ss svi 30 and particle size of sludge samples were regularly measured in all three reactors table 1 the acclimated inoculum sludge had a fluffy and irregular structure with svi30 of 78 ml g and average particle diameter of 90 μm during the initiation phase i days 0 20 settling time was progressively reduced for separating fast settling biological aggregates from poorly settling sludge whereas the concentrations of mlss in r1 r2 and r3 sharply decreased from the initial 3 6 g l to 1 9 1 5 and 1 8 g l respectively the svi30 decreased to 41 55 and 42 ml g in r1 r2 and r3 respectively implying the slightly better settling ability of sludge in r1 and r3 moreover as shown in fig 1 particle average diameters in r1 and r3 increased to 200 μm within the 20 days while that in r2 until day 25 the multiplication phase ii days 20 60 continued until the day of a nearly null variation in the size distribution of granules namely the periods of stability which was achieved for all three reactors after 60 days of operation fig 1 specifically particle average diameter of r1 r2 and r3 stabilized at 1 23 1 28 mm 0 78 0 83 mm and 0 64 0 68 mm respectively the multiplication phase was characterized by a significant increase in the concentration of mlss afterwards the biomass wasting strategy was implemented at the end of aeration phase to maintain a stable mlss concentration with the srt of 20 days at the stabilization phase iii days 60 100 comparatively mature granules in r1 exhibited the largest critical size 1 2 1 3 mm the highest mlss concentration 4 5 g l and the lowest svi30 34 ml g indicating the enhanced aerobic granulation it is worthy of noting that although the r1 and r3 had similar granulation rates before the 40 days of operation mlss and particle average diameter in r3 gradually decreased to the smallest values afterwards namely 2 5 g l and 0 68 mm respectively compared to those in r1 and r2 this result indicated that the r3 operated under the exposure of electric field via inert electrodes could rapidly form aerobic granules but failed to maintain long term stability of granules structure 3 1 2 overall performance on cod and nutrients removal compared to conventional activated sludge process ags has a remarkable capability of simultaneous cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal in an individual reactor under the operating mode of sequencing batch wang et al 2017 during the whole operation overall performance on cod and nutrients removal was determined and the results are presented in fig 2 there were slight fluctuations in the cod removal efficiencies especially at initial 40 days operation possibly due to biomass washout fig 2a afterwards average removal efficiency of cod in r1 reached a stable value of 97 12 which was higher than that in r2 95 19 and in r3 95 09 moreover all of the reactors could maintain a similar cod effluent concentration of approximate 30 mg l date not shown indicating that acetate as a sole carbon source could be well degraded by bacteria in the ags system fig 2b illustrates the tp removal profile in all three reactors at the end of experiment tp removal efficiency in r1 dramatically increased to 80 52 which was 2 15 and 1 96 folds than that in r2 37 46 and r3 41 06 respectively in addition with regard to r1 variation tendency of tp removal efficiency was similar to that of granular size growth fig 1a whereas this phenomenon was not clearly observed in another two reactors thus the improved capability of tp removal in r1 may be related to the characteristics of mature aerobic granules which would be further investigated in this study as shown in fig 2c the tn removal efficiencies manifested slight differences among all three reactors specifically tn removal efficiencies of 68 05 51 28 and 51 65 were respectively achieved in r1 r2 and r3 at the end of experiment moreover the nitrogen species nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were also simultaneously monitored to further distinguish the nitrification and denitrification performance the ammonia removal efficiencies of approximate 99 0 were achieved in all three reactors from the initial period until the end of experiment the nitrite transformed from ammonia was detected whose concentration was negligible and lower than 0 5 mg l data not shown the nitrate which is a final product from biological nitrification process was largely accumulated in the system as shown in fig 2d effluent concentration of nitrate in r1 was 19 99 mg l lower than that in r2 29 95 mg l and in r3 29 85 mg l whereas it did not reach an environmental friendly concentration of discharge therefore although r1 exhibited the better tn removal performance than other reactors the capability of denitrification i e no3 n n2 was not sufficient which need to be further optimized in the ongoing research 3 2 characteristics of mature aerobic granules 3 2 1 observation of micro morphology the inoculum sludge was characterized of a dark brown in color and irregular structure the mature aerobic granules in all three reactors exhibited various appearances which were visually recorded by digital camera optical microscopy and sem fig a2 digital and optical microscopic images of aerobic granules taken from r1 clearly revealed a uniformly spherical structure with the core of mineral like precipitates and interconnected channels sem images captured in low magnification revealed that the structure of mature granules in r1 was clear cut rigid and compact while that in other reactors showed a rough irregular and loose surface especially in r3 moreover sem images of high magnification showed that cocci and rod shaped bacteria bacilli shaped bacteria and cross linked cocci shaped bacteria prevailed the surfaces of granules in r1 r2 and r3 respectively these images further revealed the unique structure of granules in r1 which was in agreement with the excellent and stable performance of r1 3 2 2 identification of mineral precipitates aerobic granules in r1 had a compacter structure a lower mlvss mlss and a mineral like precipitates core table 1 and fig a2b compared to that in other reactors thus xrd analysis an efficient tool for distinguishing crystalline minerals from those of amorphous structure was also employed on mature aerobic granules sampled on day 100 interestingly the significant diffractogram was just found in the granule samples from r1 while not from r2 and r3 a recent research found that the precipitation of calcium carbonate was dependent on aerobic granule size liu et al 2016 which may give an explanation that the absence of mineral precipitates in r2 and r3 was also due to their smaller particle diameter than that in r1 to further estimate other possible mineral precipitates in granules their saturation index si were also calculated using the software of visual miniteq ver 3 1 table a1 based on average concentrations of major ions and ph of supernatant liquor from the samples of digested mature granules as illustrated in fig 3 major peaks in the diffractogram were coincident with those of hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh pattern and calcium iron phosphate ca9fe po4 7 pattern by comparison with portable document format standard card 2004 based on software of jade 6 0 table a1 shows that the hydroxyapatite and the vivianite were major minerals in all three reactors especially a higher si obtained in r1 however according to the portable document format standard cards the observed xrd peaks did not match with those of vivianite pattern possibly due to the instability of vivianite when incinerated in an oven at 500 c for 2 h gadgil and kulshreshtha 1994 to the best of our knowledge calcium iron phosphate ca9fe po4 7 one of the iron phosphate compounds containing calcium atom lazoryak et al 2003 was firstly found in this study whereas its formation mechanism is still not clear in the biological wastewater treatment system 3 3 eps fractionation of sludge 3 3 1 variation of pn and ps contents eps secreted by bacteria plays a significant role in the aerobic granulation and the maintenance of structural integrity of ags franca et al 2018 sheng et al 2010 different eps fractions of sludge possess the distinct characteristics of organic matters and cations which determine the function of microbial aggregates shi et al 2017 thus eps fractionation of sludge was employed as described in 2 4 and the results are illustrated in fig 4 and fig 5 at the end of experiment in all three reactors the pn contents of lb eps and tb eps of granular sludge dramatically increased fig 4 specifically in the fraction of lb eps the pn concentration in r1 r2 and r3 was up to 61 56 50 34 and 88 46 mg gvss which was 8 42 6 89 and 12 10 folds than that in the inoculum sludge 7 31 mg gvss respectively in the fraction of tb eps the pn concentration in r1 r2 and r3 was up to 101 92 72 66 and 108 86 mg gvss which was 4 23 3 01 and 4 52 folds than that in the inoculum sludge 24 11 mg gvss respectively however the ps concentration nearly kept constant in all of the eps fractions implying that the variation of pn content was more closely related to the granulation process and structural stability of ags during the whole measurement contents of pn extracted from the lb and tb eps fractions in r2 were consistently lower than that in r1 and r3 indicating the electric field may stimulate bacteria to secrete more eps the results were in somewhat agreement with previous related studies huang et al 2014 liu et al 2011 moreover although r1 and r3 were exposed to the electric field of identical intensity there existed the distinct differences in the variation tendency of pn contents extracted from different eps fractions specifically pn content in r1 was firstly increased in the all eps fractions but then slightly decreased and increased in the fraction of lb eps and tb eps respectively fig 4a by contrast pn content in r3 consistently kept a tendency of increase in all of the eps fractions fig 4c this observation indicated that the pn in r1 was inclined to distribute in the fraction of tb eps which was in accordance with the compact structure of granules 3 3 2 cations distribution of different fractions a number of studies has documented that the sludge granulation was related to the accumulation of multivalent cations especially three metal ions iron calcium and magnesium extensively reported kończak et al 2014 li et al 2014 sajjad and kim 2015 fig 5 illustrates the cations distribution of different fractions of granular sludge on day 100 with regard to r1 although iron ions were continuously released into the mixed liquor from the surface of reactive iron anode a majority of iron ions were accumulated in the fraction of pellet resulting in the effluent concentration of total iron of lower 0 2 mg l data not shown moreover in r2 and r3 iron ions originating from trace element solution of synthetic wastewater also distributed in the fraction of pellet whereas calcium and magnesium ions nearly distributed in all of the fractions which was in agreement with a previous related report kończak et al 2014 interestingly although the influent concentrations of calcium and magnesium from synthetic wastewater were identical for all three rectors mature granules in r1 contained more amount of calcium and magnesium which were 0 51 and 0 39 folds 0 45 and 0 30 folds higher than those in r2 and r3 respectively this results indicated that the presence of iron ions perhaps be beneficial to retain more other divalent cations into the sludge which jointly contributed to the formation of compact granules 3 3 3 microbial community dynamics high throughput sequencing technology was also employed to explore the microbial community structure of inoculum sludge and three ags samples on day 100 from r1 r2 and r3 respectively as shown in table a 2 effective sequences for samples r1 r2 and r3 were divided into 3091 2567 and 3032 operational taxonomic units otus respectively based on the similarity of the domain value 0 97 four other indexes including the ace and the chao for the community richness the shannon and the simpson for the community diversity were also calculated for evaluating the differences of alpha diversity of microbial communities among the three ags samples at the end of experiment the result showed that the richness and diversities of microbial communities enriched in the different reactors were almost identical moreover microbial community structures of the inoculum sludge and the three ags samples were further analyzed at the phyla and genus level fig 6 a shows that all of the sludge samples were dominated by the phyla proteobacteria and bacteroidetes whose relative abundances were dramatically increased during the granulation process especially that in r1 and r3 moreover relative abundance of the phylum planctomycetes decreased to 3 97 r1 8 15 r2 and 1 77 r3 respectively compared to 11 45 of the inoculum sludge on the contrary relative abundance of the phylum verrucomicrobia increased to 4 23 r1 14 38 r2 and 4 21 r3 respectively compared to 2 28 of the inoculum sludge in terms of the phyla level microbial communities of the ags in r1 and r3 were similar possibly due to the influence of electric field of identical intensity the heat map of the genus level illustrates that the prevailing genera in the three ags samples were obviously different from that in the inoculum sludge fig 6b the dominant genera shared by all of the ags samples were gemmobacter zoogloea and flavobacterium which were typically microbes from the aerobic granules in terms of previous researches he et al 2016 liu et al 2014 in addition the genera of azoarcus and thauera were exclusively enriched in r1 accounting for 10 65 and 3 53 respectively it is noteworthy that although a certain amount of iron was electrochemically released into the mixed liquor and accumulated inside granules the acknowledged sequences affiliated to iron reducing bacteria and iron oxidizing bacteria shi et al 2016 were not detected in the ags sample from r1 these results also implied that the enhanced performance of r1 did not simply result from the enrichment of certain functional bacteria but the synergistic cooperation of multiple factors 4 discussion 4 1 synergistic cooperation enhancing aerobic granulation aerobic granules in r1 could not only be rapidly formed within 10 days but also manifested a uniformly spherical structure with the core of mineral precipitates the observed effective and stable performance highlights the feasibility and potential of this novel strategy for the rapid start up and stable operation of ags system in the bio electrochemical system bes if the potential difference between the anode and cathode is set beyond 1 2 v vs normal hydrogen electrode oxidative electrolysis of water and reduction of protons will occur thrash and coates 2008 zhang et al 2016b thereby under the exposure of 1 0 v 1 2 v low intensity dc electric field the major effects were just played on the two parts namely microorganisms and reactive iron anode as shown in fig a3 based on quantitative and quantitative analysis it revealed that ros production of mature granular sludge in r1 and r3 were 1 05 and 1 14 folds than that in r2 respectively suggesting that 1 0 v electric field maybe induced an extent of oxidative stress in the cells moreover at the end of experiment it was observed that reactive iron anode was covered with a certain thickness of biofilms and its diameter decreased by 5 due to the dissolution of iron ions fig a4 thus the possible synergistic mechanism responsible for the enhanced aerobic granulation in r1 was proposed and illustrated in fig 7 fig 7 depicts that this novel strategy possibly profits from the two independent effects including the electrical stimulation of microorganisms and the electrical release of iron ions to identify the role of the former the r3 was operated under the exposure of sole electric field via inert electrodes as shown in figs 1 and 4 the visible granules in r1 and r3 simultaneously appeared and sooner than r2 similarly eps contents especially the pn in r1 and r3 dramatically increased by a nearly identical extent which was obviously higher than that in r2 these results suggested that the electric field may stimulate bacteria to secret a large amount of eps and then accelerate the granulation process this effect of electric field on the eps secretion has been observed and utilized in the sludge granulation processes hoseinzadeh et al 2017 huang et al 2014 some studies have documented that the application of electric field could enhance the permeability of bacterial membrane through inducing physiochemical reactions of membrane lipid composition including the reorientation of aliphatic lipid and the peroxidation of unsaturated lipid velasco alvarez et al 2017 the enhancement of membrane permeability may result in a large amount of eps secretion in addition the presence of low intensity electric field could promote the bacterial transport by hampering the initial microbial adhesion on the solid surface qin et al 2015 taken together it was inferred that the electric field played a positive role in the granulation process which was benefited from the increased bacterial collision probability and the largely improved eps secretion moreover the iron rod was used as the anode from which ferrous ions would be gradually released into the mixed liquor via anodic oxidation it was expected that the electrically released ions would enhance the bacteria gathering whereas the clear granules in r1 and r3 simultaneously appeared within 20 days during the multiplication phase ii days 20 60 the properties of aerobic granules were improved in order as follows r3 r2 r1 in terms of the average diameter and the compactness the results suggested that the electrically released iron ions played a crucial role in the multiplication phase of aerobic granules as shown in fig 7 firstly the ferrous ions were electrochemically released into the mixed liquor from the surface of reactive iron anode and then oxidized to ferric ions at the aeration phase of r1 next the functional groups of eps amide i coo etc acted as electron shuttles to bind the multivalent cations such as iron calcium and magnesium ions jin and guan 2014 finally as shown in fig 5 a majority of iron ions were accumulated in the core of granules due to the high affinity of iron ions with the bacterial surface kończak et al 2014 whereas the calcium and magnesium ions nearly distributed in all of the eps fractions in addition the above mentioned developmental process could be further confirmed by the variation tendencies of pn ps in the different eps fractions as illustrated in fig 4 during the whole experiment in r1 the ratio of pn to ps in the fraction of tb eps was constantly higher to that in the fractions of lb eps suggesting that the iron ions accumulated inside granules could assist more protein predominantly distributing in the core region of granules furthermore the higher pn content and pn ps could effectively reduce the sludge surface charge which favors the microbial aggregation and stability of granules structure zhu et al 2012 konczak et al also found that three dimensional polysaccharide network of aerobic granules could be well developed in presence of divalent cations ca2 or mg2 while more compact granules formed by the addition of all cations ca2 mg2 fe3 to the reactors kończak et al 2014 by contrast in r3 more protein was located in the fraction of lb eps without the assistance of adequate iron ions consequently the excessive eps in the form of lb eps deteriorated sludge settling ability and weakened granules structure of r3 basuvaraj et al 2015 4 2 mineral precipitation improving phosphorus removal aerobic granules cultivated in r1 possessed more excellent cod and nutrients removal capability than that in r2 and r3 especially on the tp removal fig 2 with the maturation of aerobic granules the tp removal efficiency in r1 was gradually improved and then stabilized indicating that the capability of phosphorous removal depended on the characteristics of aerobic granules in other words in r1 the enhanced granules structure may contribute to the improved phosphorous removal it is acknowledged that the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process mainly relies on the ability of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos to take up transform and store excess amount of phosphorus inside the cells however the dominant genera shared by all of the three reactors manifested the slight differences implying that the biological phosphorus removal by paos was not the only phosphorus route in r1 moreover as illustrated in fig 3 hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh and calcium iron phosphate ca9fe po4 7 were identified as the major phosphorous minerals inside granules in r1 their formation could provide the r1 with a potential phosphorus removal route because the phosphate was one major component of hydroxyapatite and calcium iron phosphate afterwards a certain amount of mixed liquor must be termly withdrawn from a reactor in order to thoroughly remove phosphorus the mineral precipitation that contribute to phosphorus removal have been widely observed in the biological wastewater treatment system angela et al 2011 huang et al 2015 in the calcium phosphate mineral family hydroxyapatite has been widely reported and considered as the most stable and insoluble one huang et al 2015 angela et al confirmed that hydroxyapatite was the major biologically induced mineral precipitates which was responsible for 45 of the overall phosphorus removal angela et al 2011 interestingly except for the acknowledged hydroxyapatite calcium iron phosphate ca9fe po4 7 was firstly identified by xrd analysis which could be synthesized from stoichiometric mixtures mixed of fe2o3 ca2p2o7 and caco3 by the solid state method at 1300 k for 150 h ground every 30 h in alumina crucibles lazoryak et al 2003 taking into account the pretreatment method of sludge samples used for xrd analysis 500 c incineration for 2 h it was inferred that the acquirement of calcium iron phosphate was not due to the transition of other mineral precipitates thereby it may be another mineral precipitate that was induced by an undiscovered biological process and it is worthy of in depth research in the future except for the contribution to phosphorus removal the mineral precipitation seemed to be closely related to the enhancement of ags stability firstly due to phosphate release by paos in the anaerobic part of granules concentrations of a higher local phosphate and cations bridged with eps might reach an equilibrium state and encourage mineral precipitation secondly the enriched genera of azoarcus and thauera fig 6b often occur together and are functionally important denitrifying bacteria in activated sludge qiao et al 2015 hence an increased alkalinity preventing dissolution of mineral precipitates high ph increases si of phosphate precipitation in general mineral precipitation provided one more route of phosphorus removal for aerobic granules with enriched cations iron calcium and magnesium whose formation and accumulation in the core of granules profited the long term stability of r1 as well 5 conclusions a novel strategy by applying the 1 0 v dc electric field via reactive iron anode into the ags system was systematically investigated in this study the results demonstrated that this strategy could effectively accelerate the rate of granulation and maintain the integrity of granular structure 1 by comparison aerobic granules in r1 rapidly grew and reached a steady state particle size distribution spreading around the critical size of 1 2 1 3 mm which also exhibited a compact structure with the core of mineral precipitates and interconnected channels 2 xrd analysis and si calculation demonstrated that hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh and calcium iron phosphate ca9fe po4 7 were the major phosphorus minerals inside granules of r1 3 under the manipulation of this strategy the electrical stimulation on eps secretion and the electrically released iron ions synergistically enhanced the granulation process furthermore the formation and accumulation of mineral precipitates inside granules improved the capability of phosphorus removal meanwhile maintained the long term stability of r1 acknowledgements the research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51778172 state key

19143,degradation of propranolol prp by a combined zero valent iron and sulfite system under simulated sunlight irradiation zvi sulfite photo was investigated simulated sunlight irradiation enhanced the degradation of prp by accelerating the decomposition of ferric sulfite complex as a result to producing sulfite radical so3 as bubbles would block the transport of photons in the reaction solution mechanical aeration rather than purging air was suggested to sustain the essential dissolved oxygen the degradation of prp increased with the elevation of initial zvi concentration from 0 05 to 0 5 mm but decreased a little with further increasing zvi concentration to 1 0 mm the degradation of prp raised from 68 5 to 98 7 while sulfite dose increased from 0 1 to 2 0 mm high removal efficiencies were always achieved when the initial prp concentration ranged from 10 to 40 μm as hso3 which can efficiently complex fe ii and transfer fe iii to fe ii is the dominant species of sulfite at ph 4 0 6 0 the highest removal of prp was achieved at ph 4 0 6 0 the presence of bicarbonate and humic acid significantly retarded the removal of prp while chloride ions could promote the removal of prp to some extent so4 ho and so5 were suggested to account for prp removal while so4 was evidenced to be the dominant radicals good reuse of zvi in the system was also achieved as the removal of prp kept higher than 80 after repeatedly used for 5 times possible degradation pathways of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system were accordingly proposed based on lc ms and density functional theory calculation the removal of amitriptyline nitrobenzene imipramine and methylparaben in the zvi sulfite photo system was also evaluated as a reducing agent sulfite is expected to consume the possible formed bromine containing intermediates as a result to inhibiting the formation of bromate which is better than the activated persulfate system graphical abstract image 1 keywords zero valent iron zvi sulfite photo sulfate radical so4 propranolol 1 introduction there has been recent interest in a new advanced oxidation process aop related to the generation of sulfate radical so4 due to the fact that so4 contains quite high redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v which is comparable to hydroxyl radical ho 1 9 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 the so4 based aops have been proposed to treat various environmental problems including degradation of massive organic pollutants such as odorous compounds algal toxins phenols pharmaceuticals and personal care products hu and long 2016 matzek and carter 2016 oh et al

most common method to obtain so4 is the activation of peroxydisulfate pds or peroxymonosulfate pms by transition metals oh et al 2016 photo radiation guan et al 2011 xie et al 2015b heat chen et al 2017b yang et al 2010 base oh et al 2016 ultrasonication hao et al 2014 zou et al 2014 and organics fang et al 2013 however the residual peroxide ions and expensive price of pds and pms might limit the application of so4 based aops in water and wastewater treatment recently some dissolved transition metallic ions such as iron and chromium have been used to activate inexpensive bi sulfite to produce so4 chen et al 2012 jiang et al 2015 2016 yuan et al 2016 due to the low cost and nontoxicity of iron based materials they are always considered to be excellent activators in aops to produce so4 using combined process of iron based materials and sulfite the formation of feo2 s iv system is considered to be an important step chen et al 2012 kotronarou and sigg 1993 zuo and zhan 2005 thus oxygen is always necessary when using sulfite as an initial chemical to produce so4 chen et al 2012 kotronarou and sigg 1993 zuo and zhan 2005 the ferrous bisulfite complex that forms through eq 1 can be further oxidized rapidly by oxygen eq 2 which produces ferric sulfite complex additionally a direct chelating reaction between sulfite and ferric ions also forms the ferric sulfite complex eq 3 the ferric sulfite complex can slowly decompose to ferrous ion and so3 eq 4 then both so5 and so4 are expected to be produced in the presence of oxygen following a sequence of reactions eqs 5 9 1 f e 2 h

the rate determining step of the chain reactions which causes the production of sludge and low efficiency in degradation of pollutants at near neutral condition chen et al 2012 due to the broad light absorption band between 290 and 575 nm of ferric sulfite complex photo irradiation has been evidenced to efficiently accelerate the rate of reaction 4 as a result to reducing the production of sludge and improving the degradation efficiency of pollutants guo et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 however due to the fast reaction rate constant between ferrous ions and so4 the formed so4 would be consumed by excess ferrous ions and retrain the destruction of substrates neta et al 1988 to ease such a problem zero valent iron zvi that can slow release iron ions has been used as an alternative of dissolved iron ions in combined process of sulfite and iron based materials guan et al 2015 xie et al 2017 the experimental results showed that the combined process of zvi and sulfite zvi sulfite achieved good degradation efficiencies of organic pollutants du et al 2018 xie et al 2017 in the zvi sulfite process the slow released iron ions have been suggested to be the dominant activator of sulfite which means that the decomposition of ferric sulfite complex should be also a rate determining step in the process xie et al 2017 consequently it is reasonable to propose that photo irradiation would also improve the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants in zvi sulfite process which still needs to be comprehensively tested the objectives of this study were 1 to make clear whether photo irradiation could enhance the degradation of organic pollutants in zvi sulfite process by selecting propranolol prp which is a widely detected beta blocker in waters as a target pollutant santiago morales et al 2013 2 to determine the possible influencing factors such as sulfite concentration zvi dose prp concentration initial phs dissolved oxygen chloride ions bicarbonate ions and the natural organic matter nom 3 to disclose the degradation pathways of prp and 4 to evaluate the environmental application potential in combination of comprehensively studying the zvi reuse

uniform distribution of particle size at 46 2 μm in average xie et al 2017 additionally fig s1a shows that there are two peaks of xrd analysis at 2θ of 44 94 and 65 16 which are attributed to the 110 and 200 planes of fe0 respectively fang et al 2010 perini et al 2014 compared with the intensity of the two peaks it is achieved that 110 planes of fe0 was the dominant all solutions were prepared in

introduced into the reactor quickly and the reaction solutions were stirred continuously the reaction temperature in this study was maintained by the thermostat and the reaction ph was adjusted by diluted sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid solutions prior to measurement the withdrawn samples at predetermined time intervals were quenched using excess etoh and filtered through a membrane with poresize of 0 22 μm to evaluate the reusability of zvi remained zvi after reaction were separated by a centrifuge tg16 ws xiangyi huhan china at 5000 rpm for 15 min and dried by a vacuum freeze dryer

using an x ray diffractometer x pert pro panalytical b v nl with cu kα radiation in the range of 10 80 ferrous ions dissolved in solution were determined using 1 10 phenanathroline spectrophotometry method to examine the released ferric ions in solution 1 10 phenanathroline spectrophotometry method was also used after reducing all the ferric ions to ferrous ions by hydroxylamine a uv vis spectrophotometer of model u3100pc mapada shanghai china was used to analyze the solution absorbance the total organic carbon toc was measured using a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 jena german a

the formed reactive radicals on an epr spectrometer emx nano germany the formation of possible intermediates during the treatment of prp was identified by an agilent technologies 1100 series lc msd trap xct palo alto ca usa coupled with an electrospray ionization in full scan mode m z 50 350 the eluent was a mixture of 35 acetonitrile and 65 phosphate solution 10 mm ph 2 5 at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and the sample loop volume was set at 20 μl 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of different processes on the degradation of prp fig 1 shows the degradation efficiency of prp by different processes at 25 c with the initial reaction ph being 6 0 after reaction for 60 min less than 8 0 of prp was degraded by either zvi or zvi persulfate zvi ps under simulated sunlight radiation and purging air although zvi has been suggested to activate ps high efficiency can only be achieved at quite high zvi concentration such as excess 1 0 mm which was much higher than that here hussain et al 2012 rayaroth et al 2017 wei et al 2016 higher concentration of zvi in the zvi ps system will release more dissolved iron ions and result in lower reaction ph which are important to activate ps rayaroth et al 2017 wei et al 2016 previous studies have found that efficient degradation of organic pollutants can only achieved when the reaction ph rapidly decreased to lower than 3 5 rayaroth et al 2017 wei et al 2016 in present study the reaction ph kept higher than 4 5 data not shown in figures during the reaction which means that the released iron ions would mainly exist in ironic hydroxide species as a result to inhibiting the activation of ps to make clear it we monitored the variation of dissolved iron ions in the zvi ps system during the reaction as shown in the insert figure of fig s3 the concentration of total dissolved iron ions rapidly increased to the highest value around 0 37 mg l after reaction for 2 min and then gradually decreased to lower than 0 05 mg l with further prolonging the reaction time evidencing that most of the released iron ions existed in the form of ironic hydroxide species additionally the passivation on the surface of zvi would also occur during the activation of ps which can also prevent the activation of ps oh et al 2016 guan et al 2015 in contrast both sulfite and zvi sulfite under the same condition were observed to degrade prp it was found that 50 of prp were removed by sulfite alone with simulated sunlight radiation and purging air which might be due to the formation of so3 that can be further converted to so5 and so4 in the presence of oxygen through the photo radiation of sulfite eq 11 meanwhile a significant improvement was found in the presence of zvi indicating that zvi can activate sulfite compared to the experimental results in absence of sunlight it is achieved that photo radiation can effectively accelerate the degradation of prp in the combined process of zvi sulfite and oxygen the acceleration of prp degradation by photo radiation in zvi sulfite system would be due to the following reasons 1 so3 is produced by the photolysis of sulfite through eq 11 and the formed so3 can be further converted to so5 and so4 in the presence of oxygen 2 photo radiation can effectively accelerate the decomposition of ferric sulfite complex the rate limiting step in the iron activated sulfite system as a result to reducing the production of sludge and improving the degradation of prp zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 yu et al 2016 xu et al 2016 although some previous studies suggest that photo radiation can promote zvi o2 reaction to produce ho following eqs 12 14 lee et al 2008 du et al 2018 such effect should be ignored in the zvi sulfite photo system due to the fact that less than 8 of prp was removed by photo zvi system with purging air fig 1 additionally we monitored the variation of dissolved iron ions in the solution finding that the total iron ions gradually increased to around 0 61 mg l with the solution ph gradually decreasing to about 3 40 in the zvi sulfite photo system fig s3 we also found that the concentration of dissolved ferric ions kept no more than 0 12 mg l and nearly stable within 30 min which is accounted for the reduction of ferric ion by sulfite ions following eqs 3 and 4 when the reaction time was increased from 30 to 60 min most of sulfite ions would be consumed which might be the reason for the rapid increase of dissolved ferric ions similar results were also reported in a previous study using zvi sulfite system to treat dye wastewater xie et al 2017 since o2 is a prerequisite oxidant for so3 to produce so5 and so4 which are expected to degrade organic pollutants eqs 5 7 effect of oxygen on prp degradation in the zvi sulfite photo system was investigated by bubbling air or nitrogen into the reaction solution in the absence of oxygen bubbling nitrogen the degradation was strongly retarded whereas in the presence of oxygen purging air or without purging prp was rapidly degraded as shown in fig s4 the initial concentration of dissolved oxygen do was less than 2 mg l and gradually decreased to zero during the reaction with purging nitrogen which was in accordance with the low degradation efficiency of prp in the same system as oxygen is essential for the sequence reactions to produce the reactive radicals purging air would improve the degradation of pollutants xie et al 2017 which was contrary to the result that the removal efficiency of prp in the system without purging was higher than that in the system with purging air the observed rate constants of prp degradation in the zvi sulfite photo system was also calculated as shown in fig s5 the observed rate constants of prp degradation in the system without purging air was around 3 1 times higher than that with purging air to disclose the possible reason the do under two operational conditions were also monitored fig s4 the concentration of do with purging air kept around 9 mg l during the reaction while the concentration of do gradually decreased in the initial 45 min and reached a lowest value which is still higher than 4 mg l without purging as for the sample without purging it is also found that the concentration of do began to increase with further prolonging the reaction time from 45 min to 120 min when the reaction time reached 80 min the concentration of do recovered to higher than 7 0 mg l the result evidenced that the reoxygenation rate was fast even without purging air due to the high speed of stirring 360 r min which means that the reoxygenation through fast stirring would sustain the necessary oxygen for the generation of reactive radicals then the concentration of do was not the primary limiting factor in the zvi sulfite photo system purging air could produce numerous large bubbles that would hinder the electron transport of active substances in the reaction solution and reduce the utilization of light energy through screening photons which might be the reason for the lower removal rate of prp in the system with purging air nam et al 2002 zhang et al 2003 based on the aforementioned discussion it is proposed that mechanical aeration would be better than direct purging air when using zvi sulfite photo system to degrade organic pollutants to test the efficiency of mechanic aeration the efficiency of rotation rate on the degradation of prp and the variation of do in the reaction solution were also tested fig s6 the observed rate constant of prp removal declined by 0 0465 s 1 as the agitation rate decreased from 360 to 120 r min along with that do in the solution at a reaction time of 60 min reduced from 4 8 to 1 5 mg l the results indicated that elevating mechanic aeration was expected to be a good method to improve the efficiency of zvi sulfite photo system in the degradation of organic pollutants 12 f e 0 o 2 2 h f e ii h 2 o 2 13 f e 0 h 2 o 2 2 h f e ii 2 h 2 o 14 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh ho 3 2 effect of initial ph according to the morphological distribution curves of s iv fe2 and fe3 ph can directly influence the form of iron ions and s iv in the reaction solution as a result to affecting the degradation of organic pollutants when using iron activated sulfite system chen et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 the effect of initial ph on the degradation of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system was also evaluated along with the initial concentrations of zvi and sulfite being 0 1 and 0 5 mm respectively as the reaction ph ranged from 2 0 to 8 0 the degradation of prp after reaction for 30 min followed a sequence of ph 2 0 13 4 ph 8 0 17 7 ph 7 0 35 6 ph 4 0 70 4 ph 6 0 79 7 ph 5 0 86 9 additionally the reaction ph was also monitored during the reaction in the system fig s7 with the oxidation process moving on ph gradually decreased when the initial ph values varied from 3 0 to 8 0 which suggests that valid initial ph of the triple system could expand to neutral and alkaline conditions fig s7 also shows that all the three chosen ph 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 rapidly declined and eventually stabilized at around 3 5 4 0 whereas ph kept stable at extremely acidic condition ph 2 0 at near neutral or week acidic circumstance ph 4 0 6 0 similar oxidation efficiencies were achieved which was similar to a previous study using zvi sulfite system to treat dye wastewater xie et al 2017 it s suggested that hso3 containing the highest ability to complex fe2 and fe3 was the dominant species of s iv in the ph range of 4 0 6 0 xie et al 2017 which could explain the high removal efficiency of prp in the ph range of 4 0 6 0 additionally the reaction ph was found to rapidly decrease to around 3 5 4 0 when the initial ph was 4 0 6 0 suggesting that the oxidation of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system occurred in a similar condition thus the degradation efficiencies of prp were nearly stable when the initial ph values were 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 although fe2 and fe3 could be produced by hydrogen evolution corrosion plenty of s iv exists in the species of so2 aq at ph 2 0 and 3 0 decreasing the concentration of hso3 as a result to reducing the prp removal efficiency chen et al 2012 xie et al 2017 the significant decreased removal efficiency of prp at ph 7 0 and 8 0 would be due to the lower hso3 species hydrolysis of iron ions and the formed passive film on the surface of zvi chen et al 2012 guan et al 2015 xie et al 2017 3 3 effect of initial zvi dose initial sulfite dose or initial prp concentration on prp removal the effects of initial zvi dose initial sulfite dose and initial prp concentration on prp degradation in the zvi sulfite photo system were also evaluated and shown in fig 3 a b and c respectively fig 3a shows the effect of zvi dose ranging from 0 05 to 1 0 mm on oxidation of prp 20 μm with an initial sulfite concentration being 1 0 mm after reaction for 60 min the removal of prp increased from 83 to 96 7 as the zvi dose increased from 0 05 to 0 1 mm and then kept nearly stable less than 3 when the zvi dose was further raised to 1 0 mm however the degradation rate of prp gradually increased when the zvi dose was less than 0 5 mm and slightly slower down when the zvi dose was further elevated to 1 0 mm the concentration of dissolved iron ions released from zvi was expected to increase with increasing initial zvi dose which was proposed to accelerate the formation of reactive radicals and improve the prp removal in the zvi sulfite photo system however suppressive effects were observed when zvi dose was raised up to 1 0 mm which might be due to the competition with prp for the reactive radicals chen et al 2012 fig 3b shows the effect of sulfite dose ranging from 0 1 to 2 0 mm on oxidation of prp 20 μm with an initial zvi concentration being 0 1 mm the removal efficiency of prp grew from 68 5 to 97 5 after reaction for 60 min while the initial sulfite dose increased from 0 1 to 0 5 mm and kept nearly stable when the initial sulfite dose ranged from 0 5 to 2 0 mm the observed reaction rate constants under different initial sulfite dose were also calculated fig s8 the observed reaction rate constants grew from 0 022 s 1 to 0 146 s 1 with the sulfite dose increasing from 0 1 to 2 0 mm which was also reported in a previous publication xie et al 2017 increasing hso3 mainly contribute to the stimulation process for the generation of feso3 and so4 eqs 3 and 7 although the observed rate constant of prp degradation gradually increased in the selected range of sulfite dose the final removal efficiency of prp kept higher than 97 and nearly stable as the initial sulfite dose was from 0 5 to 2 0 mm suggesting that initial sulfite dose of 0 5 mm would be a good choice in the degradation of prp even though high removal efficiency of prp was achieved in the selected range of sulfite we could not reach a removal percent of 100 which would due to the lack of sulfite in the solution xie et al 2017 the increase of do concentration in the solution after reaction for 45 min also supported the low concentration of sulfite in the solution fig s4 to further evaluate the influence of sulfite in the zvi sulfite photo system 20 μm prp was re introduced into the solution after reaction for 60 min at which time there were lots of iron ions in the solution fig s3 as shown in fig s9 only around 12 5 of prp was degraded when the time expanded from 60 to 120 min then after the addition of sulfite 0 5 mm at 120 min the removal of prp fast increased to 80 4 within 15 min the results solidly supported the lack of sulfite in the system at the end of reaction time the result also suggests that people don t need to worry about the residual of sulfite in the zvi sulfite photo system which is expected to be better than the activated ps systems fig 3c shows the effect of initial prp concentration ranging from 10 to 40 μm on oxidation of prp with an initial sulfite and zvi concentrations being 1 0 mm and 0 1 mm respectively for the three selected prp concentrations high removal efficiency of prp 95 could be always achieved after reaction for 60 min evidencing the good efficiency of zvi sulfite photo system on the degradation of prp however the degradation rate of prp gradually decreased as the increase of initial prp concentration which was also reported in some other aops du et al 2018 xie et al 2018 in the zvi sulfite photo system the formation rate of reactive radicals would keep stable when the operational conditions such as zvi dose sulfite dose initial ph photo irradiation are same higher prp concentration could consume more reactive radicals which means the concentration of reactive radicals in the solution would be decreased as a result to lowering the removal of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system 3 4 effect of cl hco3 and ha on prp removal the effects of cl hco3 and ha on the degradation of prp are shown in fig s10 as shown in fig s10a the presence of cl accelerated the removal of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system according to eqs 15 17 the presence of cl competes for the oxidizing species and generates cl and cl2 neta et al 1988 cl and cl2 are selective for different organic pollutants thus can degrade some organic pollutants under high reaction rate constants neta et al 1988 the improvement of prp degradation would be due to the oxidation of prp by chlorine containing reactive radicals moreover the introduction of cl could increase the ionic strength of the reaction solution and facilitated the corrosion of zvi to release fe2 refait et al 1998 which would also contribute to the higher removal rate of prp in the presence of cl such an explanation was evidenced by the much higher concentration of dissolved iron ions in the presence of cl than that in absence of cl figs s3 and s11 15 so 4 cl so 4 2 cl k 1 3 3 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 16 h o c l o h c l k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 17 c l c l c l 2 k 0 65 2 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 both hco3 and natural organic matter are common scavengers for reactive radicals xie et al 2015b the effects of hco3 and natural organic matter ha as reference were shown in figs s10b and s10c respectively it is achieved that hco3 and ha could significantly restrain the removal of prp in zvi sulfite photo system which is consist with the conclusion in other research xie et al 2017 the removal of prp decreased from 95 3 to 15 7 when the dose of hco3 raised from 0 to 2 0 mm while the degradation of prp at 60 min was reduced by 15 9 70 74 and 71 9 when the ha concentrations were 2 mg l 5 mg l 10 mg l and 20 mg l respectively 3 5 identification of the radicals to shed light on the mechanism of zvi sulfite photo system etoh and tba were selected as radical scavengers etoh is an effective quencher for both so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and ho 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 tba is usually considered to be a scavenger for ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 but not for so4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 an alcohol to substrate molar ratio of 1 25 104 1 were used to identify the primary reactive radical contributing to the degradation of prp as shown in fig 4 a the removal of prp for control group etoh group and tba group were 95 3 40 9 and 82 1 respectively based on previous studies focusing on the auto oxidation of s iv system it is suggested that so4 ho and so5 might contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants and so4 was the dominant oxidant chen et al 2012 xie et al 2017 xiong et al 2016 this conclusion was further confirmed by the epr spectrum shown in fig 4b classical zvi sulfite photo system was employed to obtain typical signals of both dmpo ho and dmpo so4 adducts while only intensity of dmpo so4 adduct was gained in tba group but no palpable characteristic peak was observed in etoh group the epr spectrum strongly evidenced the formation of so4 and ho in the zvi sulfite photo system 3 6 prp degradation pathways some previous studies have identified the degradation intermediates of prp by other oxidation processes including ferrate wilde et al 2013 ozonation benner and ternes 2009 photo catalytic oxidation santiago morales et al 2013 and γ radiation song et al 2008 to make clear the degradation pathway of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system the density functional theory dft calculation using fukui function by gaussian 09 software was used to determine the vulnerable sites and lc ms was used to determine the possible intermediates two functional methods were selected to calculate nbo charges distribution of optimized prp molecule table s1 the values of condensed fukui function calculated from nbo charges obtained using m02 functional method are listed in table s2 and checked by nbo charges with b3lyp functional method according to the calculation results the most positive values occurred at c2 c5 c11 c13 and o15 suggesting that they were the most vulnerable sites of prp for radical attack then four possible degradation pathways were proposed fig s12 in pathway a ho and so4 attacking on c13o15 bond resulted in the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring the initial attack of reactive radicals leading to naphthol p1 and 1 isopropylamino propan 2 ol p2 formation which were also detected by chen et al 2011 in pathways b c and d hydroxylation occurs in positions c5 c2 and c11 respectively corresponding to intermediates p2 1 isopropylamino propan 2 ol p4 1 8 naphthalenediol and p6 1 5 naphthalenediol afterwards electrophilic replacement of c5 c2 and c11 on the naphthalene ring by reactive radicals forms products p3 1 isopropylamino 3 3 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol p5 1 isopropylamino 3 6 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol and p7 1 isopropylamino 3 4 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol then hydroxylation and oxidation which are similar to pathway a would cause the cleavage of co bond to yield three dihydroxylated products and 1 isopropylamino propan 2 ol the reaction solution was also sampled and analyzed by lc ms the main detected intermediates in the zvi sulfite photo system are shown in table s3 consistent with the calculation results 8 intermediates were detected including naphthol 1 isopropylamino propan 2 ol 1 isopropylamino 3 3 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol 1 8 naphthalenediol 1 isopropylamino 3 6 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol 1 5 naphthalenediol 1 isopropylamino 3 4 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol and 1 4 naphthalenedio it should be noted that some intermediates containing higher m z 292 2 than prp were also detected which should be due to the replacement of two active sites on the naphthalene ring of propranolol by ho but the system failed to detect 1 3 4 trihydroxynaphthalene mw 176 which is the cleavage product of co bond this might be related to the unstable nature of the material and its tendency to be continuously oxidized additionally the variation of toc after reaction for 60 min was measured finding that the toc concentration decreased by around 9 14 fig s13 the result suggests that a few of organic intermediates can be mineralized in the zvi sulfite photo system which means that production of co2 excited when prp was degraded in the zvi sulfite photo system based on the aforementioned discussion on the calculation and lc ms analysis the possible degradation pathways of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system were summed up and illustrated in fig 5 3 7 environmental implications 3 7 1 reuse of zvi in the zvi sulfite photo system the stability of zvi is always an important property for the application of zvi based treatment processes as shown in fig 6 the stability of zvi was also evaluated by reaction for 5 times good efficiency of prp degradation could be achieved during the 5 cycles which was also observed in a previous publication focusing on the treatment of dye wastewater using zvi sulfite system xie et al 2017 the result illustrates that insignificant passivation on the zvi surface occurred which was supported by the similar xrd spectrum of the pristine and reclaimed zvi fig s1 the insignificant passivation on the zvi surface can be ascribed to the strong reducing ability of sulfite chen et al 2012 although high removal efficiency of prp was achieved in the zvi sulfite photo system using reclaimed zvi small reduction of prp degradation was also observed fig 8 the lower removal efficiency of prp when zvi were repeatedly used to activate sulfite might be due to the less release of iron ions from the reclaimed zvi table s4 3 7 2 the control of bro3 formation comparison to ps bro3 a harmful byproduct that is stable and invulnerable in aqueous solution has been proven to be produced in traditional so4 based aops through the activation of ps fang and shang 2012 lutze et al 2014 the overall formation pathway could be illustrated by fig s14 the reaction between br and so4 forms br which could be further converted to br2 and hobr obr fang and shang 2012 then the formed hobr obr can be oxidized to bro3 by so4 fang and shang 2012 lutze et al 2014 thus to evaluate the formation of bro3 in the presence of br when using so4 based aops to degrade organic pollutants is meaningful and important the degradation of prp and the formation of bro3 in the fe2 ps photo system and zvi sulfite photo system in the presence of br 20 μm were studied as shown in fig 7 about 95 4 of prp were degraded in the zvi sulfite photo system with none of bromate being detected as for the fe2 ps photo system the prp was only removed by 64 2 with producing 16 2 μg l bro3 under similar experimental conditions as shown in fig s14 the bromine containing oxidants including br br2 and hobr obr are necessary intermediates for the formation of bro3 which means that the consumption of the three bromine containing oxidants would inhibit the formation of bro3 it is known that sulfite is a strong reductant and can quickly react with the formed bromine containing oxidants neta et al 1988 troy and margerum 1991 for instance the reaction rate constants of sulfite reacting with br2 and hobr ob are at the levels of 108 m 1 s 1 and 109 m 1 s 1 respectively neta et al 1988 troy and margerum 1991 thus none of bro3 was detected in the zvi sulfite photo system it is also achieved that the proposed zvi sulfite photo system would be a good choice to degrade organic pollutants rather than traditional activated ps system concerning the control of bro3 in the presence of br 3 7 3 removal efficiencies of other organic pollutants in the zvi sulfite photo system to further test the application potential of the zvi sulfite photo system in removing organic contaminants four widely detected organic pollutants including am nb imi and mep in natural waters were selected as target substrates as presented in fig 8 the degradation efficiencies of am nb imi and mep are 92 3 40 3 96 9 and 31 0 respectively it is concluded that the zvi sulfite photo system is selective to degrade organic pollutants which is in consist with the aforementioned conclusion that so4 and so5 played vital roles in the removal of organic pollutants the degradation of nb also verified the formation of ho in the zvi sulfite photo system which was in agreement with the results achieved in section 3 5 fig 4 additionally the good performance of zvi sulfite photo system on the removal of am and imi suggests that it would be a useful method to treat typical β blockers 4 conclusions high efficiency of the zvi activated sulfite system in degradation of organic pollutants under simulated sunlight radiation was achieved in this study oxygen is necessary for the zvi sulfite photo system and mechanical aeration rather than purging air was suggested to offer dissolved oxygen overall the increase of either initial zvi concentration 0 05 0 5 mm or initial sulfite concentration 0 05 2 0 mm accelerated the degradation of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system high removal efficiency of prp was always achieved with varying the initial prp concentration from 10 to 40 μm while higher initial prp concentration lowered the degradation rate of prp the optimal ph range of 4 0 6 0 was achieved due to the fact that hso3 which can efficiently complex fe ii and transfer fe iii to fe ii is the dominant sulfite species at ph 4 0 6 0 both bicarbonate and ha inhibited the degradation of prp while chloride ions promoted the removal of prp in the system so4 ho and so5 resulted in the oxidation of prp and so4 was the dominant reactive species in the zvi sulfite photo system possible degradation pathways of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system were accordingly proposed based on lc ms and dft calculation based on the dft calculation results four organic carbon sites and an oxygen site are vulnerable and hydroxylation reaction was proposed to be the initial reaction in the degradation of prp additionally high removal efficiency of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system after repeatedly used the zvi for 5 times evidenced the good stability of zvi none of bromate was detected during the degradation of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system when bromide was introduced into the system which might be due to the conversion of bromine containing oxidants back to bromide by sulfite the removal of am nb imi and mep in the zvi sulfite photo system was also evaluated better performance of am and imi than nb and mep suggests that the proposed zvi

19143,degradation of propranolol prp by a combined zero valent iron and sulfite system under simulated sunlight irradiation zvi sulfite photo was investigated simulated sunlight irradiation enhanced the degradation of prp by accelerating the decomposition of ferric sulfite complex as a result to producing sulfite radical so3 as bubbles would block the transport of photons in the reaction solution mechanical aeration rather than purging air was suggested to sustain the essential dissolved oxygen the degradation of prp increased with the elevation of initial zvi concentration from 0 05 to 0 5 mm but decreased a little with further increasing zvi concentration to 1 0 mm the degradation of prp raised from 68 5 to 98 7 while sulfite dose increased from 0 1 to 2 0 mm high removal efficiencies were always achieved when the initial prp concentration ranged from 10 to 40 μm as hso3 which can efficiently complex fe ii and transfer fe iii to fe ii is the dominant species of sulfite at ph 4 0 6 0 the highest removal of prp was achieved at ph 4 0 6 0 the presence of bicarbonate and humic acid significantly retarded the removal of prp while chloride ions could promote the removal of prp to some extent so4 ho and so5 were suggested to account for prp removal while so4 was evidenced to be the dominant radicals good reuse of zvi in the system was also achieved as the removal of prp kept higher than 80 after repeatedly used for 5 times possible degradation pathways of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system were accordingly proposed based on lc ms and density functional theory calculation the removal of amitriptyline nitrobenzene imipramine and methylparaben in the zvi sulfite photo system was also evaluated as a reducing agent sulfite is expected to consume the possible formed bromine containing intermediates as a result to inhibiting the formation of bromate which is better than the activated persulfate system graphical abstract image 1 keywords zero valent iron zvi sulfite photo sulfate radical so4 propranolol 1 introduction there has been recent interest in a new advanced oxidation process aop related to the generation of sulfate radical so4 due to the fact that so4 contains quite high redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v which is comparable to hydroxyl radical ho 1 9 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 the so4 based aops have been proposed to treat various environmental problems including degradation of massive organic pollutants such as odorous compounds algal toxins phenols pharmaceuticals and personal care products hu and long 2016 matzek and carter 2016 oh et al 2016 inactivation of bacteria and algae anipsitakis et al 2008 wang et al 2016 improvement of coagulation chen et al 2017a and control of disinfection byproducts chu et al 2015 xie et al 2015a the most common method to obtain so4 is the activation of peroxydisulfate pds or peroxymonosulfate pms by transition metals oh et al 2016 photo radiation guan et al 2011 xie et al 2015b heat chen et al 2017b yang et al 2010 base oh et al 2016 ultrasonication hao et al 2014 zou et al 2014 and organics fang et al 2013 however the residual peroxide ions and expensive price of pds and pms might limit the application of so4 based aops in water and wastewater treatment recently some dissolved transition metallic ions such as iron and chromium have been used to activate inexpensive bi sulfite to produce so4 chen et al 2012 jiang et al 2015 2016 yuan et al 2016 due to the low cost and nontoxicity of iron based materials they are always considered to be excellent activators in aops to produce so4 using combined process of iron based materials and sulfite the formation of feo2 s iv system is considered to be an important step chen et al 2012 kotronarou and sigg 1993 zuo and zhan 2005 thus oxygen is always necessary when using sulfite as an initial chemical to produce so4 chen et al 2012 kotronarou and sigg 1993 zuo and zhan 2005 the ferrous bisulfite complex that forms through eq 1 can be further oxidized rapidly by oxygen eq 2 which produces ferric sulfite complex additionally a direct chelating reaction between sulfite and ferric ions also forms the ferric sulfite complex eq 3 the ferric sulfite complex can slowly decompose to ferrous ion and so3 eq 4 then both so5 and so4 are expected to be produced in the presence of oxygen following a sequence of reactions eqs 5 9 1 f e 2 h

the rate determining step of the chain reactions which causes the production of sludge and low efficiency in degradation of pollutants at near neutral condition chen et al 2012 due to the broad light absorption band between 290 and 575 nm of ferric sulfite complex photo irradiation has been evidenced to efficiently accelerate the rate of reaction 4 as a result to reducing the production of sludge and improving the degradation efficiency of pollutants guo et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 however due to the fast reaction rate constant between ferrous ions and so4 the formed so4 would be consumed by excess ferrous ions and retrain the destruction of substrates neta et al 1988 to ease such a problem zero valent iron zvi that can slow release iron ions has been used as an alternative of dissolved iron ions in combined process of sulfite and iron based materials guan et al 2015 xie et al 2017 the experimental results showed that the combined process of zvi and sulfite zvi sulfite achieved good degradation efficiencies of organic pollutants du et al 2018 xie et al 2017 in the zvi sulfite process the slow released iron ions have been suggested to be the dominant activator of sulfite which means that the decomposition of ferric sulfite complex should be also a rate determining step in the process xie et al 2017 consequently it is reasonable to propose that photo irradiation would also improve the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants in zvi sulfite process which still needs to be comprehensively tested the objectives of this study were 1 to make clear whether photo irradiation could enhance the degradation of organic pollutants in zvi sulfite process by selecting propranolol prp which is a widely detected beta blocker in waters as a target pollutant santiago morales et al 2013 2 to determine the possible influencing factors such as sulfite concentration zvi dose prp concentration initial phs dissolved oxygen chloride ions bicarbonate ions and the natural organic matter nom 3 to disclose the degradation pathways of prp and 4 to evaluate the environmental application potential in combination of comprehensively studying the zvi reuse

using an x ray diffractometer x pert pro panalytical b v nl with cu kα radiation in the range of 10 80 ferrous ions dissolved in solution were determined using 1 10 phenanathroline spectrophotometry method to examine the released ferric ions in solution 1 10 phenanathroline spectrophotometry method was also used after reducing all the ferric ions to ferrous ions by hydroxylamine a uv vis

dissolved oxygen do meter do200 ysi usa and a ph meter starter 3100 ohaus usa were used to monitor the do concentration and solution ph respectively dmpo was used as spin trapping agent to evaluate the formed reactive radicals on an epr spectrometer emx nano germany the formation of possible intermediates during the treatment of prp was identified by an agilent technologies 1100 series lc msd trap xct palo alto ca usa coupled with an electrospray ionization in full scan mode m z 50 350 the eluent was a mixture of 35 acetonitrile and 65 phosphate solution 10 mm ph 2 5 at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and the sample loop volume was set at 20 μl 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of different processes on the degradation of prp fig 1 shows the degradation efficiency of prp by different processes at 25 c with the initial reaction ph being 6 0 after reaction for 60 min less than 8 0 of prp was degraded by either zvi or zvi persulfate zvi ps under simulated sunlight radiation and purging air although zvi has been suggested to activate ps high efficiency can only be achieved at quite high zvi concentration such as excess 1 0 mm which was much higher than that here hussain et al 2012 rayaroth et al 2017 wei et al 2016 higher concentration of zvi in the zvi ps system will release more dissolved iron ions and result in lower reaction ph which are important to activate ps rayaroth et al 2017 wei et al 2016 previous studies have found that efficient degradation of organic pollutants can only achieved when the reaction ph rapidly decreased to lower than 3 5 rayaroth et al 2017 wei et al 2016 in present study the reaction ph kept higher than 4 5 data not shown in figures during the reaction which means that the released iron ions would mainly exist in ironic hydroxide species as a result to inhibiting the activation of ps to make clear it we monitored the variation of dissolved iron ions in the zvi ps system during the reaction as shown in the insert figure of fig s3 the concentration of total dissolved iron ions rapidly increased to the highest value around 0 37 mg l after reaction for 2 min and then gradually decreased to lower than 0 05 mg l with further prolonging the reaction time evidencing that most of the released iron ions existed in the form of ironic hydroxide species additionally the passivation on the surface of zvi would also occur during the activation of ps which can also prevent the activation of ps oh et al 2016 guan et al 2015 in contrast both sulfite and zvi sulfite under the same condition were observed to degrade prp it was found that 50 of prp were removed by sulfite alone with simulated sunlight radiation and purging air which might be due to the formation of so3 that can be further converted to so5 and so4 in the presence of oxygen through the photo radiation of sulfite eq 11 meanwhile a significant improvement was found in the presence of zvi indicating that zvi can activate sulfite compared to the experimental results in absence of sunlight it is achieved that photo radiation can effectively accelerate the degradation of prp in the combined process of zvi sulfite and oxygen the acceleration of prp degradation by photo radiation in zvi sulfite system would be due to the following reasons 1 so3 is produced by the photolysis of sulfite through eq 11 and the formed so3 can be further converted to so5 and so4 in the presence of oxygen 2 photo radiation can effectively accelerate the decomposition of ferric sulfite complex the rate limiting step in the iron activated sulfite system as a result to reducing the production of sludge and improving the degradation of prp zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 yu et al 2016 xu et al 2016 although some previous studies suggest that photo radiation can promote zvi o2 reaction to produce ho following eqs 12 14 lee et al 2008 du et al 2018 such effect should be ignored in the zvi sulfite photo system due to the fact that less than 8 of prp was removed by photo zvi system with purging air fig 1 additionally we monitored the variation of dissolved iron ions in the solution finding that the total iron ions gradually increased to around 0 61 mg l with the solution ph gradually decreasing to about 3 40 in the zvi sulfite photo system fig s3 we also found that the concentration of dissolved ferric ions kept no more than 0 12 mg l and nearly stable within 30 min which is accounted for the reduction of ferric ion by sulfite ions following eqs 3 and 4 when the reaction time was increased from 30 to 60 min most of sulfite ions would be consumed which might be the reason for the rapid increase of dissolved ferric ions similar results were also reported in a previous study using zvi sulfite system to treat dye wastewater xie et al 2017 since o2 is a prerequisite oxidant for so3 to produce so5 and so4 which are expected to degrade organic pollutants eqs 5 7 effect of oxygen on prp degradation in the zvi sulfite photo system was investigated by bubbling air or nitrogen into the reaction solution in the absence of oxygen bubbling nitrogen the degradation was strongly retarded whereas in the presence of oxygen purging air or without purging prp was rapidly degraded as shown in fig s4 the initial concentration of dissolved oxygen do was less than 2 mg l and gradually decreased to zero during the reaction with purging nitrogen which was in accordance with the low degradation efficiency of prp in the same system as oxygen is essential for the sequence reactions to produce the reactive radicals purging air would improve the degradation of pollutants xie et al 2017 which was contrary to the result that the removal efficiency of prp in the system without purging was higher than that in the system with purging air the observed rate constants of prp degradation in the zvi sulfite photo system was also calculated as shown in fig s5 the observed rate constants of prp degradation in the system without purging air was around 3 1 times higher than that with purging air to disclose the possible reason the do under two operational conditions were also monitored fig s4 the concentration of do with purging air kept around 9 mg l during the reaction while the concentration of do gradually decreased in the initial 45 min and reached a lowest value which is still higher than 4 mg l without purging as for the sample without purging it is also found that the concentration of do began to increase with further prolonging the reaction time from 45 min to 120 min when the reaction time reached 80 min the concentration of do recovered to higher than 7 0 mg l the result evidenced that the reoxygenation rate was fast even without purging air due to the high speed of stirring 360 r min which means that the reoxygenation through fast stirring would sustain the necessary oxygen for the generation of reactive radicals then the concentration of do was not the primary limiting factor in the zvi sulfite photo system purging air could produce numerous large bubbles that would hinder the electron transport of active substances in the reaction solution and reduce the utilization of light energy through screening photons which might be the reason for the lower removal rate of prp in the system with purging air nam et al 2002 zhang et al 2003 based on the aforementioned discussion it is proposed that mechanical aeration would be better than direct purging air when using zvi sulfite photo system to degrade organic pollutants to test the efficiency of mechanic aeration the efficiency of rotation rate on the degradation of prp and the variation of do in the reaction solution were also tested fig s6 the observed rate constant of prp removal declined by 0 0465 s 1 as the agitation rate decreased from 360 to 120 r min along with that do in the solution at a reaction time of 60 min reduced from 4 8 to 1 5 mg l the results indicated that elevating mechanic aeration was expected to be a good method to improve the efficiency of zvi sulfite photo system in the degradation of organic pollutants 12 f e 0 o 2 2 h f e ii h 2 o 2 13 f e 0 h 2 o 2 2 h f e ii 2 h 2 o 14 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii oh ho 3 2 effect of initial ph according to the morphological distribution curves of s iv fe2 and fe3 ph can directly influence the form of iron ions and s iv in the reaction solution as a result to affecting the degradation of organic pollutants when using iron activated sulfite system chen et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 the effect of initial ph on the degradation of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system was also evaluated along with the initial concentrations of zvi and sulfite being 0 1 and 0 5 mm respectively as the reaction ph ranged from 2 0 to 8 0 the degradation of prp after reaction for 30 min followed a sequence of ph 2 0 13 4 ph 8 0 17 7 ph 7 0 35 6 ph 4 0 70 4 ph 6 0 79 7 ph 5 0 86 9 additionally the reaction ph was also monitored during the reaction in the system fig s7 with the oxidation process moving on ph gradually decreased when the initial ph values varied from 3 0 to 8 0 which suggests that valid initial ph of the triple system could expand to neutral and alkaline conditions fig s7 also shows that all the three chosen ph 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 rapidly declined and eventually stabilized at around 3 5 4 0 whereas ph kept stable at extremely acidic condition ph 2 0 at near neutral or week acidic circumstance ph 4 0 6 0 similar oxidation efficiencies were achieved which was similar to a previous study using zvi sulfite system to treat dye wastewater xie et al 2017 it s suggested that hso3 containing the highest ability to complex fe2 and fe3 was the dominant species of s iv in the ph range of 4 0 6 0 xie et al 2017 which could explain the high removal efficiency of prp in the ph range of 4 0 6 0 additionally the reaction ph was found to rapidly decrease to around 3 5 4 0 when the initial ph was 4 0 6 0 suggesting that the oxidation of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system occurred in a similar condition thus the degradation efficiencies of prp were nearly stable when the initial ph values were 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 although fe2 and fe3 could be produced by hydrogen evolution corrosion plenty of s iv exists in the species of so2 aq at ph 2 0 and 3 0 decreasing the concentration of hso3 as a result to reducing the prp removal efficiency chen et al 2012 xie et al 2017 the significant decreased removal efficiency of prp at ph 7 0 and 8 0 would be due to the lower hso3 species hydrolysis of iron ions and the formed passive film on the surface of zvi chen et al 2012 guan et al 2015 xie et al 2017 3 3 effect of initial zvi dose initial sulfite dose or initial prp concentration on prp removal the effects of initial zvi dose initial sulfite dose and initial prp concentration on prp degradation in the zvi sulfite photo system were also evaluated and shown in fig 3 a b and c respectively fig 3a shows the effect of zvi dose ranging from 0 05 to 1 0 mm on oxidation of prp 20 μm with an initial sulfite concentration being 1 0 mm after reaction for 60 min the removal of prp increased from 83 to 96 7 as the zvi dose increased from 0 05 to 0 1 mm and then kept nearly stable less than 3 when the zvi dose was further raised to 1 0 mm however the degradation rate of prp gradually increased when the zvi dose was less than 0 5 mm and slightly slower down when the zvi dose was further elevated to 1 0 mm the concentration of dissolved iron ions released from zvi was expected to increase with increasing initial zvi dose which was proposed to accelerate the formation of reactive radicals and improve the prp removal in the zvi sulfite photo system however suppressive effects were observed when zvi dose was raised up to 1 0 mm which might be due to the competition with prp for the reactive radicals chen et al 2012 fig 3b shows the effect of sulfite dose ranging from 0 1 to 2 0 mm on oxidation of prp 20 μm with an initial zvi concentration being 0 1 mm the removal efficiency of prp grew from 68 5 to 97 5 after reaction for 60 min while the initial sulfite dose increased from 0 1 to 0 5 mm and kept nearly stable when the initial sulfite dose ranged from 0 5 to 2 0 mm the observed reaction rate constants under different initial sulfite dose were also calculated fig s8 the observed reaction rate constants grew from 0 022 s 1 to 0 146 s 1 with the sulfite dose increasing from 0 1 to 2 0 mm which was also reported in a previous publication xie et al 2017 increasing hso3 mainly contribute to the stimulation process for the generation of feso3 and so4 eqs 3 and 7 although the observed rate constant of prp degradation gradually increased in the selected range of sulfite dose the final removal efficiency of prp kept higher than 97 and nearly stable as the initial sulfite dose was from 0 5 to 2 0 mm suggesting that initial sulfite dose of 0 5 mm would be a good choice in the degradation of prp even though high removal efficiency of prp was achieved in the selected range of sulfite we could not reach a removal percent of 100 which would due to the lack of sulfite in the solution xie et al 2017 the increase of do concentration in the solution after reaction for 45 min also supported the low concentration of sulfite in the solution fig s4 to further evaluate the influence of sulfite in the zvi sulfite photo system 20 μm prp was re introduced into the solution after reaction for 60 min at which time there were lots of iron ions in the solution fig s3 as shown in fig s9 only around 12 5 of prp was degraded when the time expanded from 60 to 120 min then after the addition of sulfite 0 5 mm at 120 min the removal of prp fast increased to 80 4 within 15 min the results solidly supported the lack of sulfite in the system at the end of reaction time the result also suggests that people don t need to worry about the residual of sulfite in the zvi sulfite photo system which is expected to be better than the activated ps systems fig 3c shows the effect of initial prp concentration ranging from 10 to 40 μm on oxidation of prp with an initial sulfite and zvi concentrations being 1 0 mm and 0 1 mm respectively for the three selected prp concentrations high removal efficiency of prp 95 could be always achieved after reaction for 60 min evidencing the good efficiency of zvi sulfite photo system on the degradation of prp however the degradation rate of prp gradually decreased as the increase of initial prp concentration which was also reported in some other aops du et al 2018 xie et al 2018 in the zvi sulfite photo system the formation rate of reactive radicals would keep stable when the operational conditions such as zvi dose sulfite dose initial ph photo irradiation are same higher prp concentration could consume more reactive radicals which means the concentration of reactive radicals in the solution would be decreased as a result to lowering the removal of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system 3 4 effect of cl hco3 and ha on prp removal the effects of cl hco3 and ha on the degradation of prp are shown in fig s10 as shown in fig s10a the presence of cl accelerated the removal of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system according to eqs 15 17 the presence of cl competes for the oxidizing species and generates cl and cl2 neta et al 1988 cl and cl2 are selective for different organic pollutants thus can degrade some organic pollutants under high reaction rate constants neta et al 1988 the improvement of prp degradation would be due to the oxidation of prp by chlorine containing reactive radicals moreover the introduction of cl could increase the ionic strength of the reaction solution and facilitated the corrosion of zvi to release fe2 refait et al 1998 which would also contribute to the higher removal rate of prp in the presence of cl such an explanation was evidenced by the much higher concentration of dissolved iron ions in the presence of cl than that in absence of cl figs s3 and s11 15 so 4 cl so 4 2 cl k 1 3 3 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 16 h o c l o h c l k 4 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 17 c l c l c l 2 k 0 65 2 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 both hco3 and natural organic matter are common scavengers for reactive radicals xie et al 2015b the effects of hco3 and natural organic matter ha as reference were shown in figs s10b and s10c respectively it is achieved that hco3 and ha could significantly restrain the removal of prp in zvi sulfite photo system which is consist with the conclusion in other research xie et al 2017 the removal of prp decreased from 95 3 to 15 7 when the dose of hco3 raised from 0 to 2 0 mm while the degradation of prp at 60 min was reduced by 15 9 70 74 and 71 9 when the ha concentrations were 2 mg l 5 mg l 10 mg l and 20 mg l respectively 3 5 identification of the radicals to shed light on the mechanism of zvi sulfite photo system etoh and tba were selected as radical scavengers etoh is an effective quencher for both so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 and ho 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 tba is usually considered to be a scavenger for ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 but not for so4 4 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 an alcohol to substrate molar ratio of 1 25 104 1 were used to identify the primary reactive radical contributing to the degradation of prp as shown in fig 4 a the removal of prp for control group etoh group and tba group were 95 3 40 9 and 82 1 respectively based on previous studies focusing on the auto oxidation of s iv system it is suggested that so4 ho and so5 might contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants and so4 was the dominant oxidant chen et al 2012 xie et al 2017 xiong et al 2016 this conclusion was further confirmed by the epr spectrum shown in fig 4b classical zvi sulfite photo system was employed to obtain typical signals of both dmpo ho and dmpo so4 adducts while only intensity of dmpo so4 adduct was gained in tba group but no palpable characteristic peak was observed in etoh group the epr spectrum strongly evidenced the formation of so4 and ho in the zvi sulfite photo system 3 6 prp degradation pathways some previous studies have identified the degradation intermediates of prp by other oxidation processes including ferrate wilde et al 2013 ozonation benner and ternes 2009 photo catalytic oxidation santiago morales et al 2013 and γ radiation song et al 2008 to make clear the degradation pathway of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system the density functional theory dft calculation using fukui function by gaussian 09 software was used to determine the vulnerable sites and lc ms was used to determine the possible intermediates two functional methods were selected to calculate nbo charges distribution of optimized prp molecule table s1 the values of condensed fukui function calculated from nbo charges obtained using m02 functional method are listed in table s2 and checked by nbo charges with b3lyp functional method according to the calculation results the most positive values occurred at c2 c5 c11 c13 and o15 suggesting that they were the most vulnerable sites of prp for radical attack then four possible degradation pathways were proposed fig s12 in pathway a ho and so4 attacking on c13o15 bond resulted in the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring the initial attack of reactive radicals leading to naphthol p1 and 1 isopropylamino propan 2 ol p2 formation which were also detected by chen et al 2011 in pathways b c and d hydroxylation occurs in positions c5 c2 and c11 respectively corresponding to intermediates p2 1 isopropylamino propan 2 ol p4 1 8 naphthalenediol and p6 1 5 naphthalenediol afterwards electrophilic replacement of c5 c2 and c11 on the naphthalene ring by reactive radicals forms products p3 1 isopropylamino 3 3 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol p5 1 isopropylamino 3 6 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol and p7 1 isopropylamino 3 4 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol then hydroxylation and oxidation which are similar to pathway a would cause the cleavage of co bond to yield three dihydroxylated products and 1 isopropylamino propan 2 ol the reaction solution was also sampled and analyzed by lc ms the main detected intermediates in the zvi sulfite photo system are shown in table s3 consistent with the calculation results 8 intermediates were detected including naphthol 1 isopropylamino propan 2 ol 1 isopropylamino 3 3 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol 1 8 naphthalenediol 1 isopropylamino 3 6 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol 1 5 naphthalenediol 1 isopropylamino 3 4 naphthol 1 yloxy propan 2 ol and 1 4 naphthalenedio it should be noted that some intermediates containing higher m z 292 2 than prp were also detected which should be due to the replacement of two active sites on the naphthalene ring of propranolol by ho but the system failed to detect 1 3 4 trihydroxynaphthalene mw 176 which is the cleavage product of co bond this might be related to the unstable nature of the material and its tendency to be continuously oxidized additionally the variation of toc after reaction for 60 min was measured finding that the toc concentration decreased by around 9 14 fig s13 the result suggests that a few of organic intermediates can be mineralized in the zvi sulfite photo system which means that production of co2 excited when prp was degraded in the zvi sulfite photo system based on the aforementioned discussion on the calculation and lc ms analysis the possible degradation pathways of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system were summed up and illustrated in fig 5 3 7 environmental implications 3 7 1 reuse of zvi in the zvi sulfite photo system the stability of zvi is always an important property for the application of zvi based treatment processes as shown in fig 6 the stability of zvi was also evaluated by reaction for 5 times good efficiency of prp degradation could be achieved during the 5 cycles which was also observed in a previous publication focusing on the treatment of dye wastewater using zvi sulfite system xie et al 2017 the result illustrates that insignificant passivation on the zvi surface occurred which was supported by the similar xrd spectrum of the pristine and reclaimed zvi fig s1 the insignificant passivation on the zvi surface can be ascribed to the strong reducing ability of sulfite chen et al 2012 although high removal efficiency of prp was achieved in the zvi sulfite photo system using reclaimed zvi small reduction of prp degradation was also observed fig 8 the lower removal efficiency of prp when zvi were repeatedly used to activate sulfite might be due to the less release of iron ions from the reclaimed zvi table s4 3 7 2 the control of bro3 formation comparison to ps bro3 a harmful byproduct that is stable and invulnerable in aqueous solution has been proven to be produced in traditional so4 based aops through the activation of ps fang and shang 2012 lutze et al 2014 the overall formation pathway could be illustrated by fig s14 the reaction between br and so4 forms br which could be further converted to br2 and hobr obr fang and shang 2012 then the formed hobr obr can be oxidized to bro3 by so4 fang and shang 2012 lutze et al 2014 thus to evaluate the formation of bro3 in the presence of br when using so4 based aops to degrade organic pollutants is meaningful and important the degradation of prp and the formation of bro3 in the fe2 ps photo system and zvi sulfite photo system in the presence of br 20 μm were studied as shown in fig 7 about 95 4 of prp were degraded in the zvi sulfite photo system with none of bromate being detected as for the fe2 ps photo system the prp was only removed by 64 2 with producing 16 2 μg l bro3 under similar experimental conditions as shown in fig s14 the bromine containing oxidants including br br2 and hobr obr are necessary intermediates for the formation of bro3 which means that the consumption of the three bromine containing oxidants would inhibit the formation of bro3 it is known that sulfite is a strong reductant and can quickly react with the formed bromine containing oxidants neta et al 1988 troy and margerum 1991 for instance the reaction rate constants of sulfite reacting with br2 and hobr ob are at the levels of 108 m 1 s 1 and 109 m 1 s 1 respectively neta et al 1988 troy and margerum 1991 thus none of bro3 was detected in the zvi sulfite photo system it is also achieved that the proposed zvi sulfite photo system would be a good choice to degrade organic pollutants rather than traditional activated ps system concerning the control of bro3 in the presence of br 3 7 3 removal efficiencies of other organic pollutants in the zvi sulfite photo system to further test the application potential of the zvi sulfite photo system in removing organic contaminants four widely detected organic pollutants including am nb imi and mep in natural waters were selected as target substrates as presented in fig 8 the degradation efficiencies of am nb imi and mep are 92 3 40 3 96 9 and 31 0 respectively it is concluded that the zvi sulfite photo system is selective to degrade organic pollutants which is in consist with the aforementioned conclusion that so4 and so5 played vital roles in the removal of organic pollutants the degradation of nb also verified the formation of ho in the zvi sulfite photo system which was in agreement with the results achieved in section 3 5 fig 4 additionally the good performance of zvi sulfite photo system on the removal of am and imi suggests that it would be a useful method to treat typical β blockers 4 conclusions high efficiency of the zvi activated sulfite system in degradation of organic pollutants under simulated sunlight radiation was achieved in this study oxygen is necessary for the zvi sulfite photo system and mechanical aeration rather than purging air was suggested to offer dissolved oxygen overall the increase of either initial zvi concentration 0 05 0 5 mm or initial sulfite concentration 0 05 2 0 mm accelerated the degradation of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system high removal efficiency of prp was always achieved with varying the initial prp concentration from 10 to 40 μm while higher initial prp concentration lowered the degradation rate of prp the optimal ph range of 4 0 6 0 was achieved due to the fact that hso3 which can efficiently complex fe ii and transfer fe iii to fe ii is the dominant sulfite species at ph 4 0 6 0 both bicarbonate and ha inhibited the degradation of prp while chloride ions promoted the removal of prp in the system so4 ho and so5 resulted in the oxidation of prp and so4 was the dominant reactive species in the zvi sulfite photo system possible degradation pathways of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system were accordingly proposed based on lc ms and dft calculation based on the dft calculation results four organic carbon sites and an oxygen site are vulnerable and hydroxylation reaction was proposed to be the initial reaction in the degradation of prp additionally high removal efficiency of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system after repeatedly used the zvi for 5 times evidenced the good stability of zvi none of bromate was detected during the degradation of prp in the zvi sulfite photo system when bromide was introduced into the system which might be due to the conversion of bromine containing oxidants back to bromide by sulfite the removal of am nb imi and mep in the zvi sulfite photo system was also evaluated better performance of am and imi than nb and mep suggests that the proposed zvi sulfite photo system is selective to oxidize some organic pollutants declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

worldwide profiles of antibiotic resistance genes args in river reservoir system is essential to better understand their dynamic mechanisms in aquatic eco environment in this study we investigated the

modern era have accelerated the evolution and dissemination of args ever since the use of penicillin for medical therapy in 1942 qiao et al 2018 vikesland et al 2017 almost simultaneously with the introduction of penicillin an increasing number of reservoirs have been built to benefit human society around the world over the past 70 years with more than 50 000 large dams located in river basins in the management and control of water resources lehner et al 2011 however this would increase water residence time and improve light conditions nutrient retention and sediment aggradation in the reservoir maavara et al 2017 undoubtedly these dams have disrupted original geochemical processes and ecological connectivity of traditional rivers worldwide lehner et al 2011 based on these then river reservoir system has been commonly adopted to characterize this widely distributed environmental gradient from river system to reservoir system associated with hybrid aquatic environmental properties chen et al 2017b noteworthily river system is easily impacted by anthropogenic activities including livestock and poultry breeding agricultural and municipal drainage which together release diverse chemical and biologic pollutants into river system liao et al 2018 antibiotic residues args and their bacterial hosts could pass through artificial environmental systems and are ultimately released into river system via various waste streams vikesland et al 2017 for instance recent surveys estimated a total of 24 748 tons of antibiotics and 9 47 1013 copies person day of the args loads were released into rivers and related waterways in china su et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 in contrast most of the reservoir systems are located in some relatively pristine areas with little human activities other than riverine inputs often acting as important drinking water sources compared with river system reservoir system may be less susceptible to be polluted with the antibiotics and args su et al 2014 however antibiotics can accumulate and persist in natural aquatic ecosystems in which they would continue to exert selective pressures on bacterial communities and increase the likelihood of spontaneous mutation creating resistance and horizontal gene transfer hgt among bacteria community via mobile genetic elements mges for the emergence and spread of args grenni et al 2018 as a result the river reservoir system could provide ideal settings for the physical transport acquisition and dissemination of args which are closely related to the combined effects between natural processes and anthropogenic activities lupo et al 2012 marti et al 2014 previous studies mainly focused on the occurrence and distribution of args in individual rivers reservoirs estuaries and artificial waters chen et al 2015 jiang et al 2013 su et al 2017 zhu et al 2017b however the occurrence and distribution of args in the river reservoir system were not yet well addressed even though the importance of river reservoir system has been established most importantly the dominant factors that may affect the dynamics of args in different environments are conflicting to some extent based on the summary of previous literature wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 it is notable that the current volume of studies on the identification of dominant factors affecting the args profiles is still lacking especially in the field studies taken together more comprehensive investigations about the args profiles and dominant factors affecting their profiles in river reservoir system will be of great significance for a better understanding of the args in actual aquatic environment to accomplish this goal a representative river reservoir system was chosen to uncover broader profiles of args in the south china which is also a key drinking water source for several metropolitan cities of guangzhou shenzhen and hong kong chen et al 2017b technically compared to the lower throughput conventional qpcr high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr that includes 296 primer sets covering almost all major classes of args and mges is more applicable to obtain a comprehensive result for args zhao et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 in addition bacterial community compositions and antibiotic residues were also considered in this study by combining these aspects this study aims to 1 comprehensively investigate the temporal season and spatial environmental gradient characteristics of diversity and abundance of args and mges in the river reservoir system 2 delineate the major factors e g antibiotics bacterial biomass bacteria communities and mges as well as to address the key driver in shaping the args profiles along the environmental gradient 2 materials and methods 2 1 site selection and sampling the subtropical river reservoir system n24º21 25º06 e115º00 115º47 and sampling sites covering a watershed area of 5150 km2 have been described elsewhere and showed in fig 1 chen et al 2018 chen et al 2017b briefly the river system s1 s8 situated in the anthropic zone consists of two primary tributaries beiling river with 140 km length 2363 km2 of catchment area s1 s4 and xunwu river with 138 km length 2697 km2 of catchment area s5 s8 which is receiving heavy nonpoint source pollution such as untreated wastewater discharge dispersed livestock wastewater and agricultural runoff then it finally discharges into a huge and deep reservoir reservoir fengshuba located in a relatively pristine area notably apart from pollutant inputs from the river system we hypothesize that the reservoir system s9 s13 in this natural environment was less directly contaminated due to reservoir resettlement and forestry projects in general environmental gradient in the study includes the differences in the hydrologic condition and degree of human activities between the river system and reservoir system table s1 and s2 which is also similar to other watersheds zhang et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 the surveys were performed separately in the three seasons july 2015 summer season november 2015 autumn season and march 2016 spring season table s2 respectively in the river system surface water samples 9 l were collected from 8 sampling locations s1 s8 fig s1 specifically at each site in the reservoir system s9 s13 fig s1 three water samples 3 l collected separately from the surface water 0 5 m below surface the middle water half of the depth and the bottom water about 2 4 m above bottom were combined to form a composite sample 9 l all the samples were immediately transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c before analysis chen et al 2018 2 2 chemical analysis the dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved total nitrogen dtn and total phosphorus dtp contents in the water samples were measured according to the standard methods state environmental protection administration of china 2002 based on the survey of antibiotic consumptions in china zhang et al 2015 17 specific antibiotics were selected as target compounds these included sulfonamides including sulfadiazine sdz sulfamonomethoxine smm and sulfaquinoxaline sqx fluoroquinolones including norfloxacin nor ciprofloxacin cip and ofloxacin ofc beta lactams including amoxicillin amx cefalexin clx penicillin g peng and penicillin v penv tetracyclines including oxytetracycline otc tetracycline tc and doxycycline dc and others including tylosin tyl erythromycin h2o etm h2o lincomycin lin and vancomycin van detailed descriptions of these antibiotics table s3 and corresponding analysis in the water samples were presented in si text 1 2 3 dna extraction and high throughput quantitative pcr dna was extracted from the water samples with ezna water dna kits omega usa according to the manufacturer s protocols the concentration and quality of the extracted dna were checked using agarose gel electrophoresis and microspectrophotometry nanodrop nd 2000 thermo usa then qualified dna was adjusted to 50 ng μl and stored at 80 c until molecular analysis all high throughput qpcr reactions were performed using the wafergen smartchip real time pcr system as described previously wang et al 2014 a total of 296 primer sets were quantify to the gene targets in the present study including 285 args for major classes of antibiotics nine target genes for mges eight transposase genes and one universal class i integron integrase gene cinti 1 one clinical class i integron integrase gene inti 1 and the 16s rrna gene table s4 xie et al 2016 detailed description on the pcr reaction conditions and raw data processing were conducted as previously described in other studies chen et al 2017a wang et al 2014 the gene copy number was calculated according to the follow equation gene copy number 10 31 ct 10 3 where threshold cycle ct referred to quantitative pcr result and 31 was identified as the detection limit looft et al 2012 the relative abundance of each gene was calculated by normalizing each gene s copy number to the 16s rrna s copy number zheng et al 2018 the absolute abundance absolute copy number of args were calculated by multiplying the value of relative gene copy number of args by the absolute copy number of 16s rrna gene xie et al 2016 for all samples all qpcrs were conducted in three technical replicates with negative controls 2 4 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing the v4 v5 region of 16s rrna gene was used to characterize bacterial communities chen et al 2017a each pcr reaction was carried out in 20 μl reaction mixtures and pcr amplification conditions were in accordance with previous study sun et al 2014 to minimize potential pcr bias triplicate pcr reactions were performed and purified for each sample as described above after quantifying the purified pcr products all the purified products were adjusted at the same concentration and then evenly mixed subsequently the mixtures were sequenced on miseq platform illumina usa sequencing analysis was processed using qiime toolkit for 16s rrna data sets briefly sequences were used to pick operational taxonomic units otus at a similarity of 97 using usearch method the taxonomic information was annotated with the silva database bacterial communities at the level of genus were classified into pathogenic bacteria community pbc and nonpathogenic bacteria community npbc following the previous methodology han et al 2017 all the sequence raw datasets have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive with the bioproject accession number prjna386241 2 5 data analysis the data were organized in microsoft excel 2016 and diagrams were plotted using originpro 2016 the differences of grouped data complying with the parametric assumption shapiro wilk test were analyzed with a one way anova followed by tukey s post hoc tests otherwise nonparametric data were analyzed using one way kruskal wallis anova tests followed by dunn s multiple comparison tests chen et al 2017b pearson s and spearman s correlations were performed using spss 21 0 software profiles of args mges pbc and npbc assemblages were analyzed using principal coordinates analysis pcoa and permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova 9999 permutations implemented in primer version 7 0 and canoco 4 5 all statistical tests were considered significant when the p value was below 0 05 co occurrence patterns of arg subtypes with mges relative copy number and bacterial community genus at the level of relative abundance based on spearman s analysis ρ 0 8 and p value 0 01 were explored by a network visualization using gephi platform 0 9 2 to reduce the chances of false positive results p values were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method li et al 2015 structural equation model sem was adopted to evaluate the direct or indirect effects of antibiotics basic properties mges bacterial abundances and community compositions on the args patterns the matrices of these variables were imported into amos 21 software for the sems construction based on the maximum likelihood estimation method hu et al 2016 furthermore the indirect effect of latent variables was calculated by multiplying the standardized effects of all pathways on one route from one latent variable to another and then to args while the standardized total effects on args were calculated by summing standardized indirect and direct effects eisenhauer et al 2015 hu et al 2017b 3 results 3 1 diversity of args and mges in total 251 242 args and 9 mges out of the 295 targeted genes were detected in this study two different variations including season and environmental gradient were considered to evaluate the effect on the number of detected args and mges assays along with the season variation the number of detected args in the waters did not exhibit significant difference among the summer autumn and spring one way anova f 1 10 p 0 05 at the same time the number of detected mges 8 9 genes in the waters in the spring was significantly higher than that in the summer 6 9 genes kruskal wallis kw test χ2 6 81 p 0 05 fig s2a and c however the number of detected args and mges in the waters of river system 116 213 genes and 7 9 genes were significantly higher than those in the reservoir system 87 178 genes and 6 9 genes one way anova f 12 69 p 0 01 kw test χ2 17 97 p 0 01 fig 2 a fig s2b and d moreover venn diagram analysis demonstrated that 204 args which accounted for 84 3 of the total args were shared between the river system and reservoir system fig 2b the unique subtypes in the waters of river system and reservoir system included 34 args and 4 args respectively more detailed information for the shared and unique args can be found in the bipartite network analysis fig s3 3 2 abundances of args and mges the absolute abundance of 16s rrna args and mges in the waters of river reservoir system ranged from 1 9 109 to 2 6 1011 copies l 6 6 107 to 2 1 1011 copies l and 6 7 107 to 6 7 1010 copies l respectively fig s4 a consistent phenomenon was observed that the absolute abundance of 16s rrna args and mges in the spring were significantly higher than that in the summer and autumn kw tests p 0 05 or p 0 01 fig 3 a c in contrast there was no obvious difference in the absolute abundance of 16s rrna and args between the river system and reservoir system kw tests p 0 05 whereas the absolute abundance of mges in the river system was significantly lower than that in the reservoir system kw test p 0 05 fig 3d f notably both the absolute abundance of args and mges correlated significantly with that of the 16s rrna pearson s r 0 77 p 0 01 pearson s r 0 78 p 0 01 in the river reservoir system respectively table s5 in order to avoid potential influence caused by bacterial community size we also used the relative abundance of args and mges for the further exploration fig s5 the relative abundance of args and mges did not change along the seasonal variations kw test p 0 05 fig s6a and c in contrast both the relative abundance of args and mges in the river system were significantly higher than those in the reservoir system kw tests p 0 05 or p 0 01 fig s6b and d respectively furthermore the effects of season and environmental gradient on the relative abundance of args and mges were investigated using the pcoa with one way permanova fig 4 seasonal factor had a significant effect on the distribution patterns of args permanova pseudo f 2 91 p 0 003 fig 4a while distribution patterns of mges exhibited no distinct according the seasonal factor permanova pseudo f 2 04 p 0 051 fig 4c in contrast args and mges distributions revealed significant differences between the river system and reservoir system according the environmental gradient factor permanova pseudo f 3 97 p 0 001 permanova pseudo f 5 10 p 0 002 fig 4b and d respectively further the co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes and mges in the river system and reservoir system were investigated using the network analysis which showed significant clusters within the networks the most frequently connected node in each network was defined as the hub for instance the tet 32 was the hub gene for network in the river system fig s7 while the mpha 01 was the hub gene for network in the reservoir system fig s8 additionally the network analyses also showed that many args were co occurred with mges for instance the genes encoding transposase e g tnpa 02 tnpa 07 and tnpa 05 among the mges showed the most remarkable co occurrence patterns with related genes in the river system with the corresponding degrees of 53 45 and 39 fig s7 in comparison the genes e g tnpa 05 tp614 and cinti 1 among the mges showed the most remarkable co occurrence patterns in the reservoir system with the corresponding degrees of 15 13 and 12 fig s8 3 3 correlation between antibiotic residues and args mges and inti 1 antibiotic residues in the waters of river reservoir system were analyzed and presented in details in fig s9 the total concentrations ng l of five major antibiotic classes sulfonamides fluoroquinolones beta lactams tetracyclines and others in the river system were 17 11 108 63 78 60 597 21 25 59 193 17 9 10 218 25 and 0 50 15 38 respectively for the reservoir system the corresponding values ng l were 11 61 38 74 26 80 239 55 7 61 131 79 37 77 300 72 and 0 34 3 58 in addition the concentrations of fluoroquinolones and antibiotics were positively correlated with the absolute abundance of related arg types args and mges in the river system pearson s r 0 46 0 67 p 0 05 while these correlations could not be found in the reservoir system fig 5 b nevertheless the concentration of antibiotics showed a strong correlation with the absolute abundance of inti 1 in both the river system and reservoir system p 0 01 fig 5b 3 4 characterization of bacterial community and co occurred with args subtypes mges a total of 1 536 600 high quality sequences were obtained from the water samples with 39400 sequences per sample on average which were clustered into 4348 otus at 3 dissimilarity level the main genus in the waters of river reservoir system were showed in detail in fig s10 it should be noted that the composition of bacterial community in this study mainly includes 7 relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria community pbc and 94 nonpathogenic bacteria community npbc at the genus level fig s10 according to the environmental gradient the community composition of npbc showed a distinct difference between the river system and reservoir system permanova pseudo f 12 05 p 0 0001 fig 6 a likewise the pbc also displayed a significant difference along the environmental gradient permanova pseudo f 2 58 p 0 049 fig 6b with a result that the relative abundance of total pathogenic bacteria in the river system was obviously higher than that in the reservoir system one way anova p 0 05 fig s11 the co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes mges and bacterial genera were also explored using the network analysis moreover we hypothesized that the co occurrence patterns between args and bacterial taxa could be used to provide possible host information for args if the args and coexisting bacterial taxa had a strong and significantly positive correlation spearman s correlation ρ 0 8 adjusted p 0 01 for instance dechloromonas was the possible host of aminoglycoside resistance genes e g aac 6 ii aada 1 02 and aada1 mlsb resistance genes ermb and ermf and tetracycline resistance gene tetx in the river system fig s12 likewise bacillus was the possible host of multidrug resistance gene adea tetracycline resistance gene tetd 02 and mlsb resistance gene mata mel cronobacter was also found to be the possible host of multidrug resistance gene adea and vancomycin resistance gene vanrb in the reservoir system fig s13 3 5 factors influencing the dynamics of args structural equation model sem has been commonly applied in the complex eco environmental relationships to develop causal understanding from observational data in this study the sem was useful to explore the direct indirect and total effects of antibiotics ants nutrients nuts bacterial biomass bb mges npbc and pbc on the arg patterns fig 7 in addition the nutrition composition including doc dtn and dtp in the water samples showed no distinct difference between the river system and reservoir system permanova p 0 05 table s6 generally the factors influencing the dynamics of args in terms of standardized total effect in the river system followed the order mges λ 0 450 npbc λ 0 279 pbc λ 0 210 ants λ 0 178 bb λ 0 162 nuts λ 0 103 fig 7a and c whereas the factors influencing the dynamics of args in the reservoir system followed the order mges λ 0 415 npbc λ 0 231 pbc λ 0 014 bb 0 030 nuts λ 0 030 ants 0 093 fig 7b and d strikingly it could be found that the mges and npbc positively influenced the args dynamics both in the river system and reservoir system while the other factors influencing the args dynamics between the river system and reservoir system were conflicting to some extent 4 discussion in the emerging world as more and more dams are frequently constructed the river reservoir system is the most representative form of surface water and universally exists in the modern aquatic environment not just an independent river or reservoir system however little attention is afforded toward the args contents in this system to our best knowledge this study provided the most comprehensive profiles of args in river reservoir system by using high throughput qpcr for the first time 4 1 variations of args along the season and environmental gradient the present study was performed at the watershed scale according to the variations of season and environmental gradient the detected number and relative abundance of args and mges did not changed seasonally suggesting that season factor might exert a less role in influencing their diversities and relative abundances however the absolute abundance of 16s rrna args and mges varied with the seasonal variations and their higher abundance were all in the spring fig 3a c considering the fact that rainfall in the spring rainfall 316 0 mm was far greater than summer rainfall 217 8 mm and autumn rainfall 28 5 mm table s2 these suggested that more rainfall could increase the absolute abundance of args and mges in the river reservoir system attributed to storm driven transport which probably contributed to the entry of args and mges from domestic wastewater and agricultural runoff into aquatic environment marti et al 2014 also this finding was consistent with previous studies in other catchments di cesare et al 2017 garner et al 2017 furthermore the significant correlations between the absolute abundance of 16s rrna an indicator of bacterial biomass and args mges p 0 01 table s5 indicated that bacterial biomass played an important role in impacting the absolute abundance of args and mges yang et al 2018 in other words more bacterial biomass had the opportunity to harbor more args and mges however this concept is inconsistent with a previous finding that temperature is a potential factor driving the absolute abundance of args in the zhangxi river zhejiang province china zheng et al 2018 this phenomenon may be attributed to that the differences in the characteristics of rainfall and air temperature between our river reservoir system and the zhangxi river the change trends of the rainfall and air temperature were very similar in the zhangxi river while these trends were dissimilar with the fact that the local air temperature rainfall of river reservoir system in the summer autumn and spring were 27 3 28 4 c 217 8 mm 15 6 18 0 c 28 5 mm and 14 3 16 5 c 316 0 mm respectively table s2 in view of the above when the trends of the rainfall and air temperature are coincident it is actually difficult to ascertain the role of rainfall or temperature in influencing the absolute abundance of args and mges fortunately our study provides an opportunity to overcome this problem taken together these further support the idea that seasonal runoff induced by the rainfall rather than the uncontrollable air temperature could strongly affect the entry of exogenous bacteria potentially harboring antibiotic resistomes into the aquatic environment which in turn affects the absolute abundance of args and mges as expected significant decreasing trends were observed in the detected number of args and mges according to the environmental gradient from the river system to reservoir system p 0 05 indicating that environmental gradient could markedly influence their diversities in the river reservoir system specifically the 204 shared args between the river system and reservoir system suggested riverine input might be responsible for these args for the reservoir system and these genes were relatively persistent along the environmental gradient the 34 unique args e g suli tett erma and vanc1 in the river system highlighted that these genes might be more closely related to anthropogenic release for example blapao erma suli and tett were detected frequently in wastewater treatment plants sludges manures human and pig faeces an et al 2018 li et al 2015 qian et al 2018 wei et al 2018 meanwhile the relative abundance of args and mges also decreased significantly along the environmental gradient these findings suggested reservoir system had the potential to attenuate their diversity and relative abundance in river system indeed in most developing countries river system is commonly considered as a long term polluted water environment receiving inadequate waste discharges in anthropic zone since these anthropogenic effluents derived from multiple sources contain more diverse and high relative abundance of args and mges tang et al 2016 xiong et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 on the other hand compared to the river system long hydraulic retention time with slow outflow in the reservoir system could promote the args deposition of particle associated bacteria or bacterial aggregates exported from the river system czekalski et al 2014 additionally significant differences in the distribution of args and mges were observed between the river system and reservoir system adonis test p 0 05 the hub genes for the networks among arg subtypes and mges between the two systems were also different these findings suggested that environmental gradient could obviously affect the distribution of args and mges in aquatic environment also this was similar to other studies focusing on the other environmental gradients e g river and estuary livestock wastewater and receiving river pristine environment and human impacted environment from different environmental compartments chen et al 2015 chen et al 2013 jia et al 2017 in general it was notable that values of chi square χ2 in the absolute abundance of 16s rrna args and mges according to the season factor were obviously lower than those according to the environmental gradient factor while opposite phenomenon was found for the values of chi square χ2 pseudo f f in the detected number relative abundance distribution pattern of args and mges table s7 these results suggested that season factor played more important roles in the absolute abundance of 16s rrna args and mges whereas the environmental gradient exerted more influences in the detected number relative abundance distribution pattern of args and mges in the river reservoir system based on these compared with season factor we affirmed that environmental gradient between the river system and reservoir system has been a dominant factor in differentiating the complex characteristics of args and mges among the modern aquatic environment 4 2 factors influencing the distribution of args it has been demonstrated that args can be increased by mges via the hgt to acquire resistance genes among various microorganism martínez et al 2014 in this study we also found that the absolute abundance of all args types and args showed strong correlations with mges in both river system and reservoir system pearson s r 0 54 0 95 p 0 05 or p 0 01 table s5 indicating that the widespread prevalence of mges played an important role in accelerating the proliferation of args in the aquatic environment zheng et al 2017 however obvious discrepancies between the river system and reservoir system were found when regarding the patterns of args co occurring with mges fig s7 and s8 in particular the degrees of tnpa 02 53 tnpa 07 45 and tnpa 05 39 for the co occurrence patterns in the river system were higher than those of tnpa 05 15 tp614 13 and cinti 1 12 in the reservoir system this probably suggested that the specific promotion effect of mges on args is different along the variation of environmental gradient and the effect in the river system was stronger than that of the reservoir system antibiotic residue antibiotics and its positive correlations with each type of args args and mges in the river system suggested subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotic residues might have a high probability to directly exert selective and co selective pressure for args induction and or stimulate the propagation of mges which in turn promoted the args levels via the hgt under certain conditions beaber et al 2004 levin reisman et al 2017 wang et al 2014 likewise a similar result was also observed between the most dominant antibiotics among the residues fluoroquinolones and its correlations fig 5b fig s9 generally these findings were consistent with previous studies in the water sediment and soil chen et al 2015 chen et al 2014 zhu et al 2017b in contrast the above correlations were not found in the reservoir system fig 5b suggesting that antibiotic residues here might play a less role in the spread of args and mges probably these differences along the environmental gradient could be partly attributed to the discrepancies in attenuation rates of antibiotics and args mges in aquatic environment akiyama and savin 2010 because the concentrations of antibiotic residues decreased significantly from the river system to reservoir system p 0 05 fig 5a while the absolute abundance of args or mges did not vary obviously along the environmental gradient p 0 05 in addition the strong correlations between the absolute abundance of inti 1 and concentration of antibiotics in both the river system and reservoir system suggested that antibiotic residues could permanently exert selective stress for the propagation of inti 1 and inti 1 could be considered as an alternative indicator to rapidly evaluate the level of antibiotic residues in aquatic environment previous studies had suggested inti 1 as an environmental marker of anthropogenic pollution because of its unparalleled advantages gillings et al 2015 ma et al 2017 and our finding further consolidated this previous proposal previous studies have demonstrated that bacterial community could also structure the args profiles and pathogen is more prone to acquire and propagate args than nonpathogenic bacteria forsberg et al 2014 wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 thus the community compositions of npbc and pbc were separately investigated based on the pcoa in this study fig 6 the results suggested that the environmental gradient could significantly influence their compositions although the environmental gradient in this study is mainly composed of hydrological gradient and anthropogenic contamination level this finding can still be seen as partially consistent with previous studies which supported the view that the degree of anthropogenic contamination strongly impacts aquatic microbial community structure hu et al 2017a liao et al 2018 meanwhile we found that a decreasing trend in the relative abundance of total pathogenic bacteria from river system to reservoir system fig s11 suggesting that the environmental gradient might affect the attenuation process of pathogens in aquatic environment as a result the chance of pathogenic bacteria transmitting args would be inhibited to some extent furthermore obvious discrepancies between the river system and reservoir system were also observed in the patterns of args mges co occurred with bacteria genera fig s12 and s13 these analyses indicated that the characteristics of bacteria that harbor args were different along the environmental gradient moreover the opportunistic pathogen of bacillus and cronobacter possibly harboring related args should be given more attention considering the reservoir system providing drinking water source of particular cronobacter possibly harboring vancomycin resistance gene vanrb in the drinking water reservoir was a terrible phenomenon because vancomycin is the one of the last line defense against gram positive bacteria however the cronobacter is a gram negative bacterial zhu et al 2017b bao et al 2017 and singh et al 2015 suggested that the isolated cronobacter could harbor the genes involving in vancomycin resistance pathway thus it is very necessary to study the changing characteristics of the cronobacter in the receiving aquatic environment during the drainage of reservoir meanwhile it should be noted that the network analysis is only based on mathematical statistics and inevitably has a chance to influence its robustness and reliability in predicting args hosts therefore substantial investigations need to be performed to further validate the related findings zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2017a as above mentioned several factors e g mges antibiotics npbc and pbc could influence the distribution of args further sem results in the study showed that mges contributed the most to the args in term of standardized total effect followed by npbc in both the river system and reservoir system fig 7 suggesting the args profiles in actual aquatic environment were more closely associated with their inherently molecular microbiological mechanisms blair et al 2015 which was also consistent with previous studies wu et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 probably our finding is conflicting to the preconception that antibiotics could be the dominant factor driving the arg profiles this noticeable discrepancy may be attributed to the following explanations first antibiotics are not the only selective pressure in the selection and spread of args in actual field environment martínez 2008 zhao et al 2017 thus it is easy to understand that antibiotic pollutants may exert a fraction of selection and impact in the args profiles in the aquatic environment second the concentration of antibiotics is relatively low at the level of ng l in this environment wu et al 2018 it is highly likely that the concentration of antibiotics in the actual environment is rather low and cannot dominantly govern the args profiles bengtsson palme and joakim larsson 2016 which is in accordance with previous laboratory research that some selected antibiotic concentrations maintaining crucial roles in the emergence and spread of args were often observed to be more higher than the level of ng l levin reisman et al 2017 rysz et al 2013 van den bergh et al 2016 although the most contributed factors were the same between the river system and reservoir system it should be noted that their values in terms of standardized total effects were different suggesting that specific factors affect the extent of args changed along the environmental gradient for example the standardized total effects of pbc and antibiotics on the args in the reservoir system were obviously lower than those in the river system fig 7 interestingly this phenomenon further implied that the reservoir system could act as a safety barrier to attenuate the contributions of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotics on the dissemination of args during the process of receiving and mixing the imported riverine waters overall given the fact that no obvious variations of nutrients p 0 05 and bacterial biomass p 0 05 were found along the environmental gradient our study highlights that the environmental gradient could drive the args profiles probably via influencing the mges antibiotics pathogenic bacteria community and nonpathogenic bacteria community 5 conclusion this study revealed the comprehensive profiles of args in a river reservoir system main conclusions derived from the present work are as follows seasonal runoff induced by the rainfall could strongly affect the absolute abundance of args and mges while environmental gradient between river system and reservoir system exerted more influences on the diversity relative abundance

19144,the rapid construction of reservoir in river basin generates a river reservoir system containing an environmental gradient from river system to reservoir system in modern aquatic environment worldwide profiles of antibiotic resistance genes args in river reservoir system is essential to better understand their dynamic mechanisms in aquatic eco environment in this study we investigated the diversity abundance distribution of args and mobile genetic elements mges in a representative river reservoir system using high throughput quantitative pcr as well as ranked the factors e g antibiotics bacterial biomass bacteria communities and mges influencing the patterns of args based on structural equation models sems seasonal variations in absolute abundance of args and mges exhibited similar trends with local rainfall suggesting that seasonal runoff induced by the rainfall potentially promote the absolute abundance of args and mges in contrast environmental gradient played more important roles in the detected number relative abundance distribution pattern of args and mges in the river reservoir system moreover environmental gradient also made the co occurrence patterns associated with args subtypes mges and bacteria genera in river system different from those in reservoir system the sems revealed that mges contributed the most to shape the arg profiles overall our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of environmental gradient on args dynamics in river reservoir system probably via influencing the mges antibiotics pathogenic bacteria community and nonpathogenic bacteria community graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes high throughput qpcr river reservoir system structural equation model environmental gradient 1 introduction nowadays increasing emergence and prevalence of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic resistant genes args have been recognized as a globally major health challenge of the 21st century qiao et al 2018 it should be noted that antibiotic resistance itself is a natural and ancient phenomenon d costa et al 2011 martínez 2008 however the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in modern era have accelerated the evolution and dissemination of args ever since the use of penicillin for medical therapy in 1942 qiao et al 2018 vikesland et al 2017 almost simultaneously with the introduction of penicillin an increasing number of reservoirs have been built to benefit human society around the world over the past 70 years with more than 50 000 large dams located in river basins in the management and control of water resources lehner et al 2011 however this would increase water residence time and improve light conditions nutrient retention and sediment aggradation in the reservoir maavara et al 2017 undoubtedly these dams have disrupted original geochemical processes and ecological connectivity of traditional rivers worldwide lehner et al 2011 based on these then river reservoir system has been commonly adopted to characterize this widely distributed environmental gradient from river system to reservoir system associated with hybrid aquatic environmental properties chen et al 2017b noteworthily river system is easily impacted by anthropogenic activities including livestock and poultry breeding agricultural and municipal drainage which together release diverse chemical and biologic pollutants into river system liao et al 2018 antibiotic residues args and their bacterial hosts could pass through artificial environmental systems and are ultimately released into river system via various waste streams vikesland et al 2017 for instance recent surveys estimated a total of 24 748 tons of antibiotics and 9 47 1013 copies person day of the args loads were released into rivers and related waterways in china su et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 in contrast most of the reservoir systems are located in some relatively pristine areas with little human activities other than riverine inputs often acting as important drinking water sources compared with river system reservoir system may be less susceptible to be polluted with the antibiotics and args su et al 2014 however antibiotics can accumulate and persist in natural aquatic ecosystems in which they would continue to exert selective pressures on bacterial communities and increase the likelihood of spontaneous mutation creating resistance and horizontal gene transfer hgt among bacteria community via mobile genetic elements mges for the emergence and spread of args grenni et al 2018 as a result the river reservoir system could provide ideal settings for the physical transport acquisition and dissemination of args which are closely related to the combined effects between natural processes and anthropogenic activities lupo et al 2012 marti et al 2014 previous studies mainly focused on the occurrence and distribution of args in individual rivers reservoirs estuaries and artificial waters chen et al 2015 jiang et al 2013 su et al 2017 zhu et al 2017b however the occurrence and distribution of args in the river reservoir system were not yet well addressed even though the importance of river reservoir system has been established most importantly the dominant factors that may affect the dynamics of args in different environments are conflicting to some extent based on the summary of previous literature wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 it is notable that the current volume of studies on the identification of dominant factors affecting the args profiles is still lacking especially in the field studies taken together more comprehensive investigations about the args profiles and dominant factors affecting their profiles in river reservoir system will be of great significance for a better understanding of the args in actual aquatic environment to accomplish this goal a representative river reservoir system was chosen to uncover broader profiles of args in the south china which is also a key drinking water source for several metropolitan cities of guangzhou shenzhen and hong kong chen et al 2017b technically compared to the lower throughput conventional qpcr high throughput quantitative pcr ht qpcr that includes 296 primer sets covering almost all major classes of args and mges is more applicable to obtain a comprehensive result for args zhao et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 in addition bacterial community compositions and antibiotic residues were also considered in this study by combining these aspects this study aims to 1 comprehensively investigate the temporal season and spatial environmental gradient characteristics of diversity and abundance of args and mges in the river reservoir system 2 delineate the major factors e g antibiotics bacterial biomass bacteria communities and mges as well as to address the key driver in shaping the args profiles along the environmental gradient 2 materials and methods 2 1 site selection and sampling the subtropical river reservoir system n24º21 25º06 e115º00 115º47 and sampling sites covering a watershed area of 5150 km2 have been described elsewhere and showed in fig 1 chen et al 2018 chen et al 2017b briefly the river system s1 s8 situated in the anthropic zone consists of two primary tributaries beiling river with 140 km length 2363 km2 of catchment area s1 s4 and xunwu river with 138 km length 2697 km2 of catchment area s5 s8 which is receiving heavy nonpoint source pollution such as untreated wastewater discharge dispersed livestock wastewater and agricultural runoff then it finally discharges into a huge and deep reservoir reservoir fengshuba located in a relatively pristine area notably apart from pollutant inputs from the river system we hypothesize that the reservoir system s9 s13 in this natural environment was less directly contaminated due to reservoir resettlement and forestry projects in general environmental gradient in the study includes the differences in the hydrologic condition and degree of human activities between the river system and reservoir system table s1 and s2 which is also similar to other watersheds zhang et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 the surveys were performed separately in the three seasons july 2015 summer season november 2015 autumn season and march 2016 spring season table s2 respectively in the river system surface water samples 9 l were collected from 8 sampling locations s1 s8 fig s1 specifically at each site in the reservoir system s9 s13 fig s1 three water samples 3 l collected separately from the surface water 0 5 m below surface the middle water half of the depth and the bottom water about 2 4 m above bottom were combined to form a composite sample 9 l all the samples were immediately transported to the laboratory and stored at 4 c before analysis chen et al 2018 2 2 chemical analysis the dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved total nitrogen dtn and total phosphorus dtp contents in the water samples were measured according to the standard methods state environmental protection administration of china 2002 based on the survey of antibiotic consumptions in china zhang et al 2015 17 specific antibiotics were selected as target compounds these included sulfonamides including sulfadiazine sdz sulfamonomethoxine smm and sulfaquinoxaline sqx fluoroquinolones including norfloxacin nor ciprofloxacin cip and ofloxacin ofc beta lactams including amoxicillin amx cefalexin clx penicillin g peng and penicillin v penv tetracyclines including oxytetracycline otc tetracycline tc and doxycycline dc and others including tylosin tyl erythromycin h2o etm h2o lincomycin lin and vancomycin van detailed descriptions of these antibiotics table s3 and corresponding analysis in the water samples were presented in si text 1 2 3 dna extraction and high throughput quantitative pcr dna was extracted from the water samples with ezna water dna kits omega usa according to the manufacturer s protocols the concentration and quality of the extracted dna were checked using agarose gel electrophoresis and microspectrophotometry nanodrop nd 2000 thermo usa then qualified dna was adjusted to 50 ng μl and stored at 80 c until molecular analysis all high throughput qpcr reactions were performed using the wafergen smartchip real time pcr system as described previously wang et al 2014 a total of 296 primer sets were quantify to the gene targets in the present study including 285 args for major classes of antibiotics nine target genes for mges eight transposase genes and one universal class i integron integrase gene cinti 1 one clinical class i integron integrase gene inti 1 and the 16s rrna gene table s4 xie et al 2016 detailed description on the pcr reaction conditions and raw data processing were conducted as previously described in other studies chen et al 2017a wang et al 2014 the gene copy number was calculated according to the follow equation gene copy number 10 31 ct 10 3 where threshold cycle ct referred to quantitative pcr result and 31 was identified as the detection limit looft et al 2012 the relative abundance of each gene was calculated by normalizing each gene s copy number to the 16s rrna s copy number zheng et al 2018 the absolute abundance absolute copy number of args were calculated by multiplying the value of relative gene copy number of args by the absolute copy number of 16s rrna gene xie et al 2016 for all samples all qpcrs were conducted in three technical replicates with negative controls 2 4 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing the v4 v5 region of 16s rrna gene was used to characterize bacterial communities chen et al 2017a each pcr reaction was carried out in 20 μl reaction mixtures and pcr amplification conditions were in accordance with previous study sun et al 2014 to minimize potential pcr bias triplicate pcr reactions were performed and purified for each sample as described above after quantifying the purified pcr products all the purified products were adjusted at the same concentration and then evenly mixed subsequently the mixtures were sequenced on miseq platform illumina usa sequencing analysis was processed using qiime toolkit for 16s rrna data sets briefly sequences were used to pick operational taxonomic units otus at a similarity of 97 using usearch method the taxonomic information was annotated with the silva database bacterial communities at the level of genus were classified into pathogenic bacteria community pbc and nonpathogenic bacteria community npbc following the previous methodology han et al 2017 all the sequence raw datasets have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive with the bioproject accession number prjna386241 2 5 data analysis the data were organized in microsoft excel 2016 and diagrams were plotted using originpro 2016 the differences of grouped data complying with the parametric assumption shapiro wilk test were analyzed with a one way anova followed by tukey s post hoc tests otherwise nonparametric data were analyzed using one way kruskal wallis anova tests followed by dunn s multiple comparison tests chen et al 2017b pearson s and spearman s correlations were performed using spss 21 0 software profiles of args mges pbc and npbc assemblages were analyzed using principal coordinates analysis pcoa and permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova 9999 permutations implemented in primer version 7 0 and canoco 4 5 all statistical tests were considered significant when the p value was below 0 05 co occurrence patterns of arg subtypes with mges relative copy number and bacterial community genus at the level of relative abundance based on spearman s analysis ρ 0 8 and p value 0 01 were explored by a network visualization using gephi platform 0 9 2 to reduce the chances of false positive results p values were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method li et al 2015 structural equation model sem was adopted to evaluate the direct or indirect effects of antibiotics basic properties mges bacterial abundances and community compositions on the args patterns the matrices of these variables were imported into amos 21 software for the sems construction based on the maximum likelihood estimation method hu et al 2016 furthermore the indirect effect of latent variables was calculated by multiplying the standardized effects of all pathways on one route from one latent variable to another and then to args while the standardized total effects on args were calculated by summing standardized indirect and direct effects eisenhauer et al 2015 hu et al 2017b 3 results 3 1 diversity of args and mges in total 251 242 args and 9 mges out of the 295 targeted genes were detected in this study two different variations including season and environmental gradient were considered to evaluate the effect on the number of detected args and mges assays along with the season variation the number of detected args in the waters did not exhibit significant difference among the summer autumn and spring one way anova f 1 10 p 0 05 at the same time the number of detected mges 8 9 genes in the waters in the spring was significantly higher than that in the summer 6 9 genes kruskal wallis kw test χ2 6 81 p 0 05 fig s2a and c however the number of detected args and mges in the waters of river system 116 213 genes and 7 9 genes were significantly higher than those in the reservoir system 87 178 genes and 6 9 genes one way anova f 12 69 p 0 01 kw test χ2 17 97 p 0 01 fig 2 a fig s2b and d moreover venn diagram analysis demonstrated that 204 args which accounted for 84 3 of the total args were shared between the river system and reservoir system fig 2b the unique subtypes in the waters of river system and reservoir system included 34 args and 4 args respectively more detailed information for the shared and unique args can be found in the bipartite network analysis fig s3 3 2 abundances of args and mges the absolute abundance of 16s rrna args and mges in the waters of river reservoir system ranged from 1 9 109 to 2 6 1011 copies l 6 6 107 to 2 1 1011 copies l and 6 7 107 to 6 7 1010 copies l respectively fig s4 a consistent phenomenon was observed that the absolute abundance of 16s rrna args and mges in the spring were significantly higher than that in the summer and autumn kw tests p 0 05 or p 0 01 fig 3 a c in contrast there was no obvious difference in the absolute abundance of 16s rrna and args between the river system and reservoir system kw tests p 0 05 whereas the absolute abundance of mges in the river system was significantly lower than that in the reservoir system kw test p 0 05 fig 3d f notably both the absolute abundance of args and mges correlated significantly with that of the 16s rrna pearson s r 0 77 p 0 01 pearson s r 0 78 p 0 01 in the river reservoir system respectively table s5 in order to avoid potential influence caused by bacterial community size we also used the relative abundance of args and mges for the further exploration fig s5 the relative abundance of args and mges did not change along the seasonal variations kw test p 0 05 fig s6a and c in contrast both the relative abundance of args and mges in the river system were significantly higher than those in the reservoir system kw tests p 0 05 or p 0 01 fig s6b and d respectively furthermore the effects of season and environmental gradient on the relative abundance of args and mges were investigated using the pcoa with one way permanova fig 4 seasonal factor had a significant effect on the distribution patterns of args permanova pseudo f 2 91 p 0 003 fig 4a while distribution patterns of mges exhibited no distinct according the seasonal factor permanova pseudo f 2 04 p 0 051 fig 4c in contrast args and mges distributions revealed significant differences between the river system and reservoir system according the environmental gradient factor permanova pseudo f 3 97 p 0 001 permanova pseudo f 5 10 p 0 002 fig 4b and d respectively further the co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes and mges in the river system and reservoir system were investigated using the network analysis which showed significant clusters within the networks the most frequently connected node in each network was defined as the hub for instance the tet 32 was the hub gene for network in the river system fig s7 while the mpha 01 was the hub gene for network in the reservoir system fig s8 additionally the network analyses also showed that many args were co occurred with mges for instance the genes encoding transposase e g tnpa 02 tnpa 07 and tnpa 05 among the mges showed the most remarkable co occurrence patterns with related genes in the river system with the corresponding degrees of 53 45 and 39 fig s7 in comparison the genes e g tnpa 05 tp614 and cinti 1 among the mges showed the most remarkable co occurrence patterns in the reservoir system with the corresponding degrees of 15 13 and 12 fig s8 3 3 correlation between antibiotic residues and args mges and inti 1 antibiotic residues in the waters of river reservoir system were analyzed and presented in details in fig s9 the total concentrations ng l of five major antibiotic classes sulfonamides fluoroquinolones beta lactams tetracyclines and others in the river system were 17 11 108 63 78 60 597 21 25 59 193 17 9 10 218 25 and 0 50 15 38 respectively for the reservoir system the corresponding values ng l were 11 61 38 74 26 80 239 55 7 61 131 79 37 77 300 72 and 0 34 3 58 in addition the concentrations of fluoroquinolones and antibiotics were positively correlated with the absolute abundance of related arg types args and mges in the river system pearson s r 0 46 0 67 p 0 05 while these correlations could not be found in the reservoir system fig 5 b nevertheless the concentration of antibiotics showed a strong correlation with the absolute abundance of inti 1 in both the river system and reservoir system p 0 01 fig 5b 3 4 characterization of bacterial community and co occurred with args subtypes mges a total of 1 536 600 high quality sequences were obtained from the water samples with 39400 sequences per sample on average which were clustered into 4348 otus at 3 dissimilarity level the main genus in the waters of river reservoir system were showed in detail in fig s10 it should be noted that the composition of bacterial community in this study mainly includes 7 relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria community pbc and 94 nonpathogenic bacteria community npbc at the genus level fig s10 according to the environmental gradient the community composition of npbc showed a distinct difference between the river system and reservoir system permanova pseudo f 12 05 p 0 0001 fig 6 a likewise the pbc also displayed a significant difference along the environmental gradient permanova pseudo f 2 58 p 0 049 fig 6b with a result that the relative abundance of total pathogenic bacteria in the river system was obviously higher than that in the reservoir system one way anova p 0 05 fig s11 the co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes mges and bacterial genera were also explored using the network analysis moreover we hypothesized that the co occurrence patterns between args and bacterial taxa could be used to provide possible host information for args if the args and coexisting bacterial taxa had a strong and significantly positive correlation spearman s correlation ρ 0 8 adjusted p 0 01 for instance dechloromonas was the possible host of aminoglycoside resistance genes e g aac 6 ii aada 1 02 and aada1 mlsb resistance genes ermb and ermf and tetracycline resistance gene tetx in the river system fig s12 likewise bacillus was the possible host of multidrug resistance gene adea tetracycline resistance gene tetd 02 and mlsb resistance gene mata mel cronobacter was also found to be the possible host of multidrug resistance gene adea and vancomycin resistance gene vanrb in the reservoir system fig s13 3 5 factors influencing the dynamics of args structural equation model sem has been commonly applied in the complex eco environmental relationships to develop causal understanding from observational data in this study the sem was useful to explore the direct indirect and total effects of antibiotics ants nutrients nuts bacterial biomass bb mges npbc and pbc on the arg patterns fig 7 in addition the nutrition composition including doc dtn and dtp in the water samples showed no distinct difference between the river system and reservoir system permanova p 0 05 table s6 generally the factors influencing the dynamics of args in terms of standardized total effect in the river system followed the order mges λ 0 450 npbc λ 0 279 pbc λ 0 210 ants λ 0 178 bb λ 0 162 nuts λ 0 103 fig 7a and c whereas the factors influencing the dynamics of args in the reservoir system followed the order mges λ 0 415 npbc λ 0 231 pbc λ 0 014 bb 0 030 nuts λ 0 030 ants 0 093 fig 7b and d strikingly it could be found that the mges and npbc positively influenced the args dynamics both in the river system and reservoir system while the other factors influencing the args dynamics between the river system and reservoir system were conflicting to some extent 4 discussion in the emerging world as more and more dams are frequently constructed the river reservoir system is the most representative form of surface water and universally exists in the modern aquatic environment not just an independent river or reservoir system however little attention is afforded toward the args contents in this system to our best knowledge this study provided the most comprehensive profiles of args in river reservoir system by using high throughput qpcr for the first time 4 1 variations of args along the season and environmental gradient the present study was performed at the watershed scale according to the variations of season and environmental gradient the detected number and relative abundance of args and mges did not changed seasonally suggesting that season factor might exert a less role in influencing their diversities and relative abundances however the absolute abundance of 16s rrna args and mges varied with the seasonal variations and their higher abundance were all in the spring fig 3a c considering the fact that rainfall in the spring rainfall 316 0 mm was far greater than summer rainfall 217 8 mm and autumn rainfall 28 5 mm table s2 these suggested that more rainfall could increase the absolute abundance of args and mges in the river reservoir system attributed to storm driven transport which probably contributed to the entry of args and mges from domestic wastewater and agricultural runoff into aquatic environment marti et al 2014 also this finding was consistent with previous studies in other catchments di cesare et al 2017 garner et al 2017 furthermore the significant correlations between the absolute abundance of 16s rrna an indicator of bacterial biomass and args mges p 0 01 table s5 indicated that bacterial biomass played an important role in impacting the absolute abundance of args and mges yang et al 2018 in other words more bacterial biomass had the opportunity to harbor more args and mges however this concept is inconsistent with a previous finding that temperature is a potential factor driving the absolute abundance of args in the zhangxi river zhejiang province china zheng et al 2018 this phenomenon may be attributed to that the differences in the characteristics of rainfall and air temperature between our river reservoir system and the zhangxi river the change trends of the rainfall and air temperature were very similar in the zhangxi river while these trends were dissimilar with the fact that the local air temperature rainfall of river reservoir system in the summer autumn and spring were 27 3 28 4 c 217 8 mm 15 6 18 0 c 28 5 mm and 14 3 16 5 c 316 0 mm respectively table s2 in view of the above when the trends of the rainfall and air temperature are coincident it is actually difficult to ascertain the role of rainfall or temperature in influencing the absolute abundance of args and mges fortunately our study provides an opportunity to overcome this problem taken together these further support the idea that seasonal runoff induced by the rainfall rather than the uncontrollable air temperature could strongly affect the entry of exogenous bacteria potentially harboring antibiotic resistomes into the aquatic environment which in turn affects the absolute abundance of args and mges as expected significant decreasing trends were observed in the detected number of args and mges according to the environmental gradient from the river system to reservoir system p 0 05 indicating that environmental gradient could markedly influence their diversities in the river reservoir system specifically the 204 shared args between the river system and reservoir system suggested riverine input might be responsible for these args for the reservoir system and these genes were relatively persistent along the environmental gradient the 34 unique args e g suli tett erma and vanc1 in the river system highlighted that these genes might be more closely related to anthropogenic release for example blapao erma suli and tett were detected frequently in wastewater treatment plants sludges manures human and pig faeces an et al 2018 li et al 2015 qian et al 2018 wei et al 2018 meanwhile the relative abundance of args and mges also decreased significantly along the environmental gradient these findings suggested reservoir system had the potential to attenuate their diversity and relative abundance in river system indeed in most developing countries river system is commonly considered as a long term polluted water environment receiving inadequate waste discharges in anthropic zone since these anthropogenic effluents derived from multiple sources contain more diverse and high relative abundance of args and mges tang et al 2016 xiong et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 on the other hand compared to the river system long hydraulic retention time with slow outflow in the reservoir system could promote the args deposition of particle associated bacteria or bacterial aggregates exported from the river system czekalski et al 2014 additionally significant differences in the distribution of args and mges were observed between the river system and reservoir system adonis test p 0 05 the hub genes for the networks among arg subtypes and mges between the two systems were also different these findings suggested that environmental gradient could obviously affect the distribution of args and mges in aquatic environment also this was similar to other studies focusing on the other environmental gradients e g river and estuary livestock wastewater and receiving river pristine environment and human impacted environment from different environmental compartments chen et al 2015 chen et al 2013 jia et al 2017 in general it was notable that values of chi square χ2 in the absolute abundance of 16s rrna args and mges according to the season factor were obviously lower than those according to the environmental gradient factor while opposite phenomenon was found for the values of chi square χ2 pseudo f f in the detected number relative abundance distribution pattern of args and mges table s7 these results suggested that season factor played more important roles in the absolute abundance of 16s rrna args and mges whereas the environmental gradient exerted more influences in the detected number relative abundance distribution pattern of args and mges in the river reservoir system based on these compared with season factor we affirmed that environmental gradient between the river system and reservoir system has been a dominant factor in differentiating the complex characteristics of args and mges among the modern aquatic environment 4 2 factors influencing the distribution of args it has been demonstrated that args can be increased by mges via the hgt to acquire resistance genes among various microorganism martínez et al 2014 in this study we also found that the absolute abundance of all args types and args showed strong correlations with mges in both river system and reservoir system pearson s r 0 54 0 95 p 0 05 or p 0 01 table s5 indicating that the widespread prevalence of mges played an important role in accelerating the proliferation of args in the aquatic environment zheng et al 2017 however obvious discrepancies between the river system and reservoir system were found when regarding the patterns of args co occurring with mges fig s7 and s8 in particular the degrees of tnpa 02 53 tnpa 07 45 and tnpa 05 39 for the co occurrence patterns in the river system were higher than those of tnpa 05 15 tp614 13 and cinti 1 12 in the reservoir system this probably suggested that the specific promotion effect of mges on args is different along the variation of environmental gradient and the effect in the river system was stronger than that of the reservoir system antibiotic residue antibiotics and its positive correlations with each type of args args and mges in the river system suggested subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotic residues might have a high probability to directly exert selective and co selective pressure for args induction and or stimulate the propagation of mges which in turn promoted the args levels via the hgt under certain conditions beaber et al 2004 levin reisman et al 2017 wang et al 2014 likewise a similar result was also observed between the most dominant antibiotics among the residues fluoroquinolones and its correlations fig 5b fig s9 generally these findings were consistent with previous studies in the water sediment and soil chen et al 2015 chen et al 2014 zhu et al 2017b in contrast the above correlations were not found in the reservoir system fig 5b suggesting that antibiotic residues here might play a less role in the spread of args and mges probably these differences along the environmental gradient could be partly attributed to the discrepancies in attenuation rates of antibiotics and args mges in aquatic environment akiyama and savin 2010 because the concentrations of antibiotic residues decreased significantly from the river system to reservoir system p 0 05 fig 5a while the absolute abundance of args or mges did not vary obviously along the environmental gradient p 0 05 in addition the strong correlations between the absolute abundance of inti 1 and concentration of antibiotics in both the river system and reservoir system suggested that antibiotic residues could permanently exert selective stress for the propagation of inti 1 and inti 1 could be considered as an alternative indicator to rapidly evaluate the level of antibiotic residues in aquatic environment previous studies had suggested inti 1 as an environmental marker of anthropogenic pollution because of its unparalleled advantages gillings et al 2015 ma et al 2017 and our finding further consolidated this previous proposal previous studies have demonstrated that bacterial community could also structure the args profiles and pathogen is more prone to acquire and propagate args than nonpathogenic bacteria forsberg et al 2014 wu et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 thus the community compositions of npbc and pbc were separately investigated based on the pcoa in this study fig 6 the results suggested that the environmental gradient could significantly influence their compositions although the environmental gradient in this study is mainly composed of hydrological gradient and anthropogenic contamination level this finding can still be seen as partially consistent with previous studies which supported the view that the degree of anthropogenic contamination strongly impacts aquatic microbial community structure hu et al 2017a liao et al 2018 meanwhile we found that a decreasing trend in the relative abundance of total pathogenic bacteria from river system to reservoir system fig s11 suggesting that the environmental gradient might affect the attenuation process of pathogens in aquatic environment as a result the chance of pathogenic bacteria transmitting args would be inhibited to some extent furthermore obvious discrepancies between the river system and reservoir system were also observed in the patterns of args mges co occurred with bacteria genera fig s12 and s13 these analyses indicated that the characteristics of bacteria that harbor args were different along the environmental gradient moreover the opportunistic pathogen of bacillus and cronobacter possibly harboring related args should be given more attention considering the reservoir system providing drinking water source of particular cronobacter possibly harboring vancomycin resistance gene vanrb in the drinking water reservoir was a terrible phenomenon because vancomycin is the one of the last line defense against gram positive bacteria however the cronobacter is a gram negative bacterial zhu et al 2017b bao et al 2017 and singh et al 2015 suggested that the isolated cronobacter could harbor the genes involving in vancomycin resistance pathway thus it is very necessary to study the changing characteristics of the cronobacter in the receiving aquatic environment during the drainage of reservoir meanwhile it should be noted that the network analysis is only based on mathematical statistics and inevitably has a chance to influence its robustness and reliability in predicting args hosts therefore substantial investigations need to be performed to further validate the related findings zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2017a as above mentioned several factors e g mges antibiotics npbc and pbc could influence the distribution of args further sem results in the study showed that mges contributed the most to the args in term of standardized total effect followed by npbc in both the river system and reservoir system fig 7 suggesting the args profiles in actual aquatic environment were more closely associated with their inherently molecular microbiological mechanisms blair et al 2015 which was also consistent with previous studies wu et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 probably our finding is conflicting to the preconception that antibiotics could be the dominant factor driving the arg profiles this noticeable discrepancy may be attributed to the following explanations first antibiotics are not the only selective pressure in the selection and spread of args in actual field environment martínez 2008 zhao et al 2017 thus it is easy to understand that antibiotic pollutants may exert a fraction of selection and impact in the args profiles in the aquatic environment second the concentration of antibiotics is relatively low at the level of ng l in this environment wu et al 2018 it is highly likely that the concentration of antibiotics in the actual environment is rather low and cannot dominantly govern the args profiles bengtsson palme and joakim larsson 2016 which is in accordance with previous laboratory research that some selected antibiotic concentrations maintaining crucial roles in the emergence and spread of args were often observed to be more higher than the level of ng l levin reisman et al 2017 rysz et al 2013 van den bergh et al 2016 although the most contributed factors were the same between the river system and reservoir system it should be noted that their values in terms of standardized total effects were different suggesting that specific factors affect the extent of args changed along the environmental gradient for example the standardized total effects of pbc and antibiotics on the args in the reservoir system were obviously lower than those in the river system fig 7 interestingly this phenomenon further implied that the reservoir system could act as a safety barrier to attenuate the contributions of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotics on the dissemination of args during the process of receiving and mixing the imported riverine waters overall given the fact that no obvious variations of nutrients p 0 05 and bacterial biomass p 0 05 were found along the environmental gradient our study highlights that the environmental gradient could drive the args profiles probably via influencing the mges antibiotics pathogenic bacteria community and nonpathogenic bacteria community 5 conclusion this study revealed the comprehensive profiles of args in a river reservoir system main conclusions derived from the present work are as follows seasonal runoff induced by the rainfall could strongly affect the absolute abundance of args and mges while environmental gradient between river system and reservoir system exerted more influences on the diversity relative abundance distribution of args and mges environmental gradient could obviously influence the distribution of pathogenic bacteria community and nonpathogenic bacteria community as well as the co occurred patterns among the args subtypes mges structural equation models indicated that mges contributed the most to shape the args profiles in river reservoir system environmental gradient drove the args profiles in river reservoir system probably via influencing the mges antibiotics pathogenic bacteria community and nonpathogenic bacteria community conflicts of interest the authors declare no
